The action was brought by the appellants, the; holders of a note made by the defendants, respondents, in favour of a firm of horse-dealers, of Columbus, Ohio, doing business there under the name and style of McLaughlin Bros., for part of the price of a stallion sold to the defendants by an agent named Hitchcock, and indorsed by the payees to the plaintiffs. The note was dated 5th March, 1903, and made payable on 1st March, 1905, with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, such interest being payable annually. At the time of the transfer of the note to the plaintiffs, a short time before the principal would become due, there was an instalment of the interest past due and unpaid, but there was no evidence that the note had been presented for payment of such interest when it fell due at the end of the first year after the date of the note. The defendants, by their pleadings, contended that Hitchcock had obtained the note by fraud, that the stallion was not sound and fit according to warranty and that the plaintiffs took the note, at the time of the indorsement, with knowledge of the fact that it had become dishonoured by default in payment of the overdue instalment of interest and subject to equities.\nThe appeal was brought direct to the Supreme Court of Canada, from the decision of the trial judge, by consent of the parties, and the questions at issue thereon are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants.\nHudson for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The substantial question which this appeal presents for decision is whether or not the promissory note upon which the action was brought was, at the time it was transferred to the appellants, who were the plaintiffs in the action, an overdue note within the meaning of sections 56 and 70 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act.\"\nThe note in question was dated the 5th March, 1903, and by it the respondents, who were the defendants in the action, promised to pay to McLaughlin Bros., or order, at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Gilbert Plains, Man., on the 1st March, 1905, the sum of $875.00 with interest annually at 6%. After the first of the periodical payments of interest, thus provided for, had fallen due, the note was transferred to the appellants. There is no evidence that it was presented for the payment of this sum, which in fact was never paid.\nThe learned trial judge held that the respondent's signature to the instrument was obtained through the fraud of the payee, and I see no sufficient reason to disturb this finding. I think, however, that the plaintiffs, who acquired the note for value in the usual course of business, have satisfied the onus upon them to shew that in taking it they acted in good faith.\nMoreover, there was no evidence that the plaintiffs had any knowledge of the fact that the interest had not been paid, and assuming that the note had been dishonoured within the meaning of section 72 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" (which even admitting that default in the payment of interest alone would constitute such dishonour does not on the evidence appear since there is nothing to shew that the note, which as we have seen was payable at a particular place, was ever presented there or at all, for the payment of interest), the appellants, therefore, could not be said, in acquiring it, to have taken a dishonoured note with notice of its character. It follows that, subject to the answer to be given to the question I have stated, the title of the appellants as that of holders in due course is not affected by the fraud of their transferor.\nTo come then to the question whether this note, in the circumstances, was an overdue note, within the meaning of the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" when it came into the hands of the appellants.\nThe literal truth is, of course, that a single payment of interest reserved by the note was overdue, while in respect of the principal and the remaining payment of interest the note was not overdue. And the question is which of these circumstances is to determine the category into which the instrument falls\u2014that of instruments which are \"overdue\" within the meaning of the Act or that of current instruments?\nThe Act itself furnishes no express definition of term \"overdue\"; but it contains expressions and even enactments not easily to be reconciled with the view that the circumstance alone of a payment of interest being in default is a sufficient ground for referring the instrument by which it is payable to the class comprised within that description. Section 23 (2) enacts that\nwhere a bill is accepted or indorsed when it is overdue it shall as regards the acceptor who so accepts or any indorser who so indorses it, he deemed a bill payable on demand.\nThe legislature could not have intended that after default in respect of a single payment of interest and before the maturity of the principal payable under it the indorsement of a bill should have the effect as regards the principal or as regards interest not yet payable of changing the character of the bill into that of a bill payable on demand. Section 142 also leads to singular results upon the respondents' reading of the words in question. But regarding the question as one of statutory construction merely the most formidable obstacle in the respondents' way appears to be the language of sections 70 and 71\u2014the sections in which the legislature has expressly defined the legal characteristics of \"overdue\" bills and notes. In these sections the term \"overdue\" seems to be used as convertible with \"after maturity.\" Now it is true that as the legislature has not expressly defined the meaning of the term \"overdue\" so neither has it defined the equivalent expression; but construing the words in the ordinary sense I do not think the phrase \"after maturity\" is applicable to the state of the note in question here. In the ordinary sense of the words a mercantile document providing for the payment of principal and interest in respect of which the time for the payment of the principal should not have arrived would not be said to be \"at maturity.\" And I do not think there is any special mercantile sense of the words\u2014known at all events to the law\u2014in which that description would fit such a state of such an instrument. See United States v. Pacific Ry. Co.[1]. As a question of statutory interpretation then, if one were obliged to determine the question upon the words of the Act alone I should have a great difficulty in adopting the view advanced by the respondents. But I do not think the question is one of statutory construction only. Section 10 provides that:\nThe rules of the common law of England including the law merchant save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act shall apply to (bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques. The express provisions of the Act do not in my judgment afford a clear guide upon the question; and it is I think one of the questions for the determination of which this section directs us to have recourse to the common law of England.\nThe learned trial judge following what he considered to be the decision of the full court of Manitoba in Moore v. Scott[2] has held that the circumstance that default had been made in respect of a payment of interest at the time the note was acquired by the appellants was sufficient to bring it within the class of \"overdue\" instruments. It is conceded that\u2014if we except the decision referred to, which it will be necessary to notice particularly later\u2014there is no English decision and no Canadian decision of a superior court which is directly in point. One must consequently reach one's conclusion through an examination of the principles of the common law applicable to circumstances of the case, and it is, I think, very necessary that from the outset we should keep in mind some of the most elementary of those principles.\nThe characteristics which the law recognizes as marking negotiable instruments are, first, such instruments when payable to bearer or indorsed in blank are transferable from hand to hand so that the right to maintain an action upon the instrument passes by delivery of the instrument only, and secondly, a person taking such an instrument in good faith and for value acquires a title to it and that which it represents as against the whole world. (See, e.g., London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons [3], per Lord Halsbury at page 207 citing Bowen L.J.[4], and per Lord Herschell, at page 221 and in Bechuanaland Exploration Go. v. London Trading Bank[5], at page 666, per Kennedy J.; Foster v. Pearson[6], at page 855, per Parke B.)\nThese attributes the courts have always recognized as indispensable, to instruments forming part of the commercial currency. \"The true reason\" (why money cannot be followed), said Lord Mansfield in Miller v. Race[7],\nis on account of the currency of it; it cannot- be recovered after it has passed into currency; * * * the true owner cannot recover it after it has been paid away on a bona fide and valuable consideration.\nTherefore because bank notes\nare treated as money, as cash, in the ordinary course and transaction of business, by the general consent of mankind which gives them the credit and currency of money to all intents and purposes,\nhe held it to be necessary\nfor the purposes of commerce that their currency should be established and secured\nand that the owner from whom they had been stolen could not follow bank notes into the hands of a bona fide holder for value. So in Wookey v.Pole[8], it was held that Exchequer bills in which the blank for the name of the payee was not filled up were subject to the same rule. In the course of an elaborate judgment Holroyd J. emphasizing the distinction between money and securities representing money and other forms of property, said, at page 9:\nIn Peacock v. Rhodes[9], Lord Mansfield says, \"The holder of a bill of exchange or promissory note is not to be considered in the light of an assignee of the payee. An assignee must take the thing assigned subject to all the equity to which the original party was subject. If this rule applies to bills and promissory notes it would stop their currency.\" * * * * These authorities shew that not only money itself may. pass and the right to it may, arise by currency alone but further that these mercantile instruments which entitle the bearer of them to money may also pass, and the right to them may arise in the like manner by currency or delivery. These decisions proceed upon the nature of the property (viz. money) to which such instruments give the right and which is itself current; and give to the holders merely as such the right to receive the money or specify them as the person entitled to recover it.\nNow the rule governing \"overdue\" instruments, namely, that such an instrument\ncan be negotiated subject only to any defect of title affecting it at its maturity and thenceforward no person who takes it can acquire or give a better title than that which had the person from whom he took it (sec. 10),\n\u2014though seemingly an exception to the rule governing currency of negotiable instruments, grew naturally out of the application to overdue instruments of the, custom of merchants upon which the rules of the law merchant relating to negotiable instruments were originally based\u2014rules which, to quote the language of Cockburn C.J. in Goodwin v. Robarts[10],\nare neither more nor less than the usages of merchants * * * * ratified by the decisions of courts of law, which upon such usages being proved before them have adopted them as settled law with a view to the interests of trade and public convenience.\nThe rule in question was originally a rule of evidence only. See Taylor v. Mather[11], and the argument of Erskine in Boehm v. Sterling[12] in 1797, at page 427, The first reported case in which it was enunciated as a rule of law was Brown v. Davies[13], decided shortly after the retirement of Lord Mansfield. The grounds of that decision are thus stated in the judgment of Buller J. at pages 82 and 83:\nThere is this distinction between bills indorsed before and after they become due. If \u00e0 note indorsed be not due at the time it carries no suspicion whatever on the face of it, and the party receives it on its own intrinsic credit but if it is overdue, though I do not say that by law it is not negotiable yet certainly it is out of the common course of dealing, and does give rise to suspicion. Still stronger ought that suspicion to be when it appears on the face of the note to have been noted for non-payment; which was the case here. But generally when a note is due, the party receiving it takes it on the credit of the person who gives it to him. Upon this ground it was that, in the case in Cornwall, I held that the defendant, who was the maker, was entitled to set up the same defence . that he might have done against the original payee; and the same doctrine has often been ruled at Guildhall. A fair indorsee can never be injured by this rule; for if the transaction be a fair one, he will be still entitled to recover. But it may be a useful rule to detect fraud whenever that has been practised (upon Lord Kenyon's appearing to dissent from the generality of the doctrine held by Mr. Justice Buller, he proceeded to observe) my Lord thinks I have gone rather too far in something that I have said, but it is to be observed that I am speaking of cases where the note has been indorsed before it became due, when I consider it as a note newly drawn by the person indorsing it.\nAnd in the very latest judicial statement of it which has come under my notice the rule is put upon the precise grounds upon which it was rested by Buller J. in 1789.\nIn London and County Banking Co, v. Groome[14] in 1881, at page 292, Lord Field (then Field J.) said:\nThat the holder of an overdue bill or note payable at a fixed date (appearing of course upon it) is in the position suggested is established beyond all doubt; and the reason of the rule is that inasmuch as these instruments are usually current only during the period before they become payable, and their negotiation after that period is out of the usual and ordinary course of dealing, that circumstance is sufficient of itself to excite so much suspicion that, as a rule of law, the indorsee must take it on the credit of and can stand in no better position than the indorser: Brown v. Davies[15].\nThat, I think, with great respect, is an entirely accurate statement of the grounds upon which the rule is based.\nIs this case then within the principle of this rule?\nIt will not do to say that the rule applies to all bills and notes which in any sense of the word may be described as \"overdue.\" We must test each case by the answer to the question whether the instrument is such an instrument as the principle of the rule applies to and whether it is \"overdue\" in the sense in which the term is used in the decisions upon which the rule is founded. A case which is not within the principle of a decision is not governed by it, and we certainly have no authority by extending the principle of the decisions, to impose fresh restrictions upon the currency of negotiable instruments. The rule is based on. the fact that by the custom of merchants certain instruments do not after maturity pass as mercantile currency; and, in form, it is put as expressing a conclusive presumption that a person taking such an instrument after maturity takes it with a suspicion concerning the title of the person from whom he receives it; and, consequently, cannot, of course, claim the rights of a bona fide holder. That is only bringing the law relating to such instruments into conformity with the mercantile usage upon which the negotiability of them originally rested. But such a principle obviously fails of application to instruments which are of such a character and in such a state that, in respect of them, no such presumption can generally arise; and, that, in respect of them also, it could not be generally affirmed that the negotiation of them as a part of the currency of the country is outside the usual course of dealing.\nFirst, then, is there, in the case of the negotiation of such instruments as those in question here, after default in the payment of interest and before maturity of the principal, any ground upon which such a presumption can, in the absence of any notice of such a default, be based?\nThe instruments which were the subjects of the observations in the cases referred to are there said to carry suspicion on the face of them because a bill which on the face of it is overdue and consequently ought not to be in circulation comes to an intended taker tainted with suspicion. But a bill not on its face overdue carries no suspicion because intending indorsees cannot from the face of the bill alone know that it ought not to be in circulation. This is the substance of the observation of Parke B., at page 165, in Cripps v. Davis[16]:\nThe reason why the party who takes an overdue bill or note takes it with all its equities, is because, on the face of it, it carries suspicion; that does not apply to the case of a bill or note payable on demand.\nNow it is not argued here that the fact of the time fixed for the payment of interest being passed when the note was negotiated was in itself a circumstance of suspicion within this principle; that would lead to a conclusion which nobody accepts, viz.: that whether the interest be in default or not in default the moment the date fixed for such payment is past the instrument is overdue within the rule. What then is the circumstance of suspicion? The failure to meet the obligation to pay? But that does not appear on the face of the instrument. And obviously the failure to pay the interest can be regarded as such a circumstance only on the hypothesis that the law imposes upon the person taking such an instrument after the time for such a payment is passed, the duty to inquire whether the payment has been made; and not only that, but to ascertain at his peril whether it has been made. I own it seems to one to be abundantly clear that an instrument the negotiation of which is regulated by such a rule of law is not in the full sense of the term a negotiable instrument\u2014that is to say, it is not negotiable as the commercial currency of the country is generally; and in particular, it is not negotiable as bills of exchange and promissory notes before maturity are negotiable. Consider the position, in this view, of an intending taker. If there has been a default he can acquire only such a title as his transferor can give him; and if (as must often happen) it should be impossible to ascertain this with certainty he would (obviously) be put upon an investigation of the title of his transferor. But it is the absence of the necessity of such an investigation which is the very thing that distinguishes current negotiable instruments from other classes of personal property; a distinction, as we have seen, the result of commercial necessity which requires that such instruments when taken in the ordinary course of business may, as regards title, be taken with absolute confidence and without any of the doubt and suspicion which must follow the adoption of the rule contended for in cases to which it applies. In London Joint Stock Go. v. Simmons[17] Lord Herschell said, at page 221:\nOne word I would say upon the question of notice and being put upon inquiry. I should be sorry to see the doctrine of constructive notice introduced into the law of negotiable instruments.\nAgain are there any satisfactory grounds upon which one can affirm that the negotiation of such instruments in such circumstances, to use the words of Buller J.,\nis out of the ordinary course of dealing and does give rise to suspicion?\nGiven the absence of notice of default on the face of the instrument I do not know on what ground that can be maintained.\nMunicipal and other debentures so framed as to be promissory notes and nothing but promissory notes bearing interest periodically do, as everybody knows, so circulate. Nor do I suppose it has ever been suggested that everybody taking such a debenture is put at his peril upon the inquiry whether there is in point of fact an instalment of interest overdue and unpaid; and still less whether there has ever been in the history of the instrument a day's default in the payment of such an instalment. And it is to be observed that this last mentioned inquiry is that which the proposed rule would impose upon an intending taker; for it could hardly be argued that' the character of such instruments \u2014 as negotiable or non-negotiable \u2014 is changed from time to time according as interest is paid or in arrear. An instrument once stamped with the character \"overdue\" must, I think, retain that character; it is obvious that any other principle would lead to unspeakable confusion. And it is hardly, I think, open to question that in the case of instruments of the character referred to, any rule imposing the burden of inquiry into the circumstances of every preceding payment of interest would in practice destroy the. Commercial currency of them. In point of fact when payable to bearer or indorsed in blank, to use the language of Malins V.C. in Re Imperial Land 00.[18], at page 487, \"They pass as freely as bank notes.\"\nIt would appear, therefore, that the application of the rule in the manner proposed cannot be justified upon the grounds upon which the rule itself is based.\nI come now to those decisions that are precisely in point; and it will be convenient first to deal with the decisions of the American courts. It is here again to be observed that we are applying the law merchant. And while it is true that we have to administer the law merchant which is a part of the law of England, and have no authority to, administer anything but the law of England, yet it is also true that, as in its broad features, the law merchant was much the same in all commercial countries, it is the practice of English judges when the point for decision is a question arising upon the law merchant and is also one upon which English authority is wanting, to have recourse to the law of other commercial countries. Examples may be found in Lord Mansfield's judgment in Luke v. Lyde[19], and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Willes in Dakin v. Oxley[20]. The weight to be attached to a rule of law of a foreign country is increased when the principles of the law there administered upon the subject in question are professedly (as the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on this subject are) a development of the law merchant, as recognized by the common law of England.\nThere are some branches of the law merchant in which the American courts have professedly departed from the common law and in such cases their decisions cannot afford us a guide; but where that is not so, unless at all events it appears to proceed upon principles at variance with the accepted principles upon which courts administering the law of England are accustomed to act, one must, of course, regard a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon a point of commercial law not covered by authority in England or Canada as no small evidence of the soundness of the conclusion at which one has one's self arrived.\nAlthough the decisions of the American courts are, of course, not binding on us yet the sound and enlightened views of American lawyers in the administration and development of the law,\u2014\nsaid Cockburn C.J. in the course of a judgment in Scaramanga & Co. v. Stamp[21], at page 303, dealing with a question of Maritime law\n\u2014a law, except so far as altered by statutory enactment, derived from a common source with our own\u2014entitle those decisions to the utmost respect and confidence on our part.\nThe doctrine which is affirmed uniformly in the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on the question before us is that a negotiable instrument reserving periodical payments of interest is not, within the rule of commercial law, regarded as over- due merely because default has been made in respect of such a payment.\nThis doctrine is thus stated in one of the latest of the cases, Morgan v. United States[22] at pages 500 and 502:\nThe title of the purchaser of overdue negotiable paper, such as a bill of exchange or a promissory note, stands on the same footing as if it. had been dishonoured by a refusal to accept or pay and had been put under protest. When transferred after it has become due, although not reduced to the rank of an ordinary chose in action, the legal title to which cannot pass by assignment or delivery, it carries on its face the presumption which discredits it and deprives it of that immunity which, while the time for payment was still running, was secured to it in favour of a bona fide purchaser for value without actual notice of any defect, either in the obligation or the title. This was put by Mr. Justice Buller in Brown v. Davies[23], on the ground that to take an overdue note or bill was \"out of the common course of dealing.\" Ordinarily a note or bill when due becomes functus officio, because it was made to be paid at maturity, and if it fails of its intended operation and effect, the presumption is that it is owing to some defect which has furnished a sufficient reason to the party apparently chargeable for not having punctually performed his obligation. In the strong language of Lord Ellenborough in Tinson v. Francis[24], \"after a bill or note is due it comes disgraced to the indorsee.\" No such presumption, in our opinion, arises to affect the title of a holder of the bonds of the United States, such as those now in question, acquired by a bona fide purchaser for value prior to the date fixed in the bonds themselves for their ultimate payment; .\n*******\nWhile it has been held that a note, the principal of which is payable by instalments, is overdue when the first instalment is overdue and unpaid and is thereby subject' to all equities between the original parties, Vinton v. King[25], yet it is said by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in National Bank v. Kirby[26] \"we are referred to no case in which it has been held that failure to pay interest, standing alone, is to be regarded sufficient in Jaw to throw such discredit upon the principal security upon which it is due as to subject the holder, to the full extent of the security, to antecedent equities.\"\n\"To hold otherwise,\" said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac[27] \"would throw discredit upon a large class of securities issued by municipal and private corporations having years to run, with interest payable annually or semi-annually.\" And the doctrine was re-affirmed in Railway Co. v. Sprague[28].\nIt is quite true that the opposite appears to have been held in New York and Minnesota at an early date; that is to say, it has been held that notice of default in the payment of interest is equivalent to notice of dishonour. But I do not know that it has been held that default in payment of interest alone imparts to the instrument in respect of which it occurs the character of an overdue instrument; and in any case it is plain that these decisions run counter to the main stream of American authority; Long Island Loan & Trust Co. v. Columbus, Chicago & Indiana Central Rway. Co.[29] in 1895, at page 457.\nIt is argued, however, that the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States are expressly based upon principles and reasoning which a court administering the law of England cannot adopt.\nIt is said first that the decisions proceed upon the principle that interest is a mere incident of the principal while the settled doctrine of the English law is that interest reserved by a contract always constitutes a debt distinct from and independent of the principal.\nAnd, secondly, that broadly speaking the law administered by the Supreme Court of the United States in relation to the incidents of negotiability differs so widely from the law of England that the decisions of that court cannot be safely resorted to for assistance in the determination of questions arising upon such instruments. In support of these contentions the respondents rely upon the judgments of Howell C.J., and Perdue J., in Moore v. Scott[30] a case which (while it is unnecessary to say that the judgments referred to deserve the most attentive examination) cannot be regarded as an authority upon the point in question by reason of the fact that two out of four judges who took part in the decision expressly declined to give an opinion upon it.\nTo take the second of these contentions first. The learned Chief Justice of Manitoba in the case referred to at page 501, put it thus:\nThat case (Cromwell v. County of Sac[31]. shews how widely the American differs from the English law on this subject. In speaking of the rights of a holder in due course the learned judge uses the following language, \"Mere suspicion that there may be a defect of title in its holder or knowledge of circumstances which would excite suspicion as to his title in the mind of a prudent man is not sufficient to impair the title of the purchaser. That result will only follow where there has been bad faith on his part.\" This cannot be the law under the English and Canadian codes.\nNow it is to be observed that the learned judge [in Cromwell v. Sac Co.31 is stating a rule of law, not a proposition compounded of a rule of law and an inference of fact. And he states the law to be that in the case he puts the existence in fact of good faith or bad faith is the test that is to be applied; and the \"suspicion\" which is the subject of his observation is on the face of it a suspicion not inconsistent with the existence of good faith. So under the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" in England or Canada, as under the common law the rule of law is absolute that the question in every such case is the question of fact\u2014did the taker acquire the instrument in good faith or bad faith? Given facts exciting suspicion, i.e., actual suspicion arising from facts known or believed to exist and either an absence of inquiry or an inquiry which does not remove the suspicion and you have a state of facts which is obviously incompatible with good faith; but it would be going a long way to lay down as a proposition of law that \"mere suspicion\"\u2014a speculative surmise that something might be wrong without any objective basis\u2014could never in any circumstances be consistent with honesty. And, even so, that is a somewhat narrow ground on which to rest the opinion that the American law on this subject has departed widely from the law of England. Had the point been material I have no doubt that Field J. would have agreed with the observation of Lord Herschell in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[32], at page 221.\nIf there be anything which excites the suspicion that there is something wrong in the transaction, the taker of the instrument is not acting in good faith if he shuts his eyes to the facts presented to him and puts the suspicions aside without further inquiry.\nTo come then to the contention that the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States upon this question proceed upon views of the legal nature of the contracts under which interest is reserved in such instruments that are radically at variance with the principles of English law on the subject. Now it is quite true the judgment of Field J. in Cromwell v. County of Sac[33] contains this observation,\nThe interest stipulated for was a mere incident of the debt.\nBut it is a mistake to suppose as appears to have been assumed by some of the learned judges in Moore v. Scott[34] that this observation implies any such identification of the debt arising from the con-tract for the payment of interest with that arising from the contract respecting the principal as would prevent a separate action for the interest or postpone the commencement of the period of prescription in respect of the interest until the maturity of the principal. On both these points the law had long before, in that court, been settled in the opposite sense in respect of the class of instruments in dispute in the case then under consideration, Clark v. Iowa City[35]. In truth the observation was directed not to any contention that in such cases the two contracts are independent, but on the contrary to a contention that the instrument in question contained but one promise embracing the principal and interest; that in law the debt was a single entire debt; and that anything which dishonours any of the parts of the instrument dishonours the whole[36]. This somewhat technical reasoning was in substance that upon which the American decisions were based in which it was held that de- fault in payment of a single instalment of the principal payable by the terms of a promissory note impresses the note with the character of an \"overdue\" instrument: Vinton v. King[37]; Newell v. Gregg[38]; and see per Parke B. in Oridge v. Sherborne[39], at page 378; and the purpose of the argument was to bring the case of a default in respect of a payment of interest within the principle of those decisions. For the rejection of the technical argument ample justification on technical grounds is to be found in the decisions in Rudder v. Price[40], at page 555; Herries v. Jamieson[41], at p. 556; Dickenson v. Harrison[42], and Attwood v. Taylor (\u00e0). And it would be entirely at variance with the views of English lawyers from the time of Lord Mansfield to the time of Lord Halsbury broadly to affirm that (where by the same instrument payment of both principal and interest is provided for) the obligation in respect of the interest is always to be attributed to a contract wholly independent of the contract respecting the principal. What the relation is between the obligation for the payment of principal and that for the payment of interest is always on the last resort a question of the construction of the particular document out of which the obligations arise; Economic Life Assurance Society v: Usborne[43], at p. 149; and upon the terms of the document it is to be determined whether, for a given purpose, the two obligations are to be regarded as wholly independent or as integral parts of a single obligation or as bearing to one another the relation of principal and accessory. In the absence of special words the course of the decisions in England prior to the decision of the House of Lords in Economic Life Assurance Society v. Usborne[44], was to regard the contract for interest as for many purposes \"ancillary,\" \"subsidiary,\" \"incidental\"; as \"following the nature\" of the principal; Hollis v. Palmer[45], per Tindal C. J., at pp. 267 and 268, per Vaughan J., at p. 270, and in Bingham's report of the same case, per Bosanquet J.[46], at page 718; Clark v. Alexander[47], per Tindal C.J., at page 165; Florence v. Drayson[48], per Cockburn C.J. and Cresswell J., at pages 589 and 590; Florence v. Jenings[49]; Lowry v. Williams[50], per FitzGibbon L.J., at pages 282 and 283; Ex parte Fewings[51]. If then for the purpose of fixing the character of a commercial instrument\u2014in respect of being overdue or current within the commercial rule\u2014one be obliged\/ disregarding broader considerations, to determine as between the contract for principal and that for the payment of interest contained in it which the law regards as the principal and which the accessory; if one be compelled to resort to such artificial tests; then although law of England furnishes no positive rule applicable to the case yet the weight of argument would seem to incline in favour of the view that the character of the instrument should be determined by reference to that which, for many other purposes, is commonly regarded as the principal obligation. And this appears to have been the view of Field J.\nFor these reasons I think the criticisms referred to miss their aim. But the true answer is that the decisions in question rest on much broader grounds. The true ratio of them is indicated in the passage already quoted from the judgment in Morgan v. United States[52]; and will be found, on a careful examination, to be simply this: that inasmuch as the grounds upon which the rule relating to overdue instruments is founded do not justify the application of it by reason only of a default in respect of a periodical payment of interest, so to apply it, would in effect be to introduce a new rule restricting the currency of negotiable instruments which would greatly impair if it would not entirely destroy\u2014the negotiable character of a large class of such instruments now universally regarded and treated as a part of the commercial currency of the country. For the reasons I have given these grounds seem to me to be sound grounds\u2014in conformity with the principles acted upon by English courts for over a century.\nOf the views expressed in the judgments in Moore v. Scott[53], to which I have already referred at some length, and in an admirably clear and forcible judgment of the late Judge McDougall, of the York County Court, in Jennings v. Napanee Brush Co.[54], it is perhaps sufficient to say that my reasons for thinking that these views should not be accepted will, without a more systematic discussion of them, be apparent from the foregoing; although I wish to be understood distinctly as neither approving nor disapproving the actual decision in either of those cases.\nThere remains the question whether, as regards the unpaid interest itself, the note should for the purposes of the rule in question be regarded as an overdue note. Against the affirmative of these views there is a strong prima facie case in the obvious inconvenience and confusion to which the adoption of it would in practice give rise. And although in strict theory there is something to be said in favour of it, I think it must be rejected.\n\"The object of the law merchant,\" said Byles J. in Swan v. North British Australasian Co.[55], as regards bills and notes made or become payable to bearer is to secure their circulation: therefore honest acquisition confers title. To this despotic but necessary principle the ordinary rules of the common law are made to bend.\nSo the governing factor in the consideration of this question is that the instrument is a current negotiable instrument up to the time of the maturity of the principal; and it would, I think, be incompatible with the full recognition of this character of the instrument to hold that the title to interest not paid when due does not follow the title to the instrument itself.\nFor the purpose of clearness I will attempt to summarize the ground upon which I think this case ought to be decided.\nThe doctrine of constructive notice is not applicable to current bills and notes transferred for value, but in all cases when the good faith of the holder is in issue the question is a question of fact to be determined on the circumstances of the particular case; and on the evidence here the plaintiffs should be held to be holders for value in good faith.\nUpon the question whether the note sued upon was overdue when it was acquired by the plaintiffs, as a clear rule upon that question cannot be gathered from the express, provisions of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" we must under section 10 of that Act have recourse to the common law for the purpose of arriving at the rule to be applied. The grounds upon which those decisions are based in which the rule limiting the currency of overdue instruments has been enunciated and applied do not in my judgment justify the application of the rule to a bill or note in respect of which the principal is not yet due, merely because a payment of interest is in default. Moreover, for the reasons given, the plaintiffs cannot in taking the note sued upon be said to have taken a dishonoured note with notice of its dishonour.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal per saltum, by leave of Mr. Justice Mathers, from the trial judge who dismissed the action to recover the amount of a promissory note he had found on the facts to have been obtained by fraud.\nIt is conceded the appellants are holders for value.\nThe note was given in the following form:\n$875.00 Gilbert Plains, Man., March 5th, 1903.\nMarch 1st, 1905, after date, for value received, we jointly and severally promise to pay McLAUGHLIN BROS., or order, Eight Hundred and Seventy-Five Dollars at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, with interest at six per cent, per annum, interest payable annually.\nfor the price of a stallion alleged to have been sold to a syndicate of whom twelve signed.\nIt was concluded by us all at the close of the argument of the appellant's counsel that the circumstances were such that the payees if suing could not recover.\nThe question remains whether or not the appellants can hold any higher position.\nThey took it on the 11th of February, 1905, knowing only that the business of payees was that of horse dealers and assuming therefrom that the note represented some dealing in horses.\nIt appears that they made no inquiries. The interest for the first year was then and had been past due for nearly a year. They sue for this interest as well as the principal and interest for the time since the end of the first year. It is claimed that, the interest being for the first year overdue and unpaid when the appellants took, they cannot claim to have taken in due course, so as to deprive th\u00e9 makers of the right to set up all the equities attached to the note, that they might have set up if payees had been suing. Can it be said that. the yearly interest being overdue for nearly a year, the note is overdue within the meaning of sections 56 and 70 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act?\"\nI do not think that the codification of the law in that Act was of such a nature as to either extend or restrict the meaning of the word \"overdue\" in this connection.\nNor do I find any help from a comparison of the use of the word \"overdue\" in these sections and in other parts of the Act or from a reference to the use of the word \"interest\" where it occurs in the Act.\nAt first I was disposed to think the use of the words \"interest payable annually\" unwarranted by the defining section 28 which seems to imply that the interest is to be the whole interest. But I think it must be taken when severed as in this note into annual payments of interest as if of annual instalments and, if need be to maintain the necessary quality of being for a sum certain, be treated as an instalment.\nNo case in England and only the cases of Moore v. Scott[56], and Jennings v. Napanee Brush. Co.[57], in Canada, deal with the point. The decisions in both these cases are against the appellants' view. The matter is well reasoned out in each. The first is from the appellate court of Manitoba. The second is by the late Judge McDougall, of the County Court of the County of York, in Ontario, whose opinions were always worthy of great consideration. As usual with him, he referred to and presented fully the opinion he combatted and then proceeded with his own exposition of the law.\nI prefer his reasoning to that which proceeds as some American cases do upon the basis of the interest being but an incident of the contract.\nIt is as I have already found an instalment.\nIs an overdue and unpaid instalment enough to bring a bill or note within the meaning of \"overdue\" in the Act and in the law as it stood before it was codified by this Act?\nI think it is. It seems to contain all the elements that formed the foundation for the rule.\nBrown v. Davies[58] is one of the earliest reported cases on the subject.\nIn 1789, Kenyon C.J. being of opinion that unless knowledge was brought home to the plaintiff the defence of its previous payment as against a payee could not be put up as against the indorser.\nIt was stated in argument of that case that Mr. Justice Buller had in another case Banks v. Colwell said that it had been repeatedly ruled at Guildhall that wherever it appears that a bill or note has been indorsed over, some time after it is due, which is out of the usual course of trade, that circumstance throws such a suspicion upon it that the indorsee must take it upon the credit of the indorser and must stand in the situation of the person to whom it was payable. In his judgment in the case just argued, Buller J. stated: But if it is overdue though I do not say that by law it is not negotiable yet certainly it is out of the common course of dealing and does give rise to suspicion.\nAgain he says:\nA fair endorsee can never be injured by the rule; for if the trans-. action be a fair one he will be entitled to recover. But it may be a useful rule to detect fraud whenever that has been practised.\nIn a foot-note there is a case of Taylor v. Mather[59] mentioned.\nIn this Buller J. said:\nI have always left it to the jury upon the slightest circumstance to presume that the indorsee was acquainted with the fraud.\nAs Lord Ellenborough put it in the case of Tinson v. Francis[60],\nAfter a bill or note is due it comes disgraced to the indorsee.\nThis language is just as applicable to a bill or note of which one or more instalments is due as if the whole were due. Especially is this so whenever as here the indorsee buys the overdue interest as part of his purchase. His suing for it surely entitles us in the absence of explanation to assume the appellant did so.\nIt is a broken contract.\nIt could be presented and protested. It could be sued upon and judgment be recovered for that which is due. See the case of Oridge v. Sherborne[61].\nIf suit were brought by the payee and a defence of fraud set up that defence would when adjudicated upon determine conclusively the same question between the same parties as to the rest of the note. See Black River Savings Bank v. Edwards[62]. In the case of Vinton v. King[63] a Massachusetts Supreme Court decision, it was expressly held that an instalment of principal having fallen due and remained unpaid the note was overdue, and taken by a later indorsee subject to all the equities attaching to the note. Indeed, Mr. Daniels' work on Negotiable Securities (5 ed.), p. 781, broadly lays it down that an overdue instalment of a bill or note renders it an overdue bill or note within the rule.\nThis principle has been applied elsewhere. Indeed, I cannot find it has been very seriously questioned.\nAn overdue instalment is universally held in, and I think the preponderance of authority in the United States is that default in payment of interest is just as effective to constitute the instrument an overdue bill or note as is default as to both principal and interest maturing on the same date.\nThe distinction made between instalments of principal and instalments of interest is I think essentially unsound.\nIt proceeds upon undue stress being laid upon what is said as to interest being only an incident of the debt.\nI agree to the fullest extent with the reasoning of the late Judge McDougall in the Jennings Case[64] cited above.\nTo say that an instalment of one hundred dollars being overdue is fatal, but one of a thousand dollars of interest of no effect, seems to me trying to make a distinction without a difference, when we have regard to the reason for the rule. The radical error is in treating the interest as something incidental to and not part of the contract.\nIt arises, I suspect, from the radical difference of the point of view interest is looked upon in the United States as distinguished from that obtaining in England.\nSedgwick deals with this at page 430, Vol I., of the 8th edition of his work on Damages as follows:\nSec. 292: Difference between English and American law.\nIn the American courts interest is allowed as damages more liberally than in England. The leading difference seems to grow out of a different consideration of the nature of money. The American cases look upon the interest as the necessary incident, the natural growth of the money, and therefore incline to give it with the principal, which the English courts treat it as something distinct and independent, and only to be had by virtue of some positive agreement or statute.\nAdopting the English point of view as we ought I see no difficulty in treating interest as any other instalment overdue.\nNo point seemed to be made of the presumption or inference relative to the knowledge or want of knowledge of the appellants, when taking the note, of the non-payment of the year's interest which I find was overdue and unpaid.\nI have considered it and concluded that in the absence of any explanation the suing for it must be attributable to some knowledge or assumption of knowledge that cannot now be denied by the appellants.\nOne thing we must always bear in mind in dealing with questions such as this arising upon negotiable securities and the promissory note form especially; and it is this that the transferability of the original contract, so operating as to defeat the rights of the original parties to the contract, by creating a new contract as it were with a third party unknown, is an invasion by the law merchant, and the statutes ex- tending the same, of the general law of contract and ought not to be extended further than well recognized authority or custom or statute carries it.\nA curious condition of things is accidentally disclosed by seeking for authority amongst American cases. It is that in the case of First National Bank of St Paul v. County Commissioners of Scott County[65] it appears the courts of the state where the note, in question here, was transferred, have treated overdue interest as if principal.\nI suppose I am debarred on principle from recognizing this foreign law as a fact whilst asked to consider it as a means of general instruction. It only adds one more to the many unexplained things that appear. It shews how things in a law suit are left to chance, without the application of that industry that ought to be supplied to minimize perchance the realm of chance.\nHaving our attention called to debentures and their coupons as analogous negotiable instruments and the conflicting decisions anent the same, I desire to say that there may be a distinction between them and bills or notes arising from their respective differences of origins and the different modes of commercial handling of the same or the custom of their markets, and hence I would desire to be understood as reserving any opinion anent the same till the occasion arise. For example, the coupons are often severed from the contract for principal.\nI cannot find under the circumstances of this case authority or reason to warrant me in adding, to the point of overdue interest, any weight arising from the suspicions, if any, caused by the alteration of the rate of interest on the note.\nThe note was admitted and that must be taken to cover the need for explanation of the alteration, and leave the note in that regard as \"regular on the face of it.\" At least that is my present impression. Perhaps I am mistaken and it should be held to fail in this regard to get any support from the Act.\nIs the pencil indorsement of the horse being returned such evidence of that fact as should be held to impeach the good faith of the appellants? Is it to be inferred that this had been indorsed before coming to appellants?\nIn the view I have taken of the case it is unnecessary for me to decide. Indeed, if I felt this should be decided I would be inclined under all the circumstances to grant a new trial to ascertain the fact with costs to abide the event of such issue.\nHaving regard to the foundation upon which the rule as to, overdue notes rests-, the current of such authority as there is, on the point, the probable conformity thereto in practice, and the undesirability of disturbing the same, I think, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J (dissenting).\u2014I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fisher, Wilson & Ewart.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hudson, Howell, Ormond & Marlatt.\n[1] 91 U.S.R. 72.\n[2] 16 Man.

Should not the action have been brought on behalf of all the ratepayers and inhabitants of the municipality?\nJudgment appealed from (41 N.S. Rep. 351) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed.\nThe action was originally brought by Rueben I. Hart, a ratepayer of the City of Halifax, on behalf of all the ratepayers, to recover from the defendant, mayor of the city, a sum of money paid him out of civic funds in reimbursement of his expenses in attending a convention of the Union of Canadian Municipalities at Winnipeg. The plaintiff claimed that such payment was beyond the powers of the city council and, on refusal of the latter to allow its name to be used, that he was entitled to bring the action. On his death the suit was revived by his executors, the present respondents.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action holding that it could only be brought in the name of the Attorney-General. His judgment was reversed by the full court and judgment entered for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPending the action an Act was passed by the legislature of the province legalizing such payments for the future and empowering the City Council of Halifax \"in the event of judgment being finally recovered by the plaintiff\" in this case to pay all. or any sums for principal, interest and costs incurred by the defendant. 7 Edw. VII.ch. 61, sec. 17.\nAllison for the respondent.\nF. H. Bell for the appellant.\nAllison for the respondent took the preliminary objection that the above mentioned Act having legalized such expenditure for the future and empowered the city council to pay any sum recovered by the plaintiffs nothing but costs was involved in the appeal and the court should not entertain it. He relied on Moir v. Village of Huntingdon[2]; McKay v. Township of Hinchinbrooke[3]; Fraser v. Tupper[4].\nThe court directed that the hearing of the appeal should proceed on the merits.\nF. H. Bell for the appellant. The payment to the defendant by the city council was not ultra vires being made as incidental to, and by virtue of, its general statutory powers. Attorney-General v. North-Eastern Railway Co.[5]; Attorney-General v. Manchester Corporation)[6] ; Attorney-General v. Mersey Railway Co.[7].\nEven if the payment was illegal the contract to pay having been executed the money cannot be recovered back. Leake on Contracts (5 ed.), p. 553; Hermann v. Charlesworth[8].\nIn any case the action could only be brought by the Attorney-General. Evan v. Corporation of Avon[9]; Attorney-General v. DeWinton[10]; Kilbourne v. St.John[11].\nAllison for the respondents. A municipal corporation can only exercise the powers expressly granted to it or powers necessarily incidental thereto or essential to its declared objects and purposes. Dillon on Municipal Corporations (4 \u00e9d.), vol. 1, p. 87. The payment to the respondent in this case was not incidental nor essential to the objects and purposes of the corporation and was ultra vires. Waters v. Bonvouloir[12].\nThe Attorney-General was not a necessary party to the action. See Attorney-General v. Wilson[13]; Patterson v. Bowes[14]; Armstrong v. Church Society[15]; Prestney v. Mayor, etc:, of Colchester[16].\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Maclennan J.\nDavies J.\u2014This action was brought by the respondent, Hart, as one of the residents and ratepayers of the City of Halifax, on behalf of himself and the other ratepayers, praying for a declaration that a certain payment of $231, made to the defendant, appellant, when mayor of the said city, out of the funds of the city, might be declared illegal and void and re-paid by him into such funds.\nThe defendant contested the suit upon several grounds.\nFirst: That the payment was not ultra vires of the corporation, but within their powers;\nSecondly: That, even if ultra vires, the payment was made for work which the defendant had been requested by the council to do and constituted a completed contract so that neither the city nor any one else on its behalf could recover it back, and\nThirdly: That the transaction impeached was complained of as being an improper and illegal diversion of the city funds and that the only person who could take the proceedings for the recovery of the money was the Attorney-General, with or without a relator.\nWe were all of the opinion, after hearing the argument, that the trial judge and the majority of the court of appeal were right in holding the payments complained of to have been ultra vires of the corporation, and, having been so, could have been recovered back in a suit by the City of Halifax corporation.\nThe city having, however, refused to allow its name to be so used, the main question argued before us remained:\u2014Could, in such a case, a ratepayer and resident, suing as the plaintiff has done here and making the city a defendant in his suit, successfully claim the declaration he prayed for, or must such a suit be brought in the name of the Attorney-General.\nThe trial judge, holding that the Attorney-General was a necessary party, dismissed the action, and the court of appeal in Nova Scotia unanimously reversed that decision and held that the action, as brought, could be maintained.\nWe think it is not open to doubt that granting the payment impeached to have been ultra vires, and made to an officer of the corporation such as the mayor, the action could have been maintained in the corporate name of the city against him for its money, and that, in such case, the Attorney-General need not have been a party. The fact that it was money and not other property of the city that was in question could not make any difference in the right of the city corporation to sue, and I did not understand Mr. Bell, in his very able argument at bar, to contend that it did.\nThe sole point, therefore, that remains for consideration is whether, in a case where the municipal authorities refuse to allow the corporation name to be used to test the legality of the payment of municipal funds proposed to be made or already made, or the legality of the appropriation of other property of the municipality made or to be made, questions which seem to me to stand practically on the same footing, the action to test the question must be brought in the name of the Attorney-General, with or without relators, and cannot be brought in that of the resident ratepayers who are members of the corporation.\nMany years ago, that important question was decided in Ontario in the case of Paterson v. Bowes[17], in favour of the right of the ratepayers to sue in the circumstances suggested.. That case has been consistently followed in that province ever since and may now be considered as the settled rule of law and practice there.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the case now under review, reversing that of the trial judge, follows on the same line, while in Prince Edward Island, Hodgson M.R., in Tanton v. The City of Charlottetown[18], after a lengthy review of the English cases, holds that the Attorney-General must be a party plaintiff.\nThe necessity of the Attorney-General being a party to any action against corporations which involve only public rights or interests, or for the protection, in any way, of public interests, as such, and as distinct from cases where there is a distinct private injury arising from the act complained of, is admitted.\nWhat is contended by the respondent is that where the act complained of is ultra vires of the corporation, and works a distinct private injury separable from the wrong to the public, the private individual or individuals may, in cases where the user of the name of the corporation is refused, sue for his own protection . in his own name without the Attorney-General.\nIn the case of Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council[19], Buckley J. held that a plaintiff can sue without joining the Attorney-General, in two cases, (a) where an interference with a public right involves interference with some private right of the plaintiff, and (6) where no private right of the plaintiff is interfered with but he, in respect of his public right, suffers special damage peculiar to himself from the interference with the public right.\nDoes the principle involved in the second proposition of Buckley J., and on which it necessarily rests, apply to the facts of this case?\nAssuming, as we have already decided and on which assumption alone the question arises, that there has been an interference with a public right by the misappropriation of the moneys of the municipality to purposes outside of its powers, can it fairly be said that the plaintiffs have suffered damage peculiar to themselves qua ratepayers.\nThe public right, interference with which justifies the intervention of the Attorney-General is, I take it, the application of moneys devoted by the terms of the incorporation Act of the municipality to certain specified purposes, to purposes other and different from these, in other words, to purposes ultra vires of the municipality.\nThe peculiar damage sustained by the ratepayers as the result of such misappropriation, arises out of the increased rates which they will have to pay by reason of the misappropriation of the moneys of the corporation. It matters not whether the damage be great or small, unless indeed the whole transaction was so trivial that the court would refuse to interfere on that ground. But the broad contention is put forward that even where personal misappropriation of the corporate funds by the officers of the municipality is shewn, coupled with the refusal by the controlling officials of the use of the corporate name to enable the wrong to be rectified, the ratepayers are helpless unless and until they can get the Attorney-General to intervene; and that any special damage which the plaintiffs individually or as a special class will sustain cannot and does not give them \u00e0 right to sue.\nThe misappropriation here complained of is only $270. If it was $2,700, it should not make any difference in the determination of the right of the injured class to sue for their own protection. As ratepayers, they seem to me to have suffered special and peculiar damage to themselves distinct from the public damage which the Attorney-General has the sole right to represent, and, as a result of such special and peculiar damage, have a right to sue in their own name, in equity, to have the wrong rectified or proposed wrong enjoined, where their trustee, (the municipality), refuses to allow the corporate name to be used for the purpose.\nI quite concede, alike on principle as on authority, that where the general right of His Majesty's subjects alone is involved, and with respect to any interference with that right, the Attorney-General is the only and proper person, with or without relators, to sue. The relator only came in for the purpose of costs. Attorney-General v. Logan[20]. The Attorney-General comes in as the officer of the King, who, as parens patrice, by his proper officer, files his information to see that right is done to his subjects who are incompetent to act for themselves. But it does not seem reasonable or consistent with principle to apply the rule to cases where persons or a class, being members of municipal corporations, complain of the action of officials, having control for the time being of the corporation, diverting or appropriating its money or property for purposes ultra vires of the corporation so as to work a special injury to such persons or class of persons and refusing to allow the corporation name to be used to test the legality of the action complained of. In the latest case I have been able to find, The Attorney-General, (on the relation of the Spalding Union Rural District Council), and The Spalding Union Rural District Council v. Garner[21], where the beneficial right of pasturage along a certain road was in question, Channell J. held, that this right was vested in the Parish Council and not in the Rural District Council and that\nthe Attorney-General could only interfere to protect the rights of the community in general and not the rights of a limited portion thereof, especially when that limited portion could have brought the action alone, and that, therefore, the Attorney-General had no right to bring the action.\nThe learned judge reviews many of the decided cases and admits that he had reached his conclusion \"not without considerable doubt.\"\nThe right of the Attorney-General alone to interfere in cases where incorporated companies, by their officials, attempt to misuse their statutory powers or divert or misappropriate the company's funds, irrespective of special damage to the complainant, is neither raised nor questioned here, nor do I seek to cast any shadow of doubt upon such right.\nChief Justice Dillon, in his book, (4 ed.) on Municipal Corporations, so often cited as authority, in discussing the question now under review, concludes strongly in favour of the right of ratepayers, without joining the Attorney-General, to maintain such actions as the present; sections 914 to 922. By pertinent and cogent reasoning, which is satisfactory to me at any rate, he establishes the distinction which should prevail, that\nwhere the duty about to be violated or the action sought to be enjoined is public in its nature and affects all the inhabitants alike, one not suffering any special injury cannot, in his own name, or by uniting with others, maintain a bill, but that, in the case of a ratepayer sustaining special damage, he may bring his action for relief.\nIn Crampton v. Zabriskie[22]., in 1879, the Supreme Court of the United States added the weighty sanction of their authority to the conclusions which Mr. Dillon had reached and upheld\nthe right of resident taxpayers to invoke the interposition of a court of equity to prevent an illegal disposition of the moneys of the county, or the illegal creation of a debt which they, in common with other property holders of the county, may otherwise be compelled to pay.\nI do not propose to review the great array of authorities more or less applicable which were cited to us by learned counsel in their able arguments. The case of Watson v. The Mayor, etc., of Hythe[23], was relied upon by the appellant for the proposition that, for the purposes and practice we are discussing, municipal and commercial corporations stood on different footings. The case is very meagrely reported and the decision is that of a single judge. In maintaining the objection to the maintenance of the action,, he laid stress upon the fact that the wrong complained of was one by a public body and not causing damage to an individual and that such wrong could only be restrained by action of the Attorney-General. In substance (he says), the plaintiffs were seeking to restrain not the council, but the corporation from exercising its public functions in a manner which was not pleasing to the plaintiff.\nThe ratio of his decision appears to have been the absence of special damage to the individual suing and the substitution by the plaintiff of his displeasure for his damage. Nor does it clearly appear from the report of that case that the act complained of was ultra vires.\nThe case of Evan v. The Corporation of Avon[24] was much replied upon by the appellants. I do not think that when properly examined it can be said to be an authority for their contentions. In the first place, the plaintiff there sued by himself without the Attorney-General, and not even on behalf of the rest of the burgesses or of the inhabitants. Yet the bill was not dismissed upon these grounds but because the corporation was absolutely entitled to the property claimed, and the plaintiff had failed to shew a title in the freemen under the reservation comprised in the second section of the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. There was no question there of payments of the corporation funds for purposes beyond their powers. The prayer of the bill was to restrain the corporation from selling the market property and other property remaining in them and for an account of such property as they had sold, and the holding of the M.R. was, that the corporation admittedly not being within \"The Municipal Corporations Act,\"\nhad full power to dispose of all its property like any private individual,\nand that no private trust was sufficiently alleged on the face of the bill to support it. When read together with the subsequent case of Prestney v. The Mayor and Corporation of Colchester & The Attorney-General[25] I do not think it can be held to be an authority for the appellants' contentious in this suit.\nOn the whole and admitting that there is some conflict of authority, I conclude that the balance alike of authority and reason, to say nothing of convenience, are in favour of such an action as the present being maintainable.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Graham that there is no English authority that conflicts with the law as upheld in Paterson v. Bowes[26], which followed Bromley v. Smith[27], and has been in turn followed by a stream of cases for fifty years in On- tario, that a ratepayer has a right of action where moneys have been, as here, unlawfully taken, or diverted from the municipal treasury to which his taxes go and that the Attorney-General is not a necessary party.\nAs against these authorities we have three recent cases in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, all within the last twenty years.\nThe law must be the same in all these three provinces, as well as in Nova Scotia.\nIt would seem as if expediency, as well as what seems in principle good law, should drive us to follow the law as maintained in Ontario, and in this case in Nova Scotia.\nI see no possible legal defence in the way of justification for the appellant and the argument in his favour, derived from the alleged rule that moneys paid ultra vires cannot be recovered, is not applicable to one standing, as he did, in relation to the depleted fund.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree with the judgment that the payment in question to the appellant, Macllreith, was one which the defendant corporation could not legally make; and that, in that respect, it stands on a different footing from the payment to the defendant Doane.\nI am also of opinion that the judgment is right on the question raised upon the form of the action.\nI confess I feel no difficulty whatever upon that question. It is a mere question of proper parties to a, suit in a court of equity. That question, in the very form in which it arises here, was fully discussed and reasoned out in Ontario, in the case of Paterson v. Bowes[28], by two of the ablest equity judges of that province; and I am unable to see any flaw in their reasoning. The right of the inhabitants to compel the city corporation that is the city council, as a body, to do its duty, rests on this:\u2014That the corporation is a trustee for the inhabitants.\nThat was declared in the same case of Bowes v. City of Toronto[29], by L.J, Knight Bruce, in these words:\u2014\nThe (city) council was, in effect and substance, a body of trustees for the inhabitants of Toronto.\nThe only difference between that case, in its initial stage, when the question of pleading was decided, and the present, is that in that case the plaintiff sued on behalf of himself and all the other inhabitants, and not, as here, the other ratepayers.\nThe city corporation is composed of all the inhabitants and not merely of the ratepayers, and I think the better form of action would be on behalf of both the inhabitants and ratepayers; but I think it good enough in its present form, as on behalf of the ratepayers, for, whether inhabitants or not, all the ratepayers are also cestuis que trustent of the city corporation.\nAs between the ratepayers and other inhabitants, the former have the greater interest in the recovery of money of the corporation, which has been misapplied, for they must pay an equivalent sum again, unless it is recovered, while the other inhabitants are free from that obligation.\nIt was said that as the statement of claim now stands the inhabitants who are not ratepayers, and who have an important interest, ought to be but are not before the court. But I think they are before the Court sufficiently, being represented by the city corporation, and will be bound by the judgment, what ever it may be. But, if that were doubtful, it would be proper to allow an amendment by alleging that the plaintiff sued on behalf both of the ratepayers and inhabitants[30].\nIt was also urged that, while the plaintiff might have been a ratepayer in 1905, when the money in question was misapplied, he might have ceased to be so in 1906, when he brought his action. But it is distinctly alleged in the statement of claim, and expressly admitted in the statement of defence, that the plaintiff was a resident ratepayer when the money was misapplied and continued so to be at the time of pleading.\nI am unable to see any good reason why, on a mere question of parties, and of the form of action, there should be any distinction whatever between business corporations and those numerous bodies, small and great, other than charitable, which we have in all the provinces of Canada, and which are authorized to act as corporations.\nI express no opinion on the question whether the Attorney-General of the province could, having regard to decided cases, or could not, have sued in this case, with or without a relator.\nAt the opening of the argument, it was objected by the respondents' counsel that the statute of Nova Scotia, ch. 61, sec. 17, (1906), had put an end to the appeal, and the argument proceeded subject to that objection.\nI do not think there is anything whatever in the objection. The authority given by the statute to the city council is only\nin the event of judgment being finally recovered by the plaintiff.\nI think that language contemplates that the action might proceed to a finality, including any competent appeal or appeals, which the parties or either of them might be advised to resort to.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J. concurred with Davies J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Tanguay (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Canadian Electric Light Company (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1907: October 10; 1908: February 18.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nRivers and streams\u2014Crown domain\u2014Title to land\u2014\"Flottage\"\u2014 Driving loose logs\u2014Public servitude\u2014Riparian ownership\u2014 Action possessoire\u2014Arts. 400, 503, 507, 2192 C.C.\u2014Art. 1064 G.P.Q.\nIn the Province of Quebec, watercourses which are capable merely of floating loose logs, (flottables \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues,) are not dependencies of the Crown domain within the meaning of article 400 of the Civil Code. The owners of the adjoining riparian lands are, consequently, the proprietors of the hanks and beds of such streams and have the right of action au possessoire in respect thereof. There is, however, a right of servitude over such watercourses in respect to all advantages which the streams and their banks, in their natural condition, can afford to the public, there being no distinction, in this regard, between navigable or floatable streams and those which are neither navigable nor floatable. McBean v. Carlisle (19 L.C. Jur. 276) and Tanguay v. Price (37 Can. S.C.R. 657) followed.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 16 K.B. 48) affirmed, Girouard and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Larue J., at the trial[2], in the Superior Court for the District of Quebec.\nThe action was au possessoire et en d\u00e9molition de nouvelles \u0153uvres and was brought by the respondents to obtain a declaration of their rights in the banks and bed of the River Chaudi\u00e8re as riparian proprietors of certain lands on both sides of that river. It was admitted that, at the locus in quo, the river was neither navigable nor floatable except for loose logs (\u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues), that the plaintiffs had been for some years in actual possession of the banks and bed of the river and had constructed dams and done other works there for the purpose of creating a reservoir and developing water-power for the operation of their electric light system installed in their power-house on the lands in question. They contended that the defendant had illegally disturbed them in their possession and prayed for the demolition of certain wharves and piers placed by the defendant on the banks and booms stretched across the river for the purpose, as alleged by him, of improving the floatability of the stream to carry on his lumbering operations with better advantage. At the trial, the questions at issue were whether or not the plaintiffs were in possession of the bed and banks of the river, at the place where the encroachments complained of occurred, within the meaning of articles 2192 of the Civil Code and 1064 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and if the defendant was entitled, under the circumstances, to invoke the benefit of the provisions of articles 5535 and 5536 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec and of the Act, 54 Vict. ch. 25 (Que.).\nThe courts below unanimously held that the defendant did not come within the provisions of the provincial statutes referred to, and the majority of the Court of King's Bench, held that, as the river was floatable merely \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues, it was not part of the Crown domain, and affirmed the judgment of Larue J. which maintained the plaintiffs' action, Lavergne J. dissenting.\nThe questions raised on the present appeal are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nLane for the appellant.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. and L. P. Pelletier K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The plaintiffs in the court of first instance (respondents) brought against the defendant (appellant) an action known in the Province of Quebec as an action possessoire et en d\u00e9molition de nouvelles \u0153uvres, whereby they sought the demolition and removal of certain piers and wharves built on the bed and the shores together with certain booms stretched across the waters of the River Chaudi\u00e8re.\nIn their declaration the plaintiffs set forth their documents of title and allege that they are proprietors and in possession of several lots of land fully described in such documents and situate within the parishes of St. Nicholas, St. Etienne de Lauzon and St. Jean Chrysostome, in the County of Levis, all crossed by or fronting on the River Chaudi\u00e8re. The plaintiffs further allege that as owners of the soil on both sides of the river (which they state to be at the locus in quo neither navigable nor floatable, except for loose logs) they are the owners of the land under the waters and that they have taken actual pedal possession of the same for the purpose of building a dam and creating a reservoir for the development of their electric light system. They complain that the defendant encroached on the bed of the river and its banks within the limits of their possession, and there proceeded to erect piers and wharves. By their conclusions, the plaintiffs pray for a declaration of their rights, for a declaration that the defendant has illegally disturbed the enjoyment of such rights, and for a declaration authorizing the demolition of the works complained of.\nThe defendant, without denying the alleged acts of trespass, except those that are charged with respect to the lands above high water mark, says:\n1st. That the Chaudi\u00e8re is a navigable and floatable river, and consequently its bed forms part of the Crown domain. (Art. 400 C.C.)\n2ndly. That the piers and the wharves in question were built by him on the bed and banks of the stream to improve its floatability and were necessary to carry on with advantage his lumber business, he being the proprietor of extensive timber limits on the river above; and he claims the benefit of articles 5535 and 5536 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec and of the provincial statute, 54 Vict. ch. 25.\nThe questions in issue at the trial were, therefore:\n1st. Were the plaintiffs in possession of the bed and banks of the River Chaudi\u00e8re, at the place where the encroachments complained of occurred, within the meaning of articles 1064 C.P.Q., and 2192 C.C.?\n2ndly. Is the defendant, in the circumstances, entitled to claim the benefit of the statutory provisions he invokes?\nThe judges below are unanimously of opinion that the defendant did not come within the exceptional provisions of the Revised Statutes of Quebec which are applicable only to a proprietor whose lands border on a water-course, or to the owner of property along or across which a water-course runs or passes (art. 503 C.C.) and that defendant is not in either class.\nBoth courts also find that the Act, 54 Vict. ch. 25, does not, if applicable to the circumstances of this case, confer on the appellant power to do the acts complained of, unless and until certain conditions have been performed by him which have not been performed.,\nWith the unanimous conclusions reached on these two points I agree; and the only question to be considered on this appeal, and it is of the greatest importance, is the one with respect to which there was a dissenting opinion below, viz.: Were the plaintiffs in possession of the bed and banks of the river as alleged in their declaration; or, in other words, is the Chaudi\u00e8re River navigable and floatable at the place where it crosses or passes over the plaintiff's property so as to make it part of the Crown domain?\nThe answer to this question depends upon the construction to be put upon the word \"floatable\" in article 400 of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec.\nIt is unnecessary to add that the case must be decided according to the French law as it exists in that province.\nSome reference was made to a supposed defect in the respondent's title resulting from the description of the lots which are stated to be bounded by the river.\nIn my opinion, this difficulty is disposed of by the judgment of this court in Massawippi Valley Railway Co. v. Reed[3]. See also Attorney-General of Quebec v. Scott[4].\nAdmittedly the river is not navigable.\nIn Bell v. The City of Quebec[5], their Lordships, citing Dalloz, Rep. tit. \"Voirie par eau\" no. 39, say the test of navigability of a river is its possible use for transport in some practical and profitable manner.\nIt cannot be said, taking the most favourable view of the evidence, that this river could be used in a profitable or practical manner for the purpose of navigation, and for that the defendant did not contend here. On this appeal, as in the courts below, the issue was as to the floatability of the river; and this issue involves the decision of a preliminary question which, from its very nature, is exclusively one of fact and as to which, under the French system, the finding of the trial judge is practically conclusive. (Beaudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, no. 174; Attorney-General of Quebec v. Scott[6]. The learned trial judge, who heard all the witnesses, after having described the character of the river throughout its entire course, from Lake Megan-tic to the estuary or basin at the foot of the falls below the plaintiff's property, sums up in these terms:\nLa preuve d\u00e9montre de la mani\u00e8re la plus convaincante que cette rivi\u00e8re n'est navigable d'une mani\u00e8re pratique, dans son \u00e9tat naturel, dans aucune partie de son parcours, sauf en bas de la chauss\u00e9e de la demanderesse dans l'estuaire du bassin de la rivi\u00e8re jusqu'\u00e0 sa jonction avec le fleuve St. Laurent.\nQuant a sa flottabilit\u00e9 elle est impossible pour les radeaux et trains de bois. Lors des grosses eaux du printemps et des pluies extraordinaires amenant une crue subite le flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues est le seul genre de flottage qui puisse s'y faire.\nDans les basses eaux, les gens peuvent traverser \u00e0 pied.\nThis finding of fact is concurred in by the majority of the court of appeal and is not expressly dissented from by Mr. Justice Lavergne, who says, at page 422:\nLa Chaudi\u00e8re est une des rivi\u00e8res les plus consid\u00e9rables. Sa larguer moyenne est de trois arpents; elle en a atteint jusqu'\u00e0 8 a 9. Au printemps et aux coups d'eau d'\u00e9t\u00e9, les eaux sont tr\u00e8s hautes et alors se fait le flottage de centaines de milliers et peut-\u00eatre de millions de billots qui se rendent aux divers moulins o\u00f9 ils sont sci\u00e9s et mis sur le march\u00e9. Cependant de St. Fran\u00e7ois \u00e0 la jonction Scott, distance de 20 \u00e0 30 milles, il y a assez d'eau pour les petites embarcations, et m\u00eame pour les bateaux \u00e0 vapeur. De la jonction Scott jusqu'\u00e0 la ch\u00fbte, suite de rapides. Dans l'\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 eau basse, il n'y a de navigable ou de flottable que la partie de St. Fran\u00e7ois \u00e0 la jonction Scott.\nSee also O'Farrell v. Duchesnay[7].\nThe plaintiff's property is between \"la jonction Scott\" and \"la ch\u00fbte.\" Vide The Queen v. Robertson[8], per Strong J., at page 130. Therefore I assume that the river is found to be in fact floatable only for loose logs; and, on that assumption, I proceed to examine the question as to whether such a river forms part of the Crown domain as being a floatable river within the meaning of article 400 C.C. The question is very frankly and very fairly put by Mr. Justice Lavergne in his dissenting judgment, when he says:\nIl est ind\u00e9niable qu'aux hautes eaux la rivi\u00e8re est flottable pour des flots de billots. L'intim\u00e9 nous dit que c'est l\u00e0 le flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues et que les rivi\u00e8res flottables \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues ne sont pas des d\u00e9pendances du domaine public.\nCette distinction ne se trouve pas dans le code et il me semble qu'elle n'a pas lieu d'\u00eatre dans le pays. Dans l'ancienne France elle n'\u00e9tait donn\u00e9e que par un certain nombre d'auteurs. Le Code Napol\u00e9on ne distingue pas.\nHere, I venture to say with deference, is the fundamental error which has led the learned judge to the erroneous conclusions he has reached. In France, before the Code, there was a broad distinction between streams that were floatable in the sense that they could be used for the transport of boats, flats or rafts (the words used are \"portant bateaux, trains ou radeaux\") and those streams that were floatable for loose logs only; and since the Code, as Laurent says, the distinction is universally admitted.\nDalloz, R\u00e9p. Jur. Eaux, no. 61:\nIl est vrai (dit-il), que le code civil n'a \u00e9tabli aucune distinction entre les deux sortes de flottage; il a m\u00eame gard\u00e9 un silence absolu \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; mais la distinction se retrouve dans toutes les anciennes lois, comme dans tous les monuments de la jurisprudence.\nProudhon, Domaine public, vol. 3, no. 857:\nIl est essential de remarquer que les rivi\u00e8res flottables doivent \u00eatre rang\u00e9es dans deux classes tr\u00e8s distinctes.\nLa premi\u00e8re classe comprend celles des rivi\u00e8res o\u00f9 le flottage s'exerce par trains ou radeaux, et la seconde celles o\u00f9 il ne se pratique qu'\u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues. On entend ici par trains, ou trains de bois, les groupes ou faisceaux de bois coup\u00e9s en bouts de moindre ou m\u00e9diocre longueur, que l\u2019on assujettit les uns aux autres par des perches et des liens, pour pouvoir les soigner ensemble comme un seul corps lanc\u00e9 \u00e0 flot dans la rivi\u00e8re par laquelle on veut les faire descendre.\nLe mot radeau s'applique plus sp\u00e9cialement aux grands bois de charpente ou de m\u00e2ture qu'on lance en rivi\u00e8re et qu'on y assujettit de m\u00eame les uns aux autres par des perches et des liens, pour pouvoir les soigner ensemble et en gouverner la conduite comme s'ils ne formaient qu'un seul corps.\nIl est ais\u00e9 de comprendre que cette esp\u00e8ce de flottage ne peut s'exercer que dans les grandes rivi\u00e8res, o\u00f9 le volume des eaux est partout suffisant pour porter \u00e0 flot les trains et radeaux, et dans le lit desquelles on ne trouve ni cataractes, ni cascades, ni rochers qui embarrassent le cours d'eau.\nTels sont les caract\u00e8res par lesquels on distingue la premi\u00e8re classe des rivi\u00e8res flottables.\nAgain at no. 860:\nIl y a donc deux esp\u00e8ces bien distinctes de rivi\u00e8res flottables:\nLa premi\u00e8re comprend celles sur lesquelles le flottage s'exerce par grosses masses be bois r\u00e9unis et enlac\u00e9s en trains ou radeaux; et cette esp\u00e8ce appartient, sous tous ses rapports, au domaine public, comme celle des rivi\u00e8res navigables:\nLa seconde esp\u00e8ce comprend celles des rivi\u00e8res ou m\u00eame des gros ruisseaux qui ne sont flottables qu'\u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues; et cette derni\u00e8re classe reste, quant \u00e0 tous ses usages, except\u00e9 celui de la flottabilit\u00e9, dans le domaine priv\u00e9 des propri\u00e9taires riverains.\nSee also nos. 390 and 391.\nThe earliest reported case is in Dalloz, 1823, 1. 371, where it was held:\nLes rivi\u00e8res ne doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es d\u00e9pendant du domaine public que lorsqu'elles sont flottables \u00e0 train ou \u00e0 radeau. Celles qui ne sont flottables qu' \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des riverains.\nReference is also directed to the note to this case, loc. cit.\nLaurent, Suppl\u00e9ment des Principes du Droit Civil, vol. 2, one of the most recent books, sums up the doctrine in these words: Une rivi\u00e8re n'est pas flottable dans le sens de l'article 538 quand elle ne l'est qu'\u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues; ceci est universellement admis.\nBeaudry-Lacantinerie, \"Des Biens,\" page 134, no. 174, says:\n174. Les fleuves et les rivi\u00e8res navigables ou flottables. Ce sont des chemins qui marchant, dit Paschal. Une rivi\u00e8re . * * *. peut servir au transport des bois par le flottage ou la flottaison. On distingue deux esp\u00e8ces de flottages, le flottage avec trains ou radeaux, * * * et le flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues * * * . Il n'y a que les rivi\u00e8res flottables avec trains ou radeaux qui fassent partie du domaine public.\n2 Plocque, L\u00e9gislation des Eaux, no. 174:\nOn appelle flottable une rivi\u00e8re sur laquelle on conduit des trains ou brelles, c'est-\u00e0-dire, des masses de bois de charpente, de menuiserie ou de chauffage, assujetties avec des perches ou des liens, en forme de radeau. Mais on ne comprend pas dans le nombre des rivi\u00e8res flottables les cours d'eau sur lesquels on fait flotter des bois isol\u00e9s ou b\u00fbches perdues.\nIt is useless to accumulate references to books and cases; all the learning on the subject will be found in Fuzier-Herman, vbo. \"Rivi\u00e8res\" nos. 80 et seq., where there is authority.in abundance to support my submission that the distinction referred to by Mr. Justice Lavergne was universally admitted in France both before and since the Code. The distinction was recognized and acted upon in this court in Ward v. Township of Grenville[9]. Mr. Justice Girouard, at page 524, says that the Rouge River\nwhich in no sense is navigable but only floatable \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues. is the property, of the riparian proprietor.\nAnd again at page 526, he speaks of the rights of the public with respect to the use of a private river for the purpose of floating logs. However, as to the ownership of the beds of rivers floatable only for loose logs (b\u00fbches perdues), which is the point at issue on this appeal, Laurent, who with Daviel and Championni\u00e8re, holds that the riparian proprietor is the owner of the bed of the stream opposite his property, says[10]:\nIl y a sur ce point un v\u00e9ritable chaos d'opinions, et dans la doctrine et' dans la jurisprudence.\nIn 1846, however, the Cour de Cassation[11] decided that the beds of such rivers were res nullius, and this doctrine seems to have been finally adopted by the French courts[12].\nTwo very instructive notes to the cases cited shew how reluctantly the text-writers accepted this jurisprudence; but finally, in 1898, the doctrine propounded by Laurent, Daviel and Championni\u00e8re prevailed, and legislation introduced in that year set at rest the long standing controversy in France. See \"Loi du 8 avril, 1898,\" article 3 of which reads:\nLe lit des cours d'eau non navigables et non flottables appartient aux propri\u00e9taires des deux rives.\nIn a note to the judgment rendered in 1846, Mr.Deville says(2):\nLa cour de cassation r\u00e9sout ici, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, une question depuis longtemps controvers\u00e9e entre les jurisconsultes et qui, chaque fois qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente, y est un sujet de grave perplexit\u00e9.'\n******\nL\u2019arr\u00eat que vient de rendre la cour mettra-t-il un terme \u00e0 ce long d\u00e9bat, et fixira-t-il la jurisprudence? Il est permis d'en douter. Il est m\u00eame remarquable qu'au moment o\u00f9 cet arr\u00eat est rendu appara\u00eet un ouvrage de l'un de nos plus savants jurisconsultes, ayant pour objet d'\u00e9tablir la th\u00e8se contraire \u00e0 celle que vient de consacrer la cour supr\u00eame. Dans cet ouvrage intitul\u00e9 \"De la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des eaux courantes,\" etc., et appel\u00e9, nous n'h\u00e9sitons pas \u00e0 le dire, \u00e0 faire sensation dans la science, l'auteur, M. Championni\u00e8re, se livre \u00e0 une \u00e9tude approfondie de l\u00e9tat de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et en particulier de celle des cours d'eau, sous l'empire de notre ancien r\u00e9gime f\u00e9odal et des institutions seigneuriales, pour en faire ressortir la solution de la question qui nous occupe, et il en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion, qui nous semble irr\u00e9sistible, qu'en France la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des rivi\u00e8res non navigables ni flottables n'a jamais appartenu au domaine, ni aux anciens seigneurs; qu'elle a toujours appartenu aux riverains; que, par cons\u00e9quent, 1' abolition du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9odal n'a pu la transmettre \u00e0 l\u00e9tat; et qu'enfin, soit la l\u00e9gislation interm\u00e9diaire, soit le code civil, l'ont laiss\u00e9e, comme elle Pavait \u00e9t\u00e9 de tout temps, dans le domaine priv\u00e9 des particuliers.\nIn the Province of Quebec this question was the subject of judicial examination and decision by the special court established under the Seigniorial Act of 1854; and Sir Louis LaFontaine in his judgment[13] goes into the whole subject at great length. In the result it was held, in accordance with the earliest French decisions, that the beds of rivers floatable only for loose logs were not part of the Crown domain, but passed by the King's grant to the seignior and from the latter by subinfeudation or accensement to the censitaire. (See 70, 71, 72a, Vol. A, Quest. Seig.; and opinions of Day J., p. 50(6), Mondelet J., p. 34(0), Smith J. 80(f), and Meredith J., p. 79(h), Vol. B, Quest. Seig.)\nAt page 80 (h), after a careful examination of all the authorities, Meredith J. states his conclusions as follows:\nThere has been much controversy as to whether under the code civil (Code Napol\u00e9on) even unnavigable rivers are susceptible of being private property; but whatever doubts may exist as to the bearing of the modern law of France on this subject, it is indisputable that, before the revolution of 1789, unnavigable rivers in France were universally held as private property, subject to certain easements and servitudes in favour of the public, and that the state did not pretend to have any right of ownership therein.\nAnd at page 81(h) he adds: It appears to me to be clear that when the King of France made grants of lands in. Canada the unnavigable rivers within the limits of the lands so granted were included in the grants.\nIt is needless however to dwell upon this point, as it is admitted both by the counsel for the seigniors and by the counsel for the Crown.\nThis principle admitted, as this eminent judge says, by all the great lawyers engaged in that case, and accepted by the thirteen judges who sat in the court as a legal axiom, would appear to me to be conclusive on the point we are considering. It is not contended, and no such contention could be successfully maintained, that the law has been changed by the Code. If the river is not floatable, as found by the trial judge (and there is no dispute as to the facts); and conceding, as stated by Meredith J., that by the King's grant the bed of the river passes to the grantee, cadit qucestio and the plaintiffs must succeed. In this view it is immaterial whether the lands in question were situated within what was called \"le Canada seigneurial\" or were granted by the King directly \"en franc et commun soccage.\" In either case the beds of the unnavigable rivers\u2014giving to the word \"navigable\" its widest and most comprehensive meaning as including floatable\u2014contained within the limits of the lands so granted were included in the grants.\nIf after fifty years this principle of French law, so accepted by this great body of jurists as settled beyond controversy, is now to be upset, I must be content to say (paraphrasing and adapting the language of Mr. Justice Girouard in Consumers Cordage Company v. Connolly[14], at page 310), that I cannot disregard the opinions of these great jurists, three of whom subsequently drafted the Quebec Code; and that if I did entertain a different view from theirs I would hesitate to express it, in view of the fact that it has within the last few months on two different occasions been re-affirmed and acted upon by the highest court of appeal in the province, composed of men specially trained in the principles of the law by which we must be guided in this case.\nThe court of appeal for the Province of Quebec in Boswell v. Denis[15], held that rivers non-navigable (non navigables et non flottables) are the property of the riparian proprietor who has the exclusive control of the same. The Chief Justice, Sir Louis LaFontaine, disposes of the question without distinguishing as to whether the lands through which the river flows were seigniorial or not, in these words:\nIt has been clearly proved that the river is neither navigable nor floatable; this being proved, the appellant has admitted, having fished in it, on the side of and opposite to the respondent's property; and by the decision of the seigniorial court it is held and decided that rivers non navigables et non flottables belong to the riparian proprietors, the judgment of the court below must, therefore, be maintained.\nThis judgment, rendered in 1859, has never been reversed, nor, so far as I have been able to find, questioned. Article 400 of the Civil Code, promulgated in 1866, is not given as new law and reproduces article 538 of the Code Napol\u00e9on. It is to be borne in mind that the Quebec Civil Code and the Code Napol\u00e9on both proceed on the general principle that all property is private, and that to this general principle, articles 400 C.C. and 538 C.N. are exceptions. Laurent, Vol. 6, no. 16, makes this so clear that I cannot resist the desire to quote what he says:\n16. Le Code Napol\u00e9on contient un chapitre sp\u00e9cial sur les biens dans leurs rapports avec ceux qui les poss\u00e8dent, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur la division des biens consid\u00e9r\u00e9s quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, car ce chapitre est le troisi\u00e8me du titre 1er. intitul\u00e9 \"De la distinction des biens.\" Or, il n'y a qu'une seule classification dans le dit chapitre; il y est question de biens appartenant \u00e0 des particuliers et de biens n'appartenant pas \u00e0 des particuliers (art. 537). La loi prend soin d'\u00e9num\u00e9rer les biens qui n'appartiennent pas \u00e0 des particuliers, ce sont les biens du domaine public et les biens communaux. Tous les autres biens sont donc propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. En d'autres termes, le domaine priv\u00e9 est \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du domaine de l'Etat et des communes, ce que la r\u00e8gle est \u00e0 \u00e9gard de l'exception. Le domaine priv\u00e9 est certes la r\u00e8gle; nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que c'est par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que le l\u00e9gislateur enl\u00e8ve une certaine partie du sol \u00e0 l'exploitation des citoyens, toujours plus active et plus profitable que celle de l'Etat. D\u00e8s qu'il n'y a pas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 publique en cause, les biens doivent rester dans le domaine des particuliers. Ce principe suff\u00eet, nous semble-t-il, pour d\u00e9cider la question. L'article 538 place dans le domaine public de l'Etat les fleuves et rivi\u00e8res navigables ou flottables. Cela implique d'abord que les cours d'eau non navigables ni flottables ne sont pas une d\u00e9pendance du domaine public; sinon les mots navigables ou flottables de l'article 538 n'auraient pas de sens. L'article 644 est con\u00e7u de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re; il porte: \"Celui dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 borde une eau courante, autre que celle qui est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e d\u00e9pendance du domaine public par l'article 538, peut s'en servir * *\" Il y a donc une distinction; les cours d'eau navigables appartiennent \u00e0 l'Etat; les cours d'eau non navigables ne lui appartiennent pas.\nThe question as to which the French text-writers and the courts were mainly divided, namely, as to whether the bed of a river, such as the Chaudi\u00e8re, was res nullius, does not seem to have ever been considered in Quebec; and it was not argued here nor decided by the judges below.\nAll the commentators of the French Code and the Cour de Cassation agree in distinguishing rivers floatable for rafts (flottables en trains) from those floatable only for loose logs (flottables \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues); and I can see no reason why the distinction which they make should not be applicable to the words used in the same connection in our Code, which is copied from the French. At the time the Quebec law was codified the word \"floatable\" had acquired a well defined and well settled meaning; and the reasonable presumption is that the well settled interpretation of the words was adopted with the words themselves by the codifiers. I have carefully examined all the cases decided before and since the Code to which my attention has been drawn, and if there are any in the Quebec court of appeal that in any way affect the holding in Boswell v. Denis[16], I have not been fortunate enough to see them. The only other case in which the question raised here was formally decided since the Code by the court of appeal is Turcotte v. Laferri\u00e8re Lumber Co.[17], and in that case Boswell v. Denis16 was followed.\nMr. Justice Boss\u00e9, in his notes, examines a great number of cases relied on by the appellant, such as Hurdman v. Thompson[18]; Tourville v. Ritchie[19]; Pierce v. McConville[20]; Laurin v. Charlemagne, etc., Lumber Co.[21]; Bell v. Corporation of Quebec[22]; McBean v. Carlisle[23], and Bourque v. Farwell[24], in several of which he himself sat, and comes to the conclusion that they are not applicable to the point raised in this appeal. All of them, except Hurdman v. Thompson18, refer to obstructions such as wharves, booms, dams and bridges which interfere with the free use of the waters of non-navigable and non-floatable streams. In Hurdman v. Thompson18, the principal question at issue was as to whether the Ottawa River, because of the natural obstacle created by the Chaudi\u00e8re Falls, was to be considered, at that point, a navigable and floatable river. In effect these cases, as also Oliva v. Boissonnault[25], and Reg. v. Patton[26], decide that there can be no interference with the rights of the public to the free use of the waters of a navigable or floatable river, including rivers floatable only for loose logs, except under legislative authority.\nIt is to be observed that Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 delivered the principal judgment in Hurdman v. Thompson[27], and Mr. Justice Larue, the trial judge in this case, delivered the judgment, which this court subsequently maintained, in the Moisie River Case (Attorney- General of Quebec v. Fraser & Adams[28]).\nIn McBean v. Carlisle[29], there is an expression of opinion by Dorion C.J. that might have some bearing on the question at issue; but that eminent judge, with characteristic reserve, added that the distinction between rivers that are floatable or navigable and those that are not was of no importance in that case, where it was not necessary to decide as to the ownership of the river, and whether or not it was private property.\nThe text-writers on the Quebec Code, Langelier and Mignault, both maintain that rivers that are floatable only for loose logs do not form part of the Crown domain and belong to the riparian owner. (2 Langelier, p. 130; 2 Mignault, p. 458.)\nIn conclusion, I must say that a careful examination of the authorities has convinced me that by the law of the Province of Quebec the plaintiffs, as owners of the soil on both sides of a stream floatable only for loose logs are owners of the soil that forms the bed of the stream, and as such are entitled to bring this action. In so holding, I do not for a moment question the right that the public have to all the advantages that a river, in its natural state, and its banks can afford to the public; and there is no difference in that respect whether the river is navigable or not, floatable or not. (Municipal Code, 868, 891; McBean v. Carlisle[30], per Dorion C.J., at page 278; Tanguay v. Price[31].)\nIt is generally admitted by the text-writers that grants made under the old seigniorial system in France conveyed special rights to the grantee in the non-navigable rivers in the lands granted. Fuzier-Herman, vbo. \"Rivi\u00e8res,\" no. 128:\nD\u00e8s avant 1898 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lit des rivi\u00e8res non navigables, d\u00e9ni\u00e9e en principe aux riverains par la majorit\u00e9 de la doctrine et de la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 1898, (v. supra no. 99) leur \u00e9tait accord\u00e9e dans des circonstances exceptionnelles; quand elle r\u00e9sultait de titres sp\u00e9ciaux constitu\u00e9s avant la mise en vigueur du code civil. Ainsi la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lit d'un cours d'eau pouvait \u00eatre valablement attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 un particulier par la concession d'un seigneur haut-justicier consentie avant 1789.\n(And see Dalloz, 1866, 1, 391.)\nI assume that if in this case it had been satisfactorily proved that the plaintiffs' lands were included within the limits of the Lauzon Seigniory, and had been conceded previous to 1854, as appears probable by the titles alleged, then there could be no doubt that the riparian proprietor by his grant would be owner of the bed of the stream; but although the well-known rule under the old French law \"nulle terre sans seigneur\" created a presumption that until a title to the contrary was produced, all lands were held under the seigniorial tenure, Wilcox v. Wilcox[32], at page 14, I do not in my view of the case deem it necessary to do more than suggest this additional reason why we should not disturb the judgment of the court of appeal.\nThe \"Seigniorial Act,\" 18 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 16, sub-sec. 9, enacts that the decision to be pronounced on each of the questions submitted to the court shall in any case thereafter to arise be held to have been a judgment in appeal \"en dernier ressort\" on the point raised on such question in a like case by other parties; and that court has, as has been pointed out, held that by the King's grant the property in the bed of a non-navigable and non-floatable stream passes to the seignior and by his concession to the censitaire. If, therefore, the River Chaudi\u00e8re, situate within what was formally called Seigniorial Canada, is not a navigable and floatable river within the meaning of article 400 C.C., and on this question of fact there are the concurrent findings of two courts, the bed of the river is declared by a final judgment, from which there is no appeal here, to have passed out of the Crown domain by the King's grant.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal has nothing to do with the improvements which a riparian proprietor can make on a river or water-course. It does not affect, either, the right which the public, in the Province of Quebec at least, has to use any river, whether navigable or floatable, or the banks thereof, for the floating and conveyance of all kinds of timber and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes, subject to certain obligations and restrictions enacted by competent authority. All these rights have been secured by several statutes to which we simply refer; 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 102; 20 Vict. ch. 40, sec. 23 (I860), c. 26, s. 2; Revised Statutes of Quebec (1888), arts. 5535, 5551; R.S.C., 1906, ch. 115.\nLikewise, it is immaterial whether the appellant has encroached upon the Chaudi\u00e8re River and its banks by piers, booms or other constructions. The principal and the only question, in this cause, is whether that river is floatable within the meaning of article 400 of the Civil Code, and consequently forms part of the domain of the Crown. If it is plaintiff's action must be dismissed, as it has not been taken by the Attorney-General who alone can represent the Crown, and no claim is made for special damage. Brown v. Gugy[33]; Bell v. City of Quebec[34]. If it is not the respondent must succeed.\nArticle 400 C.C., corresponding to article 538 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, says:\nRoads and public ways maintained by the state, navigable and floatable rivers and streams and their banks, the seashore, lands reclaimed from the sea, ports, harbours, and roadsteads and generally all those portions of territory which do not constitute private property, are considered as \"being dependencies of the Crown domain.\nNavigable and floatable rivers are also mentioned in articles 420, 425, 426, 427 and 567 C.C.\nThese rivers are called public rivers, because at common law they are subject to a servitude or easement in favour of the public to navigate or float over the same which can be interfered with only by the legislative authority. See Re Provincial Fisheries[35].\nWhat is a floatable river within the meaning of Article 400 of the Code? That is the question involved in this appeal. Respondents rely upon the old French laws. But were they ever in force in Canada?\nI agree with Mr. Justice Lavergne, who has dissented from the majority of the court, that the regulations which heretofore or now prevail in France to determine the character of a river are not suitable to this country. Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in this case starts with the proposition that, as our Code is worded like the French Code,\nles sources du droit fran\u00e7ais, comme les commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on, doivent nous servir de guides.\nThis is a very different rule from that he laid down in Hurdman v. Thompson[36]. He said in the latter case, and I quite agree with him:\nNotre ancienne l\u00e9gislation sur cette mati\u00e8re est incompl\u00e8te et assez incertaine.\nToutes deux proc\u00e9daient d'un \u00e9tat de choses enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent de celui que nous avons en ce pays.\nLoisel nous dit que les grosses rivi\u00e8res ont, pour le moins, quatorze pieds de largeur; les petites, sept; et les ruisseaux, trois et demi. Inst. liv. 2, tit. 2, r\u00e8gle 8.\nIl nous serait difficile d'appliquer au Canada une r\u00e8gle de cette nature, et l'on voit comment, le point de d\u00e9part \u00e9tant diff\u00e9rent, nous devons, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'une l\u00e9gislation pr\u00e9cise, donner relativement peu d'importance aux opinions d'auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit au sujet d'un \u00e9tat de, choses autre que celui qui nous r\u00e9git.\nFor the same reason, in the provinces governed by the English common law, and more particularly in Ontario, the judges have refused to apply the rules of that common law to several rivers and lakes of this country. The Queen v. Robertson[37], at p. 129; Re Provincial Fisheries[38], at pp. 520, 553, 555. In England, navigable or public rivers are only those where the tide is felt, but this rule does not generally prevail on the continent of America.\nThe reasons and authorities quoted by the learned dissenting judge have so convinced me of the soundness of his conclusions that I could content myself with referring to his judgment, and in fact I had prepared in a few words merely my concurrence in it; but, as there is diversity of opinion in this court and the case is important, I think it is proper that I should express my views more fully. I will, therefore, offer a few observations upon the word \"floatable\" which is to be found in article 400 of the Civil Code, and also upon the jurisprudence of France and of Quebec upon the same subject, both before and since the Quebec Code (1866).\nIt is contended that, as article 400 does not define what floatability means, we should consult the laws and decisions in force before the Code, especially the old French commentators, statutes and ordinances.\nThe ordinance of 1669, tit. 27, art. 41, for the first time provided that only rivers\nportant bateaux de leurs fonds, sans artifices et ouvrages de mains,\nform part of the Crown domain. Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, who disregarded this ordinance in the Hurdman Case[39], for want of registration, is now willing to apply the same, as, in his opinion, it merely embodies the common law existing at the time of the creation of the Superior Council. With due deference, I cannot agree to this historical proposition. On referring to Guenois, Conf\u00e9rence des Ordonnances, Vol. 3, p. 319, and following, and the collection of Isambert, Anciennes lois fran\u00e7aises, especially the ordinances of 1415, 1520, 1570, 1577 and 1583, relating to forests and streams, it will be found that the distinctions of the ordinance of 1669, arts. 43 to 46 as to floatable rivers, had no existence whatever before that time, for the simple reason that flottage was almost unknown. As Daviel remarks, Vol. I. p. 35, \"le flottage des bois\" the floating of wood is not very ancient; it was first practised in 1549 by one Jean Bouvet who, I have read elsewhere, conveyed to Paris fire wood, \"bois de chauffage\" and undoubtedly for that reason was called \"flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues\" or loose stumps. The King's declaration of the 15th July, 1572, refers in its title to \"rivi\u00e8res navigables et flottables\" but in the text only to the\ngrands fleuves et rivi\u00e8res et autres qui fluent et descendent en icelles. 14 Isambert, 252.\nIn several statutes we find what is meant by these grand rivers; they were La Seine, Loire, Garonne, Marne, Dordogne and others like them and their tributaries whether navigable or not. Edit of April, 1683; arr\u00eat du conseil, 10th August, 1694; 19 Isambert, 425; 20 id. 226. If these laws\u2014which were made applicable not only to the kingdom but also to every French possession\u2014had been registered in Quebec, our task in this case would have been an easy one. The Chaudi\u00e8re and all the tributaries of the St. Lawrence would be part of the Crown domain like that great river, larger than all the navigable rivers of France put together.\nThe ordinance of 1669, like the Civil Code, used the expressions \"navigable\" and \"floatable\" as if they meant the same thing, and say nothing of \"flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues\" But the ordinance of December, 1672, has done so, at least impliedly, by providing (ch. 1st. art. 1) and following, for the free navigation and passage of \"bateaux et trains de bois\" etc. Finally, Daviel, Vol. I., page 33, adds that an order of the Royal Council passed on the 9th November, 1694, with regard to the River Garonne \"aux lieux o\u00f9 elle est navigable par bateaux ou radeaux\" clearly indicates what the legislator meant by the words \"navigable et flottable\" This order in council is summarized by Isambert, Vol. 20, p. 232, in these words:\nArr\u00eat du conseil qui juge que ce n'est point par la force des bateaux que l'on doit juger si les rivi\u00e8res sont navigables, mais seulement par la navigation qui s'y fait, et en cons\u00e9quence ordonne que les propri\u00e9taires des \u00eeles, \u00eelots, dans l'\u00e9tendue des rivi\u00e8res navigables, tant par bateaux que par radeaux, notamment des rivi\u00e8res de Garonne et de l'Aude, aux endroits o\u00f9 elles portent bateaux ou radeaux seront, * * * etc.\nThese old laws were in force in France at the time of the promulgation of the Code Napol\u00e9on, and it was first thought that they had been repealed by the Code. By a decision of the 6th November, 1820, the French Minister of Financ\u00e9 declared that all floatable rivers without any distinction were part of the public domain and were capable of being licensed by the government for fishery purposes, but an order of the State Council, which was the competent authority to declare when a river was navigable or floatable, made on the 21st February, 1822, added that this was true only with regard to rivers floatable for rafts or radeaux, and that the rivers or ruisseaux floatable only \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues did not form part of the public domain. The same rule had already been adopted by the administration on the 38 pluviose, an XIII. and last by the legislature on the 15th April, 1829, when providing for river fisheries.\nWe can easily conceive that the jurisprudence of the French courts, commentators and text writers has been altogether influenced by the text of these enactments, and I cannot conceive that they can be considered as safe guides in Lower Canada. Laurent, Vol. 6, n. 12, tells us that, were it not for the old laws, no distinction between floatable rivers would be made. After laying down the rule with regard to the floating of rafts, he says:\nEn est-il de m\u00eame quand le flottage se fait \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues, c'est-\u00e0-dire lorsque les rivi\u00e8res flottent du bois b\u00fbche \u00e0 b\u00fbche? Si l'on s'en tenait au texte du code, il faudrait r\u00e9pondre affirmativement; en effet, l'article 538 n\u00e9 distingue pas les deux esp\u00e8ces de frottage; or, d\u00e8s qu'une rivi\u00e8re flotte du bois, elle est flottable. L'administration a soutenu cette opinion en France, mais ses pr\u00e9tentions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par le conseil d'\u00e9tat, et la jurisprudence des tribunaux ainsi que la doctrine se sont prononc\u00e9es dans le m\u00eame sens. L'opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale se fonde sur la tradition.\nThen Laurent speaks of the\nchaos d'opinions et dans la doctrine et dans la jurisprudence\nwith regard to rivers which are neither navigable nor floatable. Sir L. H. LaFontaine, in his admirable opinion in the Seigniorial Court, page 3325 of the report, has enumerated five different systems having each quite an array of supporters, to which many more can be added, who came to light since the learned judge delivered his judgment in 1856. This controversy does not interest us, for it is a well settled rule with us that under the Code those rivers are the property of the riparian proprietors to the middle of the stream. Laurent concludes by observing that more uniformity of opinion would exist\nsi l'on s'attachait au texte et \u00e0 l'esprit de la loi au lieu de se laisser influencer par l'ancien droit.\nIf it be true that the modern French classification of rivers is founded merely upon tradition, what is to be said of the Quebec jurisprudence? Here we have no old laws. The ordinances passed before the creation of the Superior Council, in 1663, speak only of navigable rivers, without defining what they were and without requiring that the floatable ones should be \"portant radeaux de leurs fonds\"; this was done only afterwards. Not a line, not even a word can be found in the Edits et Ordonnances in force in La Nouvelle France, after 1663, respecting rivers, either in the Royal Edits and Declarations or the ordonnances et arr\u00eats of the Council or the decisions; of the intendants, or in the Jugements et D\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur, recently published, or in Perrault's \"Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents\" Not one of the laws above mentioned was registered by the Council or is even alluded to anywhere. The enactment of the ordonnance of 1669 was in this respect new law which all the commentators invoke in support of their doctrine. In Canada, till the promulgation of the Civil Code in 1866, there was, therefore, no written law respecting the classification, ownership or regulation of rivers. Perhaps the policy of the then French Government was the same as today; for at least three-quarters of a century in all the French colonies, all rivers without distinction form part of the public domain.\nFew cases came before the courts of Lower Canada, and it is curious to see how they were dealt with. For a period extending from the time of the cession until 1810, we have no report of the decisions of our courts. In 1811, Pyke's reports of one term of the King's Bench, during that year, were published and later on appeared the Revue de L\u00e9gislation by Leli\u00e8vre et Angers, in three volumes covering the years from 1845 to 1847, and also a digest of cases from 1807 to 1822; and it is a remarkable fact that not a single case concerning rivers is reported. It may safely be said that the first river cases will be found in Stuart's Reports, in one volume, published in 1834-35 and were decided at different periods from 1810 to 1835.\nThe first is Fournier v. Oliva[40], decided in 1830. Held in appeal that the banks of navigable rivers belong to the riparian proprietor, subject to a servitude in favour of the public for all purposes of public utility. Reid C.J., said:\nBy the Roman law, the banks of navigable rivers belonged to the proprietors of the lands adjoining such rivers; and previous to the ordinance of 1669, no statutory law in France, to the contrary, could be found.\nIf this decision truly states the old law of Lower Canada, it is evident that our Code, article 400, has not adopted it.\nIn Oliva v. Boissonnault[41], decided in appeal in 1833, at page 564, Chief Justice Reid says:\nThe waters of all rivers, whether navigable or not navigable, being matters of public benefit and public interest, are vested in the Crown.\nIn the case of St. Louis v. St. Louis[42], decided in 1834, and in 1841 by the Privy Council[43], the question of flottage is not even alluded to and for that reason it is of no value for the determination of this appeal.\nIn Oliva v. Boissonnault41, in 1834, at page 525, Sewell C.J. said:\nIt may, I think, be received as a general principle, that the public have a right to all the advantages, suited to public purposes, which the natural state of a river affords, and that no change can be effected in the state and condition of a river, which does afford such advantages, unless some greater degree of convenience is thereby obtained for the public. Here the learned judge relies upon an English case, that of Lord Grosvenor reported in Starkie, Vol. 2[44]. Then the learned Chief Justice continues:\nAccordingly, in the law of France, navigable rivers have always been regarded as public highways and as such dependencies of the public domain; and floatable rivers (rivi\u00e8res flottables, as they are there termed) have been viewed in the same light. . In every river which is navigable for boats or larger vessels, and in every river which is floatable, that is capable of floating logs or rafts, the public, as in England and in America, have an easement or legal servitude. * * * The evidence in this case may not be sufficient to shew that the River St. Thomas is a rivi\u00e8re navigable. But the fact that the logs floated down the stream from the plaintiff's land to the defendant's and were there stopped in their progress towards the St. Lawrence by the boom which the latter has constructed, proves it to be a rivi\u00e8re flottable, and judgment, therefore, must be entered up for the plaintiff.\nHere the learned judge refers to l'ordonnance of 1669. This decision shews that before the Code the highest court of Lower Canada gave to the word \"floatable\" its widest sense.\nNext comes the decision of the Seigniorial Court rendered in 1856, which by the Seigniorial Act, 18 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 9, was declared to be final and binding. At pages 71a and 131a, the court held that \"rivi\u00e8res, ruisseaux et autres eaux courants\" not navigable or floatable, are the property of the seigniors and not part of the public domain. But nowhere does the court undertake to define what is navigable or what is floatable. Likewise, Chief Justice LaFontaine, who seems to have been the leading spirit of that court, says that those rivers are private property, without, however, giving any definition whatever (p. 3316).\nI am not aware of any decision supporting the distinction between floatable \u00e0 huches perdues or by rafts, except Boswell v. Denis[45], decided in 1859 by LaFontaine C.J., Aylwin, Duval, Meredith and Mondelet JJ. The report is very meagre, the opinion of the Chief Justice covering only six or seven lines. He refers us to the decision of the Seigniorial Court. But that court never defined what floatable means. None of the judges even mentioned that the Jacques Cartier River, in question in the case, was only floatable \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues. In this respect, we have only the word of the reporter, who says that Mr. Justice Chabot, who had rendered the judgment in the court below, had clearly found that that river was in that condition. Mr. Justice Aylwin, one of the ablest judges that adorned the bench of Lower Canada, dissented, observing that\nthe judgment of the court below is an exceedingly dangerous one by declaring such a river as the Jacques Cartier non flottable and vesting the property of it in the seignior or riparian proprietor.\nThese decisions form the whole jurisprudence of Quebec before the Code, with the exception of a few which were rendered by a single judge in the Superior Court, and are all in the sense of Oliva v. Boissonnault[46]. See Chapman v. Clark[47], in 1858, per Short J; Joly v. Gagnon[48], in 1859, Chabot J.; and I cannot understand that it can be said that it is favourable to the respondents' contention.\nThe decisions under the Code are numerous and generally do not agree with Boswell v. Denis[49]. They have been pronounced in every court, from the Superior Court to the court of review and the court of appeal. I will merely indicate those rendered by a single judge in the Superior Court. First, B\u00e9liveau v. Levasseur[50], in 1863, Pollette J.; Laurin v. Charlemagne & Lake Ouareau Lumber Co.[51], in 1899, de Lorimier J., both in favour of the appellant's con tention; and Geoffray v. Beausoleil[52], in 1886, Papineau J., against it.\nI find three decisions in review, one, and the first, of no value, and the other two in favour of the appellant. The first is Kerr v. Laberge[53], decided by Routhier J. in 1886, and confirmed in review by Caron, Andrews and Larue JJ. The report is very short; in fact we have only the head-notes, one of them being that the banks of navigable rivers belong to the riparian proprietors, subject to a certain servitude of passage, as was decided in the case of Fournier v. Oliva[54], which is quoted as an authority. This decision is clearly against article 400 of the Civil Code and Morin v. Lef\u00e8vre[55].\nThe two decisions in favour of the appellant are Bourque v. Farwell[56], in 1871, Berthelot, Mackay and Beaudry J J., and Atkinson v. Couture[57], in 1892, Casault, Routhier and Caron JJ. In the first case, Short J. had decided in the first court, at Sherbrooke, that a branch of the River Nicolet was a floatable river for logs, \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues, \"and, therefore, a highway appertaining to the public domain,\" In review this judgment was confirmed, the court holding\nthat a river floatable only at a certain season of the year comes under the general rule.\nWe are now coming to the jurisprudence of the court of appeal. The first case is King v. Ouellet[58], in 1885, Dorion C.J., Monk, Tessier, Cross and Baby JJ., in which the question of ownership of a floatable river for loose logs was not discussed, not even raised. The whole decision turned upon a question of negligence. However, there is a dictum of the court that such a river is a private river, which is referred to in Ward v. Township of Grenville[59], another case where the question was not involved.\nIn the cases of Pierce v. McConville[60], Mr. Justice deLorimier has decided that floatable rivers at all times, or at certain periods only, were part of the public domain, and this decision was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Review, in 1899, and is quoted with approbation by Mr. Justice Ouimet, speaking for the court of appeal[61]. It was remarkable that the river in this case was one floatable only for loose logs.\nFinally, there is the case of Hurdman V. Thompson[62], which is not of much importance here, except on one point, namely, that a river may be navigable or floatable notwithstanding that its course is interrupted in many places by falls or rapids. It may not be without interest to note that the learned judges were of opinion that the enactment of the ordinance of 1669, quoted above, declaring navigable rivers only those\nportant bateaux de leurs fonds, sans artifices ni ouvrages des mains,\nwas new law.\nIt cannot be asserted that the jurisprudence in Quebec is so uniformly in favour of the respondent that it is almost binding upon us, according to the rules laid down by Rivi\u00e8re, Jurisprudence de la Cour de Cassation, p. 64 and following, where the whole subject of the authority of arr\u00eats is discussed. I believe it is quite the other way. But suppose there was any doubt as to that point, which I do not entertain, I think that article 400 of the Civil Code contains rules on the subject complete in themselves which are binding upon us, and cannot be controlled by the pre-existing laws. This is the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Abbott v. Fraser[63], in 1874. That article makes no distinction whatever between the two kinds of floatable rivers, and I do not see why we should make any. If that was the old law, it has evidently been repealed by implication. I wish to base my conclusion upon that article of the Code and nothing else.\nFloatable must mean something different from navigable, for if it means the same thing, then one of the two words is unnecessary. Navigable is intended to refer to craft that require the direction of man and carry a crew. It comprises rafts as well as vessels, because rafts need the management of men on board. They float, it is true, but every vessel does. The words \"floatable\" and \"navigable\" are coupled together to provide for two distinct situations, first the floating of vessels and rafts, which is navigation; and second the floating of loose logs and pieces of timber, which is flottage, and is generally done in this country by gangs of men called \"drivers\"; otherwise the word \"floatable\" would have no sense. Daviel, Vol. I., p. 32, says: Dans l'acceptation la plus \u00e9tendue du mot, on comprend parmi les rivi\u00e8res navigables celles qui sont flottables en trains, parce que c'est l\u00e0 une esp\u00e8ce de navigation. Les trains se meuvent \u00e0 l'aide de moyens analogues \u00e0 ceux qu'emploient les bateaux, le halage, la voile, la rame, le gouvernail, et c'est ainsi que s'exprimaient les anciennes ordonnances.\nI do not mean to say that every floatable river is a public river and part of the Crown domain. I would put a limit, and that limit would be where public utility ceases. Any floatable river to which the public cannot have and has not any access is a private river. As Chief Justice Dorion properly remarks in the case of Bell v. Corporation of Quebec[64], it is not so much the volume of water that the river carries as the fact that its course is devoted to the public service, which gives it its legal character. This rule was also adopted by the Privy Council in the case of Bell v. Corporation of Quebec [65], and by our court in Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser & Adams[66]. The Privy Council adds:\nThe French authorities evidently point to the possibility, at least, of the use of the river for transport in some practical and profitable way as the test of navigability.\nThis principle is also to be found in the arr\u00eat of the State Council of France of the 9th November, 1694, quoted above, that it is not by reason of the force of the boats that we must decide whether a river is navigable or not, but only by the navigation which is therein carried on. I think the same principle should be applied to floatable rivers.\nWhether a river is floatable or not is now a question of law and fact, but when the law will be settled, it will only be a question of fact. The Chaudi\u00e8re River is admittedly one which the public can make use of, and has done so from time immemorial, running through a thickly populated country. It is more than 100 miles long, at many places several arpents wide, and during months, and at different seasons, is used to take down thousands, and it may be said millions, of logs and pieces of timber floating loosely, belonging to a large number of inhabitants, which supply a quantity of saw mills and others built along the shores of that river, some of the logs reaching even the River St. Lawrence below the property of the respondent, as Mr. H. M. Price testifies. Bouchette, in his Topography of Lower Canada, calls it a river of \"considerable magnitude.\" The evidence shews that it is the grand artery of the lumber trade in that vast region of the country.\nI have only one word to add, and that is with regard to the opinion of Canadian text-writers, or what is called \"la doctrine.\" It can hardly be said that authors are numerous enough in this country to form what may be called public legal opinion, by writing books or articles in reviews. Leading lawyers seldom find the time necessary to write a law book. I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of our Chief Justice, and I have noticed that he relies upon the opinion of two of our Quebec text-writers. I am happy to say that, together with Mr. Beauchamp, they are recognized by all to have rendered great service to both the bench and the bar, but text-books of Canadian authors have rarely, if ever, received such a distinction in this court. I have seen several Chief Justices refuse to take any note of them, although for my part\u2014and I am very glad to have this opportunity to put my views on record\u2014I do not see why they should not be cited, especially in Quebec cases, just as we quote the French commentators, dead or living. I have always expressed the view that we ought to get light wherever we can find it, either in the decisions of the courts or in the text-books, or reports of the framers of the Code, or even Parliamentary debates, a course which was denied during this and previous terms. This ruling is strictly in accordance with the practice prevailing in England, and to a limited extent in the United States, although in some cases we see quoted such standard books as those of Bacon, Coke, Hale, Story, Kent, and other jurists of equal eminence. Under the English system, decisions of courts alone constitute the authorities and a counsel or judge is expected to rely upon them alone, if they are of sufficient weight and can be supported by reason. In France and Quebec, on the contrary, a series of uniform decisions, approved by the commentators or la doctrine, forms what may be termed the jurisprudence of France, and on this subject I refer to an interesting dissertation by Rivi\u00e8re already alluded to. I thought, therefore, it was my duty to read what these Canadian law-writers said on the point under consideration, although in view of the decisions of the Quebec courts it can hardly be expected that their doctrine will be of much assistance.\nMr. Langelier (now Chief Justice of the Superior Court), who wrote his commentaries many years ago, as he tells us, for the students at Laval University, supports the case presented by the respondents. He does not cite, much less review, the decisions, observing in his preface that they are to be found in Beauchamp. And when we read the following passage as to what constitutes a navigable river, I do not think it is necessary to trouble ourselves about his opinion as to flottage \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues:\nIl ne suffit pas, pour qu'une rivi\u00e8re soit navigable, qu'on puisse y naviguer avec n'importe quelle sorte d'embarcation, par exemple, avec un canot ou une chaloupe, car alors toutes les rivi\u00e8res, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, seraient navigables. Mais il faut qu'on puisse y naviguer avec des bateaux suffisamment grands pour qu'ils puissent servir au transport des passagers ou des marchandises.\nMr. Mignault, K.C., of Montreal, has expressed no opinion. The passage cited is not his own, but that of Mourlon, a French commentator, influenced, like all French jurists, by the old and the new French ordonnances and regulations. Mr. Mignault is only the Canadian annotator of Mourlon, and a foot note at the same page (458) gives us some idea of his opinion on the subject. Referring to the distinction between floatable rivers for rafts and loose logs, he says that it is based upon the order of the State Council of the 21st February, 1822, and the law of the 15th April, 1829, art. 1. He merely adds to that:\nNous trouvons un arr\u00eat conforme \u00e0 cette doctrine dans le jugement de la cour d'appel dans la cause de Boswell v. Denis[67].\nI have therefore come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed and the action and injunction dismissed with costs before all the courts.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question to be determined in this case was whether the rivers of Quebec which are floatable for loose logs only, in manner as used by lumbermen of the province in their business but not otherwise navigable, are \"dependencies of the Crown domain\" within the meaning of article 400 of the Civil Code of Quebec. The words used in the article are \"navigable and floatable rivers and streams and their banks\" and the question came down to this:\u2014Whether the use of the word \"floatable\" following the word \"navigable\" and conjoined with it extended the meaning and applicability of the word \"navigable\" to rivers and streams which were not navigable in the sense in which that word had been and is judicially interpreted; or whether the term \"floatable\" should be refused any distinctive meaning, and construed as synonymous with navigable.\nUpon the determination of this question, depended the legal question of the ownership of the beds of the rivers which were not navigable but were floatable for loose logs.\nIf the word \"floatable\" was given the broader construction, namely, that it covered and included rivers and streams which were floatable only for loose logs in the manner used for the purpose of their business by lumbermen, then the river must be considered as being a dependency of the Crown domain. If, on the contrary, the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec at the time of the enactment of the Civil Code had determined that this was not the true construction of the word, but that it meant when used in conjunction with rivers and streams, those rivers and streams only which were floatable for rafts of logs, or, in other words, rivers that were \"navigable for commercial purposes\" only and did not include rivers capable of floating loose logs only, though capable of doing that. for lumbering and commercial purposes, then the beds and banks of these latter rivers were the property of the river proprietors on each side ad medium filum aqu\u0153 There is much diversity of opinion upon the point in this court, and the Court of King's Bench itself was not unanimous.\nBut, after giving the different opinions and arguments my best consideration, I have concluded with some hesitation to concur with the Chief Justice and not to allow the appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014For the reasons assigned in Mr. Justice Lavergne's dissenting judgment in the court below, I think this appeal should be allowed. I may be permitted to adopt it entirely, as I do, and yet to add a few words, in line with the reasoning it contains.\nInasmuch as the report of the case of Boswell v. Denis[68] shews, in its statement of facts, that the stream there in question had never been till then but once tested as to its floatability and that proving financially unsuccessful further trial was abandoned, and the learned trial judge having found it, notwithstanding this, floatable \u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues, we are left to conjecture whether the majority of the court proceeded on the actual facts; or the trial judge's finding by way of legal interpretation of facts; or disagreed with his law on these facts.\nMeasuring floatability by its general public utility, I should have said, and I think it possible the learned judges whose opinions prevailed meant, that on the facts as there presented the stream was not floatable in any legal sense; and, therefore, I treat that case as quite consistent with the earlier cases and the view of many learned judges in later cases. Nor can the adjudication of the special court passing on the rights of the seigniors in regard to navigable or non-navigable or non-floatable streams help us here.\nThe title here is not shewn by direct evidence to be derived from any such seigneurial right as these judgments upheld.\nAnd, as my brother Girouard remarks, the judgments and the opinions of the learned judges referred only to the test of floatability, without saying or in any way indicating what the quality of that float-ability was which they so sparingly refer to.\nWere we to go beyond the direct evidence and rely on history, as one of the learned judges below does, and respondents' factum does, it would appear that respondents' title to the bed of the stream was doubly uncertain. The seigneurie, including the river, having become vested in the Crown about sixty years ago, there is nothing to shew that the Crown again parted with the river or its bed.\nAll we are shewn is that respondents presented a title that shews later conveyances (subsequent to such re-vesting) to it, of land on each side of the river by somebody, and that, after receiving the same, it presumed to erect a dam across the river, more than a year and a day before this action.\nThe conveyances are of lots set out by their boundary descriptions, of which the river appears, in part, to be a boundary, and by their lot number, on a cadastral plan referred to. Whether the conveyance includes more or not depends on the meaning of a clause that needs to be explained or joined to something not apparent.\nThis sort of description is not as satisfactory, as one would like to have to rely upon, for the application of the ad filum aqu\u0153 rule that carries a riparian title to the middle thread of the stream. Unless respondents can rest upon this rule they have no title.\nThen the assertion of title by a possession, affected only by raising the water by a dam somewhere below, is a possession for a year and a day, which does not help as clearly as one might like.\nI do not try to solve the questions arising out of either of these features of weakness in the respondents' title to the bed of the river. They were stoutly relied on by the appellant and claimed by him to be fatal to the respondents' case. Solution is needless from my point of view. I merely note them and pass on to sky that this rule of ownership of land on either side of a stream carrying title ad filum aqu\u0153 will not in any case apply to any conveyance of land on either side of a stream which is either navigable or floatable and, hence, one of the dependencies of the Crown domain, unless that domain has been expressly granted by the Crown.\nWe are thus face to face with the question of whether or not this river is of either kind.\nIn other words, feel I am, after much reading of authorities and the consideration of innumerable references, on the part of counsel and courts below, as well as of the learned Chief Justice here, and my brother Girouard here (all of which I have found most interesting), driven to and thus bound to find the meaning of the three words \"navigable and floatable\" in article 400 of the Code.\nI have not found anything that requires me, as a matter of law, resting on canonical rules of construction or otherwise, to put upon these words, used as they are in the connection in which they appear and in relation to the past history of the rights and duties they are designed to confirm and declare, anything but their plain and ordinary meaning.\nThat meaning includes a capacity to float logs \"\u00e0 b\u00fbches perdues\" in a way to be serviceable as a public utility by the well known methods this river has served so long.\nThe absolute ownership of a private river that the alternative construction we are asked to place on those words implies, might deprive many of the right to float logs in a way so highly conducive to the public good.\nWe are told in argument, and I have observed it assumed in reported cases as a matter of course (and apparently assumed to exist quite independently of existing statutory provisions therefor), that the ownership of a private river was subject to such a public right of floatage. On what does it rest?\nIs it supposed that the law creating such a modern right and imposing it on what had long before become private property in streams in France, had such an origin and such a character as to be as of course transferred to every French colony?\nI am not concerned here to solve the problems thus suggested. I present them merely for consideration and to introduce what I am quite unable to understand in regard to respondents' view; that is this: Why, if it existed at the time of the codification and rested on some well known fundamental law that governed the whole of Quebec, was it not (if a servitude in favour of timbered estates, up-stream, for example) declared in the Code that so carefully and minutely provides for so very many servitudes of minor import? Why is it not defined and set forth anywhere else and traced to a source of custom or concession? Why is it, even if not an ordinary servitude, but borrowed as some have said from the Roman law, left undefined?\nAgain, when providing for the many conditions and rights springing out of the action of rivers, such as accession in one way or another, or avulsion, was this condition of things left so completely unprovided for? So much ignored?\nCan these questions be answered in any way but one? And is that one not simply this; that the word \"floatable\" in the many places used in the Code meant and was intended by the codifiers to mean either by rafts or loose logs. Practically every ordinary right of men to use, and ordinary use, of a river is thereby and by other provisions, covered or protected. In the converse way of dealing with the matter, I doubt it.\nMaclennan J.\u2014The only arguable question in this appeal appears to me to arise upon article 400 of the Civil Code, and that is, whether the River Chaudi\u00e8re, where it flows past the respondents' property, is floatable within the meaning of that article, and so is, with its banks, the property of the Crown, and not of the respondents as riparian proprietors.\nThe language of the article is that \"navigable and floatable rivers and streams and their banks\" are considered as being dependencies of the Crown.\nIt is admitted that the Chaudi\u00e8re is not navigable within the meaning of the article, and the contention is that it is floatable, because, during times of high water, saw-logs in very great quantities are floated down to be converted into lumber at different mills along its course.\nIf the word \"floatable\" is construed in an absolute unqualified sense, it must be admitted that this is a floatable river. But, if so construed, then every river and stream, no matter how insignificant or turbulent, would be within the article, and the defining words would be unnecessary. This extreme construction of this article was not contended for, but it was insisted for the appellant that the river was within the article because of its capability of floating loose logs, as above mentioned.\nThe respondents, on the other hand, contend that the judgment is right in holding that the floatability intended by the article is of a much higher quality, and that a stream is floatable within the meaning of the article only when it is capable of floating logs in rafts or cribs, and not merely loose logs.\nIt is agreed that mere floatability will not do. Some line must be drawn, and the question is, where it is to be.\nIf this article were a new law, and to be construed for the first time, different minds might construe it in different ways, and some might well construe it as contended for by the appellant. But it is not a new law, and was not a new law when the Code was framed and confirmed by the legislature. It was inserted in the Code as an expression of what had always been the law of Lower Canada, derived from Prance, and it is identical with the article in the Code Napol\u00e9on.\nThis being so, we may not give to the words used the construction which it may seem to us, at the present time, they ought to receive, but must endeavour to ascertain what was the settled law of Quebec, before the enactment of the Code, and which the article was intended to express.\nThat being so, the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice, in his notes, and the authorities cited by him have convinced me that the line is properly drawn in the judgment appealed from so as to exclude rivers and streams floatable only for loose logs from being dependencies of the Crown.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lane & Cantin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Drouin, Pelletier, Baillargeon & St. Laurent.\n[1] Q.R. 16 K.B. 48.\n[2] Q.R. 28 S.C. 157.\n[3] 33 Can.

Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff, Evelyn Chisholm, was left a widow with a young daughter. Her husband had been during the coverture entirely dependent on his father and she was left without any means of support. Her father-in-law, the defendant, offered to educate the child in a convent in Halifax and Montreal, to make provision for her when her education was completed and to give the plaintiff an allowance of $500 a year, but insisted on being appointed her legal guardian. After resisting for some time the plaintiff consented and the arrangement was carried out. The allowance was paid to the plaintiff for some years and then withheld whereupon she brought an action for the arrears. Several defences were pleaded, among others, want of consideration and that the alleged contract was against public policy, but the only one dealt with by the courts was that the transaction amounted to a sale of the custody of her child by the plaintiff, which was against public policy. The trial judge gave effect to this defence and dismissed the action. His judgment was reversed by the full court and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellant.\nHarris K.C. for the respondent.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellant. It is against public policy for a parent to surrender the natural rights and duties of guardianship over his child for a pecuniary consideration. Vansittart v. Vansittart[1]; Hope v. Hope[2]; Humphrys v. Polak[3].\nThe respondents rely on Roberts v. Hall[4], which is contrary to the decisions of the courts in England.\nHarris K.C. for the respondent. If the arrangement has mainly in view the benefit of the child the allowance to the mother will not make it illegal. Roberts v. Hall4; Enders v. \u00c8nders[5].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appointment of the appellant as guardian was made by the court in the exercise of its undoubted chancery jurisdiction on the application of the respondent, an application which the Nova Scotia statute authorized her to make. There is no doubt that the court could, on cause shewn, set aside the appointment, but I cannot understand how the appellant could succeed in these proceedings in obtaining a declaration to the effect that an appointment made by the court was void as against public policy. I can find nothing in the agreement itself or in its surrounding circumstances as brought out by the evidence to justify the contention that the family agreement which is attacked was only a scheme to benefit the mother, or that she had any interest which conflicted or could be in conflict with that of her child. On the contrary, I believe that in contemplation of all the parties the contract had exclusively in view the benefit of the infant. There were, as pointed out by my brother Davies, many reasons why an arrangement of this kind should be entered into, and I agree entirely in the conclusions he has reached.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiff, the widow of the only son of the defendant, to recover from the latter payment of an overdue instalment of an annuity agreed to be paid by him to her while she was self-dependent and defendant was able to pay it.\nThe defence set up was that the only consideration for the payment of the annuity to the plaintiff was the surrender by the mother to the grandfather of the control of the person and education of the child and of the mother's rights and duties to the child, and that such consideration was against public policy and void.\nThe learned trial judge after the hearing thinking himself bound by the case of Humphrys v. Polak[6], sustained this defence and dismissed the action, but on further consideration as a member of the court of appeal to which the case had been carried agreed with the rest of the court in allowing the appeal and directing judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of the overdue annuity.\nFrom this latter judgment this appeal was taken to this court, and while reliance was placed upon the case of Humphrys v. Polak6 referred to, it was strongly pressed upon us that the only consideration for the payment of the annuity to the widow was the agreement by her to the appointment of the grandfather as guardian of the child and that such a consideration was bad and a contravention of public policy as involving a necessary conflict between her interest and her duty as the child's maternal guardian.\nI fully agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Russell, speaking for the whole court, that the transaction attempted to be, at any rate partially, impeached in this case was considering the relationship, ages and means of the several parties to it \"the most natural and commendable proceeding that could be thought of in the interests of the child\/' and that the guardianship of the child which was insisted upon by the grandfather was \"desired merely as a guarantee that the child would finish her education at the convent.\" I also agree with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the case of Humphrys v. Polak6, before referred to, has little or no bearing upon the only point to be considered in this case.\nIt must be always borne in mind that the contract or agreement sought to be avoided in part by the defendant here was a family arrangement and one agreed to be, on the whole, of a most natural and commendable kind. On the one hand we have a grand- father, stated to be a wealthy man, and on the other an only child of his only son who was dead and whose widow, the plaintiff, was in delicate health and without any means of support for herself and child except her own earnings. Everything that her deceased husband had left was included in the sum of $500 realized from the sale of his furniture. She herself, after her husband's death, had gone to her people in the United States taking, of course, her young child, then not a year old, and was living with her parents. They were all Roman Catholics', and the grandfather was very desirous that his only grandchild should be educated in a convent somewhere in Canada. The daughter-in-law, as can be gathered from the correspondence, contemplated going to Boston as soon as her health permitted to study nursing. She\nhoped to make a good nurse, work hard and give poor Will's little girl a good education.\nNow it was not a good education such as is generally understood in Boston, that is a good public school education, that the grandfather desired for his grandchild. He wanted her to have such an education and training as is imparted in the convents of Halifax and Montreal, of which he knew something and which included a religious education in that branch of the Christian religion to which he belonged.\nFrom the evidence it appeared that at and from the time of his marriage till his death the defendant's son was an invalid and \"absolutely dependent on his father.\" The grandfather recognized his moral responsibility towards his grandchild and was eager and anxious to discharge it, but not unnaturally desired that so soon as the child was old enough to enter the convent as a boarder, mother and child should come to Canada and place the child in one of the convents named by him\nand allow her to remain there until she had finished her education.\nIn his letter which forms the basis of the contract he goes on to say:\nAnd after you place her in either convent, I will allow yourself $500.00 per annum paid quarterly in advance so long as I can do so whilst you are self-dependent. If you think Ruth is too young to be placed in a convent now, you can keep her where she is for a while, but I require that she will be placed in either convent not later than the first of September, 1898, where she is to remain until her education is finished. I will pay all her necessary bills for her education at either convent until she has finished her education, and after she has finished her education, I will allow her a sum yearly to keep her respectably until she is of age, and then I will make a suitable provision for her, but for all this I require to be appointed her guardian, as a guarantee that her education shall be continued in the convent until she has finished it; you see I have no desire to part you from your child, as you can live in either place with her, or in any other place you may wish. I merely wish to do what I consider is for her welfare; she will be taken care of in a convent, as well as you can take care of her. When you were sick some one else had to take care of her, and if you go to Boston you will have to leave her behind you for some one else to take care of her.\nNow it seems to me to be plain that this family arrangement proposed and subsequently carried out involved the coming of mother and child to Canada and the education of the latter in a selected convent, the right of the mother to accompany and remain in the same city where the child was placed and where she could during the convent vacations look after the child and expend for its benefit the allowance agreed to be paid by the grandfather \"to keep her respectably until she was of age.\" So far from separating mother and child the letter clearly contemplated their being together.\nYou see (he says) I have no desire to part you from your child as you can live in either place with her or in any other place you may wish\" * * * \"For all this (he continues) I require to be appointed her guardian as a guarantee that her education shall be continued in the convent until she has finished it.\"\nThe arrangement contemplated, as I say, the abandonment of the project at one time entertained by the mother of studying nursing in Boston so as to enable her to maintain and educate the child there and instead the maintenance and education of the child in a named religious faith and in a named convent in Canada with the mother's presence near the child so as to enable her to discharge the many parental duties in vacation as well as in term which are required by a child in a convent at a mother's hands. Parental pride seemed to have had naturally a strong controlling influence with the grandfather in suggesting the family arrangement now sought in part to be avoided.\nFor my part I can see nothing in that family arrangement to condemn and very much entirely to commend. The substantial motive prompting the grandfather's action was the obtaining of a legal guardianship in himself which should be a guarantee of the maintenance of a system of maintaining and educating his grandchild, mixed with that was the parental pride which moved him to provide for his daughter-in-law's support and avoid the possible scandal of the widow of the only son of a rich man being compelled to resort possibly to some menial employment for her support which would entail separation from the child. The mother in consequence of the arrangement changes her residence from one country to another, abandons her contemplated study of nursing, forgoes the right she would otherwise have to the earnings of the child when and during the time the latter should become capable of earning, satisfies the natural parental pride of the defendant by ensuring alike the maintenance of the mother and the maintenance and education of the child in a manner consistent with their relations to a wealthy grandfather, and this without any surrender of the natural duties owing from the mother to her child beyond those involved in the transference to the grandfather of the legal guardianship under the Nova Scotia statute.\nIf all these family arrangements were indeed a mere cloak to hide and cover up an improper attempt to contravene the policy of the law, as by a natural guardian selling her right as such to another for a consideration, or a mother formally abdicating alike her rights over and her duties towards her child for a personal benefit to herself the argument against the validity of the arrangement so far as it so attempted to contravene such policy would be irresistible.\nOnly a feeble attempt was made to suggest such a state of matters here and from what I have already said it will be seen that in my opinion the basis of the arrangement as a whole was one bona fide for the benefit of the child which not improperly involved, considering the extreme youth of the child and under the circumstances of the case, provision for the maintenance of the widow.\nThe facts shew that for years the arrangement continued to be loyally carried out by both parties and there is nothing on the face of the record or suggested to us why it should now be declared invalid. Such a declaration would be most unjust to the widow as she could not by any possibility now be placed in the position she occupied with respect to earning her own living by nursing or otherwise, and it seems to me would also be unjust to the child.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014However commendable the intentions of the parties to the arrangement out of which this action has arisen the arrangement is wanting in the necessary legal form or substance to constitute a contract upon which to found an action such as this.\nThe simple contract it evinces requires for its support a consideration moving from the person seeking to enforce the promise.\nThe only consideration moving from the respondent to induce the appellant to make the promise relied upon was that which he so tersely put (before this poor mother who shrank so long as she could from yielding to the hard necessity) of surrendering the custody of her child, and in order to accomplish that, of petitioning the probate court to appoint him alone as guardian.\nIf the common law right of custody did not confer on a mother ample and efficacious authority in regard to the custody of her fatherless child the statute certainly did. R.S.N.S. ch. 115, sec. 4, is as follows:\nOn the death of the father of an infant the mother if surviving shall be the guardian of the infant, either alone, when no guardian has been appointed, or jointly with any guardian appointed by the father.\nI can find no power in that court to substitute another for this statutory guardian so long as she lives. Section 5 enacts that in default of a guardian being appointed by father or mother or such an appointee refusing to act the court may appoint a guardian.\n(2) And if the infant is fourteen the court shall appoint his nominee.\n(3) But if under that age the executor or administrator of an estate the child is interested in or next of kin may apply and court appoint.\nNone of these seem applicable, assuming, what I gravely doubt, that the court has such power of substitution during the lifetime of the mother, especially where no estate existed and no fault to be found with the character of the mother; what was her legal position or what were her duties in that respect?\nTrue it was urged she had herself a power of appointment under the statute, but that also is matter of the gravest doubt.\nBut assume it exists, what again is her position? What were her duties in exercising such power?\nIn making such an appointment, or bringing about such an appointment, or taking any part whatsoever in its creation, the mother as statutory guardian must be taken to be acting in discharge of her legal duty, and cannot rid herself of the obligation to discharge such duty cast upon her.\nShe has no more right to sell the guardianship of her child than she has to sell her child. The law has been so modified by statute in Nova Scotia as to render inapplicable some of the legal propositions contained in cases cited to us.\nThe point of view has been shifted a bit. The underlying principle of the cases remains untouched. A consideration consisting only in the discharge of such a duty is no consideration in law upon which to found an obligatory promise and claim an actionable breach thereof.\nIt seems to me idle to try and conjure up some other consideration than that so plainly written on the face of the correspondence in evidence, which forms such contract as there is.\nIt is not a case where the real consideration was doubtful, where it had to be found in the acts of the parties, and inferences had to be drawn, which might trace it out in one implication, rather than another, and if more than one existed (one being illegal but clearly severable) there might yet be found room to attribute the promise to some valid consideration, rather than impute an intention to violate public policy or morality.\nIn the alternative put before us there is either no consideration or an illegal consideration.\nThe substitution of the appellant for the respondent was all he valued.\nIt involved and carried with it all else, including the many things suggested by his counsel in argument, as possible considerations.\nShe gave him nothing else he valued. Her change of purpose as to her course of life or place of residence or habit of conduct was not stipulated for by him in any way.\nHe cared only for one thing and that was the mastery of the custody of the child.\nHow can we attribute to such a case upon the facts presented some other form of consideration than that which he who dictated the bargain specifies?\nI do not assume that there was any gross impropriety in the arrangement, but when I am asked to find in it a necessary and legal consideration I can not do it.\nI can conceive of such an arrangement being submitted to a court empowered to pass upon it as a preliminary to its adoption and being approved of and become thereby valid. In such a case (which is not this) the court might become the keeper of the conscience of the guardian in discharging her duties where interest might lead one way and duty another. I would allow the appeal.\nMaclennan J.\u2014\u00cf concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I much regret that in this case I am unable to agree with the decision of the court below. Assuming that the Legislature of Nova Scotia has, by chapter 115, R.S.N.S., invested the mother of a child whose father is dead with the power to appoint within her lifetime a guardian of its person it is clear that the mother is intrusted with that power as a trustee for the benefit of her child; and likewise with respect to any application to the court of probate for the appointment of a guardian under the fifth section of the statute, or any such application to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to which she may be a party, the mother in relation to her child acts in a fiduciary capacity.\nNow there is a long settled principle of English law which is stated by Lord Cranworth in these words:\nNo one having duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has or can have a. personal interest conflicting or which possibly may conflict with the interest of those whom he is bound to protect. Aberdeen Railway Go. v. Blaikie[7], at p. 471\nThat principle seems to me to apply to this case and to govern the decision of it. It can be nothing to the purpose that one be satisfied in the particular case that there has been no consciousness of wrong doing, that in fact the person occupying the fiduciary position was actuated only by a sense of duty, or that the particular arrangement was in fact as well as in intention for the benefit of the cestui que trust. The rule is a rule of public policy and is\nbased on the consideration that human nature being what it is, there is danger in such circumstances of the person holding the fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than duty;\nBray v. Ford[8], at page 51 per Lord Herschell; therefore\nIt applies equally even though it be shewn that no advantage has been taken. The rule is made general in order to prevent the danger arising from the difficulty of disproving in particular cases that duty has given way to interest. See per Lord Eldon in the leading case Ex parte Lacey[9];\nper Rigby L.J., in Lagunas Nitrate Co. v. Lagunas Syndicate[10].\nFor these reasons I think the defendant's promise to pay the sum of f 500 yearly to the mother resting upon the consideration of her undertakings respecting the education and guardianship of her child, and upon that consideration alone, is such a promise as, under our law, the courts cannot enforce.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

In any event, taking such advice is not an answer to the action; the defendants were obliged to shew the existence of probable cause for laying the information; Tanguay v. Gaudry[4]; 61 Am. & Eng. Eneyc, p. 899; Rielle v. Benning[5]; Charlehois v. Bourassa[6]; 19 Am. & Eng. Encyc, p. 687. We also rely upon the decisions in Burrows v. Ransom[7]; Brizard v. Sylvestre[8]; Denard v. Gay[9]; and Charlehois v. Surveyer[10].\nShurtleff K.C. for the respondents. The facts justifying the prosecution have all been found in our favour by the trial judge. The plaintiff utterly failed to prove malice, or even any indiscretion or carelessness on the part of the respondents. These facts were found sufficient by the justice of the peace, by the trial judge and by the court below, as well as by the legal adviser to whom the respondents stated their case with full faith in the suspicious circumstances on which they founded a bon\u00e0 fide belief in the guilt of the plaintiff. See Hilliard on Torts, p. 49; Cooley on Torts, p. 123; Bowes v. Ramsay[11]. It was the duty of the private prosecutor to lay the information and bring the guilty person to punishment; Groth\u00e9v. Saunders[12]; Pinsonneault v. S\u00e9bastien[13]; Lefuntun v. Bolduc[14]. In addition to the authorities cited in the judgments in the court below, we refer to Moloney v. Chase[15]; Franc\u0153ur v. Boulay[16]; Le-mire v. Duclos[17]; Renaud v. Guenette[18]; and Gigu\u00e8re v. Jacob[19].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought for the purpose of recovering damages for what is usually called malicious prosecution.\nThe plaintiff, now appellant, was the owner of a creamery at a place called Dixville in the Eastern Townships. After this creamery had been in operation about six years the defendants, now respondents, started a rival factory with the result that most of the business of the neighbourhood was attracted to their establishment.\nDuring the night of July 27th, 1905, when the new creamery was completed and ready for business, an attempt was made to set fire to the building, and, for reasons which are stated at great length in the evidence, suspicion was directed towards the appellant as the guilty party. The local magistrate was consulted by one of the officials of the respondent company and on his suggestion further inquiries were made, the results of which were laid before counsel who advised that the appellant should be prosecuted. Thereupon the appellant was arrested and, after the preliminary examination, he was committed for trial. Subsequently the district magistrate before whom the case was tried under the \"Speedy Trials Act\" discharged him. Two of complainant's witnesses were absent from the country at the time of the trial, and there may have been sufficient evidence to shew a probable cause for prosecuting, but not such plain proof of guilt as would justify a conviction. After his acquittal by District Magistrate Mulvena, the appellant brought this action for $5,000 damages, alleging the arrest and subsequent discharge and that the respondents acted maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. The respondents pleaded that they used proper care to inform themselves of the facts, that the act was done without malice and that they honestly believed the case which they laid before the magistrate. On these issues the parties went to trial. The judge of the Superior Court, who saw the witnesses and had full opportunity of judging by their demeanour whether they were witnesses of truth, came to the conclusion that the respondents had taken care to inform themselves of the facts of the case; that no malice had been proved and that there was abundant evidence of reasonable and probable cause, and dismissed the action. In this conclusion the judges in appeal concur and I can see no reason on the evidence why we should reverse.\nIn appeal an issue was raised as to the burden of proof and this question has been recently much discussed in the Quebec Courts; Sharpe v. Willis[20], and Durocher v. Bradford[21]. At page 80 of the last report many cases are cited and much learning is displayed to prove that there is a difference between the English and French rule of law on this point; but, expressing a personal opinion, I agree with Mr. Justice Blanchet that there is no such difference. Under the English system, in an action for malicious prosecution\nthe plaintiff has the burden throughout of establishing that the circumstances of the prosecution were such that a judge can see no reasonable nor probable cause for instituting it:\nAbrath v. North Eastern Railway Co.[22]; Cox v. English, Scotch and Australian Bank[23], at p. 170;\nand the principles applicable in cases arising in Quebec will be found laid down in article 1053 of the Code:\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nTo make the party prosecuting responsible, it is necessary that the damage should be caused by his fault; and to lay an information, when in possession of facts sufficient to establish a bon\u00e0 fide belief of guilt, is not a fault, but the exercise of an undoubted right. In Quebec, as in English courts, it must be alleged and proved that there was fault, that is to say, that the prosecutor acted, to use the words of the Cour de Cassation\ndans le dessein coupable de nuire ou, du moins, avec une indiscr\u00e9tion et.\"une l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles\" (Fuzier-Hermann, vo. \"D\u00e9nonciation calomnieuse, No. 231; Sourdat, Responsabilit\u00e9, Vol. 1, No. 633; Receuil Philly, sommaires Mars 1908 No. 1930;\nand the plaintiff in his declaration thought it necessary to allege in conformity with this view of the law that the prosecution was started maliciously to injure him and without reasonable and probable cause.\nIt is not necessary, however, for the purposes of this case to determine that point; the evidence given is sufficient to prove that the party prosecuting entertained a reasonable bon\u00e0 fide belief based upon full conviction founded upon reasonable grounds that the appellant was guilty of the offence which had undoubtedly been committed.\nI would like to say, speaking again for myself, that in my opinion a private prosecutor is a useful person in a community where we have nothing in the nature of a public prosecutor and those who, having taken the reasonable care to ascertain the facts, prosecute duly in the public interest should be protected. It would be encouraging useless appeals for this court to hold that an uneducated layman was in fault in assuming that he had reasonable and probable cause for a prosecution in a case in which the trial judge and five judges in appeal agree with him.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Pierre & Verret\nSolicitor for the respondents: W.

Fleming (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1908: March 9, 10, 23.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nPrincipal and agent\u2014Secret profit\u2014Trust\u2014Clandestine transactions by broker\u2014Sham purchaser\u2014Commission\u2014Quantum meruit.\nH., a broker, undertook to obtain two lots for F., as an investment of funds supplied by F. for that purpose, at prices quoted and on the understanding that any commission or brokerage chargeable was to be got out of the vendors. H. purchased one of the lots at a price lower than that quoted receiving, however, the full amount quoted from F., and, by representing a sham purchase of the other lot, got an advance from F. in order to secure it.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that H. was the agent of F. and could not make any secret profits out of the transactions, nor was he entitled to any allowance by way of commission or brokerage in respect of either of the lots so purchased.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment by Morrison J., at the trial, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff applied to the defendant, who was a real estate broker at Vancouver, B.C., for information respecting investments in city property and, in consequence of what took place between them, instructed the defendant to purchase a lot he had listed for sale at $220 per acre, and another at a price quoted. The defendant purchased the first mentioned lot at $180 per acre, received the full price quoted from the plaintiff and paid the vendor, at the lower rate, out of the money he received from the plaintiff. In respect to the second lot, the defendant falsely represented to the plaintiff that another party had bought it and that, in order to secure it, he would have to pay a considerable advance on the price first quoted. The plaintiff paid the increased price thus asked for the second lot and defendant purchased it from the vendor at the price originally stated, retaining the difference himself. It had been agreed that the defendant should not charge any commission or brokerage to the plaintiff.\nThe defendant then invested the profits he had made on these transactions in the purchase of four other city lots and the plaintiff, on discovery of the deceit and artifices which had been practised in connection with his business, brought the action for a declaration that the defendant was his agent and became trustee for him of the four other lots purchased by the defendant with the secret profits he had thus made, or, in the alternative, to recover the amount of the difference between what he had been obliged to pay for the two lots and the prices actually paid to the vendors for them by the defendant.\nThe trial judge held, affirmed by the judgment appealed from, that the defendant stood towards the plaintiff in the fiduciary relation of an agent and was bound to procure the lots for him on the most favourable terms and that he could not make any secret profit out of the transactions. The defendant urged, on the present appeal, that, according to the evidence, no such agency had been created, that the defendant had dealt in the matter simply as a broker undertak- ing to procure the lots for an investor, and that he could get them for any price the vendors were willing to accept and sell them to the plaintiff or any other person at any advance in price which he might be able to obtain. He claimed, alternatively, that he was, in any event, entitled to receive remuneration in the form of a commission or allowance in consideration of the services he had rendered in negotiating the purchases.\nW. S. Deacon for the appellant.\nD. Greenfield Macdonell for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and DAVIES J. concurred in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It seems to me that there is enough stated in the evidence if that of the appellant is entirely discarded to support the respondent's claim either on the ground of his agency or of deceit.\nHaving read the evidence I am satisfied the learned trial judge was right in discarding appellant's evidence.\nThe pleadings may not exactly stand as I would draw them, but enough is stated to cover either ground I have suggested and, indeed, both grounds upon which I have suggested the action on the evidence might be maintained.\nThe acceptance of respondent's agency in each transaction in question is followed in each case by a fraudulent use of it to the respondent's detriment in reporting as to the business he undertook in each instance for the respondent, that which has been proven to have been false and thereby extracting from the respondent's bank account sums he, the appellant, had no right to.\nThe only doubt I have had in considering the case is whether or not appellant's responsibility was not to each of the vendors, but I have concluded since reading the evidence that we have nothing to do with the possible result arising from his relations with these other parties which were somewhat indefinite and in any case must rest on other facts and relations than the respondent relies upon.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed. In the transaction relating to lot 739 the defendant appears in fact to have made the purchase after he had accepted employment as the plaintiff's agent for the purchase of that property. Under his arrangement with the plaintiff the defendant was unquestionably entitled to bargain with the vendors for and to receive from them a commission on any sale effected through his agency; and, had he in this case made such a bargain, it may be assumed that the price demanded by the vendors would have been correspondingly increased. Instead, however, of taking this straightforward course, the defendant\u2014as the learned judge appears with quite sufficient warrant from the evidence to have found\u2014resorted to the subterfuge of a clandestine purchase in the name of another in order to procure a profit out of the plaintiff; a profit ostensibly paid to the sham purchaser, but really passing into the defendant's own pocket. By this tortuous course, the defendant made himself as the plaintiff's agent accountable for the whole of the excess of the purchase money paid by the plaintiff over that actually received by the vendors; and clearly, I think, without the right to make any deduction as for commission\u2014for under the terms of his agency he was to look for his commission to the vendor.\nWith respect to the other transaction, the evidence, I think, supports the finding that the relation of principal and agent had already been established between the plaintiff and the defendant when the defendant procured from Alvensleben the option to purchase; and that it was in fact procured by him in his character of agent for the plaintiff. The plaintiff was, therefore, entitled to the benefit of that option, and here again the defendant was, under the arrangement referred to, bound to look to the vendor for his commission.\nIf in the result the defendant is not entitled out of the moneys in his hands as trustee for the plaintiff to retain any sum as for commission on the transactions he negotiated, that is only the just consequence of his attempt to traffic for his own profit upon a fiduciary relation.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. J. Deacon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. N. Ellis.\n"}

The defendant demurred generally to the declaration and specifically to each count. The demurrer was sustained as to three counts and dismissed as to the other two. On appeal from the decision of the registrar refusing an order to affirm the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain an appeal from the judgment maintaining the demurrer.\nHeld, that each count contained a distinct ground on which forfeiture could be granted and a judgment depriving the municipality of its right to rely on any such ground was a final judgment in respect thereof which could be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada, sitting as a judge in chambers, whereby it was held that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nThe decision appealed from was upon an application made to the registrar, in chambers, under Rule I. of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Canada, for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal and the approval of the security for an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Iberville, by which the demurrer of the defendants to three counts in the plaintiff's declaration was allowed with costs. The circumstances of the case are stated in the following reasons for the judgment of\nThe Registrar.\u2014\"This is an application under Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules, for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the court.\n\"Bisaillon K.C. and Geoffrion K.C., appeared in support of the application.\n\"Belcourt K.C. and Roy K.C. shewed cause.\n\"The facts of the case, as disclosed by the material filed, are as follows:\n\"Pursuant to the provisions of chapter 65 of the Consolidated Statutes of Quebec, being 'An Act respecting Incorporated Joint Stock Companies' for supplying cities, towns and villages with gas and water, a company received a charter of incorporation to supply water to the City of St. Johns Subsequently, by the Act, 40 Vict, of the Statutes of Quebec, chapter 68, being 'An Act concerning the Waterworks of St. Johns,' the said water-works company became vested in Louis Molleur, the younger, of the Town of St. Johns, and he was substituted for the company as proprietor of all its property and charged with all its obligations and responsibilities. By the said last mentioned Act, and by the second section thereof, the said Molleur was granted the exclusive right and privilege to place pipes and water conduits under the streets and public squares of the town.\n\"By the third section it is provided that, if the said Molleur should refuse or neglect to fulfil all the obligations imposed upon him by the Act, after having been placed en demeure so to do by the said town, he and his representatives might be deprived of the exclusive privilege above mentioned.\n\"Section 4 provided that the water should be pure and healthy and should be sold and distributed to such of the inhabitants of the town as should be willing to receive it at the price and on the conditions which the said Molleur should establish.\n\"By section 5 the corporation obtained the right, without charge, to use the water from the water-works for the extinction of fires and to construct and place such pipes, reservoirs, etc., as should be necessary for utilizing the said water for fire purposes, and Molleur was bound, on the demand of the corporation, to keep a constant pressure of 50 pounds of steam per square inch in the boiler of the water-works, so that the same might be made use of in case of fire, upon the corporation paying him a sum to be fixed by arbitrators in the absence of an agreement.\n\"The statute also provided, by section 6, that, any time after the year 1899, the corporation should have the right to purchase the water-works by paying the value thereof, which, in default of agreement, should be settled by arbitration.\n\"By section 9 the corporation might pass a by-law compelling all the ratepayers of St. John to supply themselves with water from the water-works, and by section 10 provision was made for fixing a tariff of fees to be paid by the ratepayers in the event of the corporation and Molleur being unable to agree to the same.\n\"Section 12 authorized the corporation to require Molleur to lay down pipes in any street in the town in which there were none, provided that the owner of the water-works might be able to levy an annual amount equal to ten per cent. on the value of the work and material supplied.\n\"The present action is brought under the third section of the statute to have it declared that Molleur has forfeited all his rights and privileges for the following reasons set up in the plaintiff's declaration:\n(a) The impurity of the water supplied;\n(b) The lack and insufficiency of water pressure for fire purposes;\n(c) The lack and insufficiency of pressure for the supply of water at the domiciles of the subscribers;\n(d) The unjustifiable increase in the rates charged to the consumers of the water in the town who were bound to take their supply from the said water-works;\n(e) The bad state of the water-works and its accessories and its present incapacity to fulfil the obligations to which the proprietors were bound towards the town and its ratepayers.\n\"The defendant demurred to the declaration generally, and also specifically as to each count thereof.\n\"The Superior Court allowed the demurrer as to the grounds above mentioned (b), (c), and (d), but dismissed it as against the other counts in the declaration.\n\"An appeal taken from this judgment to the Court of King's Bench was dismissed. \"Under the practice in the Province of Quebec, an appeal from an interlocutory judgment lies to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) only by leave of a judge of that court, while an appeal lies to the same court[1] where the judgment of the Superior Court is a final judgment, in all cases except:\n'1. In matters of certiorari;.\n'2. In matters concerning municipal corporations or officers, as provided in article 1006 C.P.Q.;\n'3. In matters in which the sum claimed or value of the thing demanded is less than two hundred dollars, and in which judgment has been rendered by the Court of Review;\n'4. At the instance of any party who has inscribed in review any cause other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and has proceeded to judgment on such inscription, when such judgment confirms that rendered in first instance.\"\n\"I understand it to be admitted by the plaintiff in the present case that according to the practice in the Province of Quebec, the judgment herein was interlocutory and for that reason they petitioned a judge of the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, and it was by virtue of that leave that the judgment of the Court of King's Bench against which it is now desired to appeal to the Supreme Court, was given.\n\"The plaintiffs contend that a judgment may be interlocutory according to the procedure in the Province of Quebec, but be a final judgment as these words are construed by the Supreme Court. I do not find any case supporting such a contention. But the contrary is to be inferred from the judgment of the Supreme Court in a recent case of Desaulniers v. Payette[2], in which the Chief Justice, Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, speaking for the court, said:\n\u2018Avec la permission sp\u00e9ciale requise pour en appeler d'un jugement interlocutoire, ce jugement fut port\u00e9 en appel \u00e0 la cour du banc du roi par les opposants, mais leur appel fut d\u00e9bout\u00e9.\n'Ils veulent maintenant en appeler de ce jugement de la cour d'appel. Mais nous ne pouvons recevoir leur appel.\n'Il n'y a appel \u00e0 cette cour que d'un jugement final. Or le jugement en question n'est \u00e9videmment qu'un jugement interlocutoire, un jugement d'instruction. Les appelants eux-m\u00eames n'ont pas cru qu'ils pouvaient en appeler de plein droit \u00e0 la cour d'appel comme d'un jugement final. Et ils avaient raison. Or, il n'est pas plus final maintenant qu'il l'\u00e9tait alors.'\n\"The plaintiff relies mainly in supporting its contention that there is jurisdiction to hear this appeal, upon the decision of this court in Shields v. Peak[3]; and were it not for more recent decisions of the Supreme Court, I would have been of the opinion that that case could not be distinguished from the present. There the respondent sued for $4,000 on the common counts, and also by special count alleged that the purchase of goods had been made by the defendants when they had probable cause for believing themselves to be insolvent, and with intent to defraud the plaintiff. The defendants amongst other pleas pleaded that the contract out of which the alleged cause of action arose was made in England and not in Canada. To this plea the plaintiff demurred. Judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff on the demurrer to the plea in question, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The defendants thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and when the case was called, an objection was taken to the jurisdiction on the ground that this was not an appeal from a final judgment. The judgment of the majority of the court on the question of jurisdiction was given by Sir Henry Strong, in which he said that the case was not distinguishable from Chevallier v. Cuvillier[4], and that an appeal would lie.\n\"The latter case, whether distinguishable in principle or not from Shields v. Peak[5], certainly differed from that case in that the demurrer was to the entire cause of action and the judgment finally disposed of the rights of the parties. Indeed, I find on looking at the record in the Supreme Court that the judgment of the Superior Court is in the following terms:\n'Maintient la dite d\u00e9fense en droit et d\u00e9boute le dit demandeur de sa pr\u00e9sente demande contre la dite d\u00e9fenderesse,' except as to certain immovables with respect to which the defendants by their pleas expressly admitted the plaintiff's rights. And in the judgment of Chief Justice Sir A. A. Dorion, he says, in referring to the judgment of the court below:\n'The court below maintained the demurrer and dismissed the appellant's action quoad the respondents, except as to the two lots of land purchased from J. D. Bernard.' \"In Shields v. Peak[6], Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissented, and Mr. Justice Gwynne points out in his judgment that 'In Chevallier v. Cuvillier[7], the demurrer was to a particular specified portion of the claim in the action and the allowance of a demurrer in such case was undoubtedly a final judgment as to the claim demurred to. * * * But the case here is quite different; it is a judgment allowing a demurrer to one of several pleas upon all of which issues in fact are joined, and yet to be tried. Such a judgment decides nothing as to the action or suit in which the plea is pleaded; the action remains still wholly undetermined.'\n\"The view of the majority of the Supreme Court as determined by Shields v. Peak6, is not in harmony with either the earlier or later jurisprudence of the court. The first case reported is that of Bank of British North America v. Walker[8]. There the declaration contained eight counts, and six of these were demurred to. The seventh and eighth counts of the declaration were so framed that a verdict thereon in favour of the plaintiff if supported by the evidence would stand, whatever might be the decision of the court upon the demurrers. An appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court from the judgment on the demurrers, but no appeal was taken from the judgment of the trial judge which ordered a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs on the verdict of the jury, the reason for this probably being that no appeal had been taken from the trial judge on this branch of the case to the full court of British Columbia. After argument the Supreme Court held that the judgment on the demurrers was not one from which an appeal would lie and ordered it to be quashed, but further ordered that the defendants might appeal per saltum from the judgment of the trial judge and from the judgment on the demurrers.\n\"The next case is that of Reid v. Ramsay[9]. This was an action for assault and false imprisonment. The defendants by their second plea justified the assault by virtue of a writ of capias ad satisf. issued against the plaintiff under a judgment recovered against him. To this plea the plaintiff made four replications. The defendant demurred to the second and fourth, and in addition the defendant pleaded to the fourth replication a further rejoinder to which the plaintiff demurred. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff on all the demurrers. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and the appeal was quashed on the ground that the judgment appealed against was not final.\n\"In Rattray v. Larue[10], the appellant demurred to an intervention and the judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the demurrer, disposed finally of the rights of the parties in the intervention. The Supreme Court heard an appeal in this case from the Court of King's Bench and restored the judgment of the Superior Court. But the case is clearly distinguishable from Shields v. Peak, in that it was a demurrer to the entire cause of action and the judgment upon it finally disposed of the action.\n\"In Shaw v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[11], in an action for a breach of contract by a railway company to carry the plaintiff's goods in safety, the defendant set up a special contract limiting its liability to $100, to which the plaintiff made two replications, one of which was that the special contract could not avail against the provisions of section 25 of the \"Railway Act of 1879.\" The defendant demurred to this replication on the ground that it was a departure from the declaration which was in contract, while the replication was in tort. The demurrer was allowed in the courts below and an appeal to the Supreme Court was quashed on the ground that the judgment was not final.\n\"The judgment in this case would appear to be entirely in line with the dissenting judgments in Shields v. Peak[12].\n\"Finally, in Griffith v. Harwood[13], we have a case which appears to me to be entirely indistinguishable from the present. Here a plea of prescription was set up as one of the defences to the plaintiff's action. The appellants urged, just as the plaintiffs do in the present case, that in so far as the issue raised upon the plea of prescription was concerned, the judgment appealed from was final and prohibited the defendant from availing himself of that defence, which went to the root of the action. The court, however, following the earlier decisions, quashed the appeal.\n\"I am of the opinion, therefore, after reviewing all the decisions of the court, that by the more recent decisions it is now well settled that where a demurrer is not to the entire cause of action, but only as to some pleading, and where, notwithstanding the judgment on the demurrer., the action still subsists and there remain issues which require to be tried and disposed of by the court of first instance, no appeal lies from a judgment thereon to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\"It is contended in the present case that the result of quashing the present appeal may preclude the plaintiff from questioning the judgment of the Court of Appeal upon the present demurrers, either in the court below or in this court, if the case subsequently came on to be heard in an appeal on the merits, and Shaw v. St. Louis[14] is cited as an authority for that proposition. Even if this were the case, the answer might be made which was made to the same argument in Ontario & Quebec Rly. Go. v. Marcheterre[15], where Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau, speaking for the court, said:\n\"The appellant argued, referring to Shaw v. St. Louis14, that he might eventually find himself precluded from appealing to this court. Whether that is so or not, a point which of course we have not to determine here, that will be simply because the statute does not provide for an appeal in such a case.\"\n\"Later on, however, in Desaulniers v. Payette[16], there is no doubt the court, speaking through the Chief Justice, expressly holds that where an interlocutory judgment had been carried to the Court of King's Bench and disposed of there in a certain way, that judgment could not be reviewed if the case subsequently, on the merits, reached the Court of King's Bench and an appeal was taken from the second judgment of that court to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Chief Justice making use of the following argument in support of that proposition:\n'And likewise, when the case came up again before the Court of Appeal, that court could not but hold, as it did by the judgment now appealed from, that the Superior Court had committed no error when it had simply acted in accordance with the judgment rendered upon the first appeal.\n'Now, if the Court of Appeal (in its second judgment) has rendered the judgment that it had in law to give, the appellants' attempt to shew error in that judgment necessarily fails, and if there is no error in it they cannot expect us to reverse it. They seem to be under the impression that, because the first judgment ordering them to give security was not appealable to this court, Desaulniers v. Payette[17], they can now ask us upon this appeal from the last judgment, to review that first judgment. But that cannot be. As we have often said, an interlocutory judgment that cannot be appealed from is res judicata. But it is not merely because a judgment is res judicata that it is appealable, as the appellants would contend.'\n\"It would appear to me, however, that the recent judgment of the court in Willson v. Shawinigan Carbide Co.[18], must be taken to overrule the decision in Desaulniers v. Payette[19], for there the court says, referring to an analogous case where an appellant filed a declinatory exception to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court:\n'The judgment appealed from does not dispose of the whole case but merely an incident raised by a declinatory exception which was maintained by the trial court and rejected by the Court of Appeal. Of course in both the trial court and the Court of Appeal the question cannot be raised again. It is there chose jug\u00e9e, but it can be raised here, if after being disposed of on the merits, the case, comes up again before this court.\n'The reason for this ruling is that an appeal on the merits opens all the interlocutories, especially if a reservation or an exception be filed immediately after the rendering of the interlocutories.'\n\"The application to affirm the jurisdiction must therefore be refused with costs.\n\"The present motion was coupled with another to allow the plaintiff to deposit $500 in court as security for its appeal. I understand that my judgment on this application will be appealed to the full court. I will, therefore, reserve judgment on the application to allow the security until after that appeal has been disposed of which will preserve the plaintiff's rights to appeal, although more than 60 days will by that time have elapsed from the judgment below. It has been held (Attorney-General of Quebec v. Scott[20]) that the appellant cannot be prejudiced by the delay of the court in dealing with an application to allow the security.\"\nOn the appeal, counsel appeared for the parties, as follows:\nBisaillon E.G. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nRoy K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by The Chief Justice:\u2014The plaintiff applied under Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules to the registrar for an order affirming the jurisdiction of this court to hear an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench which confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe registrar refused to make the order on the ground that the judgment in question is not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act and I was at the argument inclined to agree with him on the authority of Griffith v. Harwood[21] and other cases in this court. Further consideration, however, has brought me to a. different conclusion.\nBy the material before us it appears that the defendant acquired by an Act of the Legislature of Quebec (40 Vict. ch. 68) the exclusive right to place, subject to various obligations, pipes and water conduits under the streets and public squares of the Town of St. Jean.\nThe third section of the Act provides that if the defendant concessionnaire refuses or neglects to fulfil any of the obligations imposed upon him he is liable to forfeit the privilege granted, and the action is brought by the Town of St. Johns claiming a declaration of forfeiture under that section. The five several breaches of the statutory obligations relied upon are set out in separate paragraphs or counts of the declaration. To this declaration the defendants fyled a general demurrer and in addition demurred specifically to each count. The Superior Court allowed the demurrer in respect of three of the counts, holding that none of these three counts disclosed facts constituting a legal ground of forfeiture within the provisions of the Act. On appeal, the judgment of the Superior Court was affirmed and on the argument here it was not disputed that the decision of the Court of Appeal constitutes a final termination, so far as the courts of Quebec are concerned, of the matter in dispute upon the demurrer, that is to say, the question whether the facts stated in any of the counts in respect to which the demurrer is allowed constituted a ground of forfeiture of the privilege, has been finally decided in the negative; the judgment appealed from is final as to those issues, costs are awarded and nothing further remains to be done. See Shaw v. St. Louis[22], at pages 402 and 403, per Taschereau J.[23]; none of the questions so decided in appeal can be reheard or re-examined in that court.\nThe question now is whether such a decision was \"a final judgment\" within the meaning of the Supreme Court Act. Chapter 139, R.S.C. (1906), sec. 2, sub-sec. (e), defines a final judgment to mean\nany judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding is finally determined and concluded.\nIf the declaration contained only the counts to which the demurrer was maintained, nobody would dispute that such a judgment allowing a demurrer to the whole action would be a final judgment within the meaning of that section and inasmuch as the grounds or causes of action set out in each of these counts if good in law are distinct grounds or causes upon any one of which the conclusions of the action claiming a declaration of forfeiture might be. granted, it seems to me that a judgment finally depriving the plaintiff municipality of the right to maintain its action upon any of those grounds or causes is with respect to them a final judgment, that is to say a judgment by which the rights of the parties on the issues raised by those counts are finally determined and concluded, except in so far as we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. It has been argued that there can be only one final judgment in each action, that is to say, the judgment that finally disposes of the whole action; but I do not think that such a limited construction should be put upon the words \"final judgment\u201d; although it might be said that if adopted the result would be to give to these words their literal meaning. The French text-writers interpret or define the term \"jugement d\u00e9finitif\" which corresponds with \"final judgment,\" by comparison with and in opposition to \"jugement provisoire, jugement pr\u00e9liminaire et jugement interlocutoire\" all of which they include under the general classification of \"jugements avant faire droit\" Colmet-Daage, in his valuable notes on Boitard, Proc\u00e9dure civile (15 ed.), vol. 1, page 255, says that Boitard is in error when he defines the final judgment as the one which puts an end to the suit and removes it completely from the court in which the judgment is rendered. Boitard says:\nLe jugement d\u00e9finitif dessaisit le tribunal et termine la contestation devant lui.\nIn his notes Colmet-Daage says:\nLa d\u00e9finition que donne Boitard du jugement d\u00e9finitif est inexacte; il y a bien des jugements de cette nature qui ne terminent pas la contestation; tels sont ceux qui statuent sur des conclusions d'exception, sur une demande en r\u00e9cusation, sur une demande en renvoi, ceux qui rejettent une demande en p\u00e9remption d'instance, etc., etc. On ne peut d\u00e9finir les jugements d\u00e9finitifs que d'une mani\u00e8re indirecte, en disant: Les jugements d\u00e9finitifs sont tous ceux qui ne rentrent pas dans l'une des trois sortes, des jugements d'avant faire droit.\nDalloz, Laurent and Pigeau all concur in the opinion that there may be several final judgments in the same case, in the sense that there may be several judgments in the same case which finally decide and dispose of particular grounds of action or issues, without finally disposing of the whole action.\nDalloz, vo. \"Jugement\" ch. 3, sec. 1, paragraph 12, says:\nDe la nature des jugements d'avant faire droit ressortent, par opposition, les caract\u00e8res des jugements d\u00e9finitifs. Et il r\u00e9sulte clairement de la distinction qui existe entre eux qu'il ne faut pas prendre le mot jugement d\u00e9finitif dans son acception rigoureusement litt\u00e9rale, en ne l'appliquant qu'aux d\u00e9cisions qui terminent la contestation d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive; ce serait l\u00e0 une erreur. Les jugements d\u00e9finitifs, en effet, sont tous ceux qui ne se bornent pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9juger, mais qui jugent un point, une question quelconque du proc\u00e8s, non pas seulement lorsqu'ils statuent sur le fond, mais aussi lorsqu'ils prononcent sur les incidents, sur les exceptions, sur les nullit\u00e9s, sur les fins de non-recevoir, etc., en premier comme en dernier ressort.\nCarr\u00e9 & Chauveau, t. 1, p. 565, note 1, 4th. and t. 4, p. 60 to same effect.\nLaurent, vol. 20, n. 22, says:\nIl peut dans une m\u00eame affaire intervenir plusieurs jugements d\u00e9finitifs en ce sens qu'ils d\u00e9cident d\u00e9finitivement certains points d\u00e9battus entre les parties; tous ces jugements ont l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nAt No. 23;\u2014\nQuand un jugement, interlocutoire en apparence, d\u00e9cide r\u00e9ellement un point contest\u00e9 entre les parties, il est d\u00e9finitif et il a, par cons\u00e9quent, l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nPigeau, Proc\u00e9dure Civile (2 ed., 1811), vol. 1, page 484:\nLe jugement d\u00e9finitif est celui qui d\u00e9termine la contestation. And then he goes on to say:\n2. Il y a deux observations \u00e0 faire sur les jugements d\u00e9finitifs:\n1. La premi\u00e8re, que le jugement peut n'\u00eatre d\u00e9finitif que sur un ou plusieurs chefs et non sur le surplus:\n2. Un jugement peut contenir en m\u00eame temps une disposition d\u00e9finitive et un avant faire droit.\nThe effect of the judgment appealed from was to put an end to the issues raised by the counts with respect to which the demurrer was maintained and to that extent the action was finally disposed of and it was \"chose jug\u00e9e.\"\nIn Shields v. Peak[24], it was held that a decision on a demurrer to a part of the action only is a final judgment in a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nAnd Mr. Justice Gwynne, who dissented, referring to Chevallier v. Cuvillier[25], says:\nThe demurrer is Chevallier v. Cuvillier25 was to a particular specified portion of the claim ascertained in the action and the allowance of the demurrer in such a case was undoubtedly a final judgement as to the claim demurred to.\nHere the judgment does not, because of the nature of the proceedings deprive the plaintiff, of a particular specified portion of his claim; but as a result of the judgment the plaintiff's action is dismissed with respect to the grounds of action contained in the counts demurred to.\nIn Baptist v. Baptist[26], it was held that the judgment was res judicata between the parties and final on the petition for continuance of the suit and therefore appealable to this court, and speaking for the court, Taschereau J., says, at page 429: Now though we have held that no interlocutory judgments can be reviewed by this court under that clause, and though in form, perhaps, this is, in one sense, an interlocutory judgment, yet, it is clear that, though upon a side issue, the controversy between the parties has been, as far as can be in the provincial courts, determined and concluded.\nMr. Justice Duff, to whom I am indebted for much assistance in the preparation of these notes, refers me to the case of McDonald v. Belcher[27]. That was an action brought in the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory in which the plaintiff Belcher claimed certain sums from the defendant McDonald, among them a sum of |50,000. At the trial the learned judge decided adversely to the plaintiffs in respect to this claim and directed a reference with respect to the remaining sums. Judgment having eventually been given upon the referee's report in respect to the remaining claims, an appeal was taken by the plaintiffs to the Supreme Court of British Columbia under 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 11, sec. 7 (D.), which authorized an appeal to that court from the Territorial Court of the Yukon in the case of final judgments.\nOn the appeal the defendant set up the contention that with respect to the item of $50,000 the judgment of the learned judge at the trial being an adjudication upon the dispute between the parties in respect of that item and not having been appealed from within the time allotted by the Act referred to, could not be reviewed. The Supreme Court of British Columbia accepted this contention. On appeal to this court, the judgment of that court was reversed. On appeal again to the Privy Council it was there held that with respect to that item the judgment or decision of the learned judge at the trial was a final judgment. At page 433 Lord Halsbury uses these words:\nThe particular matter, however, upon which the case before their lordships depends * * * is whether the question of an indebtedness by the defendant * * * to the extent of $50,000 was or was not finally disposed of by the trial which took place before the territorial judge., that is to say, whether the language used by the learned judge in disposing of the matter constituted a final judgment of the court.\nThis question was answered in the affirmative.\nIn the present case it is true that there were not separate demands. There was one conclusion only; but there were several counts, each putting forward an independent title to the relief claimed; and the effect of the judgment appealed from was as regards the counts in respect of which the demurrer was allowed precisely the same as if the action had gone to trial and judgment had been given. The controversy regarding the matters raised by them is as effectually and conclusively disposed of. And it is this quality of conclusiveness which determines the character of a judgment as a final judgment, not its relation in point of time to other proceedings. When by a judgment a distinct and separate ground of action is, to use Lord Halsbury's words, \"finally disposed of it is in the ordinary use of the words a final judgment with respect to that ground of action.\nOur decision in this appeal as to the meaning of the term final judgment is, of course, not limited to appeals from the Province of Quebec, but is applicable to those from the other provinces as well. And when it is considered that the \"Judicature Act\" is now in force in nearly all these provinces and that under it many different kinds of action may be joined together and many different counterclaims submitted by the defendants resulting possibly in many distinct issues alike of law and fact being raised it will at once be seen how illusory in many cases it would be to put the limited construction contended for upon the word final judgment.\nThe substantial controversies between the litigants might in many cases be decided by the provincial courts, but if a single issue of law or fact remained open on the record no appeal would lie to this court, and if an appeal eventually came here from the judgment of the provincial court on this final issue we would be precluded in such appeal from hearing or opening the judgments already given in what might well be the most substantial and important subjects of controversy.\nI am of opinion that this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal and the order of the registrar is modified accordingly.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bisaillon & Bossard.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Philippe Roy.\n[1] Art. 43 C.P.Q,\n[2] 33 Can.

APPEAL from the judgment of the local judge for the Toronto Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note. The judgment of the local judge from which the appeal was taken is as follows:\u2014\nHodgins Loc. J.\u2014\"Since the argument in this case I have re-read the evidence which I find to be conflicting in many particulars, and it has confirmed the impression I formed at the conclusion of the evidence that the plaintiffs were entitled to succeed.\n\"The plaintiffs' claim in this case is for damages caused to their steamer 'Neepawah's' propeller by the defendants' steamer 'Westmount,' and the main issue is whether the defendants' steamer, the 'Westmount,' bumped the plaintiffs' steamer, the 'Neepawah,' when passing her in the level between locks 23 and 24 in the Welland Canal on the night of the 20th October, 1904. The night has been described by several witnesses as a dark, rainy night,;; and this fact and the conflicting statements of witnesses so general in admiralty cases, have increased the difficulty of deciding to which side a preferable credence should be given.\n\"But the evidence as to the fact of the bumping of the 'Westmount' on the 'Neepawah' satisfies me that such bumping took place, and that together with what must have been the resultant pressure of the water on the 'Neepawah' caused by the swing of the 'Westmount' in straightening her course into the middle of the canal so as to enter the lock while passing the 'Neepawah'\u2014caused the 'Neepawah' to swing across the canal as described by several of the witnesses on both sides. See also Cadwell v. The 'C. F. Bielman'[2].\n\"The captain of the 'Neepawah' states that he heard the reversing bell of the 'Westmount' and that her reversing had the effect of turning her against the 'Neepawah' and moving her stern against his boat, and that he felt something touch his boat, and that his boat 'at once swung out,' the stern swinging to the bank, and the bow swinging out into the canal, and that when the stern swung over the bank the two flanges of the propeller wheel were broken by striking the stone side wall of the canal.\n\"The wheelsman, Laroche, states that he was at the wheel steering the 'Neepawah' and kept her straight but did not feel the bump, but was sure that the 'Westmount' had struck the 'Neepawah' 'because we changed direction instantly.'\n\"Legault, who was at the stern of the 'Neepawah' with a fender, states that the 'Westmount's' stern struck the 'Neepawah' between the aftermast and the boiler house about five or six feet from the stern of the 'Neepawah,' and shoved her on the bank and broke her wheel.\n\"McLeavy, one of the defendant's witnesses, states that when the steamers were passing their respective sterns were about three feet apart and that he saw the sterns come together and that they were coming closer together as they passed.\n\"Tracy, a lock tender, an independent witness on shore, states that when the 'Westmount' was heading to enter the lock, she was three or four feet away from the 'Neepawah\u2019 that the 'Westmount' was about half way past the 'Neepawah' when she began to get straightened for lock 23, and that the sides of the after part of the end of the two boats came nearest together.\n\"Captain Milligan, of the 'Westmount,' states that all the time he was straightening the 'Westmount' he was shifting her stern over the centre line; and that when he was straight for the lock he would necessarily be twenty feet into his port water, and therefore there would not be room for the 'Neepawah' to lie between him and the shore. And he added that he would 'let it go' that the 'Neepawah' had got as far as the centre line,\u2014but not across it,\u2014though he afterwards varied this. The frequent changes of the position of the models made by this witness, and his admissions that he was only guessing has affected his credibility. And similar changes of the position of the models by others of the defendants' witnesses have caused me to hesitate in accepting their fairness in giving evidence. At first some of them placed the models anglewise across the canal, but when attention was called to such positions, some of them altered the anglewise for another position.\n\"There is another fact which is established by the evidence of the captain of the 'Westmount' that he commenced to straighten for the lock before he had passed the 'Neepawah' and that he thereby got into the 'Neepawah's' water. The rule of the road provides that 'in narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or midchannel which lies to the starboard side of such vessel.' The 'fairway' mentioned in this rule has been defined by Bargrave Deane J. in The 'Glengariff'[3] thus: 'A fairway is practically defined by this article to be the midchannel. There is no rule which says you must keep in the fairway, but the rule says that you must keep to the starboard side of the fairway or midchannel in narrow channels.' The waterwidth of the canal between locks 23 and 24 is 108 feet; the 'Westmount's' beam is 43 feet, and the 'Neepawah's' beam is 41 feet. But the 'Westmount' began to straighten her course and thereby to get out of her starboard water and into the 'Neepawah's' water before she had passed the 'Neepawah' and thereby violated this rule of the road. I must also find that the 'Westmount' further failed to observe the rules of the road which direct crossing steam vessels to 'keep out of the way of the other.' These violations of the rules of the road led to the bumping of the stern of the 'Neepawah' which I find was the primary cause of the propellor wheel of the 'Neepawah' striking the boom or wall of the canal and breaking two of its blades.\n\"The defence raises an objection to the plaintiffs' preliminary act in that article 13 states that 'the parts of each ship which first came into collision were the port bow of the 'Westmount' and the port quarter of the 'Neepawah' abreast of the kitchen.' The plaintiffs' statement of claim alleges substantially the same that the 'Westmount' sheered on the 'Neepawah' and struck her on the port side abreast of the kitchen, and forced her stern against the boom along the stone wall * * * by reason whereof the 'Neepawah's' screw came in contact with the said boom and two of her propeller blades were broken. \"The rule of practice is that no mistake in the preliminary act can be amended unless an application to amend is made before trial. The 'Vortigem'[4]. But in The 'Frankland'[5], Sir Robert Phillimore While refusing to allow the preliminary act to be amended, allowed an amendment of the pleadings adding that it would be competent to counsel 'to comment on the discrepancy between the pleading and the preliminary act.' And in The 'Miranda'[6], the same learned judge said: 'The parties in an action of damages are not bound in their pleadings to repeat any errors or omissions which may exist in their preliminary act; and it is open to them in their statement of claim, or statement of defence to state correctly any facts which may have been omitted or erroneously stated in their preliminary act.'\n\"Apparently from these decisions the only penalty for errors and omissions in the preliminary act is that they may be 'commented upon by counsel.' But they could be amended if an early application for leave to amend had been made.\n\"In the'Dictator'[7] the court allowed an amendment of the writ by increasing the amount of the claim after judgment; and the plaintiffs were subsequently allowed to sue out execution for the increased amount allowed by the amendment of the writ[8].\n\"But in The 'Alice' & The 'Rosita'[9], the rule that a party seeking redress for an injury can only recover 'secundum allegata et probata' was held to apply only to cases where the averments alleged in the pleadings were material to the issue.. While I must find that the statement of claim incorrectly states the locality of the collision between the two steamers, I think the statement of defence is rather helpful in determining the locality of the bumping by stating that the 'Neepawah's' bow, being light, fell out from the bank and across the canal astern of the 'Westmount' as the latter passed. * * * The 'Westmount' was in her own proper water, and at a considerable distance from the point (i.e., the bow) which the alleged impact of the vessel is said by the plaintiffs to have taken place.' \"This pleading, I think, indicates the locality more fairly than the plaintiffs', that the impact was not near the bows of the two vessels, but somewhere near their sterns\u2014which the evidence warrants me in finding. And as the plaintiffs' pleading has not apparently misled the defendants, and as the points as to the preliminary act and pleadings were not taken at the opening, or early in the case, I think the plaintiffs may have leave to amend their pleading, as it seems the defendants have not been prejudiced.\n\"After the amendment the decree will be for a reference to the registrar to assess the damages and to tax the plaintiffs their costs of the action and reference.\"\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and Francis King for the appellants.\nLynch-Staunton K.C. and Logie for the respondents.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and Francis King for the appellants. The preliminary act cannot be amended. Errors therein may be corrected by the pleadings, but if not so corrected the act will govern; Williams & Bruce Ad. Prac., 3 ed., p. 369; Secretary of State for India v. Hewitt[10].\nThe amendment after- judgment was manifestly improper. See The \"Miranda\"[11]; The \"Frankland\"[12]; The \"Vortigern\"[13], as to the absolute necessity of fair notice of the material facts.\nLynch-Staunton K.C. and Logie for the respondents. This court will not reverse on questions of fact. The \"Picton\"[14]; The SS. \"Arranmore\" v. Rudolph[15].\nThe pleadings in an action in admiralty can be amended if the preliminary act cannot and the discrepancies between the two is only a ground of comment by counsel. See The \"Frankland\"12; The \"Miranda\"11;\nThe pleadings did not mislead the defendants and the learned judge was justified in allowing the amendment. The \"Alice\" & The \"Rosita\"[16].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014By the judgment appealed from, the local judge in admiralty (Toronto District), found that a collision occurred between the defendants' (appellants') ship \"Westmount\" and the plaintiffs' (respondents') ship \"Neepawah,\" and that, for the resulting damage, the defendants are liable. There is the usual order for a reference to the registrar to assess the damage.\nThe collision is alleged to have taken place between 11 o'clock and midnight on 20th October, 1904, in the stretch of water known as the level between locks 23 and 24 on the Welland Canal. This stretch is said to be 744 feet long and 110 feet wide at its widest part. The boats are each full Welland Canal size; about 250 feet long and 45 feet wide. The night was dark and rainy. This action was entered on the 5th March, 1906,\u2014almost seventeen months after the occurrence and the witnesses were examined in April and May, 1907. The entry in the log of the \"Neepawah\" made at the time by the captain is:\n\"Broke my wheel between lock 23 and 24 at 11h 30m p:m:\"\nNo mention is made of the \"Westmount\" or of a collision.\nIt further appears that a protest was made by the captain of the \"Neepawah\" and, although at the trial notice to produce was served, it was not forthcoming.\nWe are, therefore, without the aid of the written records usually made when a ship has been in collision.\nWe have this further difficulty,\u2014that, in the plaintiffs' preliminary act, dated 22nd March, 1906, the port bow of the \"Westmount\" and the port quarter of the \"Neepawah,'-' abreast of the kitchen, are the parts of the ships which, it is alleged, first came in contact; and, in the statement of claim, the collision is described as having occurred in this way:\nThe \"Westmount\" sheered on the \"Neepawah\" and struck her on the port side abreast the kitchen;\nso that, in this respect, the parties went to trial practically on the statement of facts contained in the preliminary act. The captain of the \"Neepawah\" in his examination for discovery says that the bluff of the \"Westmount's\" bow struck the \"Neepawah's\" stern.\nThe judge, notwithstanding all this, finds on the evidence that there was a collision and\nthat the impact was not near the bows of the two vessels, but somewhere near the sterns.\nIt is to be observed that the evidence to support this finding was admitted against the protest of the defendants' counsel, made at the beginning of the trial, and that no application was made to amend the preliminary act or the pleadings.\nIn fact, the statement of claim was not amended until after the judgment and then on the invitation of the judge.\nThe rule requires that a preliminary act should be filed so that particulars of the rival cases set up on behalf of the two ships which are alleged to have been in collision should be given when the facts are supposed to be fresh in the memory of both parties and the rule as to amendments is stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, vol. 1, page 94:\nAlterations or amendments will not be allowed in the preliminary act at the instance of the parties who have filed them, but, where a question in a preliminary act is insufficiently answered, the court, on the application of the opposite party, may direct the question to be properly answered and the preliminary act to be amended accordingly.\nThe plaintiffs should have been held to be bound by their preliminary act and such an amendment as was made here, if permitted, would defeat completely the object of the rule requiring the preliminary act.\nFurther, on the facts, the log is, of course, no evidence for the ship; but the legitimate inference is, where there is no entry or mention in the log, that the circumstances of the collision were such that if the true facts were entered they would be unfavourable to the vessel and weight must be given to this fact when the testimony is conflicting. Further, it is to be borne in mind that it is upon the libellant to shew by a fair preponderance of evidence that the collision happened and that it was the cause of the injury.\nOf the witnesses examined by the plaintiffs, Lagault, the second mate of the \"Neepawah,\" is the only one who says that he saw the collision, and he indicates a contact between a point on the \"Westmount\" between her aftermast and boiler-house and a point on the \"Neepawah\" about five feet forward of the stern, back of the deck-house altogether. The plaintiffs' other witnesses came to the conclusion that there was a. collision as a matter of inference. The engineer of the \"Neepawah,\" who was on deck, was not examined, although available.\nOn the other hand, for the defendants, seven members of the crew observed the passage of the vessels; they were necessarily only a few feet apart and they swear positively that the \"Westmount\" did not touch the \"Neepawah.\" The engineer who was on board, sent out under the builders' guarantee, was not examined because, at the time of the trial, he had returned to England.\nOn the facts, I am of opinion that it is abundantly proved that the vessels did not collide. I do not see how the breach of the rule as to crossing ships, referred to by the judge, can be applicable to the facts of this case; and if applicable, it is certainly not proved that a non-observance of the rule in any way contributed to the damage. The vessels were here not crossing ships; they were what is known as passing ships, in which case there is no statutory rule; it is merely a question of good seamanship.\nOn the whole, I would allow the appeal with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the local judge in admiralty of the Toronto Admiralty District, holding the SS. \"Westmount,\" owned by the appellants, liable for damages to the SS. \"Neepawah,\" owned by the respondents, arising out of an alleged collision between the two while passing each other in the Welland Canal, on the 20th of October, 1904, about 11.30 p.m.\nThe damage sustained by the \"Neepawah\" consisted in the breaking of two of her propeller blades by reason of the same coming in contact with a floating boom of timber about two feet wide at water's edge along the stone wall of the level of the canal between locks 23 and 24.\nThe \"Neepawah\" was going up the canal loaded with merchandise, drawing eight feet forward and twelve and a half feet aft. The \"Westmount\u201d loaded with grain to canal draft bound down. The steamers met and passed each other port to port in the level of the canal between the two locks, which level is about 800 feet long and 110 or 112 feet broad.\nThe steamers were each about 250 feet long, the \"Westmount\" 42 or 43 feet broad, and the \"Neepawah\" 41 feet. The night was dark and rainy, and there was much conflict as to the \"Westmount's\" contention that there was a strong breeze blowing at the time.\nThe plaintiffs' preliminary act was filed on the 22nd of March, 1906, some eighteen months after the damage occurred, and their statement of claim, on the 2nd of April, of the same year.\nIn such preliminary act it is stated that the parts of each ship which first came into collision were\nthe port bow of the \"Westmount\" and the port quarter of the \"Neepawah,\" abreast of the kitchen.\nThe statement of claim substantially repeated the preliminary act on this point though in somewhat different language, but without any correction of the statement in the preliminary act as to the parts of the two vessels which first came into collision and alleged that by reason of the \"Neepawah\" being so struck her screws came in contact with the boom and her propeller blades were broken. The captain of the \"Neepawah\" when afterwards giving his evidence on discovery stated that it was the bluff of the bow of the \"Westmount\" which struck him and drove his starboard quarter over the boom. In giving his evidence at the trial, he said that he did not know what part of the \"Westmount\" struck his boat, saying: \"It was the stern or midships or something.\" As he said he did not see any collision and was only giving an impression.\nThe \"Westmount\" in her statement of defence denied that there had been any collision between the steamers as charged and claimed that the damage to the \"Neepawah's propeller occurred by its coming in contact with the boom, without any contributory fault of the \"Westmount.\"\nThe parties went down to trial in April, 1907, on the issues thus raised by the preliminary act and the pleadings. There was, as is often the case, much conflicting evidence and, in the result, the learned judge found that there was an actual collision between the two steamers which caused the damage to the \"Neepawah's\" propeller, not, as charged in the preliminary act and the pleadings, from the bow of the \"West-mount\" striking the stern or quarter of the \"Neepawah,\" but from the stem of the \"Westmount\" striking the stern or quarter of the \"Neepawah\" as the former passed the latter and was straightening in order to enter the lock 24.\nThis was an entirely new and different case and opened up entirely new and different grounds of negligence, but the learned trial judge held that the plaintiffs' pleading\nhad not apparently misled the defendants and that the point as to the preliminary act and pleadings were not taken at the opening or early in the case and the plaintiffs might amend their pleadings as it seemed the defendants had not been prejudiced.\nWe are, however, clearly of the opinion that the learned judge was in error in holding that the plain tiffs' pleadings and preliminary act had not misled the defendants as to the case to be tried, and that he also fell into an error in thinking that the point had not been taken by the defendants at the opening or early in the case, and that the defendants had not been prejudiced.\nThe record shews clearly that the objection was taken as soon as the evidence of the first witness, Captain Patenaude, shewed that the plaintiffs were not going to stand by the statements in the preliminary act and the pleadings, but were about to put forward a new and different case. No application was made to amend the pleadings at the trial so as to enable the evidence to be given on the new and altered case. The captain of the \"Neepawah\" had been examined on discovery and had given his evidence confirming the case as put forward in the preliminary act and the pleadings. The defendants did not, therefore, have any notice of the contemplated change of front or of the new case they were called upon to meet.\nThat original case substantially charged the officers of the \"Westmount\" with so badly navigating their steamer that before her bow had passed the port quarter of the \"Neepawah\" it had negligently been run into or against such port quarter and inflicted the damage to the propeller by forcing it against the boom along the canal. The new case found by the learned judge and to meet which the pleadings were directed to be amended was that the \"Westmount's\" stern had been swung against the \"Neepawah's\" stern or quarter. It was an entirely new case,. involving questions of negligence on the \"Westmount's\" part different from those involved in the case as originally stated in the preliminary act and pleadings and calculated greatly to prejudice the defendants. It was not one which, in our opinion, should, under the circumstances, and at the time, have been allowed. It is not necessary for us, in the view we take of this case, to determine whether in any case the court would allow a party at the hearing to contradict his own preliminary act. The authorities collected in Williams & Bruce's Admiralty Practice (3 ed.), at pages 368-9, seem clear that, at any rate, applications to amend mistakes in the preliminary act will not be entertained by the court. The object of the rule requiring these preliminary acts is to obtain a statement recenti facto of the leading circumstances of the case so as to prevent either party varying his version of the facts to meet the allegations of his opponent. The preliminary act must, therefore, remain as it was prepared and filed and will not itself be allowed to be amended. But the same rule does not necessarily follow with respect to the pleadings.\nIn the case of \"The Frankland\"[17], in 1872, Sir Robert Phillimore allowed an amendment to be made in the defendants' answer, but refused to allow any in the preliminary act, saying the objection to the latter did not apply to an amendment to the answer as the application was made before any evidence had been taken. Afterwards, in 1881, in the case of \"The Miranda\"[18], the same learned judge in refusing an application to allow a mistake in a preliminary act to be amended, even though the application was made before the hearing of the suit, observed that he adhered to the practice he had always followed of refusing to allow amendments to the preliminary acts. But he went on to say, at page 186:\nThe parties in an action of damages are not bound, in their pleadings, to repeat any error or omissions which may exist in the preliminary acts, and it is open to them in their statement of claim or statement of defence to state correctly any facts which may have been omitted or erroneously stated in their preliminary acts.\nFrom these authorities it would appear that the statement in the preliminary acts are not absolutely binding on the parties making them if they have been corrected in the pleadings before evidence has been taken.\nIn the following year (1883), in the case of \"The Eugenie\", Mr. Justice Butt is said, in a note to Williams & Bruce, Admiralty Practice (3 ed.), at page 368,\nto have intimated that if the parties in damage suits chose to avail themselves of pleadings framed in accordance with the forms ap- pended to the new rules so that the pleadings afforded the court no sufficient information, the parties would be held by him most strongly to the statements contained in their preliminary acts; and that any mistake or incorrect statement in the preliminary act of either party would be visited most strongly against the party on whose behalf it was filed.\nIt would, therefore, appear that an error or misstatement of a material fact in the preliminary act is not absolutely fatal or binding on the party making it. Such a mistake may be rectified in the pleadings afterwards, and, if so rectified, will be a subject for comment at the hearing. But, if the parties go to trial without pleadings, or prepare pleadings which do not correct the errors or mis-statements of the preliminary act, and do not afford the court sufficient information, in those cases, the parties will be held most strongly to their preliminary acts.\nNow, in the case before us, there does not appear to have been any application to amend the pleadings before trial or any chance given to the defendants to shew prejudice. The parties had gone down to trial on a clear and distinct issue respecting the navigation of their ships. The pleadings did not correct the grave and important error of the preliminary act of the \"plaintiffs. The evidence shewed and it is admitted that the plaintiffs' claim as formulated in the preliminary act and pleadings could not be sustained. In addition to that it appeared in the evidence that, on the occasion of the alleged collision, the captain of the \"Neepawah\" did not make any complaint against those aboard of the \"Westmount,\" either to them or to the lock-master or any one else; that, in the discharge of his duty, he had shortly afterwards entered the fact of his loss and damage in his log-book, as follows:\nBroke my wheel between lock 23 and 24 at 11 p.m., weather very dark, no wind; start to blow S.S. West at 1.30 a.m., Friday. Not a word or hint of their having been any collision between the steamers or that the \"Westmount\" was in any way responsible for the breakage. Then, although the captain stated he had made a protest at Fort William and notice to produce it had been given, no protest was produced. In matters of this kind where serious loss and damage have been caused by collision and consequent demurrage, it is common knowledge that protests are made as soon after the accident or injury as reasonably possible, so as to record the facts officially and to enable the owners to recover their insurance.\nAll these circumstances combined to require a very strong and plain case to be made out before an amendment, practically substituting, at the conclusion of the trial, a new case for the one originally formulated, should have been made, and, in my judgment, no such case was made out.\nBut, taking the judgment as it stands, I am not able to concur in the finding of fact. One witness, and one only (Legault), pretends to speak from sight or knowledge of the actual collision having taken place as found by the learned trial judge. His evidence, however, on the point, is directly opposed to a large mass of testimony of the officers and men of the \"Westmount,\" confirmed by that of the lock-master, Hillman and to some extent by that of the lock-master, Jordan, that the propeller was broken before the vessels could assume the relative positions in which the judgment finds they touched each other. At the moment when the propeller was heard to break, these witnesses concur in stating that the \"Westmount\" was one-half way or, at the most, two-thirds way past the \"Neepawah,\" according to some of them, the bow of the latter had swung out, whether caused by the wind or by some other cause, and the reversing of her screw had caused it to break against the boom. The position of the bow of the \"Westmount\" at the time the propeller broke was, according to these witnesses, about abreast of the port quarter or stern of the \"Neepawah,\" while the stern of the \"Westmount\" would necessarily not then have passed the \"Neepawah's\" bow. But the case, as originally framed, that the bow of the \"Westmount\" then collided with the stern quarter of the \"Neepawah\" has been abandoned as untenable and the new case attempted to be set up is absolutely inconsistent with the mass of testimony shewing that the propeller was broken before the bow of the \"Westmount\" passed the stern of the \"Neepawah.\" This most important fact seems to be corroborated by the evidence of the captain of the \"Neepawah\" himself.\nNo good purpose can be gained by a critical analysis of each witness's evidence. The contradictions are impossible of reconcilement. The only witness, McLeavy, who above all others had the best chance to see whether the stern of the vessels collided at the place and moment found, distinctly and emphatically denied it and said that their sterns passed each other at least three feet apart.\nThe learned judge has, I venture to think, misunderstood this witness's testimony.\nThe effect, it seems from the judgment to have produced on his mind, was that the witness swore \"he saw the sterns come together\"; which, I think, from the way he quotes the statement, the learned judge understood as actually colliding. Now, a reference to this witness's evidence shews that, being a fireman, he ran up to see the boats passing and stood on the port quarter, opposite the towing machine, aft of all the deck-houses, leaning over the side with his arms on the rail, and did not see the \"Neepawah\" until they were, at least, half-way past each other. The bluff of the \"Neepawah's\" bow was about ten feet away from the \"Westmount's\" amidships, when he first noticed the other vessel. The sterns of the vessels were about three feet apart at the time they passed each other. The \"Neepawah's\" engines were stopped when he got abreast of her stern and he heard nothing and did not know the wheel had broken before he reached the lock. In response to the judge's question:\nCan you say definitely, now, whether the boats touched?\nhe answered,\nYes. I am sure the boats didn't touch.\nNow, the position this witness stood in enabled him to see and judge on this crucial point better than any one else. His evidence confirms that of the witnesses who proved that the propeller broke before the sterns came near each other at all. In point of fact, it had broken before he came on deck, as the engines had then stopped. So far from the judge discrediting this witness, he appears to have accepted him as a truthful witness, though at the same time misunderstanding what he said.\nOn the whole and recognizing the full difficulty of reconciling the conflicting testimony of the witnesses, I have concluded that it clearly appears the plaintiffs failed to make out the new case of negligence he was permitted to set up.\nI do not desire to be understood as assenting to the assumption of the trial judge that the rules with respect to crossing steam vessels applied under the circumstances to these steamers, nor is it necessary for me to express any opinion whether the canal level was a narrow channel within the meaning of the rules or not.\nMy decision is based, first, upon the ground that there was no evidence at all to sustain a finding for the plaintiff, on the case as set out in the preliminary act and the pleadings; that, under the facts as proved, it was not proper to have made the amendments allowed after the trial and so set up an entirely new and different case from that stated in the preliminary act and pleadings, and that the preponderance of the evidence is clearly against the plaintiffs even on the new case set up.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court below, and judgment given for the defendants, dismissing the action.\nIdington J. agreed that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred with Davies J.

The evidence left some doubt whether the duties of deceased included the inspection and care of the wires both inside and outside of the power-house, or whether his engagement was to perform the duties in question in respect only to the wires outside the power-house walls.\nHeld, that the onus of proof as to the point in dispute was on the defendants and, such onus not having been satisfied, they were liable in damages.\nJudgment appealed from affirmed, Davies J. dissenting on a different view of the evidence, and holding that the duties of deceased included the inspection and care of the interior wiring.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, whereby the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe material circumstances of the case and questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nAlleyn Taschereau for the respondent,\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014This action was brought by the widow of the deceased, one Wilfrid Guimont, to recover damages from the company for the death of Guimont caused by an uninsulated wire in the power-house of the company, at Montmorenci.\nThe question as to the liability of the appellant company for the death of the deceased turns entirely upon whose duty it was to see that the wires were sufficiently and properly insulated.\nIf this was part of deceased's duty as line-foreman, then it is quite clear that his death consequent upon his failure to discharge it could not be charged against the company or held to be merely contributory negligence on his part.\nIn the case suggested his own neglect would be clearly the cause of his death, and of course it could not be contended successfully that a company or employer who engaged a man for the special duty of seeing that dangerous wires transmitting electricity were kept properly insulated could be held liable for his death in case that death was caused by his own neglect of duty.\nI have examined and considered the evidence upon the crucial question as to the duty of the deceased with respect to the wires of the company passing into and through the power-house, and, in my opinion, the evidence of Mr. Doddridge, the superintendent of the company, and of Langford, described as the company's master mechanic, leaves no room for reason- able doubt that it was as much the duty of the de- ceased to inspect and keep in repair the electric wires running into and through the power-house as those parts of the wires outside of the power-house. With respect to the latter his duty was admitted and I think the positive testimony of the officers I have mentioned as to deceased's duty in inspecting and keeping the wires in the power-house properly insulated and repaired and his frequent and regular visits to the power-house for the ostensible purpose of discharging that duty leave no room for reasonable doubt on the point or on his understanding of it.\nAs the death of the deceased was caused by his negligently passing or attempting to pass under a wire within the power-house which had become uninsulated and out of repair and which it was his special duty to keep insulated and repaired, I think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nIdington J. concurred with Maclennan J.\nMaclennan J.\u2014After a very careful consideration of this case I am of opinion that we ought to dismiss the appeal.\nThe question is whether, upon the evidence, the condition of the wires which caused the death of the plaintiff's husband was due to his own neglect of duty; whether in fact the deceased was the person whose duty it was, as the servant of the defendants, to have inspected the wires and to have repaired their defective condition.\nThe company have a power-house at Montmorenci Falls, from which they supply light and power to the City of Quebec and other places by means of over- head electric wires.\nThe power-house contains a very large number of wires, some of them of very high voltage. These or most of them, are strung high overhead. A platform, three or four feet wide and fourteen feet above the floor, stretches across from side to side and is only reached by a moveable ladder.\nThe deceased was foreman of the company's linemen, and was subject to the orders and direction of Mr. Doddridge, the company's superintendent, and of Mr. Langford, their master mechanic. Mr. Doddridge describes his character and qualities as \"splendid\" and Langford describes him as \"a good man,\" \"a man in whom he had every confidence,\" \"a man that knew his business,\" \"a very competent man,\" \"one of our best men.\"\nIt is not disputed that his duty was, with the assistance of men under him, to keep the company's wires, outside of the power-house, in order. But the accident having occurred within the power-house, the question is whether he had any duty of inspection and repair over the wires, or those parts of them, which were within the power-house.\nIt is in evidence that, about six months before the accident, he had, in obedience to special directions, changed the positions of two wires in the power-house. In their changed position, these two wires crossed the platform, at a considerable angle, and about two and a half feet above it.\nOn the day of the accident he had been directed to change some other wires and, with an assistant, had climbed the platform, by means of a ladder, to prepare to do the work directed. While passing under the wires, which he had placed six months before, he was killed by contact with one of them and it was found that for about ten inches, immediately over the platform, one or both of the wires had not the usual or any isolation coating upon them. But there is no evidence how that defect had arisen, or how long it had existed.\nSeveral witnesses say that the duties of the deceased were confined to the lines or wires outside the power-house, except when he received special orders. Mr. Doddridge says that he, Doddridge, solely had charge of the linemen, including the deceased, but he does not say that the deceased had any duty of inspection within the power-house.\nWhat he says rather suggests the contrary; he says:\nHe had charge of all the linemen, what we call all the outside linemen of all the high tension work, of the main line work, and work around the power-house.\nThe only witness who says that the deceased had any duty of inspection within the power-house is Mr. Langford. He says positively that he had the duty of inspecting the wires within as well as those without the power-house, and to see that they were in good order. In cross-examination, however, he says he did not know whether there was any written agreement with the deceased, and that that would come under Mr. Doddridge's position.\nHe did not know who engaged the deceased, but he was under Mr. Doddridge,\nwhich I take to mean that the duties of the deceased must have been arranged between him and Mr. Doddridge. When pressed whether deceased was obliged to inspect the wires inside the power-house, his answer was: \"He was engaged as line-foreman.\" Then he says he himself had charge of the power-house, had a mechanic for the power-house,\nwho is specially appointed to take care of the power-house, and for the inspection of the different works in the power-house, dynamos, \" and water-wheels, and that sort of thing.\nThere is no witness who says he ever saw the deceased do anything in the power-house, during all the six years of his employment, except upon special instructions.\nI think the proper conclusion is that there is no sufficient evidence that the deceased, as the servant of the defendants, had the duty of inspecting and repairing the live wire which caused his death.\nI also think that this conclusion is greatly strengthened by the high character given to the deceased by Doddridge and Langford, his superior officers. It is not to be supposed, without very clear testimony to the contrary, that such a man would have neglected to inspect the wires in the powerhouse, as well as those without, and to discover and repair the defective and dangerous wire which caused his death, if it had been his duty to do so.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014The only point seriously in dispute on this appeal is whether or not the husband of the respondent was entrusted with, as one of the duties of his employment, the responsibility of seeing to the safe insulation of the wires from which he received the shock which caused his death.\nOn this question the onus was on the appellants and, after a careful examination of the evidence, I agree with the court below that that onus has not been satisfied.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lavergne & Taschereau.\n"}

Pacaud (Defendant) Respondent.\n1908: February 27; 1908: May 5.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nTitle to land\u2014Construction of deed\u2014Easement appurtenant\u2014Use of common lane\u2014Overhanging fire-escape\u2014Encroachment on space over lane\u2014Trespass\u2014Right of action.\nA grant of the right to use a lane in rear of city lots \"in common with others,\" as an easement appurtenant to the lots conveyed, entitles the purchaser to make any reasonable use, consistent with the common user, not only of the surface but also of the space over the lane. The construction of a fire-escape, three feet wide with its lower end 17 feet above the ground (in compliance with municipal regulations), is not an unreasonable use nor inconsistent with the use of the lane in common by others; consequently, its removal should not be decreed at the suit of the owner of the land across which the lane has been opened.\nJudgment appealed from affirmed, Maclennan J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent purchased several lots shown on a plan of subdivision of a block of land fronting on St. Catherine Street, in Montreal, from the plaintiff's auteurs \"with the use in common with others\" of a lane in rear, 18 feet in width, leading from Drummond Street to Mountain Street, and giving access to the property from the last mentioned streets. He constructed buildings upon the lots he had purchased extending from St. Catherine Street in the front to the line of the lane in rear, and subsequently, in accordance with the requirements of municipal regulations, erected a projecting staging or fire-escape on the rear wall of the building projecting about three feet over the lane, the lower portion being about 17 feet above the surface of the ground. Several other lots in the same sub-division were sold to other persons, who were also given the right of using the lane, in similar terms. The appellant, having purchased the remainder of the land thus subdivided, brought the action to compel the respondent to remove the fire-escape, claiming that the lane had been conveyed to him with the remainder of the property and that the respondent had trespassed thereon by so' erecting the overhanging fire-escape.\nThe action was dismissed by Dunlop J., at the trial, and this decision was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from, Boss\u00e9 and Trenholme JJ. dissenting.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nCampbell K.C. and Brosseau K.C. for the appellant.\nMignault K.C. and Beullac for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Davies J.\u2014The controversy between the parties to this appeal is as to the proper construction to be placed upon the clause of the defendant's deed which says that it was\nthe intention of the vendors to sell the land as therein described with the use in common with others of the said lane in the rear.\nThe premises are situated in the heart of the City of Montreal.\nThe appellant, who after the respondent had purchased his land became the owner of the lane in question subject, of course, to whatever rights the respondent and others had obtained over it by their deeds, claimed that such rights were simply rights of way and that the attaching by the respondent to his house of a fire-escape which for its width extended over the lane was in excess of his rights and in violation of the appellant's.\nThe courts below held that the respondent's rights were not limited to mere rights of way over the lane embracing access to and from his house, but that they included a reasonable use of the lane as such for all proper purposes not inconsistent with the common use of others entitled to use the lane or with the appellant's ownership of the soil. They held that the construction of the fire-escape complained of, in compliance and accordance with the municipal regulations, was such a reasonable use.\nI agree that, looking at the situation of the land and the buildings and of the parties with relation to the lane and the ordinary streets of the city, this construction is a correct one. I do not think a construction which gave the respondent a mere right of way in and over the lane and denied him the right to its use for the purpose of obtaining light and air for his house, the rear of which faced on the lane, would be a reasonable construction. As pointed out, such limited construction involved the right of the owner of the soil to build up the lane and exclude light and air from the windows of all the houses facing on it, provided a sufficient right of way was left over the soil. I cannot agree that this is a reasonable construction of the deed.\nThe common user by others entitled to use the lane is the test with which to measure the respondent's rights in the lane. Any user inconsistent with that common user would be illegal as would also any user interfering with the rights retained by the owner of the soil of the lane. It was not a question in this case as to the manner of the construction of the fire-escape or whether it came down too far or was too broad but simply whether or not his rights entitled him to put any fire-escape at all where he did. As far as the evidence goes, it seems to have been constructed in accordance with the municipal regulations, and the right to so construct it does seem to me to be a not unreasonable use of the lane and not necessarily to interfere with the common use of the lane by others entitled to such common use.\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I think that the instrument to be interpreted when read in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances attendant upon its execution does not provide merely for a passage way over the land in question, but for the more extended use of that space implied in such uses as were then being made of the same by other owners of adjoining properties claiming in the same right and to become users in common with the respondent. The primary use intended no doubt was to be that of a passage way and anything clearly inconsistent with that possibly might be complained of.\nThe case launched, however, was neither confined to nor substantially founded upon such a complaint.\nThe contention here seems an extreme assertion of a naked right of property the maintenance of which might injure others and do the appellant no good il my interpretation of the instrument is correct.\nThe language used is not that usually employed for a mere right of passage way.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs,\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in the Court of King's Bench, to which I may be allowed to add some further reasons.\nA lane is a way, a strip of land used for passage to and fro. It may be private, but it is usually owned by one person, who, or some antecedent owner, has given the right to use it to one or more other persons. That is the present case. One Laurie subdivided a nearly square piece of land fronting on St. Catherine Street, Montreal, into twenty-three building lots, with a lane eighteen feet wide running across the centre, from Mountain Street to Drummond Street and he or his representatives sold a number of these lots, extending from St. Catherine Street to the said lane in rear, to the respondent. In the deed, the north-west boundary of the land so sold is described as a common lane, and the interest in the lane which is conveyed is described thus:\nwith the use, in common with others, of the said lane in rear. It is plain, therefore, that the result of the conveyance was that the vendor remained owner of the lane and the purchasers became entitled to use it in common with others, that is, to use it as a way.\nWhatever right the respondent acquired was fixed once for all at the date of his deed. He has acquired no further right since.\nNow I will suppose that at that time the vendor still owned, and retained for his own use, some of the land on the other side of the lane, opposite to that of the respondent. Can it be doubted that he could build upon that land, excavating vaults and cellars and extending them beneath the lane to its full width? Or that he could project the upper stories of his buildings across the lane, for its full width, at a sufficient height, not to interfere with the use of the lane as a way?\nIt seems to me that there can be no doubt that he could do so. And, if he could, he could sell and dispose of those rights to any other person.\nIf that is so, it follows that, by the creation of his fire-escape, the respondent has been guilty of a trespass, and an illegal invasion of the appellant's property, and an unauthorized use of the lane otherwise than as a way.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brosseau, Cholette & Tansey.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Goldstein & Beullac.\n"}

The judgment entered at the second trial was affirmed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe principal contentions on the appeal were, that the only negligence relied on in the courts below was the character of a sloping platform at which the accident complained of occurred and, as to which, there was no evidence of faulty or negligent construction; that the case came directly within the authority of Crafter v. The Metropolitan Rway. Co.([2]) ; that the injuries sustained resulted from the fault of the plain tiff in failing to look out for the train when he was running towards the yard tracks and aware that the usual operations of shunting were being carried on; that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury on account of contributory negligence by the plaintiff, and that the judge's charge to the jury was misleading and had not been properly corrected after objections had been taken by counsel and the jury re-called for further directions by the judge.\nW.

In this case a specific objection to the charge of the trial judge was taken at the trial, and the trial judge was asked to correct his charge on the point in question by giving a specific direction to the jury, and that request was complied with.\nIn these circumstances it would, I think, be a violation of the principle referred to as well as a, depar- ture from the settled course of this court to give effect at this stage to the contention that the direction thus requested to be given, and thus given, was an erroneous direction.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Lougheed, Bennett & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

W. entered into two of the five contracts, sold a quantity of sand and then sold the property, without notice to B., who brought an action claiming his share of the profits that would have been earned if the five contracts had been entered into and fully carried out.\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. and Maclennan J. dissenting, that the undertaking by W. to enter into the five contracts was absolute and having by the sale put it out of his power to perform it he was liable to B. who was entitled to damages on the basis of the contracts having been carried out. Held, also, Duff J. hesitante, that the clause quoted did not modify the rigour of the absolute covenant by W. to procure these contracts in any event.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (10 Ont. W.R. 732) reversed, and the judgment of the Divisional Court (9 Ont. W.R. 48) reversing that of Anglin J. (8 Ont. W.R. 4) restored.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of a Divisional Court[2] which reversed that of Anglin J.[3] on appeal from the report of a Master to whom the case was referred for assessment of damages.\nThe parties to the appeal entered into an agreement in the following terms\u2014dated Sept. 8th, 1904.\n\u201cWhereas, the said Willox is the owner of parts of lots 4 and 17 of the Township of Stamford in the County of Welland, and the same is intended to be worked as a gravel pit.\n\u201cWhereas, the said Willox is about to enter into certain contracts hereinafter referred to for the supply to certain persons and corporations of sand from said gravel pit.\n\u201cWhereas, the said Willox has requested the said Battle to assist him financially in the development of said gravel pit, and in the carrying out of the said contracts, and the said Battle has consented upon certain conditions.\n\u201cNow this agreement witnesseth that in consideration of the hereinafter mentioned mutual covenants, promises and conditions, the parties hereto do hereby mutually covenant, promise and agree to and with each other in manner and form following, that is to say:\u2014 \u201c1. The said Willox is to enter into contracts as follows:\u2014With the Canadian Niagara Construction Company, Limited, for the supply of from 15,000 to 25,000 yards of sand; with M.P. Davis, for the supply of about 25,000 yards; with A.C. Douglass, for the supply of about 10,000 yards; with H.D. Symmes, for the supply of about 10,000 yards; with the Electrical Development Company, Limited, for the supply of about 15,000 yards; all at a price not less than 85 cents a yard delivered at their respective works, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties hereto.\n\u201c2. The said Battle is to become indorser on promissory notes made by the said Willox not exceeding in amount the sum of $5,000 in consideration whereof the said Willox hereby grants the said Battle the right to elect at any time within the next 60 days from the date hereof, between taking a one-fourth interest in all the profits arising out of the above mentioned contracts, and to purchase upon payment to the said Willox of the price or sum of $5,000, a one-third interest in the gravel pit together with a one-third interest in all the business done or transacted since the date hereof, or in prospect of being done or transacted. The intention being in the event of the said Battle availing himself of the latter option that he will share as a one-third partner in all business done from the date hereof.\n\u201c3. The said Willox hereby agrees to give and does give to the said Battle a lien upon the gravel pit being parts of lots 4 and 17 in the Township of Stamford aforesaid for any and all moneys the said Battle may be called upon to pay because of his acting as indorser as aforesaid. In the event of the said Battle being called upon to pay as herein mentioned, and his electing to take a one-third interest as above mentioned then the said payments shall be allowed and credit given the said Battle on account of the purchase price of $5,000 before referred to.\n\u201c4. Each of the parties hereto agrees to account to the other for any and all moneys received or expended in connection with the said gravel pit so long as this agreement shall last, and to keep proper and correct accounts of his dealings in respect of the same and to allow the other to inspect the said accounts.\n\u201c5. In the event of either party desiring to sell his share or interest he shall first offer the same to the other party for the same price or sum that the party desiring to sell has offered his share or interest for sale, and the other party shall have one week within which to purchase the same.\n\u201c6. Each of the parties hereto agrees to carry out this agreement to the best of his ability according to the true intent and meaning of the same and to do what he can of mutual benefit to the parties hereto.\u201d\nThe respondent, Willox, entered into contracts for supplying sand with M.P. Davis and A.C. Douglass in Sept., 1904, and considerable quantities were delivered thereunder. In Dec., 1904, he sold the property for $35,000 and out of the proceeds paid notes indorced by Battle pursuant to his agreement. The latter then brought an action claiming as damages the profits he would have received if the five contracts had been procured. The only defence pleaded was that Battle had not carried out the contract on his part and had released defendant from performance thereof.\nAt the trial consent minutes of judgment were filed by counsel adjudging defendant guilty of a breach of said contract by reason of his having put it out of his power to perform the same by selling the property and referring it to a Master to assess the damages. The reference declared that defendant should pay to the plaintiff one\u2011fourth of all or any profit which would have arisen from the contracts in the said paragraph (par. 1 of the agreement) mentioned.\u201d\nThe Master assessed the damages on the basis of defendant having undertaken to procure the five contracts mentioned in the agreement absolutely and in any event considering that the judgment pursuant to which the reference was made had so determined. On appeal from his report Mr. Justice Anglin set it aside and sent it back to have the damages assessed on a different basis and evidence admitted tendered by defendant of his inability to procure three of the contracts, which the Master had refused to receive. An appeal to the Divisional Court resulted in the judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin being reversed and on a further appeal to the Court of Appeal it was restored and the decision of the Divisional Court reversed. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nT.F. Battle for the appellant.\nCollier K.C. and Griffiths for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The questions involved in this appeal depend upon the true construction of the contract entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant in September, 1904. Another difficult question arose out of the reference made by the learned trial judge to the Master in order to have the damages assessed.\nI feel strongly inclined to the opinion expressed by the majority of the Divisional Court that the Master was right in holding that the defendant\u2019s liability was settled by the trial judge to have been an absolute one extending to all the five contracts mentioned in the agreement sued on and that it was not open to him on the reference to receive evidence of the refusal of several of the five parties to enter into their contracts and so enable defendant to escape the damages he was otherwise liable for.\nI do not desire, however, to base my judgment on that ground but upon the true construction of the agreement itself, and on this ground I concur in the unanimous judgment of the Divisional Court and the dissenting judgments of Chief Justice Moss and Riddell J., in the Court of Appeal, and think the Master bound under the contract to assess the damages as he did, on the ground that the defendant\u2019s covenant sued on was an absolute one.\nThe question is really whether the covenant or agreement entered into by the defendant was an absolute one with respect to the entering into of the five several contracts with the parties mentioned for the supply to each of them of the specified number of yards of sand and at the prices named, or whether it was a qualified agreement conditional on the several parties respectively entering into their contracts and binding on him to the extent only that they did so enter.\nI am of the opinion that it was an absolute undertaking on defendant\u2019s part on the faith of which the plaintiff entered into an absolute covenant on his part to furnish the funds\nnecessary for the development of the gravel-pit and in the carrying out of the said contracts.\nI think the fact that almost immediately after the contract sued on was entered into the defendant applied to plaintiff to carry out his covenant and indorse promissory notes made by the defendant to the amount of $5,000, and that the plaintiff indorsed these notes when requested to do so shews very strongly what the parties themselves thought was the nature of their mutual and respective covenants, which fact would be important if the language of the covenant is held to be ambiguous.\nThe majority judgment of the Court of Appeal is avowedly based largely upon the application to the clause of the agreement sued on of its sixth clause which provides that each of the parties agrees to \u201ccarry it out to the best of his ability according to the true intent and meaning of the same.\u201d The argument is that the general clause qualifies the absolute character of the language used in the first clause defining what the defendant bound himself to do and reduced the covenant down to one to do his best only. I cannot think that such is the meaning or intention of this sixth clause. I prefer to accept the construction placed upon it by the Chief Justice and Riddell J. who held that the clause obviously applied and should be confined to the case as it would be if and when the parties became partners as provided in the agreement. The clause never was intended to qualify the mutual covenants of the parties respecting their primary undertakings which were the essence of the contract entered into and were absolute in their terms. But it was a clause peculiarly applicable to the con- ditions which would exist if and when these primary undertakings were carried out and the partnership relations assumed. If it had been intended to qualify the absolute language used in the mutual covenants of clauses one and two, one would have supposed that the few simple words necessary to do so would have been used in the clauses themselves or if inserted in any other part of the agreement would have been put in clear and unambiguous language. As the Chief Justice pertinently says:\u2014\nIn the case of no partnership the words have no suitability or special fitness to the plaintiff\nor to his covenant, and it seems a somewhat forced construction which attempts to apply them to the defendant\u2019s undertaking to enter into contracts with five specified companies for specified quantities of sand at specified prices.\nAssuming the sixth clause not to apply to the respective covenants of the parties then the question is reduced to this: Were these covenants absolute ones or were they conditional only?\nThis does not seem to me to be a case coming within the rule of construction formulated by Blackburn J. in Taylor v. Caldwell[4], and accepted by a majority of the Court of Appeal in Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton Edridge & Co.[5], as to this contract contemplating the continued existence of some particular specified thing in which case the perishing of the thing without default of the defendant before breach would excuse performance by the party contracting. Nor does it come within the extension of that rule in Howell v. Coupland[6]. It is more analogous to such a case as Kearon v. Pearson, 1861[7], in which the thing contracted for is possible in itself and the contracting party is unable to perform it only through causes beyond his own control such as in that case an unexpected sudden frost, and in the case before us the refusal of the third parties to enter into the contract which the defendant had covenanted would be entered into. In such case, as said by A.L. Smith, M.R., in delivering judgment in Nickoll & Knight v. Ashton Edridge Co.[8] at p. 133, it is the party\u2019s own fault for undertaking unconditionally to fulfil a promise. In the case then before him in which he was delivering judgment the promise made as the court construed it, was a conditional one only.\nAnd so here it comes back to the question: Was the promise of defendant to enter into these five contracts an absolute or merely a conditional promise? Unless clause six of the agreement applies to and modifies the covenant it must, in my opinion, be held an unconditional promise.\nThe very essence of the covenant was the obtaining by the defendant of the five specified contracts set out, and the refusal of all or any of the parties to enter into them might easily have been anticipated or guarded against.\nThis covenant sued on formed the consideration for the covenant by plaintiff to indorse defendant\u2019s note for $5,000. That he should have absolutely bound himself so to indorse and assume all the risk of the third parties refusing to enter into their contracts would seem very strange. We cannot imply any qualification of an absolute covenant such as this. The nature of the covenant and the circumstances would not warrant such an implication. If the parties had intended any qualification of the language used it is their own fault not to have expressed it; but I think their subsequent conduct in obtaining plaintiff\u2019s indorsement of the $5,000 note a good indication of what they themselves thought the agreement meant.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Divisional Court with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Divisional Court of the 10th January 1907 be restored with costs of this appeal and that to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nI read the covenant as absolute.\nThe reasoning relied upon to qualify such absolute terms as used was rejected in the somewhat analogous case of Watson v. Charlesworth[9] and in appeal, Charlesworth v. Watson[10].\nThe Courts there held that the incorporation in the covenant itself of words of similar import to those in the subsequent covenant here relied upon to qualify could not be held as qualifying or restricting a covenant otherwise absolute.\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that we ought to dismiss this appeal. I agree entirely with the reasons for judgment given by the majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, and also with those of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIt was urged very strongly before us that the re- spondent should have pleaded that he had been unable to procure the three contracts in question, and not having done so, was precluded from proving it in the Master\u2019s office.\nI think it is an answer to that argument that there is no allegation in the statement of claim that those contracts had not been procured. And it is entirely consistent with the statement of claim that they had. The case alleged by the appellant is that the respondent had sold his sand pit, and failed to sell sand to the amount of 75,000 yards; and also that by selling he made it impossible to carry out his contract. Not a word about the agreements, or some of them, not having been procured.\nThe respondent failed to prove the various defences set up by him, and the judgment at the trial was a declaration that the defendant had been guilty of a breach of the contract, by reason of having put it out of his power to perform it by selling the sand pit. To this was added a reference to assess the damages suffered by reason of that breach.\nIt is evident that the question whether the respondent could or could not have obtained the contracts, became material for the first time on the question of damages, and that the master\u2019s office is the proper place for the inquiry.\nDUFF J.\u2014Not a little difficulty arises upon the construction and effect of clause 6; and it has been with some hesitation that I have come to the conclusion that this part of the agreement does not relax the stringency of the earlier clause. Of this last mentioned clause\u2014after the most attentive consideration of Mr. Collier\u2019s concise and forcible argument\u2014I think the construction advanced by the appellant is the true construction.

(dissenting).\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The testator, Alfred John Marks, then resident in the Town of Nelson, in British Columbia, made his last will and testament there, on the 6th of May, 1904. He devised certain real estate described as lot No. 10, in Nelson, on trusts expressed by words I quote (so far as relative to questions raised herein), to pay, out of the rents and profits, a mortgage,\nand pay my wife, during her life, the sum of fifty dollars, monthly, * * * and while continuing the said monthly payment to my wife as aforesaid, my trustees shall pay quarterly all the surplus left out of the rents and profits so issuing and arising from said lot ten to my children, Harriet Ann, Euphia Jane, and Alfred Edwin, in equal shares.\nAnd, after decease of my said wife, upon trust, that my trustees shall sell and convert into money the said lot and divide the proceeds of such sale and conversion among said children * * * in equal shares.\nThese were children of an early marriage by a wife who had died in their infancy and previous to the alleged second marriage now in question. The appellant alleges she was, after the first wife's death, married to the testator in Buffalo, in the State of New York, in the year 1873.\nThe respondent was undoubtedly, unless for such bar as the said Buffalo marriage created, married to him in British Columbia, on the 19th March, 1902; lived with him as his wife until his death, on the 8th of October, 1904, and was fully recognized meantime as his wife.\nThe contention is now set up that we are bound in law, no matter what we may consider to be the intention of this testator, under all the facts and surrounding circumstances which I think we are entitled and bound to consider in the interpretation of this will, to hold that the appellant is entitled to receive the bequests made by the said will to the wife of the testator in the language expressed above, if in truth she is shewn by the evidence to have been duly married to the testator, and not legally divorced from him, and, hence, at his death, his wife in law. And, as a clear consequence, apparently (though that is not to be disposed of here), the time of distribution must be the death of appellant and not that of the respondent.\nIn other words, it is claimed that there cannot be any one who can answer to that description \"my wife\" except the one person who may in law be decided to be such.\nI do not think the law so binds us.\nUnless it does, I do not see why we should pervert the most obvious intention of this testator. I think we are bound to read his language in light of all the circumstances that surrounded, and were known to him when he used it and give effect to the intention it discloses when so read. This proposition may seem to be in conflict with language that has been occasionally used by eminent authority. Expressions are here and there found to suggest that the will must first be read and if the particular language in question is free from ambiguity and in its primary or ordinary meaning consistent with all else in the will, no extraneous circumstances can be brought in evidence.\nThe case of Charter v. Charter[2] illustrates, better than any other I know of, how these expressions may be correctly used and applied. When they have been so applied as to exclude the surrounding circumstances, I cannot find such application to have been material or necessary for the determination of the case there in hand. Nor can I find any case that has expressly decided it would ever be improper to introduce and properly use such surrounding circumstances. I only refer to this lest such cases might be said to have been overlooked.\nI am content to adopt and act upon the following language of Lord Cairns, in Charter v. Charter[3]:\nThe court has a right to ascertain all the facts which were known to the testator at the time he made the will, and thus to place itself in the testator's position in order to ascertain the bearing and application of the language he uses.\nAnd substantially reiterated in the case of BathurstErrington[4], at page 706:\nIn construing the will of the testator * * * it is necessary that we should put ourselves, as far as we can, in the position of the testator and interpret his expressions as to persons and things with reference to that degree of knowledge of those persons and things which, so far as we can discover, the. testator possessed.\nHaving, in light of such surrounding circumstances, come to the conclusion I am about to express, it is not necessary to determine absolutely the status of either party hereto as wife.\nI, therefore, assume for the present that the appellant was duly married to the testator, as she alleges; though, even if in truth so, there may be great doubt of the fact having been duly proven here.\nNeedless, therefore, for me to go into more detail of the history presented than what in a general outline is necessary in order to find these surrounding facts and circumstances that were known to the testator and which can be properly considered here, and hence determine what the testator meant by the words \"my wife\" when used in his will.\nImmediately after the alleged Buffalo marriage, the appellant and the testator lived as man and wife with her father and mother in Kincardine, in Ontario, for three months and then took up house there. He was a house-painter, but so shiftless and improvident that he could not maintain his wife and sold everything in the house and left her at the end of eighteen months or a couple of years. He returned to Kincardine some months later, but in the course of a year or so he left her finally in 1878 and never saw her again.\nThey had no family. She then started to work as a milliner to support herself.\nHe wandered out west, kept thousands of miles away from her (except once when, in 1892, he was visiting in Ontario and Michigan, where she had lived meantime), and took, in course of time, to keeping tavern in Nelson, in British Columbia.\nThe respondent became his housekeeper in such business and they thereafter lived, from 1894, as man and wife, and, finally, got married as I have stated. The appellant had drifted over to Michigan and there formed the acquaintance of a man named Franckboner, became his housekeeper and, in 1888, took his name and lived with him as his wife. In the place where they lived, they had so managed things that everybody, on their adopting this mode of life, assumed they had been married and treated them accordingly until Franckboner died, in 1897. She then passed as his widow and, as one result, she got their dwelling house conveyed to her. She relates all this and yet denies she ever was married to Franckboner.\nIn 1892, the testator for some unexplained reason visited Kincardine and saw, amongst others, the appellant's mother; whom he met apparently on a friendly footing. We are left to speculate as to the reson for this visit and the results of it; as we are in a good many other respects where we should not have been, in regard to many things, in this curious history.\nIt is most improbable, when we come to consider the sequel, that the mother, whom she visited occasionally (though I cannot find her doing so as under the name of Mrs. Franckboner as early as 1892), was ignorant, or that he was left in ignorance by her, and by the appellant's sisters whom he saw on the same occasion in Detroit, of the Franckboner connection the appellant had formed.\nWe have to connect with such probabilities as arise thereon the fact, distinctly proven, that by a letter of the 22nd of April, 1904, he wrote her, in reply to a letter of hers, and addressed her as \"Annie Franklan,\" having, as the letter explains, not been able to make out the correct spelling of her name. He addresses her as \"dear Annie\" and signs as \"your friend, A. J. Marks.\"\nShe swears she had received, but destroyed, several earlier letters than this from him within the preceding five or six months and that the earliest of these was the first she had heard directly from him since he left her in 1878.\nShe attempts to give the contents of these previous letters. We may assume, as against her at least, that such letters were written and that she has correctly recalled the nature of the contents.\nIn the light of the previous history I have set forth, I cannot read these alleged contents of the missing letters or the contents of the one of the 22nd of April, 1904, which is placed before us, without being impressed with this,\u2014that the writer had long before not only heard of the change of name of the appellant, but also that she was no more his wife, whatever she may have been. The entire absence of any inquiry on the subject of how her change of name and all else in her situation came about leads to the conclusion that he had heard her history before then, and that, if ever he had been married to her, she had become divorced from him.\nMany trifling incidents cropping out of this correspondence tend to confirm such conclusions.\nThe will was written on the sixth of May following the last of the said letters. The testator was ill, he was going away for his health and wrote her from Spokane on the 10th of May, 1904, four days after the date of the will and acknowledged a letter he had received from her, evidently at Nelson, and I think probably answering the one above referred to of the 22nd of April. The times, the places, the circum- stances, including the preparation for his trip, point to the receipt of her letter as taking place a few days before the will was made. How do these people address each other? The testator continued to subscribe himself as \"your friend\" and address her as \"dear Annie.\" We are asked to find that the will of the writer intended to refer to this woman as his wife.\nEvidently, on this trip in 1892, he did not think it worth while, though so near to her place of abode, to try to see her. Why did he refrain? I think he may be credited with some considerations of a respectable nature prompting him to assume that she, so long abandoned by him, was married again, rather than accuse her of simple adultery.\nI refuse to believe that he ever looked upon the appellant, thenceforth, as his wife. Indeed, if we know no more, I do not think it would be an unfair inference to assume that he looked upon her as the lawful wife of another man. He was fully entitled to draw that inference. Why should I say he did not?\nHis treatment of her entitled her, if she had sought by legal methods, to have brought about that result. She says she did not. But am I to attribute to him a knowledge of that which she now asserts, and which is the most improbable part of her story, with the result of holding that he meant to designate her, when making the provision now in question for his wife? Am I to abandon all right of reason and common sense and impute to this testator an intention to provide for this appellant when the facts and circumstances surrounding the man repel any such thought?\nAt the date of this will the testator was informed (by appellant's assuming to address him as a friend named Mrs. Franckboner), as plainly as if she had said in so many words that she had, as she was entitled to on facts well known to him, procured a divorce and married again.\nHe acts on that, makes devises and bequests consistent therewith, and does not think it necessary to guard his designation by using a Christian name.\nIt seems to me quite as clear as if he had said in his will the woman who passes as my wife, by the name of Susan Marks, when it would have been held good by virtue of many authorities.\nIn Giles v. Giles[5], Lord Langdale, as Master of the Rolls, held as good a bequest by a testator named Giles to his wife Ann Giles, whom he married whilst her husband lived.\nBut there are the following cases which maintain the respondent's case, even without that.\nIn Pratt v. Mathew [6], at page 338, Sir John Romilly, the Master of the Rolls, held the phrase \"to my wife\" carried a bequest to her whom the testator had gone through the form of marrying, but whom, by reason of her having been a deceased wife's sister, he could not legally marry. And in the same case he held void a bequest to \"my children hereafter to be born\" though the said wife, so-called, with whom he lived until death, was then far advanced in pregnancy. We have here illustrated the contrast between the effect of the application of designatio personce and the force of the decisions as to after-born illegitimate children. Yet it had been urged that the phrase \"to my wife\" should be held applicable only to an after-taken wife whom he might legally have married. In Re Petts[7] the same judge held that a woman who had a husband still living when she married the testator was entitled to legacies given \"to my wife\" and \"my said wife,\" by the will of him with whom she contracted this second and void marriage.\nIn Re Howe[8], it was held, where separation by mutual consent had taken place and a ceremony of marriage gone through with another whom the testator had treated as his wife, that she took under the expression \"my wife.\"\nIn Anderson v. Berkley[9], it was held by Joyce J., that a bequest \"to my son's wife L., if she shall survive him\" was good, though she who lived with the son was not in fact his wife. The son had held her out as his wife, but the judge declined to speculate how far this would have affected the testator's mind, if he had known the truth.\nThere are thus presented decisions arising upon almost every shade of description of a woman as wife when not such in law save this case which presents a choice between two I assume to have been married in good faith to the testator. Does that make any difference?\nIn the result, I find that there was ample ground for the testator supposing that, if he had ever married the appellant, she had become the lawful wife of another and was no longer his wife and that he could not, at all events, should not be held to have intended the words \"my wife\" when used in his will to designate any other than she whom he had so recently married, without any imposition on her part as to her real status. We are asked to assume not only that he meant to designate, in so speaking of \"my wife,\" the presumable widow of another man, but also to make the inheritance of his children depend, for the time of its taking effect, on the death of that presumable widow, rather than on the death of her whom he daily greeted, in their correspondence, at the very time he was making such disposition of his estate, as \"dear wife,\" whilst greeting the other as \"dear friend.\"\nIn plain English, we are invited to accept as conclusive a chopping of legal logic rather than common sense.\nI prefer to read the ordinary meaning, the primary meaning, of the words used when read in light of surrounding circumstances in accordance with common sense, rather than treat as sound law, not that which has ever been so expressed, but the deductions asked to be drawn as possible from an extension of language that never yet has been so applied as asked to such an extraordinary condition as exists here.\nIndeed, I prefer to follow the warning implied in so many cases not to reduce the meaning of the language used to an absurdity.\nSince writing the foregoing, the report of Re Wagstaff; Wagstaff v. Jalland[10], in the Court of Appeal, reaches me and shews that a bequest by a husband to a \"widow\" during widowhood, was good though in law never legally married to him.\nThis seems to help to maintain the line of reasoning I adopt.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed. As to the costs I doubt if on an issue like this we have, where they are not by the terms of the issue given us to dispose of, any right to make them costs out of the estate. They should, it seems to me, have been reserved to await the determination of the issue or made by order directing the issue part of what we are to dispose of.\nIf ever there was a case wherein the costs should have, up to this appeal, come out of the estate, this certainly is one. The courts below have not so dealt with them, but only given the executors such costs, and I fail to see how we can interfere.\nMACLENNAN J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed.\nOne Alfred John Marks made his will on the sixth of May, 1904, at Nelson, B.C., and died there on the eighth of October afterwards.\nBy his will, he bequeathed an annuity of $50 per month to his wife, describing the legatee merely by the words \" my wife,\" and \"my said wife.\"\nThe plaintiff and defendant, respectively, claim to have been the lawful wife of the testator, at the date of his will and at the time of his death.\nAt the instance of the executors, an issue was directed to determine which of the two claimants is entitled to the bequest.\nThe issue was tried before the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, who decided it in favour of the defendant, and his decision was affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court. From that decision this appeal is brought.\nThe plaintiff's case is that she was legally married to the testator, at Buffalo, in the State of New York, on the 22nd of December, 1873; and. the defendant's case is that she was married to him on the 19th of March, 1902, at Nelson, in British Columbia.\nIt is clearly proved that, on the last mentioned date, the ceremony of marriage was performed between the testator and the defendant; and it is not disputed that this was a good marriage in law, unless the testator had then another living wife.\nIn my view of the case the only question in the appeal is whether there is sufficient evidence of the alleged marriage of 1873.\nIf the plaintiff has proved her marriage in 1873, she is entitled to succeed, for, in that case, she was the legal wife of the testator when he made his will; and no evidence is admissible to shew that the expressions \"my wife\" and \"my said wife\" contained in the will, as descriptive of the legatee, mean any other person than her who was then his legal wife.\nIn Ellis v. Houston[11], funds were directed by the testatrix to be divided between all the children of her brother. Some of them were illegitimate, born of the brother's wife before marriage, but treated by the testatrix as if legitimate. Held, that evidence could not be admitted to prove that the testatrix had directed the will to be so drawn as to include the illegitimate children and that she thought it had been so drawn.\nIn Re Fish; Ingham v. Rayner[12], in the Court of Appeal, there was a bequest to the testator's grandniece, without naming her. He had two grandnieces, one legitimate and the other illegitimate, and it was held that evidence could not be admitted to shew that the illegitimate niece was the one referred to in the will, although she was the one living in his house and called by him, his niece.\nIn Dorin v. Dorin[13], the testator married a woman by whom he had two illegitimate children, and by his will gave his property to his wife for life, and to dispose among our children by will, and, if no will, to be divided equally between my children by her. No children were born after the date of the will. Held, Cairns L.C., Hatherly, O'Hagan and Selborne L.JJ., that the personal estate, after the widow's life interest, was undisposed of, quoting Lord Eldon in Harris v. Lloyd[14] :\nI have not the least doubt that the testator meant illegitimate children, but I am clearly of opinion that there is not enough upon the face of this will to authorise me to carry that intention into effect.\nIn Hill v. Crook[15], the head-note says:\nIf there is a gift to children as a class, the law, if there is nothing in the will clearly to shew a contrary intention, will apply the gift to legitimate children only.\nThe effect of these cases I think is to establish the principle that in a will the word \"children\" or \"niece,\" or other word expressing relationship, prim\u00e2 facie means legal relationship, and no evidence dehors the will can be admitted to shew the contrary.\nThere are other cases to the same effect which might be quoted, and the only case which I have seen which might seem to decide otherwise is Re Howe[16], before Butt J., on a motion for probate. There a testator had, by mutual consent, separated from his wife, who had no issue, and, in her lifetime, went through a marriage ceremony with another, and, by the latter, had two children. By his will, he directed his property to be\ndivided equally between my two children, when the younger comes of age. The rest I leave to my wife, for her own use, to bring up the children, and after her death to be equally divided between my two children.\nThe motion seems to have been ex parte, and probate was granted to the second wife.\nThe learned judge seems to have thought there was enough on the face of the will, by the reference to the children, to shew that it was the second wife who was referred to.\nThe question then is whether there is sufficient evidence of the plaintiff's marriage to the testator in 1873. And it is proper to remark here that all the plaintiff's evidence, except that of one witness whose evidence is unimportant, was taken upon commission, and we are in a position to consider it with the same freedom as the learned judges below. This observation also applies to the defendant's examination for discovery, which was taken before the registrar and was read at the trial.\nThere are two classes of cases in which strict proof of a legal marriage is necessary, namely, indictments for bigamy, and actions for criminal conversation, \u2014 the one a criminal, and the other a quasi-criminal proceeding. In other cases, that is, in civil actions like the present, no such strict proof is required. Phipson on Evidence (3 ed.) 339; Piers v. Piers [17].\nThe learned Judge Irving, who gave the principal judgment in the Supreme Court, cites at length from the Dysart Peerage Case[18], at page 489, in which the question was which of two persons was entitled to a peerage,\u2014depending on the validity of the earlier of two alleged marriages.\nIn that case Lord Watson says:\nI see no reason why the direct and uncontradicted testimony of the person alleging the marriage, if corroborated, to some extent, by the indirect testimony of others, and supported by the facts and circumstances of the case, should not receive effect. But it will always be necessary, in a case of that kind, to test very strictly the statements given in evidence, by a woman interested in establishing that she held, and holds, the honourable status of a wife, and not the degrading position of a mistress.\nMr. Justice Irving seems to have thought that this language required him to find some corroboration of the plaintiff's evidence of the actual ceremony of marriage. I think, with great respect, that is not so. It is her testimony generally, and not her evidence of the actual ceremony, which he thinks should be corroborated to some extent by that of others, and supported by the facts and circumstances of the case. Their Lordships do not go so far as to say that the same strict proof of the ceremony is required as in bigamy, or criminal conversation, but that the testimony of the plaintiff is to be tested very strictly, by reason of the serious issues involved.\nI think it was not necessary to have any corroboration of the plaintiff's evidence of the actual ceremony, though I think even that is not wanting. There is the evidence of a marriage certificate, seen in due time afterwards by several witnesses, and references in letters of the testator written not long before his death to the plaintiff, and admitted in evidence without objection, corroborative of her story of the marriage. No attempt was made to cast any doubt upon the truth of her account of the ceremony, or upon its validity in law as related by her. But that is not all. The defendant admits, on her examination for discovery, that the testator told her before he married her, that he had been twice married and that his first wife was dead, and that he was separated from the second, that he shewed her a photograph which he said was that of his second wife, and which had the words \"Mrs. Marks\" on the back or side of it, in Mr. Marks's hand-writing.\nNow I think all that is very strongly corroborative of the plaintiff's account of the actual marriage; and, when to that is added the evidence of co-habitation immediately afterwards as husband and wife, in perfect respectability, for two or three years, first for several months in the family of the plaintiff's father and mother, and, afterwards in a dwelling of their own in the same village, and their repute and reception as husband and wife in the community during the same period, all proved by witnesses of undoubted character and position, her case is, in my opinion, satisfactorily made out.\nThe law makes the plaintiff a competent witness on her own behalf, and, upon a careful perusal of the whole of the evidence, I see no reason why she should not be believed.\nThere is no suggestion that there was a divorce obtained by her or by the testator. The defendant says that she never asked the testator whether there had been a divorce; that, before he married her, he told her that the woman whose photograph he shewed her was his second wife, and she \"supposed she was dead, or married, or something.\"\nThere is nothing to shew or suggest that the plaintiff was responsible for the separation which took place about three years after marriage, or for its long duration. The testator was unsuccessful in his business, sold out and went to the west, leaving his wife behind.\nI think it is not necessary to dwell upon their respective histories during their later years, save to say that there is nothing in the plaintiff's history, as frankly related by her, to lead me to think that she is other than a truthful witness, or that her evidence is not to be relied upon.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and that the issue should be found for the plaintiff.\nDUFF J.\u2014An ex facie valid marriage between the defendant and the testator and actual cohabitation by them as husband and wife from the time of that marriage until his death in 1904, are admitted.\nIt is also admitted that, from the year 1876, down to the year 1904, no communication of any kind took place between the testator and the plaintiff; and a correspondence begun in that year, whatever else it shews, certainly is not the sort of correspondence one would expect to pass between people regarding themselves as united by matrimonial ties. Moreover, the plaintiff, after the date when she alleges she became the wife of the testator, admittedly lived for many years with another man as his wife; received his property, after his death, and retained his name until, on the death of the testator, she made the claim which led to the present proceedings. I have no hesitation in saying that, in these circumstances,\u2014apart from the effect of any presumption that the testator did not, in marrying the defendant, commit a criminal act,\u2014a heavy burden of explanation rests upon the plaintiff.\nThat burden has not, in my opinion, been dis- charged. Outside of the circumstances mentioned, I find in the plaintiff's case so many grounds of suspicion that it would, I think, be wholly unsafe to accept it as sufficient to impeach the defendant's status as the wife of the testator\u2014a status of which, as I have mentioned, she was in the actual enjoyment at the time of his death.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Robert Wetmore Hanington.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor & O'Shea.\n[1] 13 B.C.

In an action to recover damages from the Crown, under article 1056 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada:\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (11 Ex. C.R. 119), that there was such negligence on the part of the officers and servants of the Crown as rendered it liable in an action in tort; that the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 16(c), imposed liability upon the Crown, in such a case, and gave jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court of Canada to entertain the claim for damages; and that the defence that deceased, having obtained satisfaction or indemnity within the meaning of article 1056 of the Civil Code, by reason of the annual contribution made by the Railway Department towards The Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Insurance Association, of which deceased was a member, was not an answer to the action. Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([19061 A.C. 187) followed. Appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] which maintained the respondent's petition of right with costs.\nThe suppliant, on behalf of herself and her children, claimed damages from the Crown, under the provisions of section 20(c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" (R.S. [1906] ch. 140), and article 1056 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, for the death of her husband who met his death in consequence of injuries sustained while he was in the discharge of his duty as a locomotive engineer in the employ of the Crown and in charge of the engine attached to a west-bound passenger train on the \"Intercolonial Railway\" (a public work of Canada), at DeLotbini\u00e8re station in the Province of Quebec, on the 26th of November, 1903. The suppliant charged that the employees of the Crown left the east-end switch of the siding in an unsafe condition, not properly locked nor set to take the main line; that no flagman had been placed to stop the westbound passenger train which was being driven by the engine in charge of deceased; and that the semaphores and signals were not set at danger.\nThe switch in question was what is known as a \"stub-switch\"; the pointsman had attempted to set the switch for the siding, moved the crank and target in such a manner as to indicate that the switch was open, but, owing to some alleged defect in the connecting bar, and possibly to the effect of a snow storm clogging the rails, the swing-rails failed to act as intended and take the line of the siding. The engineer applied the brakes on approaching the siding but the train was still moving at considerable speed, the driving wheels mounted the track at the points, left the main line and continued to run along the ties for a short distance when the engine was wrecked and the engineer received the injuries which caused his death. The evidence shewed that the target was for the main line; the bolts of the connecting rod were broken and the swing-rails, curved by the impact of the train, were set for the main line after the accident, and there was no padlock on the switch.\nThe defence raised the following points of law: (a) that no action in tort could lie against the Crown; (b) that any right of action given by the statute was personal and could lie only at the suit of the personal representatives of deceased; (c) that deceased, by his contract of employment, had released and discharged the Crown from any claims of the nature sought to be enforced; and (d) that the negligence alleged to have caused the accident was that of a fellow-servant of deceased and, consequently, there could be no liability on the part of the Crown. It was also charged that the deceased, by failing to obey rules and observe certain signals set against his train, had been himself' the cause of his own misfortune by contributory negligence.\nThe Exchequer Court judge, Burbidge J., held that there was a right of action under the 16th section of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" (now sec. 20) and that article 1056 C.C. applied; he found that deceased was, at the time of his death, a member of the \"Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Insurance Association,\" class C, and that, except that the suppliant had not accepted the insurance money to which she was entitled, the case was similar to Grenier v. The Queen[2]. The learned judge, following Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[3], and Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4], maintained the petition of right with costs.\nNewcombe K.C. (Deputy Minister of Justice) for the appellant.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and W. G. Mitchell for the respondent.\nNewcombe K.C. (Deputy Minister of Justice) for the appellant. Independently of statute the Crown is not liable; see cases cited and remarks by Strong C.J. in City of Quebec v. The Queen[5], at page 423. Section 16(c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" was not intended to create any liability which did not formerly exist. The full title of the Act \"An Act to Amend 'the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act' and to make better Provision for the Trial of Claims against the Crown' shews its scope and that it was not to give a remedy but to confer jurisdiction upon the court to give effect to an existing remedy. The trial judge derives the liability from the \"Official Arbitrators Act\"(33 Vict ch. 23, sec. 1; R.S.C. ch. 40, sec. 6), the jurisdiction of the official arbitrators having been transferred to the Exchequer Court by 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 58. Whatever jurisdiction may have been transferred to the Exchequer Court by this provision it did not impose any liability, and there is nothing to warrant the Exchequer Court in entertaining a petition of right based upon a wrong in respect of which the Crown cannot be under any liability unless imposed by statute.\nSection 16(c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" cannot be so construed as to create liability in this case, or to affect the application of the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona. See Broom's Legal Maxims (5 ed.), p. 909. The provision is apparently intended to afford jurisdiction for giving effect to claims of the kind mentioned where such claims can be independently established.\nThe right of action, if any, given by section 16(c) is a personal one and an action will only lie at the suit of the personal representatives of the deceased. That section does not by any implication give effect, as against the Dominion Crown, to the provisions of any provincial statute. A Dominion statute is not intended to receive as many different constructions as there are provinces in the Dominion. The section must receive a uniform construction all over the whole Dominion, for it was intended to operate in each part of Canada in precisely the same way and with precisely the same effect. Hence it is quite immaterial to consider the provisions of article 1056 of the Civil Code. An intention in favour of uniformity must be presumed unless a contrary intention be clearly expressed. In all the provinces legislation more or less closely corresponding to \"Lord Campbell's Act\" has been adopted. In all the provinces other than Quebec the right of action given by these statutes is certainly a representative one. In some of the provinces the action must be instituted in the name of the personal representatives of the deceased. In others the widow may sue in her own name. In Quebec, the Judicial Committee have considered, in Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co..[6], followed in Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[7], that the relatives have an independent and not a representative right. There is, therefore, no uniformity of provincial legislation to which the Dominion statute can reasonably be held to have had reference, and it becomes necessary, if the Dominion statute imposed a new liability, to determine, irrespective of the various provincial enactments, what is the nature of the claim, who may be claimants, and what is to be the measure of damages. It is for the jurisprudence of the Dominion courts to construe the statute and determine the extent of the liability. In the section, the words \"death\" or \"injury\" are coupled together. In the case of injury, only the person who may have a claim can sue, although others dependent upon him may be damaged to the same or even to a greater extent than if he had been killed. Equally in the case of death it would seem that the right of action must be represented in the same manner, that is by the personal representative or those claiming under the person.\nWhile the Judicial Committee have decided that article 1056 0.0. involved differences from the law governing actions under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" except in regard to such points, the law remains the same. The article is substantially the old statute of the Province of Canada (10 & 11 Vict ch. 6, C.S.C., [1859] ch. 78); The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[8], at pages 123 and 125, per Taschereau J.\nArticle 9 C.C. shews that article 1056 C.C. does not apply to the Crown. Special provisions affecting the Crown are also contained in certain articles of the Code shewing that the Crown is specially mentioned where it is intended that the Crown shall be affected. See article 1994 CO., considered in Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[9]; arts. 2,222, 2,286 and 2,211 to 2,216 C.C.; Maritime Bank v. The.Queen[10], and authorities there cited; Chitty's Prerogatives of the Crown, pp. 4 et seq., and p. 25; Attorney-General v. Black[11], per Reid C.J.; Monk v. Ouimet[12], per Dorion C.J. The result will be the same if the principles of the French common law be held to apply. Burlamaqui, \"Principes du Droit de la Nature et des Gens,\" vol. 4, pp. 98 et seq.; Vattel's Law of Nations (Chitty's translation), pp. 15 and 16.\nThe deceased by his contract of employment released and discharged the appellant from any claims of the nature of the present claim. The question is not to be governed by provincial law. If the Code is not to be looked to, the suppliant can have no right of action if deceased himself never had such right, and any defence which would have been available against the deceased, had he survived, may be set up in this action. Such is the established rule in actions under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\" Addison on Torts (6 ed.), pp. 604 et seq.; Griffiths v. The Earl of Dudley[13]. Deceased was a member of the Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Assurance Association, an unincorporated society, to the funds of which the Government of Canada contributes annually $6,000. It is obligatory on every railway employee to become a member of this association. One of its rules was that, in consideration of such contribution, the Government should be relieved of all claims for compensation for injury or death of any member. These rules were in force at the time of the accident, and had been in force throughout the whole period of the employment of the deceased, and the contribution by the Crown to the funds of the association had continued during the whole period. It was one of the terms of the contract under which the deceased sought and obtained employment that he would become a member of the association and be bound by its rules, and he agreed, in consideration of such employment, the contribution of the Government of Canada and the advantages to which he might, become entitled under the rules of the association, that the Government should be relieved of all claims for compensation arising from injury or death. He would therefore have been precluded from maintaining an action had he survived, and the suppliant is likewise precluded. Clements v. London & North Western Railway Co.[14]; Griffiths v. The Earl of Dudley[15]. The deceased thus obtained satisfaction, and his relatives have therefore no claim under article 1056 C.C., even if applicable.\nThe negligence alleged to have been the cause of the accident, was that of a fellow-servant of the deceased. On the principles just discussed, this defence is not to be judged by either English or French law, as such, but by the jurisprudence of the Exchequer Court proceeding on the principles of broad and general application, and, even if governed by Quebec law, the plea affords a good defence under that law. The principle underlying the doctrine of common employment is stated in Hutchison v. York, Newcastle & Berwick Railway Co.[16]. A servant when engaging undertakes, as between himself and his master, to run all the ordinary risks of the service (risque professionnel), and this includes the risk of negligence upon the part of a fellow-servant in the discharge of his duty as servant of the common master. It is not a positive rule establishing freedom from liability of employers in a particular class of cases, but the purely negative rule that, a servant having undertaken to accept the ordinary risks of his employment, the risk of injury arising from negligence of his fellow-servants is not an exception to such risks. The doctrine, only comparatively recently established, lays down no new principles. See Priestly v. Fowler[17] decided in 1837, in which the doctrine was first laid down, and Bartonshill Goal Co. v. McGuire[18], at page 306, per Chelmsford. L.C. The principles on which the doctrine is based are discussed by Lord Chancellor Cranworth in Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[19], at page 284, and further elaborated by Lord Chancellor Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[20], at pages 331-2.\nThe position is that, by the statute, a certain liability is imposed upon the Crown, and it is for the court to say what limitations, if any, are to be placed upon that liability. The Crown now asks, just as the first advocates of the doctrine asked, that its liability be so limited not because it is the law in England but because such limitation is a reasonable one. The jurisprudence of England is an illustration and not an authority on the question.\nThe Dominion Parliament recently passed the statute, 4 Edw. VII. ch. 31, providing against contracting out by railway servants. It does not apply in the case of Government railways, although it was competent for Parliament to pass similar legislation that would. Can the effect be the same? Is it immaterial whether such legislation is passed or not? If so, the effect of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" must be to make the Crown liable, unless the Parliament has said it will not be liable; in other words, that it is liable unless Parliament has said, not that it will, but that it will not be liable. In the Miller Case[21] it was decided that 4 Edw. VII. ch. 31 was valid, and (so far as the Province of Quebec is concerned) the statute only confirms the alleged existing law. But the Grand Trunk Railway Co. was, admittedly, subject to the laws of Quebec, and the Dominion is not. In the case of the Dominion Crown it is a question of creating the liability, and for this a Dominion statute is necessary.\nThe limitation of the liability by the jurisprudence of this court is by no means confined to the doctrine of common employment. A single other instance will suffice. Assume, as is suggested, that the Quebec law does not recognize the defence of contributory negligence (Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Boisseau[22]), yet it might certainly be properly and probably successfully invoked in the Exchequer Court. See Priestly v. Fowler[23]; Farwell v. Boston and Worcester Rd. Corporation[24]; Hutchinson v. York, etc., Ry. Co.[25]; Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[26], per Lam-worth L.J., at pages 285, 298, 300; Wilson v. Merry[27], at pages 330-331; Smith's Master and Servant (with notes on Canadian law) 6 ed., pp. 183, et seq. Even if the question is to be decided according to Quebec law, the plea of common employment affords a good defence under that law. It is not to be found in the Code, but it is not a matter positivi juris but is of a negative character. The law in Scotland, like the Code, is founded on the civil law. The House of Lords held that the doctrine obtained as much in Scotland as in England; and why? The Lord Chancellor, in Bartonshill Goal Co. v. McGuire[28], said: \"But it is said * * * there is no such law existing in Scotland. I own I was surprised to hear the assertion made, because I had assumed that the authorities in England had been based upon principles which were not of local application nor peculiar to any one system of jurisprudence. The decisions upon the subject in both countries are of recent date, but the law cannot be considered so; the principles upon which these decisions depend must have been lying deep in each system ready to be applied when the occasion called them forth.\" See also Canadian Pacifie Rail-way Co. v. Robinson[29], at page 125, per Taschereau J.\nIt has now to be considered whether or not there is anything in the Quebec jurisprudence which will support the claim that the doctrine does not obtain in that province. In 1865, in Fuller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[30], it was decided that a servant had no action of damages against his employer for any injury he might sustain through the negligence of his fellow-servants, that French law did not govern the case, and the Court of Review decided in accordance with the principles laid down in the English cases of Priestly v. Fowler[31] and Hutchinson v. York, etc., Railway Co.[32]. This was followed, in 1867, by Bourdeau v. Grand Trunk Co.[33], where it was decided that \"the\u201d plaintiff cannot recover damages from his employers, the accident having occurred through the . negligence of a fellow-servant. The plaintiff in entering the service of the company took the risk of these accidents upon himself.\" In Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[34], the question of common employment was not really raised, but Ramsay J., expressed an opinion that it was settled law in this country that the employer was liable for the want of skill of a fellow-servant, and added, \"We assimilate the want of skill of the fellow-workman to defective plant.\" That this is precisely what the English law does. It is an essential principle of common employment that a master is only relieved of liability if he has done his own duty by providing proper plant as well as properly qualified servants. In 1896, in Dupont v. The Quebec Steamship Co.[35] the Court of Review based its judgment on the use of defective machinery and Cimon J., adds: \"J'ajouterai que j'ai beaucoup de doute que Dupont puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 un fellow-servant, de l'\u00e9quipage du Muriel.\"\nIn 1887, in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[36], at page 114, we find an obiter dictum of Chief Justice Strong: \"This point (the negligence of a fellow-servant of the deceased) however well founded in fact would be an insufficient defence in point of law, for, according to the best French authorities, the rule of modern English law upon which that defence is founded is rejected by the French law which governs the decisions of such questions in the Province of Quebec,\" and he cited two French text writers, 31 Demolombe, No. 368, and 2 Sourdat, No. 911. Even assuming the French law were as settled as supposed, it is not correct to say that the decision of such questions in the Province of Quebec is governed by French law, especially when, as appears to be the case here, the decision of the courts depends on the express terms of the French Code. In 1894, in Filion v. The Queen[37], the above opinion of Strong C. J., is the only authority referred to by Burbidge J., for his judgment rejecting the defence of common employment, and the Supreme Court[38] on this point simply approved the judgment of the Exchequer Court. In The Queen v. Grenier[39], the Exchequer Court was reversed, the Supreme Court holding that the deceased had obtained satisfaction during his lifetime, and there is again an obiter dictum of Strong C. J., who says of the defence of common employment: \"There is no use in referring to authorities on this point as we are bound by our previous decisions regarding it.\" In The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Durand[40], at page 292, King J., delivering the judgment of the majority of the court, refers without comment to the previous cases of The Queen v. Filion37, and The Queen v. Grenier39, but he adds: \"Nor was the deceased a consenting party to the excessive quantity of dynamite being deposited near him, for the evidence shews that the deposit of such a quantity was contrary to the usual course of business.\"\nThe above appears to constitute the whole body of the jurisprudence of the Dominion and provincial courts on the question of the place in the law of Quebec of the doctrine of common employment. It really comes down to an obiter dictum of the former Chief Justice Strong. With all respect, this cannot be en- titled to much weight in a matter involving principles of such great consequence. There is nothing in either the law or jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec which can reasonably be set against the weighty and considered decisions of the House of Lords above referred to; decisions based, as they expressly claim, not on any peculiarities of English law or jurisprudence but on principles of broad and universal application.\nWe also refer to Ryder v. The King[41], per Nesbitt J., at pages 465, 466; Hall v. Canadian Copper Co.[42]; Slattery v. Morgan[43]; 12 Am. & Eng. Encyl. of Law (2 ed.) 901, notes as to the French jurisprudence respecting risque professionnel, and authorities there cited; Spence v. Healey[44], as to satisfaction in anticipation, and 1 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, vo. \"Accord,\" at page 423.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and W. G. Mitchell for the respondent. The evidence clearly shews that the accident was caused solely by the fault of the officers and servants of the Crown in the discharge of their duties as employees on the railway and that no contributory negligence can be ascribed to the deceased.\nUnder the circumstances the Crown cannot be discharged from responsibility. It seems that a wide distinction lies between the nature of the action instituted under \"Lord Campbell's Act\" and art. 1056 C.C.; Robinson v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[45]; Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[46]. As to the defence of common employment, see Filion v. The Queen[47].\nAn action in tort lay against the Crown, under section 1 of the Act, 33 Vict. ch. 23, passed in 1870, if the claim arose from death or injury to the person or property on any railway, canal or public work under the control and the management of the Government of Canada. This Act was abrogated by 50 & 51 Vict., ch. 16, creating the Exchequer Court of Canada and, from sections 58 and 59 of that Act, any claim which could be made the subject of a decision by the official arbitrators may be subject to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court; a new jurisdiction was created extending to claims of the nature of a tort, like the present one, and liability was imposed on the Crown in such cases for the wrongful acts of its officers and servants.\nApart from the statute the Crown is bound by the provisions of the Civil Code and can claim no immunity except that which constitutes the attributes of sovereignty; Campbell v. Judah[48]; Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[49]. Article 9 C.C. does not relieve the Crown from responsibility; 2 Migneault, pp. 106 et seq.; 2 Loranger, Civil Code, pp. 194 to 197; Chitty, Prerogatives of the Crown, page 382.\nAs to the claim that because, at the time of his death, deceased was a member of the Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Insurance Association no action can be maintained, see Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[50], and Miller v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[51]. The Privy Council laid down the rule that the right of action under art. 1056 C.C. is an independent and personal right and is not, as in \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" conferred on the representatives of the deceased only. Therefore, unless deceased obtained real and tangible indemnity or satisfaction for the offence or quasi-offence, the right of action remains unimpaired in his widow and children.\nIn the first place, the indemnity payable in respect to the -insurance did not come from the offender even in part. In this case, on reference to rule 7, it will be seen that in case of death the full amount to be raised is collected in proportion from every surviving member who pays an assessment according to the amount of his insurance. It is quite evident that the amount contributed by the Railway Department to the association is not devoted to the death fund but to the sick fund. Secondly, the Privy Council, in the Miller Case[52], found that the payment is independent of and bears no relation to the offence or quasi-offence and would equally have to be paid if the deceased had died a natural death. The same reason applies in the present instance. That decision supports the view that the Crown is not relieved from responsibility by reason of membership in the association. The Privy Council, in the Miller Case52, merely assumed the by-law to be valid. But if the right of action, vested in the widow and children of the deceased, is separate, personal and independent, the legality of a by-law or regulation under the provisions of which the Crown could, in advance, contract itself out of responsibility and the deceased relieve the Crown of a responsibility which did not, as yet, exist to the extent of depriving the widow and children of their recourse, it can be successfully assailed.\nThere is no Dominion law affecting negligence; the lex loci must apply to the civil right to be dealt with in the province. See 2 Wharton, Conflict of Laws (3 ed.), secs. 475, 477; also other authorities cited in Dupont v. Quebec Steamship Co.[53], by Routhier J., at page 192. Art. 1056 C.C. is not a re-enactment of \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" see per Pagnuelo J., in Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[54], at page 363, and authorities cited; Roy v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[55]. We also rely upon B\u00e9langer v. Riopel[56], at p. 258; Dupont v. The Quebec Steamship Co.53; Robinson v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[57]; The Queen v. Grenier[58], at page 51, and The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Durand[59].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree in the conclusion as to the main facts reached by the trial judge that Charland failed properly to set and lock the switch. I have gone carefully over the evidence and have reached the conclusion that the switch was not at the time in good working order. Had it been so, Charland's attempts effectively to set the switch would have been successful. He brought the crank to its proper place and set the safety hasp in its proper notch. This was not done as he says himself without difficulty and trouble, a fact which Bruce's evidence fully supports. It seems reasonably certain, however, that while Char-land was successful in putting the switch crank in place and setting the safety-hasp, such action which, in the case of the switch crank and attachments in good working order, would have resulted in placing the switch-rails flush with the rails on the main line, did not do so. The switch-crank and the safety notch were set properly for the main line, and the target so indicated, but owing to some breakage or defect in the attachments, aggravated possibly by the snow which had fallen that morning to a depth of about three inches, I conclude from the evidence that the switch-rails did not move in unison with the crank and were not made flush either with the main line or the switch-line. I think the evidence of Bruce and Charland, the two men in the best position to judge, shews that the switch-crank appeared properly set for the main line and that the target so indicated, but neither of them were able to say that they looked to see whether the switch-rails had swung so as to be flush with the main rails as if the attachments had been in order would have been the case. Bruce was too far away to see as to the rails being flush, and Charland, who was on the spot, says he did not look. Considering the trouble and difficulty he had in getting the switch-crank and the safety hasp in their places, I think it was negligence on his part not to have looked and seen whether the switch rails had, after all his labour and efforts, swung to their proper place.\nIf the crank and safety hasp were set as he describes, and Bruce confirms, and the target indicated that the main line was open, no blame whatever could be attached to. the deceased engineer for continuing on his course. Charland's evidence of the trouble he had with the switch lends great colour to the positive evidence of Bruce as to what he saw and the expert evidence of Houston as to how the accident occurred.\nI think the evidence of Bruce, who was standing on the station platform looking at the approaching engine, of Mitchell, the conductor of the train, who saw the marks of the wheels on the ties, and of the expert witness Houston, the track master, prove that the accident started at the junction of the switch-rail with the main line rail and not at the frog as submitted by the Crown. Bruce says he saw the front wheels of the engine, at this point of the switch, mount the rails which would not have taken place had the switch-rails been set true for the main line, although the indicator or switch-signal so pointed.\nI conclude from the evidence of the conductor, Mitchell, that the engineer, Goddard, as he got up to the switch observed that, notwithstanding the target indicated the main line was open, the rails were not, right and that he immediately applied the brakes, which action might have had something to do in helping on but unfortunately did not prevent the accident and, in any case, is not charged as negligence on his part.\nIn the result, my conclusion is that the accident was neither caused nor contributed to by any negligence of Goddard's, but that, as the evidence shews, the working parts of the switch must have been out of order before the accident or were put out of order by Charland's working them at the time; that their defective working condition was probably contributed to by the fall of snow, that Charland managed, with effort and after trouble, to get the crank and safety hasp in their places, but was not successful in bringing the rails of the switch and main line together, and that this failure which he negligently left unobserved caused the accident, no negligence being attributable to the deceased engineer.\nOn all the legal points debated so fully at bar I am in agreement with the conclusion of the learned trial judge. I think our previous decisions have settled, as far as we are concerned, the construction of the clause (c) of the 16th section of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" and determined that it not only gave jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court but imposed a liability upon the Crown which did not previously exist, and also that such liability was to be determined by the general laws of the several provinces in force at the time such liability was imposed and that the case at bar is within the provision of the above cited amendment.\nI also agree on the authority of Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[60] , which, in my opinion, governs this case, that the defence raised by the Crown of the deceased having obtained satisfaction or indemnity within the meaning of article 1056 of the Civil Code by reason of the annual contribution made by the Intercolonial Railway Employees' Relief and Insurance Association, Class C, cannot be sustained.\nI also concur with the trial judge that our decisions are binding upon us to the effect that the doctrine of contributory negligence (so called) only applies in the Province of Quebec to the mitigation of the damages which would otherwise be recovered by the injured party and does not operate to defeat his action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I cannot find as a fact that the deceased engine-driver so neglected his duty as to render his conduct contributory to his own death.\nThe application of the emergency brakes indicates he saw what, if he had seen sooner, might have averted the accident.\nI cannot, however, say upon the whole evidence that his failure to see sooner was the result of negligence.\nAs to the other questions raised we are bound, as to some of them, I think, by decisions here, and, as to others, by the decisions in the Privy Council, and cannot interfere.\nThe appeal as a result fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014The contentions advanced by the appellant are, with the exception of one which I am about to discuss, fully dealt with by the learned trial judge, and, as I entirely agree with his reasoning and his conclusions, it is not necessary that T should, save as to that exception, say anything further about them.\nA contention not referred to by the learned judge and apparently but little discussed at the trial, was pressed upon us, viz., that the negligence of the deceased, Holsey Cleveland Goddard, is an answer to the action. That contention necessarily, in the circumstances, proceeds upon the proposition that a person situated as Goddard was, and observing the rules, must have seen that the switch was set for the siding. There seem to be insuperable obstacles in the way of giving effect to that contention at this stage. The evidence, for example, of the witness Bruce, put forward by the Crown as a substantial part of the defence, was to the effect that the witness observed the signal at the switch immediately before the approach of Goddard's train, and that it appeared to be set for the main line. In view of that evidence it is quite impossible to say that the implied finding of the learned trial judge on this point is a finding so clearly erroneous as to justify the reversal of it.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

[1906] c. 37, s. 278.\nA train of the Wabash Railroad Co. and one of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. approached a highway crossing at obtuse angles. The former did not, as required by sec. 278 of the Railway Act, come to a full stop; the latter did so at a semaphore nearly 900 feet from the crossing and receiving the proper signal proceeded without stopping again at a \u201cstop post\u201d some 400 feet nearer where a rule of the company required trains to stop. The trains collided and the engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. was killed. In an action by his widow:\nHeld, that the failure of the engineer to stop the second time was not contributory negligence which prevented the recovery of damages for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s husband caused by the admitted negligence of defendants.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nA collision occurred between trains of the Wabash Railroad Co. and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., respectively, at a crossing about a mile from St. Thomas, Ont., and the engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway train was killed. At the trial of an action by his widow, on behalf of herself and children, she obtained a verdict against the Wabash Railroad Co. for $10,000, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nOn appeal by the company to the Supreme Court of Canada it was admitted that the defendant company was guilty of negligence in not coming to a full stop before approaching the crossing as required by sec. 278 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d and the only question raised was whether or not the deceased engineer was guilty of contributory negligence because, having come to a full stop at a semaphore about 900 feet from the crossing, he did not stop a second time at a \u201cstop post\u201d some 400 feet further on as required by the rules of his company.\nThe rules as to the \u201cstop post\u201d are the following:\u2014\n\u201cThe following instructions concerning Standard Stop Posts and Slow Posts are issued for the guidance of all concerned: Standard Stop Posts placed 400 feet from Railway Crossings at grade and drawbridges where interlocking plants are not in operation are indications of points at which trains are required to come to a stop and be governed by rule 98(c).\u201d\nRule 98(c), referred to in the circular reads as follows\u2014\n\u201cUnless there is an interlocking plant in operation, trains must stop and receive proceed signal from signalman before passing over a drawbridge or a railway crossing at grade.\u201d\nRose for the appellant.

The amount of the indemnity policy should have been deducted from the verdict. Hicks v. Newport, Abergavenny & Hereford Railway Co.[2], approved in Bradburn v. Great Western Railway Co.[3]\nRobinette K.C. and Godfrey for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Maclennan.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014The plaintiff is the widow of John McKay, an engineer of a Canadian Pacific Railway passenger train, who was killed in a collision between his train and a train of the appellant company, at a level crossing near St. Thomas, Ont., and she sued for damages for his death. At the trial the plaintiff obtained a verdict and judgment for $10,000, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and this appeal is from that judgment.\nBefore the accident the trains were approaching each other at an angle of 122\u00b0 55\u2019, the train of the deceased on an up-grade, and that of the appellants on a heavy down-grade.\nSection 298 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d enacts that\nevery train shall, before it passes over any such crossing * * * be brought to a full stop. The crossing is guarded by five semaphore signals, all operated by a man stationed at the crossing, where one of those signals is placed. The other signals, called distance semaphores, are placed at varying distances, about 800 feet from the crossing, two on each line, one on each of the four directions of the lines from the crossing.\nThe variation in the distance of those signals apparently depends on the grade of the approach to the crossing. The signal on the side from which the train of the deceased was approaching being 815 feet, and that on the opposite side 936 feet from the crossing, and that on the appellants\u2019 line, on the side from which their train was approaching being 893 feet, and on the opposite side 703 feet from the crossing.\nI think it is evident that these distance signals were intended by the respective companies to insure compliance with the section of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d above referred to, and to indicate the points on each line at which the full stop required by the statute is to be made before the train passes the crossing.\nBut, besides these semaphore signals, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company has placed a fixed post, about 400 feet from the crossing, marked STOP. It is a fixed signal, always speaking, not capable, like the others, of being opened and closed, and the appellants have no such additional signals on their line.\nWhat then is the purpose and significance of this post? That is explained by rules of the company, 98(c) and 98 (d), and an instruction issued to its trainmen.\nThese rules are as follows:\u2014\n98(c)\u2014Unless there is an interlocking plant in operation, trains must stop, and receive proceed signals from signal-men, before passing over * * * a railway-crossing at grade. 98(d) Passenger trains must not exceed a speed of twelve miles, and other trains a speed of eight miles, per hour, over railway-crossings at grade.\nAnd the instruction is as follows:\u2014\nStandard stop-posts, placed 400 feet from railway-crossings at grade * * *, where interlocking plants are not in operation, are indications of points at which trains are required to come to a stop, and be governed by rule 98(c).\nReading the statute and the rules and the instruction together, I think the stop-post is placed as an additional caution, and to ensure the full stop which the statute makes imperative, in case, for any reason, a train did not stop at the distance signal, and as indicating a point beyond which no train should proceed without coming to a stop.\nThe distance signals must be intended for the same purpose by both companies, that is, as signals for the stop required by the statute. The appellant company had no other, and there can be no reason suggested for two stops before crossing.\nThe jury found, as they were warranted in doing upon the evidence, although there was some evidence the other way, that the deceased\u2019s train did stop at the distance semaphore; that he received a proceed signal from that semaphore, and also from the one at the crossing; and that his speed, at the crossing, was from ten to twelve miles an hour. They also found that the speed of the appellants\u2019 train, at its distance semaphore, was forty-five miles an hour, and, at the moment of the collision, eight to nine miles an hour, and that the appellants\u2019 engine was the one which struck the other.\nIt was not contended before us that the appellants were not guilty of negligence, which caused the accident, and the contention was that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, in not stopping at the stop-post.\nIn my opinion it is clear that, having stopped at the distance semaphore and having received a proceed signal from that, and also from the one at the crossing, and having approached the crossing at a speed not exceeding ten or twelve miles an hour, the deceased was not guilty of any negligence.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014It seems to me to be clear that disobedience of an instruction such as that relied upon by the defendants cannot be regarded as, per se, a breach of the statute or of the statutory rule. The duty of the deceased, McKay, under the statute was neither more nor less than the duty of the company which employed him; and the duty of the company cannot, I think, be measured by the terms of the directions they may give to the persons whom they place in charge of their trains. The statute, in other words, cannot be said to prescribe one standard of duty for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and another for the defendants. Neither do I think the question whether, in bringing the train to a stop at the semaphore, McKay did make a \u201cfull stop\u201d in compliance with the statute, involves any question of fact which the learned judge was bound to submit to the jury. On that head the sole question for them to pass upon seems to me to have been that which the learned trial judge left to them, namely, whether in fact the train was brought to a full stop; and the legal result of the finding on that point, taken together with the undisputed facts is, I think, that the statute was observed. Then, was there any evidence of contributory negligence in fact on the part of McKay which could properly have been submitted to the jury? I think there was none.\nThe instruction referred to seems to be at best ambiguous, and reasonably open to a construction which would sanction the course which the jury found McKay actually took.\nI should think it not open to dispute that the existence of an ambiguous instruction reasonably susceptible of a construction sanctioning a given course of conduct could not alone be sufficient evidence to support a finding that such conduct is negligent conduct. Evidence shewing that the instruction although open to such a construction was in practice acted upon in a different sense might, perhaps, alter the case. But we have nothing of the kind here. There is not the slightest evidence that McKay\u2019s conduct was not in accordance with the practice under the instruction; on the contrary the only evidence touching the point is to the opposite effect.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.E.

However, it does appear to me to be important that the litigation should be advanced another stage and that it is in the interests of the parties themselves that it be put in a position where the questions in issue may be brought before the Supreme Court of Canada rather than that there should be a rehearing or reargument in this court. And for that I am not without a precedent. For in the case of The Attorney-General for British Columbia v. The Attorney-General for Canada[1], the decision of the Exchequer Court was taken by consent and without argument in order to facilitate the bringing of the case directly to the Supreme Court. It is true that in this case I have not the consent of the parties, but I think may take it for granted that they would consent to a course of procedure which appears to me to be so much in their interest. The main question it seems to me that I need to decide is as to the party upon whom the burden of bringing the appeal should be thrown, and in this case I think that burden should fall upon the suppliant.\"\nThe questions at issue on the appeals are stated in the judgments now reported.\nT. Mayne Daly K.C. and J. Travers Lewis K.C. for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. for the respondent. Girouard J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I also concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014Each of these cases arises out of an application made under the mining regulations in force in the Yukon for a mining lease.\nThe first question that suggests itself in considering the appeal is: Can relief be given in an action taken by way of petition of right upon and for relief from the refusal of the Crown to comply with an application made under the said regulations?\nSection 3 thereof, as amended on the 2nd March, 1900, is the basis of the claim and is as follows:\u2014\nTo any person who files an application in the Department of the Interior at Ottawa for a location previously prospected by him or his authorized agent at the time the location was prospected, a lease will be issued provided he is the first qualified applicant therefor. Before the issue of any such lease there shall be filed in the Department of the Interior at Ottawa a report from the Gold Commissioner to the effect that it has been proved to his satisfaction that the applicant himself, or a person acting for him, was upon and actually prospected, prior to the date of the application, the ground included in the location, and that the ground included in the location is not being worked and is not suitable to be worked under the regulations governing placer mining.\nThat section standing alone might in the case of a suit brought upon the filing of an application (either rejected and refused so soon as filed or when supplemented by a compliance with the proviso of the section) raise some curious questions.\nIt is, however, not alone but is preceded and followed by sections that confer upon the Minister of the Interior, representing the Crown, powers and impose upon him duties in regard to the granting of such leases that give to the operation of the section or subject matter of its operation an instability, a want of uniformity and indefiniteness of possible results that render it quite impossible to say that a contract has been formed at any stage up to the last when the minister has directed the lease to issue in the form and for the quantity of land and upon the terms of rental that he in each such regard may have decided upon.\nIt seems impossible to find a completed contract until then.\nIt is suggested and pressed upon us that a duty has been created by these regulations, which have the force of a statute, rendering it possible for the Exchequer Court upon such petition of right as is before us to interfere, and to declare that the Crown is bound to issue a lease.\nIt is, if I understand counsel aright, only mildly claimed that such a suit might be maintained in case the Crown, immediately after the filing in priority to all others of such an application, refused to recognize it.\nIt is however stoutly maintained that upon the filing as required by the latter part of said section of the report therein mentioned, as was done here, there is duly established such a claim to a lease that the Exchequer Court can give relief in regard to it.\nThere is not created in that case any more than upon the mere filing of the application a contract or any tangible right that a court can enforce.\nThe case of Farmer v. Livingstone[2] presents similar features. There the applicant for a homestead presented all the statute required of such an applicant, and made his application therefor and paid the statutory fee of ten dollars, but did not get a receipt or anything to shew he had been granted a right of entry upon the land yet he went into actual possession. It was held he had no claim of which the court could take cognizance. I think the reasoning upon which this court reached its conclusions in that case leads to our being bound to pause before saying that there was in these cases any right in law which could be recognized.\nWe need not however go so far as that reasoning might carry one.\nThere the court seemed to accept without limitation the theory that statutes prescribing a duty for a public officer might be treated as directory and as conferring no right.\nI express no opinion on that.\nI prefer to point out that this regulation, which at all events prescribed certain things to be done and pointed out certain paths for an applicant to follow, imposed upon the minister of the Crown duties to be discharged and conferred powers to be exercised by him before the applicants could have any rights enure to them or either of them under the regulations.\nThe non-discharge of one of these duties of the minister seems to me, when considered in connection with the peculiar facts before us, quite clearly destructive of any claim each appellant makes here. That is set forth in the second regulation which is as follows:\nEach alternate claim shall, until otherwise ordered by the Minister of the Interior, be reserved.\nNow we find Frooks' claim preceded Smith's and the latter defined his as follows: Commencing at the lower end boundary of F. D. Frooks' application on Flat Creek, thence extending down a stream a distance of five miles, and in width from summit to summit.\nThe minister never decided that this Smith claim which I take it then became alternative to that of Frooks could be open to any one.\nUntil there was had such a necessary determination under the regulations he could have no right.\nThen, as to Frooks, he later, by permission of the department, so amended his claim as to cover both sides of the creek, including thereby new territory.\nI do not think that can be treated as such a decision of the questions raised by section 2 of the regulations as to enure to Smith's benefit for we have nothing to shew that his application was considered in that connection.\nAnd as to this amendment of Frooks' claim, made as it was in 1903, I think it must be held as something done by him that brings him and his claim under the amended regulations of 19th May, 1902, which rendered it necessary to get the consent of the commissioner which never was given.\nIt seems almost impossible to render new territory, then clearly under the new regulations, subject to the administration of old and repealed regulations without at least some express declaration on the part of the Crown that such old regulations were to be held applicable thereto.\nIndeed it would seem as if such a thing had by the repeal of the regulations become beyond the power of the minister to declare.\nIn any way one looks at the matter it is to be observed that the sanction of the minister was necessary to confer any right. It never was given. Nothing ever was granted. Nothing existed but uncompleted negotiations.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDuff J.\u2014The appellant, Smith, applied on the 28th April, 1900, for a lease of a tract of mining land in the Yukon Territory under the regulations then in force,\nfor the disposal of mining locations to be worked by the hydraulic or other mining process,\n(hereinafter referred to as the \"hydraulic regulations\").\nOn the 2nd day of February, 1904, an order was passed by the Governor-General in Council[3], by which,\nthe regulations for the disposal of mining locations in the Yukon Territory to be worked by the hydraulic mining process, established by the order-in-council of the 3rd of December, 1898, and amended by subsequent orders-in-council, were rescinded and the Minister of the Interior was authorized to deal in accordance with the provisions of the said regulations with all leases already issued and with all applications which have already been granted under the provisions thereof.\nThe Crown contends that, by this order-in-council, the power of the Minister of the Interior to issue leases of locations for hydraulic mining was abrogated (except in respect of \"applications\" which had \"already been granted under the provisions\" of the regulations referred to); and, therefore, that since the appellant's application was not one of those which had thus \"already been granted\" the minister was by the order-in- council deprived of authority to issue a lease in respect of it. The appellant attacks this position in two ways. He says, first, that before the order-in-counsel of February, 1904, was passed his application had been granted within the meaning of that instrument; and secondly, assuming that not to be so, he had by presenting his application merely, acquired a status respecting the land applied for, and that the order-in-council ought to be construed as not affecting that status to his prejudice.\nThe first of these contentions is based upon the following communication from the Secretary of the Department of the Interior to the appellant:\u2014\nOttawa, 9th of April, 1901.\nSir:\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th of February last, addressed to the Deputy Minister, with respect to the application made by you for a lease for hydraulic mining purposes of a tract of land situated on Flat Creek, in the Yukon Territory, and in reply to inform you that the reports required by section 3 of the hydraulic mining regulations, have now been received in this Department, and you are given six months from this date within which to file in the office of the Gold Commissioner at Dawson, the returns of the survey of the location in question, upon the conditions, however, that the ground included in the location will be open to placer mining entry, up to the date upon which such returns are filed with the Gold Commissioner.\nYour very obedient servant,\nP. G. Keyes,\nSecretary.\nE. W. Smith, Esq.,\nComptroller's Office,\nDawson, Y.T.\nThis letter, the appellant argues, was an acceptance of his application. It seems to be very clear that it was a distinct notice to him that the application was not accepted and would not be accepted or acted upon before the returns referred to in it should be furnished. In order to appreciate fully the effect of this communication as touching the appellants' contention, it is necessary to notice the terms of the 13th clause of the hydraulic regulations. That clause directed that \"when it is decided to hold any ground\" with a view to disposing of it under those regulations, notice of that decision should be posted in the office of the mining recorder for the district; and it was further declared by the same clause that thereafter no claim professedly located under the Placer Mining Regulations within the area affected by such a notice should have any legal validity. The statement in the letter that the tract applied for would still be open to entry under the placer mining regulations conveyed a very obvious warning that no decision of the character referred to in the 13th clause of the hydraulic regulations had yet been arrived at; and consequently that the question was yet in abeyance whether that tract would (in the words of that clause) be\nheld for the purpose of being included in locations under the hydraulic regulations.\nThat upon any application for a lease under the hydraulic regulations there was always this preliminary question to be passed upon by the Minister of the Interior is made very clear by this clause; and indeed is, apart from this clause, manifest from the tenor of the regulations as a whole. As regards the area embraced within appellant's application, that question \u2014thus expressly held open by the letter quoted\u2014 still remained an open question when the order-in-council of the 2nd February, 1904, was passed. In such circumstances it would appear to be beyond dispute that the appellant's application cannot be. brought within the category of \"applications already granted\" within the meaning of that instrument.\nThe second contention fails for substantially the same reasons. The appellant relies upon the language of the order-in-council of the 2nd of March, 1900, which is as follows:\u2014\nWhereas it is provided by clause 3 of the regulations for the disposal of mining locations in the Yukon Territory, to be worked by hydraulic or other mining process, made by order-in-council of 3rd December, 1898, as amended by order-in-council dated 24th October, 1899, that leases may be issued to applicants who can furnish evidence that they prospected the location applied for prior to December, 1898, and\nWhereas it is now deemed that it would be in the public interest if the said regulations were amended so that in the future any person who files an application for a location may obtain a lease thereof, without competition, provided the location has been prospected prior to the date of his application:\nTherefore His Excellency by and with the advice of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, is pleased to order that clause 3 of the above mentioned regulations shall be and the same is hereby amended to read as follows:\u2014\nTo any person who files an application in the Department of the Interior at Ottawa for a location previously prospected by him or his authorized agent at the time the location was prospected, a lease will be issued provided he is the first qualified applicant therefor. Before the issue of any such lease there shall be filed in the Department of the Interior, at Ottawa, a report from the Gold Commissioner to the effect that it has been proved to his satisfaction that the applicant himself, or a person acting for him, was upon and actually prospected prior to the date of the application the ground included in the location, and that the ground included in the location is not being worked and is not suitable to be worked under the regulations governing placer mining.\nThe contention is that this order-in-council constituted an offer to the world, upon the acceptance of which by the filing of an application alone, a present interest in, together with a right to a lease of, the ground applied for became vested in the appellant; and that\u2014this interest being, as well as this right, \"a right or privilege acquired, accrued or accruing\" under the hydraulic regulations, within the meaning of sec. 19, sub-sec. (c) ch. 1, R.S.C. (\"The Interpretation Act\")\u2014 neither the interest nor the right could under the express terms of that enactment be affected by the revoking of those regulations.\nI cannot accept this view for two reasons. First, the hydraulic regulations manifestly invested the minister with the responsibility not only of pronouncing upon the preliminary question already referred to \u2014whether, that is to say, the lands applied for should be reserved for disposal under the hydraulic regulations,\u2014but, in addition, assuming that question decided in favour of the applicant, the further duty of determining first of all the priorities among rival claimants and then the extent of the location and the conditions of the lease to be granted. In face of this, I do not see how it is possible to read the order-in-council of March, 1900, as bestowing upon an applicant in consequence of his application alone, any present interest in .the land; or as making the application in itself the basis of any claim of a character sufficiently definite to enable a court to take cognizance of it. Not until the application was accepted certainly,\u2014and perhaps not until the parties had executed a lease or done what the law would regard as equivalent to the execution of a lease,\u2014would any such right or interest come into existence. A status so indefinite\u2014resting so largely in the discretionary policy of a public department,\u2014cannot I think be fairly described as a right or privilege either \"acquired\" or \"accrued\" or \"accruing.\"\nAgain the interpretations ordained by the \"Interpretation Act\" must always yield to an unmistakable expression of intention in the enactment to be construed; indeed these interpretations are by the express terms of the Act made non-applicable if \"a contrary intention appears.\" Now the order-in-council of the 2nd February, 1904, dealt very explicitly with applications of the class to which the appellant's belonged, applications that is to say which were still under consideration when the order-in-council was passed; and it was in respect of those applications which at that date had been \"already granted,\" and in respect of those only, that the minister was by the order-in-council authorized after that date to issue leases.\nThe intention was plainly manifested that save in pursuance of such an application leases should no longer be granted; as regards all other applications the powers of the minister were at once and wholly revoked. Where the law making authority has so unequivocally expressed its meaning there seems to be no room to apply the enactment of the \"Interpretation Act.\"\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThese considerations apply also to Frooks' appeal in which, accordingly, the same order should be made.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: T.

Code s. 1014(3).\nBy sec. 1014(3) of the Criminal Code either party may \"during the trial\" of a prisoner on indictment apply to have a question which has arisen reserved for adjudication by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, that for the purposes of such provision the trial ends with the verdict after which no such application can be entertained.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming, on a reserved case, the verdict of guilty on the trial of the appellant for forgery..\nThe indictment charged appellant with forging a promissory note and the evidence at the trial shewed that he had signed a fictitious name to a blank form of note and given the document to a merchant in payment for goods. He was found guilty, and after verdict his counsel took the objection that the evidence did not warrant a conviction, and asked the judge to reserve a case for the Court of Appeal which he refused to do. On the prisoner's behalf application was then made to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Court of Appeal for the province under the Criminal Code, and that court made an order directing the trial judge to reserve a case which he did, submitting, with a statement of the proceedings, two questions for the Court of Appeal.\n1. Does the indictment disclose any criminal offence?\n2.

The application for a reserved case must be made \"during the trial\"; Crim. Code, sec. 1014(3); and after verdict is too late.\nThe indictment is good on its face and any defect in the proof of the offence is cured by the verdict. Rex v.Wright[5]; Reg. v. Mason[6].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was indicted for forgery of an alleged promissory note and tried upon such indictment at the criminal term of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held by Mr. Justice Longley with a jury. The evidence to support the charge was that he signed the name \"Thomas Healey\" to a piece of paper of which the following is a copy:\n$14.00. Nov'r. 18th, 1907.\nafter date promise to pay to the order of\ndollars, at value received.\nNo. . Due (Sgd.) Thomas Healey.\nThe evidence further shewed clearly that he was not the person he represented himself to be and whose name he signed and that his signing was fraudulent and to the prejudice of the private prosecutor who had sold him a coat for the price of fourteen dollars in payment of which at the sale thereof he signed and gave the vendor the paper in question.\nThere was no objection taken to the indictment, the reception of the evidence, or the direction of the learned trial judge, and the accused was found guilty. Thereupon and before sentence was passed, objection was taken, for the first time, that the accused could not on such evidence be convicted of the crime alleged.\nThe learned trial judge declined to reserve a case as requested upon this objection and sentenced the accused to three years in the penitentiary.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, being the proper appellate court in the premises, was moved on behalf of the prisoner to direct the learned judge to state a case and so directed accordingly.\nThe learned judge stated with a brief report of the case the following points:\n1. Does the indictment disclose any criminal offence?\n2. In view of the fact that the instrument signed was a blank form of a promissory note, not filled in, was the prisoner rightly convicted of forgery of a promissory note? The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon hearing this appeal dismissed it, but Mr. Justice Meagher, one of the Court of Appeal that so heard the appeal, dissented in regard to the second question and held that there should be a new trial.\nThe prisoner has appealed from that decision.\nThe objection is taken here, as it was in the court below, that the prisoner had not any such right of appeal, as he was given leave to present, to the said court.\nThe question thus raised turns upon the interpretation of the Criminal Code, sec. 1014, sub-sec. 3, which can better be considered with and in relation to sub-sec. 2 of the same section. These sub-sections are as follows:\n1014 * * *.\n2. The court before which any accused person is tried may, either during or after the trial, reserve any question of law arising either on the trial or on any of the proceedings preliminary, subsequent, or incidental thereto, or arising out of the direction of the judge, for the opinion of the court of appeal in manner hereinafter provided.\n3. Either the prosecutor or the accused may during the trial, either orally or in writing, apply, to the court to reserve any such question as aforesaid, and the court, if it refuses so to reserve it, shall nevertheless take a note of such objection.\nIt is urged on the one hand that the words \"during the trial\" in this sub-section 3 must include everything up to and including the sentencing of the prisoner.\nOn the other hand, it is said that the plain ordinary meaning of the word trial must be adopted and that according to such reading the trial ends with the verdict of the jury.\nI think this latter contention the correct one. A man might never be sentenced, yet he stands convicted when found guilty or acquitted when found not guilty and either could successfully plead respectively autrefois convict or autrefois acquit as the necessities of any later case might render necessary. Sentence so uniformly followed a conviction in olden times as to give the passing of sentence a semblance of part of the trial. It was also the point at which long ago most of the serious questions of law raised upon a trial came up for final disposition if not conclusion.\nEver since our Canadian statute (in 1869), 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 29, was passed almost all this has changed.\nIt was by section 32 of that procedure Act, enacted that objections to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof must be taken by demurrer or motion to quash\u2014before defendant pleaded and not afterwards.\nPower of amendment was given the court by the same section in order to meet, if possible, the objection that might be so raised.\nThus far the English legislation, 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 100, was followed. Indeed, our whole criminal legislation of 1869 followed largely this beneficient English reformation of the criminal law. In this instance, however, the Parliament of Canada went a great step in advance of the other. Instead of limiting the peremptory requirement for demurrer or motion to quash to any formal defect, our legislation dropped the word \"formal\" and made the requirement apply to and prohibited the motion for arrest of judgment in any such case where demurrer might have been upheld or power to amend existed. That now stands virtually the same in our Criminal Code, sec. 898, with sub-sec. 2 as follows: 898. 2. No motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage of by the demurrer, or amended under the authority of this Act.\nThis radical difference between the English and Canadian legislation acted upon in Reg. v. Mason[7], ought always to be kept in view in reading English authorities in relation to proceedings at trial, including indictment.\nThe important ground left for such a motion seems to be as stated in the Code by sec. 1007, sub-sec. 1, to be founded on the ground shewn therein, which is as follows:\n1007. The accused may at any time before sentence move in arrest of judgment on the ground that the indictment does not, after amendment, if any, state any indictable offence.\nThis is not as clear as one would wish. Is it only in the case of an amended indictment that the motion lies?\nThe very comprehensive language of section 989 shews how very limited a field is left for motions in arrest of judgment.\nIt is quite possible that after a prisoner had pleaded instead of demurring that the indictment might erroneously be amended by a trial judge in such a way as to render it bad in law.\nIf he should, over-confident of his own judgment, make a mistake in refusing to allow a demurrer to an amended indictment, the only recourse the prisoner would have as of right, save objecting to the amendment and noting of it, would be this motion to arrest judgment.\nBut is there any reason found in that for the extending of the right of appeal? The accused when the motion to amend has been made has every chance to object, and then thus comes within the limited meaning of the words \"during the trial\" and be able to insist on properly laying a foundation for appeal.\nThe chances of legal wrong ever being done by a trial judge to the accused after the verdict are almost infinitesimal and so easy of remedy by appeal to the clemency of the Crown that one cannot. see injury likely to result from limiting his rights of appeal to that which transpired before the verdict.\nOn the other hand if the trial referred to in this sub-section 3 of section 1014 of the Code were extended to include proceedings after verdict then the accused would have left open to him in every case the right to keep silence and only interpose his objections after the verdict when nothing could be amended.\nThe door would be thus thrown wide open to almost interminable appeals nearly all of which might ultimately prove quite unfounded, yet persisted in would serve the purpose of the accused, who was guilty, but desired, proceedings prolonged until he was quite forgotten, as a satirist tells us happens in the administration of the criminal law where justice is not swift of foot.\nThere is a marked difference between the provision made in sub-section 2 and that in sub-section 3 of section 1014 of the Code.\nThe first is intended to cover almost every case that a trial judge can reasonably have brought under his notice for reserving a case.\nIt entrusts to him the protection of the accused in any case in which the law apparently leading to his conviction may be doubtful. The trial judge generally and, if I may be permitted to say so, properly, gives the prisoner the full benefit of any such doubt as he may have by reserving a case.\nIt is better that a number of cases barely arguable be remitted by this means to an appellate tribunal than that a trial judge should feel oppressed by the risk of being responsible for an illegal conviction.\nOn the other hand the accused is given as of right every opportunity of contesting the ruling of the trial judge on anything that arises in the progress of the trial.\nIf this prisoner, for example, had availed himself of this right he could easily have laid the foundation at the proper time for carrying his case to appeal.\nOf course his doing so might not have led to acquittal, but might have led to amendments or other proceedings or actions of the court that might have ultimately brought about a conviction of what he was properly chargeable with.\nThat is, however, what the law is designed to effect.\nAs to the objection taken to the form of indictment, I doubt if that is properly before us.\nThe court below was unanimous in upholding it. It is only in case of a dissenting opinion that a prisoner can come to this court as of right.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed simply on the ground that an appeal founded on the way it was did not lie either to the court below or to this court.\nThe case was argued fully on all points both as to the right of appeal and the merits of the objection to a conviction for forgery as of a promissory note where such a note never did exist, but a something so indescribable in law as the paper of which above is a copy. I have considered the possibility of holding that, as it was a case in which the learned trial judge might have reserved a case, his doing so might, though in obedience to an order of the court be treated as if originating on his own motion.\nDoing so would convert what has been done into a something never intended and not within the contemplation of the Act.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] Temp. & M.

In the judgment appealed from, His Lordship said:\u2014 \"I venture to ask the parties and any one who reads this short note not to come to the conclusion that the judgment which I am about to enter is given upon due consideration of the merits of the case. At the time when the evidence taken at Dawson was forwarded to the registrar of the court at Ottawa and the record thereby completed and since that time my other engagements were such as prevented me from taking the matter up and dealing with it in an adequate manner. And now the state of my health prevents me from giving the case the consideration which it deserves. However it does appear to me to be important that the litigation should be advanced another stage and that it is in the interests of the parties themselves that it be put in a position where the questions in issue may be brought before the Supreme Court of Canada rather than that there should be a rehearing and a re-argument in this court. And for that I am not without a precedent. For in the case of The Attorney General for British Columbia v. The Attorney General for Canada[1], the decision of the Exchequer Court was taken by consent and without argument in order to facilitate the bringing of the case directly to the Supreme Court. It is true that in this case I have not the consent of the parties, but I think I may take it for granted that they would consent to a course of procedure which appears to me to be so much in their interests. The main question it seems to me that I need to decide is as to the party upon whom the burden of bringing the appeal should be thrown, and in this case I think that burden should fall upon the defendants.\n\"There will be judgment for the plaintiff.\" The circumstances of the case material to this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. The clauses of the regulations and in the lease calling for construction are as follows:\u2014\n\"Regulations\"\n\"For the disposal of Mining Locations in the Yukon Territory to be worked by hydraulic or other mining process, approved by order in council, dated 3rd December, 1898.\"\n\"12. In case any lessee shall at any time make default in the payment of the rental or the royalty payable under these regulations, or shall make default in the performance of the conditions imposed by these regulations or by the lease, the Gold Commissioner may post a notice in a conspicuous place upon the location in connection with which such default has been made, and may mail a copy of such notice to the last address of the lessee known to the Commissioner, requiring such default to be remedied, and in case such default is not remedied within three months of the date of the posting of the notice upon the location all the rights of the lessee under the lease and under these regulations shall be and become ipso facto null and void.\"\nExtracts from lease,\nDated 3rd November, 1899:\n\"4. That the said lessee shall have sufficient hydraulic or other machinery in operation on the said demised premises within one year from the date hereof to permit of his beginning active operations for the efficient working of the rights and privileges hereby granted, which active operations he shall begin within the said period; and that if during any year of the said term hereby granted the lessee shall fail to ex- pend in such mining operations in, about or upon the said mining rights and privileges hereby granted the sum of five thousand dollars\u2014of the fact of which failure the Minister shall be the sole and final judge \u2014this lease or demise and the remainder of the term hereby granted, and all benefits, rights, and privileges hereby granted to the lessee shall become and be utterly and absolutely null and void, unless the Minister shall otherwise decide, and that in the event of such predetermination of this lease or demise and of the term hereby granted, or the remainder thereof, Her Majesty, her successors or assigns, may thereupon reenter upon the said demised premises, and have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the same and every part thereof, as if these presents had never been executed, and without any compensation or payment of any kind to the lessee for any work done or improvements made thereon; but nothing herein contained shall in anywise affect the right of Her Majesty or her successors or assigns to all arrears of rent or royalty to be paid as hereinbefore provided, or to any remedy for the recovery of such arrears of rent or royalty.\"\n\"10. That if the lessee shall at any time during the said term fail to pay the rent or royalty hereby reserved or any part thereof within sixty days after the same, respectively, shall have become due or if he shall commit any breach or default in the observance of the above conditions or of any of them other than that referred to in the clause numbered \"4\" of these presents, then, and in every such case the Gold Commissioner may post a notice in a conspicuous place upon the said demised premises and may mail a copy of such notice to the last address of the lessee known to the Commissioner requiring such de- fault to be remedied and in case such default is not remedied within three months of the date of the posting of the notice upon the location all the rights of the lessee under the said lease and under the said regulations of the Order in Council of the third day of December, A.D. 1898, shall be and become ipso facto null and void provided that the claim of Her Majesty or Her successors or assigns for any rent or royalty then due or accruing due, or any remedy for the recovery thereof shall be in no wise affected by such cancellation.\"\nBelcourt K.C. and J. A. Ritchie for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree in the conclusion reached by my brother Duff as to the necessity for a hearing of judicial nature before declaring the lease forfeited. Any right to determine without such a hearing must, if intended, be so clearly expressed as to exclude the reasonable expectation of a hearing.\nThe ordinary case of the builder or contractor, from long usage, from the nature of the matters to be determined, and generally incident to the possession of some expert knowledge or personal supervision in him given the power to determine, and for most part the necessities of the case, lead possibly to a different expectation in any one signing a building contract. The reasons I have assigned in the case of Klondike Government Concession v. The King[2], are also applicable here if it in fact was intended to assert the same wide power as I inferred and found asserted there. The inference of that fact is not so clear here as there The margin of expenditure over the $5,000 limit in this case is so narrow the minister may have found \"reasons for discrediting some trifling item and proceeding merely on a correct appreciation of the amount expended.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I do not think it necessary to express any opinion upon the various matters which were discussed before us in this case on the question whether the appellants had or had not been guilty of such violations of the conditions and stipulations of their lease as to entitle the Crown to terminate it, being of opinion that the Minister could not do so without acting judicially and giving the appellants an opportunity of being heard.\nDuff J.\u2014Under clause 4 of the appellant's lease, the determination by the Minister of the Interior of the fact of the lessees having failed in making the expenditure required is I think a condition of the exercise of the right of re-entry vested in the Crown. Nobody would contemplate the possibility of a re-entry on the ground of such a failure, until the fact that it had occurred should have been ascertained; and it is I think to the determination of the existence of that fact\u2014as a step preliminary to the exercise of the right \u2014that the provision making his finding conclusive and final applies. Is then the function of the Minister in arriving at a decision upon that question of fact\u2014as distinct from his function in declaring a forfeiture\u2014a function of a judicial nature? Or is his power to decide the question an absolute power which\u2014so long only as he acts in good faith\u2014it is permissible to exercise without regard to the principles governing judicial or quasi-judicial inquiries?\nI think it belongs to the former class. The stipulation imports inquiry, and a determination as the result of inquiry. It is not one of those cases in which a question is committed to the decision of an expert, who is, solely or primarily, to use Lord Esher's phrase, \"to employ his own eyes, knowledge and skill.\" It would be ridiculous to suppose either party to have contemplated that the minister should ascertain, from his own personal inspection of the ground and by use of his own knowledge and skill, whether a given amount had been expended by the lessees in a given year in the efficient working of their location. It must have been assumed that he would rely upon knowledge obtained at second hand\u2014not by any means necessarily through evidence of such a character as would be admissible in a court of law\u2014but by possessing himself of the results of the observation, knowledge, and investigations of others. Having then an inquiry of such a character provided for in an instrument inter partes\u2014an inquiry which might, in the result, lead to the forfeiture of the rights of one of the parties\u2014the proper view I think of the function of the person appointed to conduct it, there being nothing in the instrument to manifest a contrary intention, is that in the course of it he is bound to observe the requirements of substantial justice; and those requirements are not observed, if he reaches a decision adverse to the party whose rights may be thus affected, without first giving that party an opportunity both to know what is alleged against him, and to meet it.\nIt would seem that, in the case now under consideration, since the person charged with the investigation is also the person invested with authority to make the election whether or not a forfeiture is to be declared, the propriety of this view is even the less open to dispute.\nThe principle above indicated has been acted upon by the courts in a great variety of cases. In Wood v. Woad[3], at page 196, speaking of the expulsion of a partner under a power contained in the partnership articles which authorized also the appropriation by the remaining partners of the share of the partner expelled, Kelly, C.B. (in the course of a passage which was in Russell v. Russell[4], at page 478, adopted by Sir George Jessel as an accurate statement of the law, and has since been quoted with approval, by Lord Macnaghten speaking for the Judicial Committee in Lapointe v. L'Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montr\u00e9al[5] at pages 539 and 540), said:\u2014\nWas the alleged act of expulsion void? It is contended for the plaintiff that the language of the rules gives an unconditional and absolute power to the committee to expel a member from the society, and I agree that if the committee in fact exercised their power under the rules, their decision could not be questioned; however unfounded the reasons for it may have been, it would have been final and could not be reviewed by any court. But they are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim audi alteram partem, that no man shall be condemned to consequences' resulting from alleged misconduct unheard and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nIn Edwards v. Aberayron Mutual Ship Ins. Society[6], at page 579, Amphlett B. thus applied the same principle to an adjudication by the directors of a Mutual Ins. Society upon a question of the Society's liability to one of its members:\u2014\nIt is beyond doubt, however, that, when they undertook the delicate task of adjudicating between their own society and a member, their functions, if not strictly the same, were analogous to those of an arbitrator, and they were bound to act judicially and with perfect fairness and impartiality between the parties: McIntosh v. Great Western Ry. Co.[7]. To come to a decision under these circumstances in favour of their own society, and against the plaintiff, without hearing him or giving him an opportunity of being heard, was contrary to every principle of justice, and ought not, I think, to be held by any court of law or equity to be binding upon him.\nIn Armstrong v. South London Tramway Co.[8], the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a certificate of the manager of the defendant company in these circumstances; an agreement between the plaintiff (a tram-conductor) and the company provided that a breach of the company's rules should render the plaintiff liable to dismissal and to the forfeiture of any unpaid wages already earned and that the certificate of the manager\u2014who was to be \"the sole and final judge\" upon the question whether a breach had in fact occurred\u2014should be conclusive evidence of that fact in any court. The manager without hearing the plaintiff in his own defence, gave a certificate to the effect that a breach of the rules had been committed by the plaintiff. The court held that the certificate was invalid. Lord Esher said:\u2014\nA party could not be deprived of wages already earned without a hearing. It was a necessary implication that the party should be heard, and it would be monstrous to suppose otherwise.\nThe reported decisions afford also many examples of the application of the principle to the conduct of public officials invested by statute with authority to decide upon the existence of facts necessary to justify the exercise of a power to expel from an office, or to deprive of a benefice, or to invade private rights of property. Many such cases are referred to in the judgment of Sir Robert Collier in Smith v. The Queen[9]. In that case the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had to consider the legal validity of a proclamation of the Governor of Queensland declaring the forfeiture of a lease granted under the Crown's Land Alienation Act. The proclamation professed to be in pursuance of a section of that statute under which\nif at any time during the currency of a lease it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners\nthat the lessee had abandoned his selection, it was made lawful for the Governor to declare a forfeiture of the lease. The Judicial Committee held it to be essential that a proclamation under this enactment be preceded by a decision of the Commissioners, which, to satisfy the statute, could only be arrived at after an inquiry conducted in conformity with the principles governing inquiries of a judicial nature; and that as a fair opportunity had not been given the lessee to meet the case against him, the decision of the Commissioners and the proclamation of forfeiture must be pronounced to be alike nullities. An analogous rule was applied in the Province of Quebec in Richelieu and Ontario Navigation Go. v. Commercial Union Assurance Co.[10].\nIt is undisputed that in this case the act of the minister in professing to declare a forfeiture was not preceded by any. inquiry which can be said upon the above principles to satisfy the requirements of the law as regards inquiries of a judicial or quasi-judicial character, and it follows that this act was inoperative.\nA further contention by Mr. Shepley remains. It is said that the stipulations contained in the earlier part of the 4th clause of the lease\u2014requiring the lessees to have upon their location within the first year of the term machinery of a character indicated in that clause, and within that year to commence active operations in working their location\u2014are conditions subsequent; and that failure on the part of the lessees to comply with either of these stipulations having been proved the Crown is entitled to judgment declaring the forfeiture of the term.\nIt is not, I think, necessary to pronounce upon the question whether, on a fair reading of the lease as a whole, these stipulations are or are not justly to be regarded as conditions, or upon the question whether, assuming them to be such, a breach of either of them has been established. Conceding both of these points to the Crown still I think the claim in this action fails.\nIt is well settled that the effect of a condition subsequent in a lease (whether a right of re-entry be or be not expressly vested in the lessor) is not to render the lease void on a failure on the part of the lessee to observe the condition but voidable at the option of the lessor or the person entitled to the reversion; Davenport v. The Queen[11]; and some act on the part of the person entitled to exercise the option, definitely indicating his intention to do so, is necessary to effect the determination of the lease.\nNow I think that in this lease the mode in which, upon a breach of the stipulations last mentioned, that intention is to be signified is expressly prescribed; and that to enable the Crown to take advantage of such a breach it is necessary that the course which the instrument itself marks out should be pursued.\nBy the 18th clause of the lease the demise is made expressly subject to the hydraulic regulations of the 3rd December, 1898; and by the 12th section of those regulations it is provided:\u2014\n12. In case any lessee shall at any time make default in the payment of \/the rental or the royalty payable under these regulations, or shall make default in the performance of the conditions imposed by these regulations or by the lease, the Gold Commissioner may post a notice in a conspicuous place upon the location in connection with\" which such default has been made, and may mail a copy of such notice to the last address of the lessee known to the Commissioner, requiring such default to be remedied, and in case such default is not remedied within three months of the date of the posting of the notice upon the location all the rights of the lessee under the lease and under these regulations shall be and become ipso facto null and void.\nMoreover by the 10th clause of the instrument itself the parties have in substance contracted to the same effect:\u2014\nThat if the lessee shall at any time during the said term fail to pay the rent or royalty hereby reserved or any part thereof within sixty days after the same, respectively, shall have become due or if he shall commit any breach or default in the observance of the above conditions or of any of them other than that referred to in the clause numbered \"4\" of these presents, then, and in every such case the Gold Commissioner may post a notice in a conspicuous place upon the said demised premises and may mail a copy of such notice to the last address of the lessee known to the Commissioner requiring such default to be remedied and in case such default is not remedied within three months of the date of the posting of the notice upon the location all the rights of the lessee under the said lease and under the said regulations of the order in council of the 3rd day of December, A.D. 1898, shall be and become ipso facto null and void provided that the claim of Her Majesty or her successors or assigns for any rent or royalty then due or accruing due, or any remedy for the recovery thereof shall be in no wise affected by such cancellation.\nI have no doubt that the \"condition\" described as \"that referred to in clause numbered 4,\" to which the clause I have quoted is not to apply, is the condition which I have already considered at some length and in respect of which a right of re-entry is expressly given; that, namely, which requires the lessees to expend annually a specified amount in working their location. As regards the other stipulations in that clause (numbered 4) they must, I think, in their character of conditions be read as if the provisions of clause 10 of the lease and clause 12 of the regulations were incorporated with them.\nIt is conceded that the course appointed by these provisions has not been taken and consequently the option to forfeit the term must be held not to have been validly exercised.\nThis appears to be sufficient to dispose of the action, and the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Belcourt & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent; Macdonald, Shepley, Middleton & Donald.\n*Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused on 18th July, 1908.\n[1] 14 Can.

The reasons for the judgment appealed from were stated by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge in terms exactly similar to those mentioned in the report of the case of The Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[1], at page 282; the same clause (12) of the hydraulic regulations of 3rd December, 1898, was in question, as well as clauses in the appellants' lease in the same terms as those quoted in the Bonanza Greek Hydraulic Concession Case[2], at page 283.\nThe special circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. and Lar-month for the appellants.\nShepley K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I also agree in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIdington J.\u2014Parliament passed on the 13th June, 1898, the \"Yukon Territory Act\" setting apart the Yukon Judicial District which up to that time had formed a part of the North-West Territories, as a separate territory to be known under the name of the Yukon Territory.\nThe Governor in Council was given by that Act subject to the provisions thereof power to make ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the territory. It was provided subject to the provisions of the Act that the laws and ordinances as the same existed in the North-West Territories should remain in force until amended or repealed by Parliament or ordinances of the Governor in Council.\nPrior to the passing of this Act there existed mining regulations applicable to the North-West Territories and thus applicable to the New Yukon Terri- tory. These regulations had been consolidated apparently by an ordinance of the 18th January, 1898, under the heading of\u2014\nRegulations governing placer mining in the provisional district of the Yukon, North-West Territories.\nI do not find any definition of \"placer mining\" in these regulations or elsewhere in legislation affecting the territory in question, until 1906. Indeed I cannot find these words used in the enacting part of these regulations except in so far as they appear in the forms. One of these forms refers to \"placer mining as defined in the said regulations,\" We must I think seek, therefore, for this definition and the meaning of \"placer mining\" so far as it has any meaning, in relation to the questions raised here, in the nature and quality of the rights and privileges defined in the said regulations, and the operations carried on thereunder or contemplated to be carried on thereunder. The rights or privileges provided therein were those conferred upon persons known as free miners enjoying a license (renewable yearly) from the Government under the said regulations. These licenses provided for the licensees each operating comparatively small parcels of land; 250 feet by 1,000 feet being the largest. Provisions were made for staking out such claims and for their allotment. No method of working is specified. The use of water, however, was provided for.\nSo far as I can see it would have been quite competent for a free miner having acquired a license conferring upon him the right to work one of these claims to have used any machinery, hydraulic or otherwise, that he saw fit. He could not receive a grant of more than one claim in a mining district but might in addition to one such hold a hill claim acquired by him under these regulations in communication with a creek, gulch or river-claim, and any number of claims by purchases. Any number of miners might unite to work their claims in common.\nIt is obvious that for the purposes of working such limited claims expensive machinery would not be expedient as a form of investment. It is quite as obvious that even if no machinery or very little machinery were used in operating, the system could not attract the investment of large capital and all its use implies.\nA Mr. Anderson, in December, 1897, applied to the Department of the Interior for a lease of part of the lands now in question for \"hydraulic mining\" purposes.\nThe then minister reported that in his opinion it was desirable to introduce \"hydraulic mining\" in the Yukon District and that Mr. Anderson should be given an opportunity to ascertain whether or not this kind of mining was practicable on the tract applied for. A lease was given him subject to certain conditions on the 24th day of December, 1898. The phrase \"the method of mining known as hydraulic mining\" is used in the recital describing the nature of the application for the lease. The words \"hydraulic mining,\" \"hydraulic mining operations,\" \"hydraulic machinery,\" repeatedly appear in this lease. Nothing appears therein defining the meaning of these terms.\nSome other territory was added shortly after to Anderson's concession.\nOn the 3rd December, 1898, and prior to granting this lease to Mr. Anderson, a new set of mining regulations headed \"for the disposal of mining regulations in the Yukon Territory to be worked by hydraulic or other mining process\" was adopted.\nOn the 12th February, 1900, the lease now in question was made by Her late Majesty Queen Victoria represented by the Minister of the Interior of Canada thereinafter called \"the minister\" to the appellants. This lease was in substitution for all that which Anderson had acquired. I infer he had induced the formation of the appellants' company and made arrangements for it acquiring his rights and such further rights as the minister was induced to concede.\nIn this lease there are recitals almost identical with those in the Anderson lease but with this marked difference, that in the first recital the words \"by hydraulic or other mining process\" are substituted for the words \"by method of mining known as hydraulic mining. In the second recital the words \"hydraulic mining\" stand unchanged as in the second recital of the original lease.\nWhen we find that in this second recital the words \"his own use and benefit\" are continued although in this case it is a corporate body that is being spoken of, we realize fully that care had not been exercised in drafting the recital and to that may be attributed the repeating of the same phrase of \"hydraulic mining\" instead of \"hydraulic or other mining process\" as in the preceding recital and elsewhere throughout the lease, and in the regulations under which the lease is made.\nThe third recital seems identical except in regard to the date. It is, I think, quite clear that the parties concerned intended by the departure, thus evidenced, from the original phraseology respectively to give and to acquire more extensive rights than the words \"hydraulic mining\" might have restricted the lessees to.\nThis lease to the appellants purports to be given pursuant to the regulations of the 3rd December, 1898, but in the order in council permitting it to be made the express exception was made that the rental of $500 per annum then being paid for the location should be charged instead of the lower rental prescribed by the regulations.\nIt incorporates the regulations by rendering it subject thereto \"as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if they were set forth\" in the lease.\nThe appellants took possession under the said lease, brought certain machinery and mechanical appliances and had them installed as required in the first year of the term on the property in question and have carried on mining operations upon such property ever since, sometimes with all such appliances, sometimes with only part thereof.\nThe yearly rental of $500 was paid and accepted by the Department until the declaration of forfeiture about to be referred to.\nOn the 21st August, 1900, the mining inspector pursuant to request reported to the Assistant Gold Commissioner, an officer appointed pursuant to the statute and regulations, and under the Minister of the Interior, that there had been prior to the date of the second lease substantial machinery and subsequent thereto also very substantial machinery brought on and installed for the purposes of operating the mining location in question.\nHe amongst other things said:\u2014\nI must say that the company are doing their work in an excellent way under the direction of Mr. Martin who intends doing some winter sluicing in a most ingenious method the start of which I have seen and hope will prove successful.\nHe also remarked that the company were working ground quite unsuitable for individual mining as the dirt they were getting only averaged about $6 to the cubic yard.\nOn the 12th November, 1902, Mr. Beaudette, mining engineer, in answer to a telegram reported to the minister that the operations conducted on this concession were of a placer nature, only and the operations were; not conducted on as large a scale as some of the placer mining claims on the same creek, that the machinery used was only useful in connection with placer mining operations and could not be used for hydraulicing, but there was however a pump and hydraulic pipes on the ground which were used to hydraulic a hill about a year previously but then practically abandoned and useless as the ground within the location was situated on a creek bed with no water to operate, or grade and dumping ground to deposit the tailings on, and consequently unsuitable for such purposes.\nThere had been, he reported, $5,000 expended as near as he could judge in actual mining operations on this location in that year.\nOn the 10th December of the same year, Mr. Gosselin, Assistant Gold Commissioner, certified to the same effect, and reported to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior on the same day enclosing affidavits of Anderson and others as to the work and adding that even if shewn to be in excess of $5,000 it was by the ordinary placer mining methods, that in some cases placer mining was carried on upon a larger scale, repeated what was reported above by the mining: engineer, and closed by saying: Under the circumstances I have issued accordingly my certificate to the effect that the concessionnaires have done work on the concession to the extent of at least $5,000.\nSimilar complaints followed the next year.\nIt is quite noticeable that the officials in the Yukon were somewhat in doubt as to whether an expenditure in the way of what was called placer mining could be a fulfilment of the lease or not, and in the year previous to that now in question the matter was disposed of by the direct instructions of the Department to recognize what was done as complying with the lease.\nOn the 26th April, 1905, Mr. Finnie, Assistant Gold Commissioner, certified accordingly as the Secretary had instructed\nthat it had been proven to his satisfaction that the lessees of hydraulic mining location described in Lease No. 1, which was issued on the 12th February, 1900, in favour of the Klondyke Government Concession, Ltd., of London, England, have expended in actual mining operations, in, about or upon the said hydraulic location, the sum of at least $5,000 during the year commencing the twelfth day of February, 1904.\nWhether this was done as the result of so interpreting the power of the minister in regard to what we are now called upon to deal with or as a mode of exercising the discretion given him regarding forfeiture for default, does not appear.\nOn the 21st December, 1905, Mr. Gosselin, as Assistant Gold Commissioner, notified the appellants of other complaints of breaches of conditions in the lease, and took steps in respect thereto by virtue of paragraph No. 10.\nOn the 26th January, 1906, Mr. Anderson makes an affidavit as agent of the company as follows, amongst other things:\u2014 2. That during the year which commenced on the 12th February, 1905, the following amount of cash has been paid by the company in connection with mining operations carried on upon the said leasehold during the said period, viz.:\nIn wages.............\n$16,056.65\nIn wood......\n4,101.55\nIn supplies.....\n11,153.25\nMaking a total of.....\n$31,314.45\nThat the mining operations represented by the said expenditure, were as follows, viz.:\u2014\nSunk 6 shafts to bed-rock at an average depth of 30 feet each.\nDrifted underground at the said average depth of 30 feet and uncovered approximately 33,000 square feet of bed-rock, hoisted and sluiced the payable gravel from said driving.\n3. That the said mining operations were carried on by the company directly and not by miners working under any percentage agreements as to the gold recovered from the ground.\n4. That besides those operations, about 100,000 square feet of bed-rock were uncovered, drifted, hoisted and sluiced by different parties of miners working under verbal agreements with the company, whereby those miners were permitted to work pieces of the company's property and to retain a certain percentage of the gold recovered by them in lieu of wages.\nOn the 2nd February, 1906, Mr. Beandette, Government Mining Engineer, reports as follows, to the Assistant Gold Commissioner, that\nthere were six outfits operating on the concession during the summer and I am positive that the amount of Work as represented in the affidavit has been performed. Taking that amount of work as correct, I would estimate the cost to le $14,666.60, as follows:\u2014\n33,000 square feet of bed-rock represent a cubic content of 7,533.03 cubic yards. The cost to remove a cubic yard of gravel by the ordinary placer method is estimated at $2, which is only for labour alone.\nThe property was operated by ordinary placer methods, the same as is found on ordinary individual claims.\nThere were no hydraulic operations conducted on the property during the year.\nOn the 30th April, 1906, the minister notified the appellants\nthat, after due inquiry, the undersigned Minister of the Interior has satisfied himself and has found as a fact that during the year last past of your tenancy under your lease from the Crown * * * your company has failed to expend the sum of $5,000 in active mining operations for the efficient working of the rights and privileges granted by the said lease * * * and thereupon declares the lease void.\nA statement is put in supported by evidence that from first to last those lessees had spent a very large sum of money in each year making a total of something over $523,000. In crediting the amount of money realized from the operations there would be a large sum, largely in excess of $ 5,000 a year, spent by the appellants over and above their entire receipts. It was stated in argument and not contradicted, to be I think $ 150,000 in all.\nThe question is raised whether the minister can, as the result of an ex parte inquiry, in such a case declare such a lease as this forfeited.\nIn this case I am, by reason of the conclusion I have come to for the reasons I am about to give, not troubled with the necessity of determining that question of mode of inquiry in this case.\nThe operative part of the lease is as follows:\u2014\nNow this indenture witnesseth that in pursuance of the premises and in consideration of and subject to the rent, covenants, provisos, exceptions, restrictions and conditions hereinafter reserved and contained and by the lessee to be paid, observed and performed, Her Majesty doth grant, demise and lease unto the lessee the said tract of lands and the exclusive right and privilege of extracting and taking therefrom, by hydraulic or other mining process, all royal or precious metals or minerals from, in, under or upon the tract of lands hereby demised and leased with regard to which the said rights and privileges are hereby granted, which said tract is described as follows, that is to say:\u2014\nThen follows the descriptions of the properties and then habendum and reddendum clauses. Following the latter is this proviso: \"provided always and this lease is subject to the following exemptions, restrictions, provisos and conditions,\" which are numbered from 1 to 18.\nOf these Nos. 4 and 10 are those upon which the questions herein turn and are as follows:\u2014\n4. That the said lessee shall have sufficient hydraulic or other machinery in operation on the said demised premises within one year from the date hereof to permit of his beginning active operations for the efficient working of the rights and privileges hereby granted which active operations he shall begin within the said period; and that if during any year of the said term hereby granted, the lessee shall fail to expend in such mining operations, in, about or upon the said mining rights and privileges hereby granted, the sum of five thousand dollars\u2014of the fact of which failure the Minister shall be the sole and final judge\u2014this lease or demise and the remainder of the term hereby granted, and all benefits, rights and privileges hereby granted to the lessee shall become and be utterly and absolutely null and void, unless the Minister shall otherwise decide; and that in the event of such predetermination of this lease or demise and of the term hereby granted or the remainder thereof, Her Majesty, her successors, or assigns may thereupon re-enter upon the said demised premises and have, hold, use, occupy, possess and enjoy the same and every part thereof, as if these presents had never been executed, and without any compensation or payment of any kind to the lessee for any work done or improvement made thereon;-but nothing herein contained shall in any wise affect the right of Her Majesty or her successors or assigns to all arrears of rent or royalty to be paid as hereinbefore provided or to any remedy for the recovery of such arrears of rent or royalty.\nNo 10 is as follows:\u2014\nThat if the lessee shall, at any time during the said term fail to pay the rent or royalty hereby reserved, or any part thereof, within sixty days after the same respectively shall have become due, or if he shall commit any breach or default in the observance of the above conditions or of any of them other than that referred to in the clause numbered \"4\"of these presents then, and in every such case, the Gold Commissioner may post a notice in a conspicuous place upon the said demised premises and may mail a copy of such notice to the last address of the lessee known to the Commissioner requiring such default to be remedied, and in case such default is not remedied within three months of the date of the posting of the notice upon the location, all the rights of the lessee under the said lease and under the said regulations of the Order in Council of the 3rd day of December, A.D. 1898, shall be and Become ipso facto null and void, provided that the claim of Her Majesty or her successors or assigns for any rent or royalty then due or accruing due, or any remedy for the recovery thereof shall be in no wise affected by such cancellation.\nIt is contended in support of the minister's finding that this paragraph 4 empowered him to do what is complained of in the manner he so did. On the other hand it is contended that he should either have proceeded by directing proceedings to be taken under paragraph 10 as done in cases mentioned above or if that were inapplicable for any reason, that he should have acted under section 12 of the regulations of the 3rd December, 1898, which provides a method somewhat similar to that of said paragraph 10 for dealing with breaches of conditions.\nIt is replied to this contention that the terms of section 10 of the proviso in the lease indicated clearly that everything arising under or out of section 4 of the same proviso is expressly excepted from the operation of section 10 by the words\nor if he shall commit any breach or default in the observance of the above conditions or of any of them other than that referred to under the clause numbered 4 of these presents, etc.\nCan it be said that these words necessarily referred to the whole of paragraph 4? Can they fairly be referred to as having such comprehensive operation? Do they grammatically permit of any such meaning?\nThere is more than one breach or default possible within paragraph 4. Can it be said that the phrase \"other than that\" referred to in the clause numbered 4 can cover more than one? Read grammatically it certainly cannot and of those which is the one that is the most obviously pointed at? Is it not that of the fact of which the minister shall be \"the sole and final judge\" according to paragraph 4? Read thus, restricted thus, and given no wider meaning, it seems fulfilled to the letter. Even if paragraph 10 of the lease should be thus excluded it does not appear that section 12 of the regulations is touched thereby.\nIt is said however that the minister is not confined to the mere words of the latter part of paragraph 4, but that we must read the words \"such mining operations\" therein, in respect of which the $5,000 a year is to be spent in so expansive sense as to include all that precedes them in this paragraph 4 and thereby make the test the minister has the power to apply to be the efficient working of the rights and privileges thereby granted. In this way a; man might from one cause or another have spent $10,000 in working with some hydraulic machinery and done neither himself nor the country any good yet have his lease declared by the minister to have become forfeited because his work had proved inefficient. I do not think such a thing was ever contemplated as confiding such a power to the minister.\nIt is to be observed that the phrase \"such mining operations\" has not necessarily any relation to the words \"efficient working.\" I would say that the words \"such mining operations\" had relation to and referred to and were intended to be governed by the meaning of the terms \"hydraulic or other mining process.\"\nWe are thus brought to a consideration of the bearing of the history I have already given of these words in this connection. We have the words \"hydraulic mining\" adopted in the first lease. We have the words changed to express evidently some wider idea than was expressed by the words in the lease to Mr. Anderson. Why were the words \"or other mining process\" used? Why are they used in the regulations? Why were the regulations framed? Was it not to give effect to the suggestion that the words \"hydraulic mining\" were too restricted? Was it not to give in a wider sense effect to what was the object for which the whole regulations of 3rd December, 1898, were provided? What was that object? It was clearly as was forcibly put forward by counsel for the Crown to induce capitalists to invest their money in projects for the development of the mining lands in the Yukon in a much more comprehensive and expansive way than was being done through the little grants of 250 feet by 1,000 feet renting from year to year and called placer mining. The idea originated with Mr. Anderson. The hydraulic mining method was that which occurred to him at first as being the most appropriate method by which those larger operations could be carried out, but just as clearly it appeared to him later, as the result of a year and a half's experience, that what was known as hydraulic mining might be too restricted a method to induce the investment of capital to bring about the mining development of the territory in the way in which he and the Government desired.\nIf we were to find any charm in the word \"hydraulic\" we find the placer miner regulations recognize an hydraulic process of some kind. The miners are possibly not given much to etymological derivations. But they evidently know, sometimes, how to use water when they see it. We have not been favoured in the legislation under review or even in the evidence with any satisfactory interpretation of the phrase \"hydraulic mining.\" The officials use the term as one having to them a known meaning and that not to include sluicing though uninstructed people might call that a hydraulic process.\nFrom what counsel and witnesses say no doubt the latter was known as a method of applying by a force pump water so as to resolve the hard earth and get thereby at the gold therein.\nI do not suppose any one ever dreamt, in framing this forfeiting power, of it enabling the minister to determine in regard to the efficiency of the operations carried on. It seems to me the plan was adopted (and it was an ordinary business plan) of insisting upon an immediate large expenditure, and then $5,000 being spent annually in mining operations as simple tests of the earnestness of the lessees. No doubt it was supposed that self interest would in such case produce efficiency. It was not to be supposed that having spent the necessary money for equipment it would lie idle and $5,000 more be spent annually merely to duplicate the ordinary efforts of placer miners in rich territory.\nThe reason for the making of the lease of so large an area was its comparatively speaking poor and unproductive soil as compared with that much richer ground that was worked under the placer mining regulations.\nIt was to have this poor ground exploited and on the hypothesis that it could only be done profitably by the use of expensive machinery, hydraulic or otherwise, that all concerned proceeded.\nIt is quite evident that it was upon the supposition that the placer mining regulations and methods could not make this poorer soil productive that the new regulations as to \"hydraulic or other mining process\" were adopted.\nIt was to attract to the working of such poorer soil the necessary capital that these regulations were adopted and this experimental lease was given. If for example the substitution of electric for hydraulic force had become possible and even superior to the latter I do not think any one would have ever had the face to submit that it did not fall within the meaning of these words \"hydraulic or other mining process\" in the regulations or this lease.\nSuch are the inferences drawn by me from the history I have set forth and applied to enable me to see if the contention set up as to the construction of this lease be tenable. I think it utterly fails.\nOf course if the lease had clearly and explicitly set forth such a power in the minister as any of these several contentions maintained by respondent's counsel, we could gather no justifiable assistance from that history or inferences therefrom.\nBeing anything but clear and explicit we must, I think, consider everything leading up to it and immediately following it in order that we, by understanding what those concerned were about or could have had in mind and desired to have done, can in light thereof better read the purport of what they have written.\nIt is not at all to be marvelled at if their expectations failed and the expected application of what is written as an adequate safeguard has failed also.\nThat is no reason for any extending of the meaning of the language of the lease or implying greater power in the minister than is clearly written.\nAbove all a power of forfeiture by the adoption of ex parte methods is not a thing arising from implication but must rest if at all on the clearest expression thereof.\nIt is properly conceded that the minister's action was in good faith.\nThe finding gives no explicit or detailed statement of the grounds on which he acted. We are driven to conjecture. His good faith and the admitted facts regarding expenditure can only be reconciled by assuming that he proceeded upon the assumption that he had the right to determine in what way the work should be carried on and the efficiency thereof before considering the amount of the expenditure and had a right to discard all done that did not fall within the meaning he saw fit to attribute to the words hydraulic mining without giving any effect or force to the words \"or other mining process.\"\nIn so proceeding he was, I submit, exceeding his jurisdiction and therefore his finding was void.\nI was at first disposed to think the case might have been tried and a finding reached on the evidence independently of the minister's finding,\nFor two reasons that is not open. The facts and method of the trial hardly warrant us in so treating the case, and what appears in the views expressed (as to the need to resort to the special methods prescribed by paragraph 10 or by section 12) by my brother Duff, whose opinion in Bonanza Creek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[3], I have read since writing the foregoing. That case was heard immediately before this and turns upon somewhat similar questions arising on a lease in same form. It may be that as I agree in his conclusion as to a need of hearing which was not had here in the way one would like, the allowance of appeal here might well rest on that ground alone.\nThe leading facts are, however, almost entirely dissimilar and there is something of a proffered but limited hearing in this case (non-existent in that) which as well as the differing facts may distinguish the two cases.\nI think well therefore to rest my opinion of this appeal on the grounds I have set forth as well as on non-observance of right to be heard.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I do not think it necessary to express any opinion upon the various matters which were discussed before us in this case, on the question whether the appellants had or had. not been guilty of such violations of the conditions and. stipulations of their lease as to entitle the Crown to terminate it, being of opinion that the minister could not do so without acting judicially, and giving the appellants an opportunity of being heard.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal is governed by the decision in The Bonanza Greek Hydraulic Concession v. The King[4]. The material provisions of the appellants' lease are identical with those considered on that appeal; and, although, in this case, there is evidence of communications and discussions between the minister and the solicitor of the company before the formal declaration of forfeiture, the minister's decision that the lessees had failed in making the expenditure required by the terms of the lease was not, I think, preceded by anything which, within the principle of that case, could be described as a hearing upon that question.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. Appeal allowed with costs.*\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chrysler, Bethune & Larmonth.\nSolicitor for the respondent: George F.

The room was on the second story and inside the street door was a landing leading to a staircase by which it was reached. I. had the only key provided for this street door and always locked it when leaving at night. He paid rent for the room at first and then remained in possession without paying rent for twelve years. The annual tax bills for the whole premises were generally, during that period, left in the room he occupied and were sent by him to the managing owner who paid the amounts. In an action to restrain the owners from interfering with his possession of said room and its appurtenances.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (15 Ont. L.R. 286) and restoring with a modification that of the trial judge (14 Ont. L.R. 17) Idington and Maclennan JJ. dissenting, that I. had acquired a title under the Statute of Limitations to said room and to so much of the structure as rested on the soil to which he had acquired title.\nHeld, per Davies J. He had also acquired a proprietory right to the staircase and the portions of the building supporting said room.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Duff J. The Statute of Limitations does not as against the party dispossessed annex to a title acquired by possession incidents resting on the implication of a grant. I. had, therefore, acquired no rights in the supports.\nPer Idington and Maclennan JJ. The use of the landing and staircase was, at most, an easement and must continue for twenty years to produce the statutory title, and to give title to the supports there would have to be actual possession which was not the case here.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nW.N. Tilley for the appellant. An upper room in a building is land for purposes of the Statute of Limitations; Preston on Estates, vol. 1, pages 8 and 506; and the staircase and landing are land as well; Rains v. Buxton[3]; Bevan v. London Portland Cement Co.[4]; Midland v. Wright[5].\nA title in fee may be acquired to a tunnel or underground way; Bevan v. London Portland Cement Co.4; and consequently in a stairway.\nThe right of support is an incident to the ownership of the room and goes with the title acquired in the latter; Harris v. Ryding[6], at p. 76; Humphries v. Brodden[7].\nW.D. McPherson K.C. for the respondent. The plaintiff had not the actual, continuous, visible occupation of the premises which is necessary to bar the title of the owner. See McConaghy v. Denmark[8]; Harris v.Mudie[9].\nThe parties here were relatives and the plaintiff never acted as if he was trying to acquire title. For both reasons his assertion of the right now will not be favoured. Hemmingway v. Hemmingway[10]; Sanders v. Sanders[11].\nIt is doubtful if a title can be acquired in an upper room such as this. A lease of a room gives the lessee no interest in the land. Shawmut National Bank v. City of Boston[12]; Harrington v. Watson[13].\nIn any case title to nothing more than the room itself could be acquired. See Doe d. Freeland v. Burt[14], in which it was held that the demise of a yard did not carry with it the use of a cellar under the yard.\nMoreover, the right of support and the right to use the landing and staircase are easements calling for twenty years\u2019 possession to bar the owner\u2019s title. Dalton v. Angus[15]; Littledale v. Liverpool College[16].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am in favour of allowing this appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the trial judge in this case and think the appeal should be allowed and his judgment restored.\nThe questions to be determined are whether or not the evidence shewed the plaintiff to have had such an open and exclusive possession for such a length of time of the up-stairs flat of the building in dispute with the passage way leading exclusively to it as gave him a statutory title to this flat and passage way as against the defendants, and, if so, whether or not as against them he had a right to an injunction restraining them from carrying out their declared intention of pulling down the lower part of the house and so destroying the upper flat and stairway.\nI am unable to draw any distinction between the possession of the plaintiff with respect to the upstairs rooms and the stairway. I agree with the trial judge and with Garrow J., in the Court of Appeal, that\nthe outer door, landing, stairway and workshop all formed part of one and the same parcel, the outer door of which plaintiff was accustomed to lock when leaving, forming in fact the outer door of his shop, and that his title to each and all should stand or fall together.\nI also agree on the legal aspect of the case with what I would gather to have been the conclusion of Mr. Justice Osler, though he expresses it in a guarded way, that the right of support by the lower story of the building which was essential to the continued existence of the plaintiff\u2019s acquired rights in the stairway and workshop was a proprietary right in his property rather than a positive easement.\nI have read and carefully considered the numerous authorities cited by counsel having more or less a bearing upon the legal questions in dispute, and, while no case can be found exactly deciding that a title to a set of chambers or rooms or flat in a building not resting on the soil directly can be acquired or gained by possession under the Statute of Limitations, still there are so many dicta on the point by distinguished and learned judges that I have reached the conclusion that such a title to such a limited part of a building can be so acquired. Of course the rights so acquired are subject to the conditions which limit all questions of rights by length of enjoyment only.\nI did not understand it to be contended that a valid grant could not be made of an upper room or flat in a building which would give the grantee such a right as amounted to ownership of the space within the room or flat or part of the building granted with, as against the grantor, a right of support and a necessary right of passage to the premises.\nIt would seem clear from the authorities that such is the case. Reilly v. Booth[17].\nMr. McPherson did, however, as I understand his argument, contend that the statute did not operate to enable an estate to be acquired by possession in a part of a building not connected directly with the soil and that even if it did the right to support was an easement not within the statute and could only be acquired by twenty years\u2019 possession, and not by twelve.\nIt is true that the Statute of Limitations does not transfer the rights of the dispossessed owner to the squatter. It only purports to extinguish by lapse of time any rights to possession which ought to have been exercised during the period limited. Tichborne v. Weir[18]; In re Nisbet and Potts Contract[19]. But nevertheless the squatter does obtain after the expiration of the statutory period a title recognized by law and the right to use the premises for all lawful purposes as against every one whose title is barred or extinguished.\nThen, does such a right and title so acquired carry with it the right of support from the underlying part of the building? It was laid down in the judgment of the Court of Exchequer Chambers in Bonomi v. Backhouse[20] in 1859, that the right of support for buildings, when acquired, is precisely similar in its character to the natural right of support for the soil.\nBy parity of reasoning it seems to me such right of support applies to the upper part of a building as against the lower. It is not contended that such right would not exist in the case of a grant of the upper part and I can see no reason why it should not exist with respect to land and premises acquired by possession unless it is held to be a positive easement within the 35th section of the statute and only to be acquired by the time prescribed in that section.\nBy that statute, land is declared to extend to messuages and all other hereditaments whether corporeal or incorporeal. It, therefore, clearly includes a flat or room or part of a house as well as a whole house. I can see no good reason or justification for confining the meaning to a part of a building directly connected with the soil. Once that conclusion is reached, that an upper room or flat is land within the statute and capable of being acquired by possession for a period of twelve years, then it appears to me we are, ex necessitate, bound to hold that the right of support is a proprietary right passing with the premises acquired by possession, essential to its existence and inseparable from it. If it is not so but is on the contrary a positive easement within the thirty-fifth section, then it would not be acquired until twenty years had elapsed. The result would be that an exclusive right to the use of the rooms would have been acquired under the fourth section after twelve years\u2019 open and exclusive possession but that such right would be made illusory and liable to be defeated at any time during the eight years between the twelve years and the twenty years by the owner, whose right to the rooms had been extinguished, pulling down the whole structure or otherwise withdrawing the support. I cannot think that a fair construction of the Act. The true construction of the two sections, I think, is to hold that the easements specially legislated for in the thirty-fifth section are positive and affirmative easements only. Otherwise we would have the strange anomaly created by two sections of the same statute, one section declaring that a title might be acquired to part of a building by twelve years of open exclusive possession, and the other that no title was acquired to that right of support which is essential to the former\u2019s existence, and that a subsequent owner whose title was extinguished to the house or part of the house above him, could destroy it altogether by taking away that which had been its natural and necessary support during the whole period necessary to acquire the possessory title.\nThese rights of support are doubtless of the nature of an easement, but they may be likened rather to those of a riparian proprietor in the water flowing past and bounding his land.\nSurely the rights of a riparian proprietor, if a squatter became such a proprietor, would follow as a consequence upon his possession when it had ripened into a statutory title and so, I take it, a possession of a house or flat which, after the statutory period of twelve years had ripened into a title, would carry with it what was absolutely essential to its existence, namely, a right to support from the subjacent part of the same house. So far as the authorities are concerned since the case of Dalton v. Angus[21], in the House of Lords, the question may be considered an open one, though, as is said in Gale on Easements, p. 357, at present the balance of authority so far as the number of dicta goes must be held to be against the view that such an easement was a positive one. As I have already said, I think, so far as the right of support is concerned, in circumstances such as those now before us, it would be held to be a proprietary right and follow as a necessary incident of the land or premises to which it is attached.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Seven persons owned some land in Toronto. Appellant was one of them and the others were his brothers and sisters. He managed the estate on behalf of all. While doing so he occupied, as a tinsmith shop, the room in question which formed part of that estate, and consisted of a second story of an old frame building having a frontage of 13 feet 6 inches on Bay street and depth of 62 feet and was adjoined on either side by other parts of the said estate. This room was reached by a stairway, closed in on one side by the outside frame wall of the building, and on the other side by a partition between it and a closed shop or shed underneath this upper room. The landing at the foot was just big enough to swing therein an ordinary door that closed, when desired, the entrance from the street. The size of the landing at the top is not clearly shewn. There was, however, between that landing and this room across the entrance thereto another door. There was in it, as well as in the street door, a slot to receive mail matter, which might be deposited through either as found convenient.\nThe appellant and his co-owners agreed he should sell to them his seventh share in the whole property and he accordingly conveyed the same in 1882 to the respondents and ceased to meddle in the management.\nHe continued to use the room in question and stairway as he had previously done but paid rent therefor at the rate of $6 a month. There was no lease in writing.\nThe management of the entire property passed to the hands of his sister Martha and from the father\u2019s death in 1890 she seems to have failed to ask for rent and he, confessedly not supposing he was dispossessing any one, or acquiring any new right, as consistently failed to pay or offer to pay rent.\nThe appellant claimed he had acquired a title to this room and stairway by virtue of such possession as he had had and of \u201cThe Real Property Limitations Act\u201d of Ontario and asked the Court to enjoin the owners of the soil and shop below his from altering, removing or dealing with the same in such a way as to interfere with the use of the room and stairs in question.\nThis was adjudged him by the learned trial judge, but the Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, dismissed the action and declared the respondents herein entitled to the possession of the premises in question.\nI agree in this result which accords with the intention of all parties.\nIt may in one sense be truly said that intention is out of the question, for the statute provides, in the absence of an entry, for intention being expressed only in two ways, by payment of rent or a written acknowledgment.\nYet when we are asked to give to equivocal acts of possession such effect as to convert what was only a right in the nature of a license or easement into exclusive possession which will operate under the statute to the extinction of an owner\u2019s right we are permitted to consider the intention.\nWas the use of the stairway as a means of access to the room in question anything but that which would be exercised by virtue of a mere license or easement?\nHad the appellant ever any other cause, than such use, for its occupation? Did he ever occupy it in any other way? Can such a mode of occupation ever be said to be of that exclusive sort that will so satisfy the statute as to extinguish the title of the owner?\nIn general the right to use a stairway is only an easement. The nature of the thing is such that it can be and often is made to serve many adjoining freeholds or leaseholds. It is hardly ever used as a place of occupation though occasionally landings leading thereto in large cities may be found so used in the way of business stands.\nAs to a street door leading thereto how does that affect the nature of the occupation? Even if each of numerous tenants had a key and locked the street door each time one entered how could it change the nature of an occupation thus enjoyed by many? What difference can it make if only one?\nIt is the exclusion of the owner that is first to be considered.\nThe cases shew that a succession of exclusive occupancies may extinguish, when that is continued for the requisite time, the title of the owner. These successive occupants may be one or many alternately.\nThen why may not a dozen or more tenants, using one door to enter a stairway in like manner, at the end of any ten years, be held to have extinguished the owner\u2019s title to the stairway?\nI put it thus as a case I suspect quite common in large blocks and as what seemed to be quite in line with the sort of occupancy the appellant first acquired here.\nI should be loathe to say anything that would thus jeopardize the rights of landlords in a very large class of cases.\nThe mere setting out of a pot or a pan occasionally on the stairway or landing of the stairway, by or for a customer coming in appellant\u2019s absence, is to my mind evidence (if any importance be attached to it at all) more against than for the appellant.\nIt indicates that the door at the head of the stair may have been locked as a rule, in case the appellant left his shop. Else why not leave them inside? And further it suggests what is highly probable that the outside door was neither locked nor shut during the day.\nThat the appellant had a key and locked it usually at night adds nothing. A dozen tenants in a well kept place might all do so and have keys. It would be rather perilous for landlords who often rent their rooms without seeing them for years and as a matter of course treat the stair as an easement, for which no rent is exacted, but the entrance to which is enclosed by a door that prudence demands the tenant or tenants should keep locked at night.\nSuppose the many combined or dwindled to one and the doors at each were kept locked by night, and if you please, by day, as suited the dwellers, yet using it only for a passageway, could such an easement be converted thereby without more into an exclusive occupancy that in ten years would obliterate the owner\u2019s title? Or suppose a number using in common such a stair for ten years, each using it for different rooms, but to the continuous exclusion of all others: Could they acquire thereby a title?\nSuppose this stairway was only the stairway to a room on some one else\u2019s property and originally let to that some one else as a stairway, could it with every other feature that is shewn to have been peculiar to this one and to its use to serve this room ever have been dreamt of as a subject of acquisition in the way now suggested?\nIf the respondents had chosen to build on their land adjoining this stairway and used as a means of access to such new building the way over this stairway I would not have supposed in such a case and on the bald sort of evidence we have before us trespass would have lain at the suit of the appellants as against the respondents.\nThe slot in the door at the head of the stair to my mind speaks volumes in this regard. The history of the stairway so far as we have it also indicates it was for a tenant\u2019s use in getting access to the room in common with others or otherwise as might be required having regard to the general development of the property.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the right to use this entrance and stairway was at the beginning but that of license or in the nature of an easement I hold it remained so.\nIn relation to that and the intention of the appel- lant in its use we may be permitted to consider the question of intention in the. sense it was regarded in the case of Littledale v. Liverpool College[22].\nApplying the evidence of intention to be derived from the annual incident of appellant looking as a matter of course to the respondents\u2019 paying the taxes, we certainly are assured that the character of the right exercised was throughout the same.\nIt is moreover of some significance that the assessment regularly and properly made as we may presume it to have been should have led to such results.\nDoubtless the respondents appeared on assessment and tax schedules as owners and the appellant as tenant according to the requirements of the Assessment Act, or the appellant never would have thought of sending the tax bills to his sister.\nHis own evidence which supplements an admission that the taxes were so paid is as follows:\u2014\nWere the tax bills ever sent to you to pay?\nA.\u2014They were left in my shop.\nQ.\u2014What did you do with them? A.\u2014I either took them myself or sent them to my sister.\nThe only question about which I have had any concern was in regard to the landing at the foot of the stairway, but as it formed only a necessary part of the whole of which the only occupancy consisted of acts of user characteristic of the use of that of an easement, I conclude it must go with the stairway.\nHence no right has been acquired thereto. Sufficient length of time has not elapsed to give a prescriptive right to an easement in the stair or entrance.\nThe appellant\u2019s title, such as it is, must be in this way only if at all to the room. In regard to a novel claim thereto of this kind I think, in the entire absence of semblance of precedent for such a claim, we must, to begin with, apprehend correctly the nature of the right to support for such a room. Whose was the support? Did the appellant ever acquire any right therein?\nWe heard much urged of a \u201cnatural right\u201d to support. An industrious search for legal foundation for such a claim has failed to discover any or any legal right to support, but that which the court came to rest the right on in the case of Dalton v. Angus[23], and which leaves, I submit, no well-founded pretension for any such thing as a \u201cnatural right,\u201d save in the case where two adjoining parcels of land have been acquired in a state of nature; and then this natural support is something which he digging has no right to meddle with.\nWhether in the ultimate analysis of reason therefor the right is resolved or not into an implied grant or implication in the grant or an application of the legal force of the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non Ioedas I will not pause to inquire.\nI merely notice it to say that there is a manifest difference between that case or such a right springing therefrom, and the right that may be sought to be imposed upon the artificial works of a man who, in the making or exercising of dominion over that which he has created, can hardly be said to have conferred upon any one a natural right to use or enjoy the fruits of the labour of him so creating; and especially so to rest thereupon a means of depriving him of his property. Truly it seems a queer case to which to extend the use of the above maxim coined as the expression of a rule primarily adopted for executing justice.\nIt seems to me self-evident that any one seeking in any way to enjoy any right dependent on the use of such a creation, whether that creation is in turn dependent upon mother earth for a support or not, must trace his right to a grant or license of some sort, express or implied.\nI am not oblivious of the fact that the use of the phrase \u201cnatural right\u201d to support has been countenanced in some cases in a way apparently inconsistent with what I am expressing.\nI think, however, that the case of Dalton v. Angus[24] should as a result of the discussion and exposition of the law therein, though possibly not necessarily of the decision, put an end to its use in that way.\nThe following summary of Gale on Easements (7 ed.), at p. 357, does not inaccurately express the legal result thereof to be kept in mind so far as we are concerned here, in apprehending as I have said we must the nature of the right to support that the appellant had for his alleged room and of the legal right or title the respondents had in and to that support and to its removal if and when they so desired.\nThe paragraph reads as follows:\u2014\nBut the decision of the House of Lords may be taken as finally establishing the rule, that twenty years\u2019 enjoyment of support to a building, whether from the adjacent or from the subjacent land, being peaceable, open and as of right, will (either by a right springing out of the enjoyment of the common law, or under the \u201cPrescription Act,\u201d or under the doctrine of presumed grant) confer the right to have the support continued; that, if the right is based on the presumption of a grant founded on the enjoyment, the presumption is absolute and cannot be rebutted by shewing that no grant has in fact been made; and that, if notice be material, then, in the absence of any wilful fraud or concealment, the outward appearance of the building is sufficient notice to all persons concerned of the amount of support which it requires.\nThis is an affirmative statement of the result of twenty years\u2019 enjoyment and in this the converse case to be considered I may add as the result of looking into the authorities that nowhere has it been held, short of express grant or license, that such a right of support upon or derived from artificial structure has been ever held to exist merely by reason of user for less than twenty years.\nSuch being the case how can it be said to have been shewn that the appellant had in relation to this room that kind of occupation which this court held in McConaghy v. Denmark[25], must be the case of one setting up a possessory title under the statute, i.e., \u201can actual, continuous and visible character\u201d or as expressed in Sherren v. Pearson[26], at p. 585 \u201can occupation exclusive, continuous, open or visible and notorious.\u201d\nI am unable to attribute to the acts of the appellant herein any such meaning.\nA possession that depends for its daily continuance on the enjoyment of that support which is in the absolute dominion of him against whom the time is supposed to be running and which had not yet earned for the alleged adverse possessor when the full time in question is supposed to have run, the right longer to continue that support is hardly within what one must feel was the sentiment lying at the very foundation of Statutes of Limitation.\nGranting as possible that the possession of a flat may ripen into a title, when the enjoyment of that possession rested upon some right of support already acquired and continuing as of right in the possessor during the currency of that ripening of the possession of the flat, yet this is far from that.\nNor can I see how the supposed acquisition of the upper part by that length of possession that goes merely to extinguish the legal estate the owner had, can ever draw to it as if appurtenant thereto any right in the easements of support necessary to the enjoyment of the upper part any more than any other mere easement as distinguished from an incident of the property unless such easement by the terms of its grant enure to or operate in favour of the actual possessor.\nThat other titles than those acquired by virtue of the Real Property Limitation Acts do generally carry with them a right of support helps not in the slightest degree.\nOne rests on express or implied consent. The other on the absolute negation of any right in another but only within certain limits of which the boundaries are defined by the acts of the trespasser thus and thereby become legal possessor.\nBeyond his actual possession he takes nothing, acquires nothing, for the statute operates to extend his dominion only so far as the rights of him who has ceased to possess have been extinguished by the possession of another, and nothing beyond has been rendered subject to his will.\nI did not overlook the fact that expressions exist in some authorities shewing the title acquired to be the equivalent of that held by him who had got a grant of the land and thus apparently extending this right beyond what I state. The case of Tichbourne v. Weir[27], where it was argued that the adverse possessor, whose possession had thus extinguished the rights of a lessee, must be held by virtue of those authorities to be as if assignee of the lease, clears up the position. It was held no such position was tenable.\nWilkes v. Greenway[28], bears out so far as it goes the view I have expressed and is not inconsistent with the strict meaning of the authorities referred to.\nStatutes now exist giving presumptively to a conveyance of land the widest effect in regard to carrying with the title thereto all the easements appurtenances and all else used or enjoyed therewith by him conveying. That cannot prevail here by virtue of possession, yet it is in truth what seems to be claimed as the result thereof. Such was not what a mere conveyance of the land meant when the Real Property Limitations Act was enacted.\nThere is another view presented by some and that is that the adverse possessor must be held to be claiming by his acts of possession everything accessory to as well as the particular parcel itself.\nI perceive the force of that reasoning, or assertion rather, but when it has, if ever, to be accepted as the claim made and resulting in so wide an acquisition, we must abandon I think the tests I have cited which at present ought to bind this court as to the nature of the occupancy.\nBut before passing the contention I have just alluded to, I may notice its relation to a point made, and doubted or denied in argument, that an estate in law can be created in an upper chamber. This point was passed with such sort of discussion without con- necting or pressing its relation to this contention I am now considering. It may well be that having such an estate created by grant its creation in that way implies the right to the use of the easement or support. Then it may well be argued that an adverse possession of that estate thus created may when the necessary time has run to ripen it by extinction of the owner\u2019s rights carry with it all that its original creation implied.\nI do not say in the absence of argument (and as in my view it is unnecessary for this case to decide) how such a condition of things might result in law.\nI merely state it thus that it may not be supposed to have been overlooked and to apply what I am about to put as its possible relation to the case in hand.\nIt may be said in a way somewhat analogous to the case of the estate thus granted that the tenant at will has entered by the consent of the owner, used the support as an easement whilst paying rent and when he ceased doing so the adverse possession was that which the owner had thus stamped upon it including the easement of support which he himself conceded and cannot be supposed to be separated when the statute began to run.\nAssume some such position arguable at all I deny that the relation of landlord and tenant or aught implied therein can be imported into the condition of things the statute is supposed to deal with.\nIt is the trespasser, or he who at all events holds in law no other relation to the owner that is supposed to be acquiring by time a right, no matter how or what the relation may have been.\nI prefer in any such conceivable cases to hold the other alternative that the statute does not effectively apply to such an alleged possession.\nIn any event this right of support for an upper room is a right that cannot be called accessory to anything the owner had and of which he is being deprived. It was not an easement he held. It was not by virtue of any easement which he had that he was enabled to enjoy the upper room. No such thing was dreamt of. It was part of his property as a whole. It is only to such\u2014claiming as the appellant does\u2014that there is need to create and then annex an easement for his supposed acquisition of property.\nThis aspect of his supposed rights seems supportable only by a most vicious sort of reasoning in a circle.\nTo repeat, it is confusing the rights that flow from grants with those which result from a statutory negation.\nThe surface and underground cases pressed upon us have no analogy for the reasons I have already set forth supplemented by the facts that in none of them can it be said the claim depended on any such right as set up but found non-existent here. And the result, limiting the title so acquired to that part of the estate really occupied, instead of extending it to that further up ad c\u0153lum seems to make against, instead of for the contention, that something outside that actually possessed became accessory thereto, by virtue of necessity for the support thereof.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I dissent from the judgment allowing this appeal. DUFF J.\u2014It is, I think, too late to dispute the proposition that an upper room not resting directly upon the soil but supported entirely by the surrounding parts of a building might at common law be the subject of a feoffment and livery as a corporeal hereditament, that is to say, as land; Co. Litt. 48 b.; Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone 202; 1 Preston Estates 8, 506; Yorkshire Fire & Life Ins. Co. v. Clayton[29]; or that the exclusive use or possession of such a room may validly be granted for a limited or an unlimited time; Reilly v. Booth[30].\nThat such a room may be the subject of a tenancy at will or for a term is not of course to be questioned by anybody.\nNow I cannot understand a tenancy of a corporeal hereditament under which the tenant does not get as against the landlord the exclusive possession of some defined or definable portion of land or of a building or other structure erected upon land. I am then, I must admit with great respect, unable to follow the argument that possession of an upper room under such a tenancy, does not involve a discontinuance of possession on part of the owner as well as such a possession by the tenant as may under the Statute of Limitations ripen into a possessory title. If you have a subject which is land and such a possession of that subject I think the ground is clear for the operation of the statute. This indeed seems to be involved in the enactments both of section 8, which provides that when a person is in possession of land as a tenant from year to year or other period without a lease in writing the right of the person entitled to the land sub- ject to the tenancy shall be deemed to have first accrued for the purposes of the statute at the determination of the first of such periods, and of section 7, which contains a similar provision relating to land held under a tenancy at will. The legislature seems in these sections to have recognized expressly the possession of a tenant at will or from year to year as involving a discontinuance of possession within the meaning of the statute by the person entitled to the land subject to the tenancy, and I can find nothing in the statute which detracts from the force of this recognition.\nThe courts have had no difficulty\u2014if we except the technical point suggested but rejected by Mellish L.J., in the case to which I am about to refer\u2014in applying the statute to seams of coal, although unopened, held under a tenancy at will. In Low Moore Co. v. Stanley Coal Co.[31], the Court of Appeal (Lord Cairns L.C., Lord Coleridge C.J. and Mellish L.J.) affirming the judgment of the Court of Exchequer (Bramwell, Pollock and Amphlett BB.) decided that a tenant at will of seven seams of coal who had entered upon the first two seams only, had for the purposes of the statute (by reason of his tenancy and his possession of the first two seams under it) possession of the remaining five seams, and that at the expiration of the statutory period he had acquired by virtue of that possession a possessory title. The scope of his tenancy was held for the purposes of the statute to define the scope of his possession. So here the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy is not disputed and once the subjects of that ten- ancy are determined the scope of his possession is for the same purposes fixed.\nIt is argued that here there can be no possession within the meaning of the statute, inasmuch as the existence of the plaintiff\u2019s shop and therefore his possession of it depends upon the physical support afforded by the subjacent parts of the structure. But that argument seems to prove far too much. The upper of two strata of soil, divided horizontally, depends for its maintenance upon the support of the lower, which may in turn depend upon the support of strata below. Can it be said that the upper stratum is, because of this physical dependence, incapable of a separate exclusive possession? I confess I cannot understand how that can be maintained; indeed the case I have just cited seems to be conclusive upon the point. The seams of coal in question there depended upon the support of the soil below, which remained in the possession of the owner; Trustees, Executors and Agency Co. v. Short[32]; to the same extent as the maintenance of the plaintiff\u2019s shop depends upon the support it receives from the lower story.\nThe decision as regards this branch of the controversy, must therefore turn upon the answer to the question: What were the premises let to the plaintiff?\nAfter a good deal of doubt and fluctuation of opinion I agree with Mabee J. and Garrow J.A. on that point. Since there was no express agreement defining the premises let, we are left to ascertain what they were by inference from the acts of the parties and the surrounding circumstances. The entrance and stairway were during the whole period of the plaintiff\u2019s possession used as a means of access to the plaintiff\u2019s shop, and the actual use of them was as an ad- junct of the shop only. I think, moreover, that the proper inference from all the evidence is that there was one key only of the street door which remained in the plaintiff\u2019s possession, and I do not think the significance of these facts is affected by the circumstance that this door was usually left open during the daytime. The entrance and stairway were used by the plaintiff and his customers as such approaches would be used in the ordinary course, and I think that as much control as would usually be exercised over such approaches by any tenant to whom they should be let with the shop as part of the demised premises was exercised by the plaintiff. The view most consistent with all these circumstances would seem to be that the approaches and the shop were treated as a unum quid, and that the former were part of the premises let to the plaintiff.\nBut the plaintiff has failed to satisfy me that he has vested in him as the holder of a possessory title to the shop a right of support from the lower story. The Statute of Limitations, when the statutory conditions concerning possession are satisfied, bars the right of the owner of the paper title to make an entry or to bring an action for possession, and moreover extinguishes his title. The possession of the intruder is thus protected, but the statute does not profess to annex to a possessory title so acquired any incidental rights which rest only upon the implication of a grant or of what in law is the equivalent of a grant, and it is, I think, a settled rule that such rights cannot, as against a dispossessed owner, be derived from the statute. Wilkes v. Greenway[33].\nApart from such an implication has the owner of an upper story of a building any such right of sup- port? I think he has none. So far as concerns this case the controversy whether such a right of support, when it exists, is properly described as an easement or as a right incident to the property in respect of which it is enjoyed is I think to quote Lord Blackburn in Dalton v. Angus[34], at page 809, \u201ca question as to words rather than as to things.\u201d The substantial point to be determined here is whether it is a right which may arise from the natural situation of the property itself\u2014(as the rights of a riparian proprietor in respect of the flow of a stream)\u2014or one which must have its origin in a grant or the legal equivalent of a grant. That this last is so as regards the right of support for a building from the subjacent or adjacent soil is very clearly settled law, and I cannot resist the conclusion that the right in question here must stand upon the same footing. I venture with very great respect to say that I agree, in this, with the view expressed by Lord Selborne in Dalton v. Angus34, at pages 793 and 794, and seemingly concurred in by Lord Watson (see p. 831).\nIt follows I think that the plaintiff is not entitled to prevent the defendants demolishing their part of the building merely because some part to which he has acquired a possessory title would thereby lose the support which it now receives; and I did not understand Mr. Tilley to argue that failing to establish a right of support he is on any other principle entitled to prevent the defendants destroying their part of the building.\nThe plaintiff is therefore not entitled to an injunction in the broad terms of the order granted by Mabee J., but he is I think entitled to an order restraining the defendants from interfering with so much of the structure as rests upon that part of the soil itself to which he had acquired a possessory title.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Thompson, Tilley & Johnston.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McPherson & Co.\n[1] 15 Ont.

In January, 1904, he attended a meeting of shareholders and from something he heard there suspected that some of said statements were untrue. After investigation he demanded back his money from the broker and wrote to the president and secretary of the company repudiating his purchase. At subsequent meetings of shareholders he repeated such repudiation and demand for repayment and in December, 1904, brought suit for rescission.\nHeld, that his delay, from January to December, 1904, in bringing suit was not a bar and he was entitled to recover against the company.\nHeld, also, that he could not recover against the directors who had instructed the broker to sell the shares as they were not responsible for the misrepresentations in the prospectus.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (38 N.B. Rep. 364), affirming the decision at the hearing (3 N.B. Eq. 508) reversed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (1) affirming the decree of the judge in equity (2) in favour of the defendants. This is a suit brought in the Supreme Court in Equity, of the Province of New Brunswick, by the appellant against the respondents for the repayment to him of three thousand dollars and interest thereon from the twenty-fourth day of June, 1903, on the ground that the same was obtained fraudulently, illegally, and by false pretences.\nThe Portland Rolling Mills, Limited, one of the respondents, was incorporated under the New Brunswick Joint Stock Companies Act in March, 1899, and has its plant and place of business in the city of St. John. In June, 1903, the respondent, James Manchester, was president, and the respondent, R. C. El-kin, was managing director and treasurer of the company. The capital stock of the company was f 90,000, divided into 900 shares of $100 each, of which the amount paid up prior to June, 1903, was $45,300, comprising 453 shares, leaving 447 shares called \"Treasury Stock\" held by the company and representing $44,700 unpaid at that time.\nOn the 26th of May, 1903, the directors passed a by-law authorizing the issue of $20,000 of treasury stock at par, and empowering the president and treasurer to employ a broker or other person to sell the stock at a reasonable commission. The president of the company, the respondent, Manchester, and the treasurer, the respondent Elkin, pursuant to the said authority, on a subsequent date, but previous to the 24th of June, 1903, employed one F. S. Sharpe, now deceased, to sell the stock at a commission of three per cent. Mr. Sharp drew up a prospectus, in which appeared the names of the directors of the company, and in which, among other things, it was alleged, contrary to fact, that with the exception of a small outside interest, the present paid-up capital of the company was, at that time, held by the directors, and that it was understood they would increase their holdings by taking up most, if not all, of the treasury stock remaining to be disposed of. No mention was made of the liabilities of the company, which at that time amounted to about $120,000. Some time in June, 1903, Mr. Sharpe called on the appellant, read over and gave a copy of the prospectus to him, and asked him to invest in the stock of the company. The appellant, relying upon the statements contained in the prospectus, purchased, through Mr. Sharpe, thirty shares of the capital stock of the company, paying therefor the sum of Three Thousand Dollars. The appellant received a stock certificate for the thirty shares of stock, dated June 24th, 1903, and bearing the seal of the company and the signatures of James Manchester, president, and E. C. Elkin, treasurer.\nThe appellant attended a meeting of the share holders of the company on the 26th day of January, 1904, when for the first time his suspicions were aroused as to the truthfulness of certain statements contained in the prospectus, upon which, among others, he particularly relied in purchasing the stock, viz.: That it was understood the directors (therein named) would increase their holdings by taking up most, if not all, of the treasury stock remaining to be disposed of, and that, with the exception of a small outside interest, the then present paid-up capital of the company was held by the directors. The appellant almost immediately interviewed Mr. Sharpe, and upon obtaining information which confirmed his suspicions, he demanded, of Mr. Sharpe, repayment of the $3,000, and on February 5 1904, he wrote a letter to the president, in which he repudiated the stock, demanding back his money. On two subsequent occasions, in February and March, 1904, he attended shareholders' meetings. At one of those meetings he tendered his stock certificate, and at both meetings reiterated his demand that the money which he paid for the stock he returned to him. He took no part in the business of those meetings, nor did he at any time after he repudiated treat the stock as his own. On March 14th, 1904, the appellant wrote to the secretary of the company, requesting a copy of the last annual report. He made a similar request in a. letter to the president, bearing date of March 19th, 1904. On the 13th of April, 1907, the respondent Manchester wrote to the appellant that the condition under which he took the stock had not been changed. The respondents did not provide the appellant with a copy of the annual report as requested, nor did they return the money and the appellant issued a summons in the Supreme Court in Equity, on December 22nd, 1904.\nThe case was heard before the Judge in Equity, who held that the appellant (plaintiff) had a right, as against the company, upon the ground of misrepresentation, to have the contract rescinded, and the money repaid with interest, but upon the ground of delay in commencing the suit, held that he was debarred from recovering against the company, and therefore was also debarred from recovering against the individual defendants, Manchester and Elkin. He also held that the defendants, Manchester and Elkin, did not authorize the preparation of the prospectus, and did not adopt it in any way, and dismissed the bill as against all the defendants with costs. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court en banc of New Brunswick, and that court, in a judgment delivered by the Judge in Equity (now Chief Justice), dismissed the appeal with costs on the ground of delay in commencing the suit. Hence the appeal to this court.\nEwart K.C. and J. M. Price for the appellant.\nEanington K.C. for the respondent company.\nTeed K.C. for the respondents Manchester and El-kin.\nEwart K.C. and J. M. Price for the appellant. The plaintiff was first put on inquiry in January, 1904, and after investigation immediately repudiated his purchase of the shares. It was the duty of the company then to strike his name from the list of shareholders and return his money. Reese River Silver Mining Co. v.

Currie[18].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The lucid and comprehensive judgment of the learned trial judge, now Chief Justice of New Brunswick, shews how the respondent company engaged an agent to sell stock issued or proposed to be issued by that company and, as a consequence, was responsible for the material misrepresentations made by the agent.\nSo far as the company is concerned and its original liability to rescission arising from these causes and to refund the appellant the money received from him by virtue of such misrepresentation, the learned judge's finding cannot be questioned.\nI cannot agree, however, that the right of rescission was lost by delay.\nThe appellant, at a shareholders' meeting, on 26th January, 1904, had reason, for the first time, to doubt the truth of the representations made to him.\nHe soon saw the agent who had sold the stock and complained to him and demanded a return of his money. Then on the 5th of February, 1904, he wrote the defendant, Manchester, president of the company, to the same effect, attended a meeting on the 16th February, to demand his money back and tender a surrender of his stock, attended another time to repeat this in March, when the meeting failed to organize, and, on the 19th March, wrote a very long letter for the same purpose and to set forth what the agent's side of the story was. These tenders and letters brought no reply till a brief note of the 13th April, which I will refer to later.\nThe repudiation and right to rescission was asserted so promptly and so persistently pressed without eliciting any reply until 13th April, that I fail to see how respondents can complain of delay in suing, at least till then. Contemptuous silence may be a fitting answer to a direct charge of personal fraud. But here, the complaint was of the conduct of an agent. It was the duty of the directors to have investigated. See remarks of Lord Hatherly, if authority needed, referred to later. It was the duty of the appellant to have awaited the result for a reasonable time.\nThe effect of delay or laches is stated in the case of Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[19], at page 239, et seq., as follows:\u2014\nNow the doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary of a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where, by his conduct and neglect, he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted; in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument against relief which otherwise would be just is founded upon mere delay, that delay, of \"course, not amounting to a bar by the Statute of Limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as relates to the remedy.\nThis was cited with approval by Lord Blackburn, in Erlanger v. The New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[20], at page 1278, as follows:\u2014\nI have looked in vain for any authority which gives a more distinct and definite rule than this; and I think, from the nature of the inquiry, it must always be a question of more or less depending on the degree of diligence which might reasonably be required, and \u2022 the degree of change which has occurred, whether the balance of justice or injustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it. The determination of such a question must largely depend on the turn of mind of those who have to decide and must, therefore, be subject to uncertainty; but that, I think, is inherent in the nature of the inquiry.\nHe also cited with approval from Clough v. London and North Western Railway Co.[21], at page 35, the following:\u2014\nWe think that so long as he has made no election he retains the right to determine it either way, subject to this, that, if in the interval whilst he is deliberating, an innocent third party has acquired an interest in the property, or if, in consequence of his delay, the position even of the wrongdoer is affected, it will preclude him from exercising his right to rescind.\nAnd he adds:\nI think it is clear on principle of general justice that as a condition to the rescission there must be a restitutio in integrum. The parties must be put in statu quo.\nThese quotations must be accepted as undoubtedly correct expositions of the law.\nThere has been no departure from these principles by any court deciding any of the cases of shareholders repudiating, in such cases of fraud, the contracts they may have entered into.\nIn regard to the contracts of shareholders or subscribers for shares, the nature of the act enabling the companies, in such cases, to become incorporated or incorporating them and the responsibilities assumed by virtue thereof either to fellow-subscribers or fellow-shareholders or creditors of such corporate bodies have all to be reckoned with in order that any attempted repudiation of a subscription for or acceptance of a share or shares may not be done to the unjust detriment of those third parties; or in conflict with the statutory obligations assumed by virtue of the subscription for shares or of acceptance thereof under the conditions that may have arisen before repudiation.\nThe statutory obligation does not exist in such a case as this. The appellant took no part in creating the company or issuing this new stock, but merely bought and paid in full $3,000 for stock subject to no further call and repudiated the purchase when he found it had been induced by fraud. Neither creditor nor shareholder is entitled to look for further assistance. What then is the third party's right that is to be affected by a rescission? What is the injury to be done such an one? How can it come about? How, by any possibility, could there spring out of the delay from April to December, in this case, any wrong or deprivation that would not have been suffered if suit had been brought in the former month instead of the latter?\nThe reason assigned for any distinction in regard to right of rescission between a contract to take shares and other contracts is well put by Fry L. J., in Re Scottish Petroleum Company[22], at page 438:\u2014\nAs regards such contracts the legislature has interposed and has provided that they shall be made known in a particular way to shareholders and creditors; notice of them is given to the world. Now, the general principle is that no contract can be rescinded so as to affect rights acquired bona fide by third parties under it. It is true that the creditors and the other shareholders have not acquired direct interests under the contract, but they have acquired an indirect interest. The shareholders have got a contributory; the creditors have got another person liable to contribute to the assets of the concern. So that, although in the case of voidable contracts simple repudiation is enough there must, in the case of a voidable contract to take shares be a repudiation and something more before the winding-up commences.\nThat relates to the contract to take shares. But what of the contract to pay for shares taken? The same reasoning answers there also.\nBut what of the cases where the shares have been paid up? There is no new co-contributory or obligation created by statute in favour of the creditor. The creditors stand, just as the creditors of one of the thousand and one others whose fortune, founded on fraud, has disappeared to the grievous disappointment of the creditors.\nThe case of Be Cacher; Lawrence's Case[23], has been relied upon both in the court below and in the argument of the respondent before us.\nWith the greatest respect for the court, I am unable to find how any support can be derived therefrom in this judgment.\nThe Lawrence Case23, is presented to us in the respondent's factum, as follows:\u2014\nIn Lawrence's Case () a delay of May to the 27th of September, being four months and eleven days, was held to be sufficient to deprive the appellant of any right he had to repudiate the shares.\nThere is no question of winding-up in this case.\nBeing typical of other cases and arguments therefrom pressed by respondent's counsel, let us see what it means and what foundation there is to it, or possible use to be made of it for laying a foundation to decide this case.\nThe facts which the report of the case presents are, that when the company was being promoted, in July, 1865, a copy of the prospectus was handed to Lawrence, probably pursuant to previous correspondence in anticipation of the project; that, on the 4th of September, 1865, he signed and sent in an application for 2,000 shares, paying a deposit of 10s. per share; that the company was incorporated and memorandum of association registered on the 11th of September, 1865; that on the 7th October, 1865, he received a letter of allotment of 2,000 shares; that, on the 14th of the same month, he paid the company's bankers a further 10s. per share, giving up his letter of allotment in ex- change for the banker's receipt acknowledging his title to and promising delivery of certificate for such shares; that nothing more passed until 14th May, 1866, between him and the company; that on that date, he and his solicitor had in their hands the whole of the document on which variance was relied for moving to be discharged from the register; that he could then have waived or rescinded but, instead of repudiating, though knowing the register held him out to the world, as a shareholder in and a member of the company allowed his son to hold communication with and influence the conduct of the directors on the footing of he (Lawrence Sr.), being a shareholder. This last was enough, Lord Cairns thought, to disentitle Mr. Lawrence.\nWhat is the possible analogy between such a case under such an Act as the English Joint Stock Companies Act of 1862, and the facts set forth and this case under the New Brunswick Joint Stock Companies Act and the facts made to appear here?\nIt was in dealing with that May to September space of time that is put forth in respondent's factum as if, which it is not, the entire substance of the case and a test of time permitted after repudiation that Lord Cairns used in answering such contention as could be set up thereunder, the following language, I quote from pages 424 and 425 of the report:\u2014\nIn considering this part of the case it is necessary to bear in mind the general scheme of the Act of 1862. No company can, under that Act, obtain a limit of liability for its shareholders except by registering a memorandum of association, which is the charter and limit of the powers of the company, just as the articles of association may be said to be its rules of internal government. A copy of these documents is to be forwarded to every member on his request, at a fee not exceeding Is. When registered they bind the company, and every member of it, as if each member had executed a deed with covenants to the effect of the provisions which they contain. On the other hand, the test, and the only test, which other members and the outer world can have of the membership of any particular person, is the entry of the name of that person on the register as a member.\n******\nIn this register of members, Mr. Lawrence, by the form of his application for shares, expressly authorized his name to be entered and he must have been aware that, upon this being done, he would be held out to the world as a member of the company, whatever the form or substance of its memorandum or articles. He must be taken, in my opinion, to have known, either that the memorandum of the association was prepared and accessible at the time of his application, or that it must be prepared forthwith; and that, in either case, both it and the articles must, in their very nature, be documents differing widely in form and, in all measures of detail at least, going beyond the prospectus; and, with regard to documents of this description, on the mode of framing which consistently with the prospectus so much difference of opinion might well arise, it would, in my opinion, be contrary to the first principles of justice to hold that Mr. Lawrence was at liberty to remain wholly passive, content to trust to what was stated in the prospectus, and, while he knew that an authority to register his name and hold him out as a shareholder had been given and probably acted on, keeping himself in a position to ratify all that had been done if the) company turned out prosperous, but for the first time to inquire, and, if possible, to repudiate, should a financial panic come, or the speculation turn out unsuccessful.\nThe language I have quoted exhibits, as usual for him who used it, such a comprehensive grasp of the whole subject matter in all its bearings, and clear exposition of the law applicable to the facts I have recited, that, if it fails to bring home to any one the wide distinction between that case and this, I cannot hope to do so by any language of my own, when the respective facts of each case and the leading features of the respective statutes upon which each creation rested are borne in mind.\nThe beauty of the exposition is that, without dwelling upon any needless details, the lesson is so learnt as one reads that the reader sees how to expand the application of it without adding useless words. I have examined every case cited or that I have been able to find, to see if there ever was a case resembling this in its leading features, where a court, whose authority would bind us, ever, merely because of delay between repudiation and action, refused relief to a shareholder whose shares had been fully paid up and who repudiated within a reasonable time, but have found none.\nThere are cases indicating the contrary view of the law.\nThe case of The Directors of the Central Railway Co. of Venezuela v. Kisch[24], in appeal shews that the plaintiff allowed, after knowing of the fraud, two months to elapse before he moved and six months after he might have known, if he had been diligent, and though a shareholder liable for the part unpaid on account of shares, yet on appeal the House of Lords thought little of the question of delay then set up.\nThe cases of Oakes v. Turquand[25], sweeps out of the way, as authorities concerning us and calling for consideration on this point of delay, all those cases under the English Joint Stock Companies Act where an order for winding-up has been made or petitioned for; and the reasoning upon which it proceeds removes, in like manner, also all those cases wherein the shareholder had not fully paid up his shares, for no one could tell when the statutory obligation under those Acts in favour of creditors, might, in the course of business, become operative, and hence the necessity for that promptitude so repeatedly urged as necessary for those repudiating or taking action to rescind, if they desired to escape the operation of that statutory obligation or to be just to those becoming entitled to invoke it.\nAmong many important differences there is the essential difference of far reaching importance in this connection between the English Joint Stock Companies Acts and the New Brunswick Joint Stock Companies Act, that the register ever since 1862 was in England open to all the world, but in New Brunswick it was only open, as of right, to creditors and shareholders.\nA man could not well complain of becoming a creditor on faith of any register where, until he became a creditor, he had no right to look at it.\nThere is exhibited in the drastic and comprehensive system of the English Act of 1862, and later Acts, a scope and purpose far beyond anything that appears in the limited field covered by the New Brunswick Act.\nIt is part of the scheme of the English Acts to work out the rights and liabilities of the subscriber for shares and those entitled to rely thereon, by holding the subscriber to the obligation he has undertaken unless he adopt the special and speedy method provided by the Act for getting rid thereof.\nSuch cases as Taite's Case[26], are only binding illustrations of time allowed for removal from the register by the means specified by the Act.\nThe same legislation or similar legislation creating similar conditions might give a value to such authorities which I do not conceive they have here where the conditions legislatively and in every way render the cases so different from what we have to deal with herein. There is no peculiar quality in the property in a share, once fully paid up, and no future liability on it, whereby we can differentiate the consequences of fraud inducing sale of it, and right of rescission arising therefrom, and those consequences in relation to any other property.\nThere always has been and always will be, as one property differs from another, a variation in the proper measure of time to be allowed for repudiation, and following repudiation, for application to the court to enforce it.\nThe perishable must differ from the permanent and the chances of change in ownership and development must give rise to such varying conditions and consequent varying obligations as to render it impossible to lay down any uniform rule.\nThere is no greater right in a corporate body, as such, or in one of the corporators, as such, to be protected from suffering or inconvenience arising from disappointments that the fraud of servant or agent creates than non-corporate persons have who endure the same.\nThe distinction made in some of the corporation cases arises from the greater risk run of injuring third parties.\nThe conditions that the cases of unpaid shares present under the English Acts are entirely different from the property in fully paid-up shares.\nI wish to refer to some cases illustrating my meaning and my understanding of the law in this regard when applied to company cases where the statutory provisions do not form a leading element in the questions to be solved. Take the case of Clarke v. Dickson[27], where the dealing was not between the company and the subscriber for shares, but between private persons in relation to the buying and dealing with shares, when the contract of purchase was alleged to have been induced by fraud.\nLapse of time, though great, was not the special element that disentitled to relief, but the change in conditions was the bar on which stress was laid and coupled with that was the dealing of the purchaser with the property.\nThe case of Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[28], is another illustration in a different way.\nThere the company had of its own motion removed, for non-payment of calls, the name of respondent as a shareholder. The Act provided that a shareholder, in such case, remained liable for such unpaid balances of purchase of shares subscribed for.\nThe company sued for the balances, and the defendant set up the fraud and succeeded, though he never, in fact, repudiated, except by his plea in answer to this suit. The dates are in this regard worthy of notice.\nOn the 27th of April, 1891, the shares were declared by the company to be forfeited, and, on the 5th of May, he was notified thereof. On the 27th of September, 1891, he was sued and on the 21st of December, 1891, the plea of fraud was filed.\nIt was argued there, as here, that he was too late, but, though the court found that he had been put on inquiry as far back as the previous March and, as a matter of fact, had formed a shrewd suspicion before the 6th of May, that he had been the victim of a fraud, the lapse of time was of no avail in answer to the claim for relief by reason of the fraud.\nLord Watson thought he and the company were, by the forfeiture of shares in May, remanded to the common law right of rescission. Lord Davey put the matter as follows:\u2014\nThe company thereby severed the relation between themselves and the respondent as shareholder, and the respondent became a mere debtor to the company. It is not proved by any evidence. that the respondents had lost his right to repudiate at the date of the notice; and I think that, not having done any act to affirm the contract, he was not then bound to take any step for the mere purpose of getting rid of his liability to pay this call. But I am also of opinion that, if the appellants had intended to rely upon the delay, they ought to have cross-examined the respondent for the purpose of ascertaining when he learnt the facts, and to have asked for a direct finding of the jury on the subject.\nTwo observations are called for by this case.\nTime in itself is not, when dissociated from the peculiar obligations arising from the statute, any more of a bar to repudiating for fraud a contract arising even out of a subscription for shares, than in any other contract.\nThe time here was, as I count it, no greater than there.\nAnother observation called for by that decision and remark is that in the defence herein no pleading set up the delay or laches, no contest was made at the trial over any such issue, no reason was asked for appellant's failure to move after he had repudiated the transaction.\nNo one, for the defence, seems to have thought of such a defence until at the close of the case, as a desperate resort the leave was asked to plead such defences.\nSuch evidence as, if attention had been called to it, might have been offered we are left to speculate on. But we find that the respondent swore incidentally to answering on other issues, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Did you ever get a balance sheet shewing a statement of the assets and liabilities? A.\u2014Never got a balance sheet from the day I took the stock to the present day. They never advised me of the meetings, or one thing or another; everything was done in a hole and corner; never got a statement shewing assets or liabilities or anything else.\nQ.\u2014Did you ever get a statement from them shewing their liabilities? A.\u2014Never got anything from them; ignored me altogether.\nAnd no reply is made to this evidence.\nThis is not all, however, for he wrote, as already stated, the defendant, Manchester, who was president of the company, a long letter on the 19th of March, 1904, in which the following passage occurs:\u2014\nThere is a lot of other things I would like to tell you, but this will do for the present. I asked Mr. Elkin the other day for the minutes of the meetings held since I bought the stock, and the last annual reports, but he told me he did not have them, they were at the mill. I went there for them yesterday, but I found Mr. Mclntyre was indisposed and not able to be at his post. I told Mr. Elkin I did not want to go into law about the matter if I could help it. And now you will allow me to tell you that the only thing that keeps me hack from putting it in the court is the minutes and the reports. You do not deserve to get another note from me. I sent you three, and you treated me with a great deal of disrespect by not answering either of them. I always thought you were a man disposed to do what was right. This is the last time that I will address you on the subject if it costs me every cent I am worth I will have my money. I will follow you and Mr. Elkin to the end of your tether, and make you do what is right. If the stock is as valuable as represented to be, why not take it up yourself?\nThe only answer ever vouchsafed to this letter, containing so explicit a demand for inspection and explanation, is the following:\u2014\nSt. John, N.B., April 13, 1904.\nMichael Farrell, Esq.,\nDear Sir,\u2014\nAt a meeting of the directors of the Portland Rolling Mills, Limited, held yesterday, your letter of March 19th was placed before the Board, and, on motion, \"the president was instructed to write in reply to Mr. Farrell and notify him that the condition under which he took his stock have not been changed.\"\nYours truly,\nJames Manchester,\nPresident, Portland Rolling Mills, Ltd.\nThe appellant ran a risk of pressing any further demand for leave to inspect, for to do so by virtue of his standing as a shareholder might have waived his repudiation, and his persisting further might have lent a colour to the argument that his doing so was as a member of the company.\nAm I to assume he was not waiting developments of evidence as to subscription of stock by the directors in accordance with the representations?\nOne of the accusations made as corollary to the existence of stock holdings by directors is that the directors were to have taken up the balance of the new stock pursuant to an understanding. Suppose they had done so in May or June would he have had much to complain of on that branch of his case, even if so tardy fulfilment had been effected?\nI do not think it lies in the mouth of a company that acted as this one did in its dealings with the appellant for one moment to complain of delay or laches, much less to seek the benefit of such a defence, if ever open, by such way of presenting it as this.\nIn addition to the remark of Lord Davey, I would call attention to the remarks at pages 240 and 241, in the judgment of the Privy Council in the Lindsay Petroleum Company Case[29], cited above, in regard to the necessity for pleading not only laches but the allegation of facts intended to be relied upon to support it, or shew the injury that has arisen to any one by reason of the imputed delay. The following sentence is, mutatis mutandis, applicable here.\nIn order that the remedy should be lost by laches or delay, it is, if not universally at all events ordinarily\u2014and certainly when the delay has only been such as in the present case\u2014necessary that there should be sufficient knowledge of the facts constituting the title to relief.\nThat the major part of the stock was not held by directors, the appellant may well be held as knowing from the 26th January, 1904.\nBut the important point, in that same connection, and the allegation of falsehood and fraud charged in relation thereto, as to the exact nature of the purpose or understanding as to future taking up of the balance of the same issue by the directors, as that of which the appellant has bought part, could only be effectually got at by an inspection of the minute books and stock books.\nThe same may be said as to the real financial condition in preceding years, and the allegations relative thereto.\nThe appellant, in his impetuosity to repudiate, possibly had not fully considered the necessity for thus arming himself, and I think, in face of respondent's way of treating him, he was well warranted in taking time after the 13th of April, 1904, to discover elsewhere or otherwise, the evidence before launching on a sea of litigation.\nThe case, though arising out of a sale of stock, presents few of those characteristics that differentiate the usual stock cases cited from others regarding fraud entitling to rescission, so as to render each day's delay strong evidence of that promptitude justice in some cases demands.\nThe company was a kind of close corporation with less than a dozen shareholders when it was decided to offer the new stock and so little of that was sold that I doubt if any changes in ownership of it took place between April and December, 1904, save to those well informed as to this claim as well as all else bearing on the state of the company.\nThe burthen rested on those setting up such an equity to plead it and prove it; at least prim\u00e0 facie.\nThe financial condition of the company was probably in fact quite as good when this suit was begun as on the previous 13th of April.\nNo change for the worse can be said to have operated on the appellant's mind in the way that seems to have happened in some cases.\nI cannot find anything to have intervened during the alleged delay in bringing the action that would have entitled any third party to complain of relief being given as of 22nd December, 1904, instead of the 14th of April, preceding.\nThe circumstances I have adverted to as possibly excusing more prompt action seem, when coupled with default in properly raising the objection to furnish an excuse, quite as potent as in the Aaron's Reefs Case[30] or the McNeill Case[31], to repel any objection on the score of laches when absolutely no evidence of acquiescence.\nIn the absence of authority, to hold mere delay itself, after clear express repudiation of a fully paid-up stock a bar, I can see no reason in accord with well understood principles for refusing the relief prayed for here as against the company.\nThen, is there a case made against the defendant directors? Is there one upon which we can properly reverse the learned trial judge's finding of fact?\nI do not think so. It seems to me, without being held bound to all he may have said, that he was guided in his consideration of the evidence applicable to the case as against these individual defendants, by a correct appreciation of the law by which they should be tried.\nThe quotation he adopts from Lord Chelmsford's judgment in Peek v. Gurney[32], at page 390, seems supported by the authorities so far as applicable to this case.\nThe agent, employed by these directors by virtue of the resolution entrusting to them the disposal of these shares, by his acts bound the company. That the learned judge found, and I have adopted. It does not follow as a matter of course, that directors, appointed by and on behalf of their company to select an agent, are personally responsible for all that agent does.\nNo case is made on the evidence that the agent engaged was so untrustworthy or likely to resort to improper means that defendants ought to have been on their guard.\nI attach no importance to his marking the prospectus as \"private.\" Whatever he called it, I would call it the act of the company.\nEven suppose it were so, and the issue of a prospectus was a thing likely to have happened, as within the scope of his authority, does it necessarily follow either that it assuredly would issue, or that the agent in issuing it would act dishonestly?\nThe transaction was not so large a one as to render resorting to the circulation of a printed prospectus a certainty or as almost certain to occur.\nNor could any one bold as a matter of law these directors liable for wholly unauthorized verbal representations.\nThen, does the evidence of knowledge of these directors of the issue and contents of the prospectus change their liability?\nHad it been clear that they or either had been aware, before the sale to the appellant, of the use of this prospectus, I should have been disposed to hold as guilty him knowing the use to which his authority was being put, and who, so knowing, refrained from at once withdrawing the prospectus and, if need be, the authority of one so abusing it, and to have held him liable to answer for the consequences.\nThe dates when each of these directors knew of the prospectus, (and I would not be disposed to distinguish as of course the date of knowing of it from the date of reading it), and of the sale of the stock and of the receipt by the treasurer of the company of the purchase money from appellant are all left quite uncertain.\nSome of the most important of these dates could easily have been fixed. It is not fair either to the accused or to the court in a trial of this kind to leave such things uncertain.\nThe court might suspect or speculate but could not act thereon. In this case, if the court impressed by the manner and other things that lead to distrust a witness, had inferred from some parts of the evidence a basis of fact against the defendant Elkin, and been led by such an inference, coupled with what I am about to advert to, had found against him, I do not know that I should have felt at liberty to disturb the finding.\nManchester's case seems entirely different, in regard to these matters that appear in Elkin's case.\nAs to both, however, there stands on record an apparent neglect of duty such as (if authority be needed), Lord Chancellor Hatherly asserted in Reese River Mining Co. v. Smith[33], at page 74, was imposed on directors where a repudiation was made of sale of right to shares on the ground of fraud.\nIt was the plain duty of the directors, including these specially connected with the agent accused, to have investigated such a charge of fraud, and, if the charge made proved well founded, to have agreed to rescission at once.\nElkin's own judgment upon such a case, from what he tells as having passed between him and the agent, should have been quite enough.\nHe realized the impropriety of the representations made. Why did he not succeed in cancelling such a transaction? He was, as the evidence shews, clear sighted enough to know the impropriety of resting a sale of stock on such a basis.\nAgain the appellant has failed to present the evidence of what took place at the board meeting or meetings which led up to Manchester, the president, writing the letter of the 13th of April. If the proper spirit that Elkin evinced when the prospectus was shewn him had prevailed, as it should have done, that letter never would have been written.\nBut, should I, sitting in appeal, even if I could infer either of these men were at the board meeting that adopted the defiant tone and directed this letter, couple that with other evidence and find them liable?\nI think not. I have referred to these things at length instead of contenting myself with simply adopting the conclusion of the learned trial judge, relative to the director defendants, because they shew that there was a case for investigation which rendered it proper to make these two directors parties defendant.\nThey have been given their costs below. I might not have thought they were entitled to them in the view of what I think was their duty on learning of this complaint.\nThey had a chance to shew they were overborne and have not done so. But as we do not, as a rule, interfere with the disposition of costs the court below has awarded, unless incidentally, to a reversal, the judgment of the court below in regard to these costs must stand.\nThey succeed here and are entitled to their costs of appeal. But I do not think they should be taxed costs here or in the courts below beyond what were necessarily incurred in their own personal defences. I do not find in the case any answer was made by defendant Elkin\u2014but assume he had nevertheless some costs of defence.\nThe general costs of the cause throughout, and of the appeals, must be given the appellant as against the defendant company, save as to such parts thereof as were occasioned by the making of the directors defendants to the cause and to the appeals. Appeal against the defendant company allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stockton & Price.\nSolicitor for the respondents,\nThe Portland Mills Rolling Co.: A.

The drawee refused payment for want of identification of the person who presented it. The defendant bank, without requiring identification, advanced $25 in cash to the forger on the forged cheque, placed the balance, $975, to his credit in a deposit account, indorsed it and received the full amount of $1,000 from the drawee. After receipt of this amount, the defendant paid the further sum of $800 to the forger out of the amount so placed to the credit of his deposit account. The fraud was discovered a few days later and, on its refusal to refund the money it had thus. received, the action was brought to recover it back from the defendant as indorser or as having received money paid under mistake of fact.\nHeld, that the drawee of the cheque, although obliged to know the signature of its customer, was not under a similar obligation in regard to the writing in the body of the cheque; that, as the receiving bank had dealt with the drawee as a principal and not merely as the agent for the collection of the cheque and had obtained payment thereof as indorser and holder in due course, it was liable towards the drawee which had, through the negligence of the receiving bank, been deceived in respect to the genuineness of the body of the cheque, and that the drawee was entitled to recover back the money which it had thus paid under a mistake of fact, notwithstanding that, after such payment, the position of the defendant had been changed by paying over. part of the money to the forger. The Bank of Montreal v. The King (38 Can. S.C.R. 258) distinguished, Newall V. Tomlin-son (L.R. 6 C.P. 405); Durrant v. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England and Wales (6 Q.B.D. 234); The Continental Caoutchouc and Gutta Percha Co. v. Kleinwort, Sons & Go. (20 Times L.R. 403) and Kleinwort, Sons & Co. V. The Dunlop Rubber Co. (23 Times L.R. 696) followed. Judgment appealed from (17 Man. R. 68) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment of Dubuc C.J., at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nShepley K.C. and D. H. Laird for the appellant.\nEwart K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed.\nThe amount of a forged cheque was paid by mistake by the drawee and the appellant, who received the money, although not due to it by the respondent, must refund it, unless precluded from doing so by some rules of law. I observe in The Bank of Montreal v. The King[2] at page 267:\nWhatever was the jurisprudence in the old days, it has been settled by the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" section 54 (now section 129), which limits the liability of the acceptor to the genuineness of the signature of the drawer, thus impliedly excluding his liability for the forgery of the body of the bill. That is still my opinion and I am very happy to learn from the factum of Mr. Ewart K.C. that long before the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" was passed, that was also the decision the Courts of Appeal of my province had arrived at in The Union Bank of Lower Canada v. The Ontario Bank[3], where Dorion C.J. said:\nIf a bank accepts a forged cheque of its own customer and the .forgery consist in the signature of its customer, it cannot recover the money, because it is bound to know the signature of its own customer. But that does not apply to the writing in the body of ihe instrument, because the bank is not bound to know the handwriting in which the document is written.\nI have, therefore, come to the conclusion that the respondent is entitled to recover back the amount paid. I may add that the case of The Bank of Hamilton v. The Imperial Bank of Canada[4] supports that conclusion.\nThe objection is raised by the appellant that its position had entirely changed since it received the money, by remitting it, or the greater part of it, to the holder. The respondent paid the cheque under the erroneous belief that it was genuine, and the appellant received the proceeds acting under the same mistake, and, therefore, the money must be returned. But the recipient bank is guilty of, perhaps, \u00e0 more grave mistake. The holder was a perfect stranger and it made no inquiry, no effort, in fact it did nothing to ascertain who he was. True, the paying bank could have found out all the circumstances of the forgery, but it was satisfied that the signature of the drawer was genuine and there its responsibility ended. The appellant could have ascertained everything connected with the cheque and the payee; it did not do so and it must suffer the loss caused by its imprudence or fault.\nDavies J.\u2014The Manitoba Government issued a cheque upon the Union Bank, respondent, signed by the officials authorized to draw such cheques in favour of The Consolidated Stationery Company for the sum of $6.00.\nJones, a clerk of the company, obtained possession of the cheque, misappropriated it, and fraudulently erased both the payee's name and the amount for which the cheque was drawn, and inserted instead the name of Willam Johnson and the sum of $ 1,000.\nThe forgery was very skilfully done, so much so that no ordinary care could have discovered it.\nJones, pretending to be Johnson, presented the cheque to the drawee, the Union Bank, for payment, but, being unknown and unidentified, payment was refused.\nHe then took the cheque to one of the branches of the Dominion Bank, the manager of which, without requiring identification, took the cheque, paid the forger $25 and placed the balance to his credit.\nThe Dominion Bank then indorsed the cheque and passed it through the Clearing House to the Union Bank, which paid the amount of the cheque as forged.\nBefore the crime was discovered, but after the Union Bank had honoured the cheque, the Dominion Bank paid to the forger Jones $800 of the amount standing to his credit.\nOn the return of the cheque to the drawer the forgery was discovered and the forger was at once arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced.\nUnder these circumstances the Union Bank sued to recover back the money paid by it to the Dominion Bank on the forged cheque, on the ground that it was paid by mistake, and as to the $ 800 paid out to the forger after payment of the cheque to them by the Union Bank and before discovery of the forgery the Dominion Bank contest their liability.\nIt is conceded that neither bank can be charged with negligence in not detecting the forgery by mere inspection of the cheque, but the respondent bank submitted that there was negligence on the part of the Dominion Bank in cashing such a cheque without first having had the person asserting himself as the payee identified.\nThe man turned out to be a forger and a thief, he was unknown to the manager, was not required to be identified, and was successful in obtaining some $825 which it seems to me would have been prevented had the usual banking business precautions been insisted upon.\nThe Union Bank on the other hand cannot be charged with negligence. It had declined in the first instance to pay the cheque to the alleged payee until he satisfied them of his identity, and only paid it when it came to them through the clearing house with the name of the Dominion Bank stamped across it. No negligence whatever can be imputed to the respondent bank; the names of the officials authorized to draw cheques for the Government were genuine and proper inspection would not and did not enable them to discover the forgery of the body of the cheque.\nIn the late case of The Bank of Montreal v. The King[5] we had a somewhat analogous case before us, and we there held that the Bank of Montreal, the drawee of the cheque, could not recover back the moneys paid by it to another bank for a forged cheque and which moneys the receiving bank had paid out to the forger before it had any notice or knowledge of the forgery.\nThe great and broad distinction between that case and the one now in appeal, at any rate in the opinion of the majority of the court, was that the name of the drawer of the cheque had been forged and that the payee by paying the cheque had represented to the receiving bank that the drawer's signature was genuine and was consequently disabled from recovering back the money, the signature being a forgery and the receiving bank having acted on the faith of such representation and paid away the money to the forger.\nThe ground upon which I based my judgment in that case as between the disputing banks was\nthat by paying the cheques to the persons presenting them the Bank of Montreal represented to them that the cheques had in fact the genuine signatures of the drawers and if upon the faith of that implied representation the holders of the cheques received the moneys, as I think they did, and subsequently paid them away to the person who deposited the cheques with them or otherwise had their positions altered to their prejudice respectively in consequence of such implied representations and in ignorance of the forgeries, they cannot be compelled subsequently by the drawee who paid the money, on discovering that the cheques were forgeries, to pay back the money.\nIn this case now before us the signatures to the cheque were genuine. It was only the body of the cheque which had been altered and forged. There was no representation express or implied made by the respondent bank to the appellant bank other or further than as to the genuineness of the drawer's signatures, and the ground and reasoning on which it was held the Bank of Montreal could not recover does not here apply. This case is more analogous to that of The Imperial Bank v. The Bank of Hamilton[6], the distinction between them being that in the latter case the payment of the money to the forger by the receiving bank was made before the paying bank had paid over the money to the receiving bank.\nThe question here is whether the single fact that the receiving bank did not pay over' the $800 in dispute until after the paying bank had paid the cheque to them can avail to prevent the paying bank from recovering the money back on the ground of mutual mistake.\nThat question it seems to me must be answered by determining whether the paying bank by paying the cheque made any representation as to its genuineness other than the representation of the genuineness of the drawer's signatures and whether the receiving bank was or was not a mere agent to receive and pay over the money. If it was such agent merely and the fact was or ought under the evidence to have been known to the paying bank they cannot recover the money back.\nIf on the contrary the receiving bank was not a mere agent if it had an interest in the money paid and received the moneys simply as holders of the cheque and not as agent merely for their depositor, the fact of their having paid over the money will not avail them. Newall v. Tomlinson[7]; Continental v. Kleinwort[8].\nI do not think the evidence justifies a holding that the appellant bank received the money from the paying bank as agent merely. As a matter of fact they had paid the forger $25 on account of the cheque when they first took it, and, to that extent at any rate, had an interest in it, and there is nothing to shew that the paying bank ought to have known or did know that the receiving bank were only collecting the money as agents to pay it over. The character in which the Dominion Bank presented the cheque through the Clearing House to the paying bank was as the holder of the cheque, and this I think is under the authorities a determining factor. Kleinwort v. Dunlop Rubber Co.[9].\nI have already held that there was no representation made as to the genuine character of the cheque beyond that to be implied that the drawer's signature was all right.\nFor these reasons I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs:\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal from the Court of Appeal for Manitoba raises the same questions as we had to decide between the Bank of Montreal and the third party banks in the case of Bank of Montreal v. The King[10] unless the forgery of a signature to a cheque is to be held as materially different in this regard from that of an entire fabrication of a cheque over a genuine signature which the forger has managed to get hold of and use.\nIn the decision of that case there was not that accord of reasoning in arriving at the result in which all the members of this court were agreed that would of necessity exclude the agitating anew of the bearing of this feature that distinguishes that case from this.\nWhen the matter is approached from the point of view that the banker is supposed to know the signature of his customer there is certainly a difference.\nThe party presenting for payment a cheque. on which the signature of the drawer is forged may in some cases have some better right to complain, if the drawee, to whom the drawer's signature was well known, seeks, after honouring it in the forged form and paying the cheque, to recover back the money paid, than in the case where the signature is genuine and the fabrication over it has been so well done that neither party imposed on had any more chance of detecting the fraud than the other.\nIn the absence of negligence I did not in the Bank of Montreal Case[11], and do not now feel much pressed by reason of the alleged duty of a banker to know his customer's signature as forming an important element or having much to do with settling the equities between such a banker and another when it comes to an issue of deciding the right of the banker so paying a forged cheque to recover the money he had paid in discharge of it.\nI may remark, in passing on, that, so far as I can see, in the case of The Imperial Bank of Canada v. Bank of Hamilton[12], where the cheque in question was a raised one as here over a genuine signature and originally certified to by the Bank of Hamilton, no importance seems to have been attached to the alleged duty of knowing the customer's signature as a factor in such a case. I do not find that suggested as a reason for distinguishing that case from others.\nThere the bank was excused even for not having looked at its books from which it could have detected the forgery. The case was determined if I understand it aright upon the broad principle that the money was paid by mistake and therefore prima facie recoverable; that notice of the mistake was given\nin reasonable time and no loss had been occasioned by the delay in giving it.\nIt is by an application of the principles that govern the right to recover money paid by mistake that the issue raised here must be decided.\nI proceeded on that ground in The Bank of Montreal v. The King[13], at pages 280 and 283.\nI need not repeat my reasons stated there. Discarding here, as I did there, the respective side issues raised, as of no significance there or here, I find no difference in the cases save in the length of time that elapsed between the passing of the cheque through the clearing house and the demand for re-payment.\nI cannot say that I find the difference in length of time between the mistake and demand for re-payment so essential as to enable me to distinguish the cases.\nThe essential feature of the receiving bank having parted, as in duty bound apparently, with the money to the extent it did, relying on the paying bank having acquiesced and paid, remains here, as there, the substantial answer to what else would be a most equitable demand.\nLet us go beyond in the agency cases, and get to the reason for the rule, a good method to solve legal difficulties in many cases, I submit, and reason by analogy therefrom. Doing so, I venture to think the banker's business, is of that nature that it would be just as inequitable as in the case of an agent receiving and paying to ask the return of money the banker has paid away in accordance with a duty that every circumstance that was apparent to him rendered imperative. People have every day to discharge that duty which apparent facts render a duty when all that can be reasonably required has been done to know the facts.\nThe Privy Council, in The Imperial Bank Case[14], had under consideration the view presented by the late Chief Justice Armour of Cocks v. Masterman[15], holding that it exemplified, if it did not establish a rule of law that\nthe holder of a bill is entitled to know on the day when it becomes due whether it is an honoured or dishonoured bill, and that if he receives the money and is suffered to retain it during the whole of that day, the parties who paid it cannot recover it back.\nThe court, in considering that, treats it not as if there were absolutely nothing in the law to support the decision of Cocks v. Masterman15 or as if that particular case had been wrongly decided,. but as if it were a proper thing to inquire in such a case as to. whether or not and how the defendant may have been prejudiced by reason of want of notice of dishonour. The court says in doing so that\nthe bank (meaning the Imperial Bank) was not deprived of any of its rights against him (i.e. Bauer, the drawer) nor was its position altered by reason of notice of the forgery not being given until the day after the bill was paid.\nThen, as to the particular case then in hand, the court found that the stringent rule referred to did not really apply to the case, and proceeded to shew that Bauer, who was the drawer was not entitled to notice of dishonour and said: There were no indorsers to whom notice of dishonour had to be given.\nWhat does all this mean, if it does not imply that there may be cases where the party called upon to return the money may have a right to answer by shewing that he has, by reason of lapse of time, been prevented from giving notice of dishonour to those to whom he might otherwise have been entitled to look but for want of notice is no longer so entitled?\nI think to that extent it is a recognition, not of the hard and fast rule as laid down in Cocks v. Master-man[16] as if of universal application, but of the principle that underlies that and many other decisions\u2014 that is, that, if the party receiving be prejudiced by reason of the drawee's payment and the consequent delay, a countervailing equity, as it were, might arise furnishing him a complete answer to the demand for a return of the money.\nI do not attempt to define the limits of this possible answer to a plaintiff's equity to a return of the money.\nIt is made clear by the Imperial Bank Case[17] that they are not co-incident with those of the rules as to notice of dishonour. On the other hand it being clear that, if being deprived by reason of the delay of the right to have recourse over against another is a sufficient answer, surely the loss of the right to retain the money which has awaited the drawee's answer to presentation is equally cogent as an answer to the claim.\nIt is on this ground that much of the judicial opinion rested in the Bank of Montreal Case[18] for refusing to that bank a discovery over against the other banks.\nI submit we should, so long as Cocks v. Master-man[19] has not been overruled but, in the way I have indicated, recognized and the mass of judicial opinion I refer to seemingly upheld by refusal of leave to appeal in the Bank of Montreal Case18, adopt and follow the principle that the Privy Council indicates, at least until some better indication of a departure therefrom by the court above than the refusal of leave in The Bank of Montreal Case18 indicates.\nAs to the distinction between the Bank of Montreal Case18 and this arising out of the nature of the forgery, I repeat that both in that case and this it was found that negligence could not be imputed to the drawees.\nSo long as that is the case, I fail to understand why there should be any distinction.\nI think the law of chance, so called, probably makes it of little consequence which way the matter be decided if it can only be so decided as to be permanent and recognized by all concerned as the binding rule.\nIn other cases than agency or those akin to it where the party receives money by mistake he generally has it or its substance permanently on hand. No hardship exists there on being ordered to return it.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014The question in this appeal is whether or not the appellant is entitled to retain money obtained from the respondent upon a cheque drawn upon the respondent bank bearing the genuine signature of the proper officers of the Government of the Province of Manitoba, but, in all other respects, a skilful forgery.\nThe cheque, in its genuine form, had been for six dollars and payable to a stationery company or order, and had been raised by one Jones to $1,000, and made payable to Willam Johnson, or order. The forger indorsed the name \"Willam Johnson\" thereof and presented it for payment at the respondent's bank, at which the Government had an account, professing to be Willam Johnson, the payee and indorser. Being asked for identification, and none being produced, payment was refused. The forger then went to the appellant's bank and presented the cheque there, asking for a small advance in cash and a deposit for the remainder in a savings account. Being unknown to the appellant, he was asked a few questions and he said he was the payee, Willam Johnson, that he was a private detective, and resided at No 465 Jarvis Street, Winnipeg. He also wrote his name as \"Willam Johnson\" on a card presented to him for that purpose.\nWithout further inquiry the appellant complied with the forger's request, cashed the cheque, paid him $25, part thereof, and borrowed the remainder, $975, from him at interest.\nThis occurred on the 26th of January, 1905. The cheque had originally borne the date of 13th December, 1904, but that date had been changed by the forger to 6th January, 1905. The appellant, therefore, without further inquiry, cashed a Government cheque for $1,000, twenty days old, presented by a person unknown to it pretending to be the payee, and who professed to be a private detective residing at a certain house in the city. Having thus cashed the cheque, the appellant stamped it with the name of the bank and sent it to the Clearing House for payment.\nI think that in doing all this without further inquiry the appellant acted with unusual want of care, and, unintentionally, set a trap for the respondent into which it fell. For I suppose that, almost invariably, when a cheque with a genuine signature comes for payment to the bank on which it is drawn, after passing through the Clearing House and having the stamp of another bank upon it, it is paid without further question, and that is what happened in this case. The respondent paid it on the 27th of January.\nAccording to the usual course of banking business, the forgery of this cheque would not be discovered until the beginning of the following month, when it would be returned as a paid cheque to the Government. Accordingly, the discovery was not made until the 3rd of February, when it was notified to the respondent, who promptly informed the appellant and demanded a return of the money.\nIn the meantime, on the 1st February, the forger had drawn a cheque for $800 on his savings account, which the appellant had cashed, leaving the sum of $175 still in its hands when it was notified.\nThe question is: Which of the parties ought, under the circumstances to bear the loss? And I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the appellant ought to do so.\nThe respondent exercised due care. It refused, when applied to by the forger, to pay the cheque without his being identified. If the appellant had done that no loss would have occurred. I think the equities of the case are entirely with the respondent. The appellant was not a mere agent. It had cashed the cheque and become the owner of it. It had, in effect, paid the money to the forger and borrowed it from him again at interest. When it presented the cheque for payment, it did so as owner of it and vouched for its genuineness by its stamp, as provided by rule 6 of the Clearing House respecting indorsements.\nI think the loss was due solely to the want of care of the appellant, and that there was no negligence whatever on the part of the respondent.\nIt is not unimportant either that the appellant has a clear right of action to recover this money from the forger, while the respondent, unless it recovers from the appellant, has no recourse against any one.\nThe appeal, in my judgment, should be dismissed.\nDuff J.\u2014The action for money had and received is an equitable action; \"the gist of it\" in\nLord Mansfield's phrase, Moses v. Macferlan[20], at page 1012\nis that the defendant is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity to refund the money.\nTregoning v. Attenborough[21]; Phillips v. School Board for London[22], at pages 452-3; Jacobs v. Morris[23]; In re The Bodega Co.[24]; Lodge v. National Union Investment Co.[25], at pages 311, 312. Accordingly in an action for money paid under mistake of fact, or for a purpose or consideration which has failed, the defendant may meet the plaintiff's claim by shewing that there is something in the conduct of the payer or in the transaction itself, or its legal incidents making it inequitable that the defendant should be compelled to restore what he has received. Bank of Montreal v. The King[26]; Phillips v. School Board for London[27].\nBut is the mere fact that the receiver, while ignorant of the mistake, has changed his position by paying the money over to a third person to whose orders it was subject, a sufficient answer in itself (within this principle) to the demand of the payer?\nI think the effect of the decisions is that that circumstance alone is not an answer, unless the receiver can bring himself within the rule applicable to moneys paid to an agent in his character of agent who has paid it over or accounted for it to his principal. Continental Caoutchouc & Gutta Percha Co. v. Klein-wort, Sons & Co.[28], at page 405; Kleinwort, Sons & Co. v. Dunlop Rubber Co.[29], at page 697, per Lord Atkinson; Durrani v. Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England and Wales[30]. That rule does not, I think, govern this case, for two reasons; first, the appellants dealt with the respondents in their character of holders of the cheque simpliciter and not in the character of agents of their depositor: Kleinwort, Sons & Co. v. Dunlop Rubber Co. 29, at page 697; and, secondly, the appellants were not in point of the fact intermediaries merely, but had an interest in the cheque in respect of the advance made by them to the depositor: Newall v. Tomlinson[31].\nIn this view the case seems distinguishable from Bank of Montreal v. The King[32]. There the judgments of the majority of this court shew that they proceeded upon the ground that the receiving banks, being entitled to assume that the paying bank knew the handwriting of their customer (whose pretended signatures as the drawers of the cheques in question in that action were forgeries), might reasonably rely upon the payment of the cheque by the latter bank, as evidencing the genuineness of the signatures; and that since they had acted upon that evidence, by honouring the cheques of the depositor, drawn upon the proceeds of the forged cheques, the loss thus occasioned could not equitably be cast upon them. It is plainly implied in these judgments that the principle on which they are based would have no application to the case of the payment of a forged cheque where the forgery consists in the alteration of the body of a real cheque actually signed by the drawer; because the payment of such a cheque implies no sort of representation as to its genuineness, except in respect of the signature of the drawer: per Girouard J. at page 267, with whom Maclennan J. concurred (page 283); and per Davies J. at page 278. It was on this ground that those learned judges distinguished that case from Imperial Bank of Canada v. Bank of Hamilton[33]. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Munson, Allan, Laird & Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fisher, Wilson, Battram & Hamilton.\n[1] 17 Man.

(1891) ch. 95, was in force, the husband being then solvent, and a certificate of title therefor issued in her name under the provisions of the Manitoba \"Real Property Act,\" the beneficial as well as the legal interest in the land vested in her for her separate use, and neither the land nor its proceeds can be taken in execution for debts of the husband subsequently incurred, notwithstanding the provisions of the second section of the \"Married Women's Act\" respecting property received by a married woman from her husband during coverture.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment of Mathers J., at the trial, and ordering that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff, with costs.\nThis was an interpleader issue directed to try whether or not a stock of furs seized in execution of a judgment against one John S. Douglas, as belonging to him, was the property of the respondent, plaintiff in the interpleader issue, Anna Douglas, his wife, as against the appellant, defendant in said issue, the execution creditor of her said husband. The plaintiff's husband bought a property on Jarvis street, in the City of Winnipeg, with his own money and, in February, 1893, conveyed it to her, bona fide, as a gift. This property had been brought under the \"Real Property Act,\" the transfer was made by the husband to the wife, without the intervention of a trustee, and, under the provisions of that statute, a certificate of title issued to the wife as owner. He was then solvent and did not, at that time, owe the debt for which the judgment was recovered against him. Some time afterwards and a few days previous to the coming into force of the \"Married Women's Property Act\" of 1900(1), under a power of attorney from the plaintiff, he sold and conveyed the property, receiving $ 1,300 therefor which he handed over to one Dickson who had been acting as trustee for moneys belonging to her. The husband had, in the meantime, become insolvent and, about seven months before the coming into force of the \"Married Women's Property Act\" of 1900, the plaintiff had commenced doing business as a manufacturer and dealer in furs in a small way and, as she had funds to spare from time to time, she placed moneys which she received from the business in Dickson's hands. Dickson acted as her trustee, receiving and paying out these moneys at her request, generally for living expenses, up to the time of the sale of the Jarvis street property. The proceeds of this sale were put into the business which, thereafter, continued to increase until the stock in trade became considerable. This business had from the beginning been carried on in the name of \"Douglas & Company\" and a certificate had been registered, as\n*63 & 64 Vict. ch. 27 (Man.) required by the provincial statute, shewing that the plaintiff was the sole owner of the business. The premises in which the business was carried on had been rented for her by her husband, who also attended to buying, selling, banking and other matters in connection with the business and received wages from her for his services.\nThe appellant, defendant in the interpleader issue, recovered a judgment against the husband, in 1906 (1), in respect of an old liability, execution thereon was issued, and the stock in trade in question (appraised at $5,945.35) was seized by the sheriff, as property belonging to the husband. On the wife making claim to the goods, the interpleader issue was ordered and tried by Mr. Justice Mathers who entered judgment for the defendant, appellant. His judgment[2] was reversed by the judgment from which the present appeal is asserted.\nT. Mayne Daly K.C. and J. Travers Lewis K.C. for the appellant.\nPitblado for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Idington.\nDavies J.\u2014At the conclusion of the argument at bar I felt that the crucial point of the case was the effect of the deed from the husband, Douglas, to his wife of the Jarvis street property, and the ownership of the $ 1,300 consideration paid for the property when sold.\nThis $1,300 went into the business and constituted practically the capital on which it was founded. Previously to it being paid in, the business was of a very limited character and there is no doubt that the $ 1,300 was the basis on which it was subsequently built up.\nAs the business was registered in the name of the plaintiff (respondent), and the evidence shewed that the credit for all goods supplied was given to her alone, and not to her husband, it seemed tolerably clear that if the capital which formed the basis of the business was hers also no reasonable doubt could exist as to the result of this action.\nA careful study of the Manitoba statutes has convinced me that the construction put upon these statutes by the Court of Appeal was the correct one, and that the effect of the husband's deed to the wife given, as held by the trial judge, bona fide and not in fraud of creditors was, under all the statutes read together, to vest in her an absolute title.\nThe appellant relied upon the effect of the proviso to section 2 of the \"Married Women's Act\" R.S.M. (1891) ch. 95, which section authorized married women to have, hold and enjoy real and personal property however acquired free from the debts or control of their husbands. The proviso declared that the section should not extend to any\nproperty received by a married woman from her husband during coverture.\nBut this section did not stand alone. Sections 21 and 23 of the same Act provided as follows:\u2014\n21. A man may make a valid conveyance or transfer of his land to his wife, and a woman may make a valid conveyance or transfer of her land to her husband without, in either case, the intervention of a trustee.\n22. It is hereby declared that the last preceding section was intended to extend, and the provisions of said section shall be held to have extended, from and after the first day of July in the year one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, and shall hereafter extend to all land in the Province of Manitoba and to every estate and interest therein.\nThe effect of section 21 was to do away with the necessity of a trustee, and a transfer under section 21 would seem to confer upon the transferee all the title, both legal and equitable of the husband, and free from any right or claim on his part.\nBut apart from that the evidence shews that on the 9th day of May, 1900, when the Jarvis street property was sold by Anna Douglas, the title then stood in her name a certificate of title having issued to her under the provisions of \"The Real Property Act\" pursuant to the transfer of February, 1893, from her husband to her.\nThe provisions of \"The Real Property Act\" in regard to the effect of a transfer and of a certificate of title in force at the date of the transfer from Douglas to his wife, in 1893, and on 9th May, 1900, when the Jarvis street property was sold by her, were statutes of Manitoba, R.S.M. 1891, ch. 133, sec. 70, and statutes of Manitoba, 1892, ch. 38, sec. 4, amending section 57 of R.S.M. (1891) ch. 133.\nThe Jarvis street land was brought under the \"Real Property Act,\" popularly called the \"Torrens Act,\" before Mrs. Douglas sold it and a certificate of title was taken out in her name. The sections I have above referred to seem to me to determine the point in controversy as to the effect of the certificate of title. The 57th section declares that such certificate of title shall be\nconclusive evidence at law and in equity as against Her Majesty * * * and all persons whomsoever that the person named in such certificate is entitled to the land included in such certificate for the estate or interest therein specified, subject however to any of the exceptions or reservations mentioned\nin sections 56 or 58 of this Act.\nThese exceptions or reservations do not arise in this case. The husband, therefore, having a right to convey to his wife without the intervention of a trustee; the transfer having been made bon\u00e0 fide, without fraud, and a certificate of title having issued under the \"Real Property Act\" in the name of the wife, the title was hers absolutely and the husband had no further interest therein.\nThe money, therefore, that was derived from this land and went into the business was the wife's, and was the basis upon which the business was subsequently built up.\nAs I have already stated, in my opinion these conclusions dispose of the whole case and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal by an execution creditor between whom and the wife of his debtor an interpleader issue was tried by Mr. Justice Mathers who decided the issue in favour of the creditor, and upon appeal the Court of Appeal for Manitoba reversed such judgment.\nThe respondent shewed that her husband having failed, in 1895, or thereabout, she took up, in his absence, the business of an insurance agent. Later, using some small surplus of her earnings as agent, she entered upon a small fur business at which she worked and which she employed her husband to manage.\nAfter being thus engaged some seven years she had acquired the goods now seized under the execution against her husband. The people who had supplied these goods sold them to her and intended the title thereto to vest in her.\nPrim\u00e0 facie she is thus entitled to succeed.\nIt is said, however, that the money with which this business was founded and carried on was in law that of the husband.\nThe learned trial judge in arriving at this conclusion does not find and report that the whole course of dealing was a sham. He holds that the property from which the chief part of the money was derived that went into the business was that of the husband and that, therefore, the business and goods found therein must be those of the husband.\nI agree that the Jarvis street property was the property of the husband in 1892, notwithstanding an improbable story as to the purchase money having come from the wife.\nShe, in the month of February, 1893, in consideration of natural love and affection, received from her husband a conveyance of this property by virtue of the provisions of the \"Real Property Act.\" The learned trial judge finds expressly this was not made in anticipation of failure but in good faith, and when the husband, after giving the property, was in solvent circumstances. It necessarily follows that he could have given it to her by any proper form of conveyance that would have made it enure to her separate estate free from the attack of his subsequent creditors. The proceeds of rents and sale of that property found their way into the fur business in question by virtue of a power of attorney from her to the husband. Hence, the learned trial judge holds the business that of the husband because he was entitled by virtue of his marital rights to the rents and to an interest in the estate for life and that would render the substantial part of the proceeds of the sale the property of the husband and not that of the wife.\nThere was no marriage settlement, but these moneys were, so far as possibly could be done by the simple device of an oral trusteeship, kept separate from those of the husband.\nOne Dickson, who undertook the duties of such trustee, received, kept and paid out all these moneys solely to the wife or for her purposes, including those of this business.\nIt happened that the proceeds of the sale of the Jarvis street property, with which we are here concerned, passed directly from the vendee to this trustee. Now the ground taken as to these moneys is that in law they were, for most part, the property of the husband.\nIt is quite clear to my mind that the effect of a conveyance made as this was under the \"Real Property Act\" is to vest in the grantee the absolute property of him or her conveying free from all the rights of any one else than the grantee unless otherwise expressed.\nSuch is the policy of the legislation under the \"Torrens Title System.\"\nIt would seem to be a monstrous absurdity in carrying out such a method of conveyancing to assume that there was by implication engrafted on to its express and positive enactments, declaring the result of the certificate of the registrar to be that of vesting the property in the party obtaining the registrar's certificate, some reservation of the husband's rights when the Act specifies the only exceptions and the supposed rights of the husband are not amongst the number. It seems to me there is not the slightest foundation for any such contention.\nThe legal consequences are that the wife had this property free from the husband's control and thus was absolutely entitled to it.\nA post-nuptial marriage settlement on such findings of solvency and bon\u00e0 fide intention would have been valid, and what has been done was the legal equivalent.\nThere seems nothing else in the case; for the profits would follow these principal moneys put in, once we find a separate business was in fact carried on.\nThere could be no doubt of the intention to carry on a separate business and reap the fruits thereof as she was entitled to do under the \"Married Women's Property Act.\" She had herself registered as carrying on the business under the name \"Douglas & Co.\" from her first starting it.\nMoreover, it is not the property conveyed that was attacked. It would require a case not made out here and legislation I do not find invoked by virtue of this issue to reach the proceeds.\nBut I think it would have puzzled a creditor very much to have reached, by any known mode of execution, the supposed marital rights Douglas had in the Jarvis street property after he had, under and by virtue of the \"Real Property Act,\" so managed, in 1893, that the lands were certified under that Act to be the property of the claimant.\nIf there remained, thereafter, anything exigible at suit of the creditors of Douglas, who has taken it away?\nIt is only what she got she has conveyed away. When he used her power of attorney to convey away her rights he surely was not asserting his power as her lord to convey his and her rights.\nHe was not the ancient lord and master of his spouse asserting rights for which he had done homage to have had recognized but her poor clerk or servant obeying her vulgar common power of attorney mandates. Such seems the evidence. We have no documents in evidence and assume from the oral evidence that he was not a party conveying.\nThe tempting inquiries, of how far, if ever, husband and wife were, except when specially given an estate that required such holding, only one person as regards her real estate; of the nature of his rights in regard to her rents, until he became tenant consummate of the courtesy; of whether, till then, they were his or hers or only his because no court had ever dared make him account for them or woman dared pray the court so to do; of the foundation on which rested his right of conveyance of a freehold that overshadowed her power over her own, in order that a true interpretation might be had of the effect of the words in the 20th section of the \"Devolution of Estates Act\"[3] abolishing the right of tenancy by the courtesy; and what, if anything, remained to the modern lord and master when this was taken away; must be laid aside for the present.\nI will not, in view of the desolating effects of the radical \"Torrens System,\" as I understand it in this case, even try to determine the limits of duty to creditors a husband of a woman owning property at common law may owe to such creditors to despoil her of her rights for their sake. In some cases the facts shew he owes much, but in this case it seems morally only a question of who should reap the unearned increment but for which there had been almost nothing here to contend about.\nSince the argument I have found that the question of invasion, by the adoption of the \"Torrens Title System\" of a husband's rights at common law in his wife's estate has been discussed in the Australian courts, where this system prevails. Two cases, In re Wildash and Hutchison; Ex parte Miskin[4] in 1877, and Grimish v. Scott[5], indicate conclusions different from what I here reach and are worth noticing by the curious student, but the Australian Act of that time and the Manitoba Act, in the nineties, are in many respects widely different, and not least in the effect to be given the certificate, saving certain expressed objections. Besides the development of the law in each country of the powers of married women to convey or hold real estate did not, I gather, keep step so to speak so as to make comparison of view of much value for our present purpose. The case of Le Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke v. McGrade[6], is also, as well as the above two cases, worth looking at when occasion arises for considering what, if any, effect is to be given to the common law notwithstanding the effect of change in mode of conveyance. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I have had no doubt at any time that there is no ground for this appeal. It is clear that the business carried on by the respondent was bon\u00e0 fide carried on by her as her own, separate and apart from her husband, and under a registered name, and it is equally clear that the land, from the sale of which the principal part of the capital of the business was derived, was conveyed to the respondent by her husband at a time when it was competent to him to do so, and that it became and was in law, having regard to the provincial statutes, her separate property.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by my brother Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Daly, Crichton & McClure.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McKerchar & Forrester.\n[1] 16 Man.

In an action for damages against his employers the jury found that the bursting was caused by strain on the valve, that the employers were guilty of negligence in allowing the engine to run on an improper bed and that they did not supply proper appliances and keep them in proper condition for the work to be done by T., the engine-bed and room all being in bad condition; they also found that the valve was not defective.\nHeld, that in the absence of a finding that the negligence imputed to the employers was the proximate cause of the injury to T., and of evidence to justify such a finding, the action must fail.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial and dismissing the action.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nRobert McKay, for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. and Greer, for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal. DAVIES J.\u2014I agree that this appeal must be dismissed with costs. The proximate cause of the unfortunate injury which happened to the plaintiff was the blowing out of a piece of what was called a valve of the engine. The jury found the valve was not defective. They also found the defendants guilty of negligence in \u201callowing the engine to run on an improper bed\u201d and also that defendants did not supply proper appliances and maintain these in a proper condition for the work to be done by plaintiff. They further found that the engine was in bad condition, likewise its \u201cbed\u201d and the \u201croom.\u201d There is no finding connecting the blowing out of the side of the valve with these neglects or failures of the defendants, nor does it appear to me there was any evidence which would justify such a finding. It is trite law that negligences or shortcomings of the defendants in any action of negligence, however numerous, will not make them liable for injuries plaintiff may have sustained unless there is a direct connection found by the jury, with evidence to sustain it, between the injury sustained and the negligence found. The facts that the \u201croom\u201d where the engine worked was in bad condition and that the bed of the engine was also defective and that the engine itself was in bad condition, all combined together, go for nothing unless these negligent acts were or some one of them was the proximate cause of the accident which caused the injuries complained of. No such necessary finding exists here, nor is there any sufficient evidence to sustain one. The onus lay upon the plaintiff. He has not discharged it.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff. MACLENNAN J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nDUFF J.\u2014Assuming that in this case there was evidence of negligence for which in an action by the appellant the respondents could be held responsible, that is to say that from the condition of the engine and its bed it might reasonably have been anticipated that the respondents\u2019 employees would be exposed to unnecessary danger, and that for injuries attributable to these things the respondents would be answerable in law to the appellant, still I think the appeal and the action must fail. Putting aside the defences set up I am quite unable to find in the appellant\u2019s case itself anything upon which, acting judicially, any tribunal could properly base an inference that the accident in which he received his injuries was the result of any defect in the plant or machinery mentioned.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, McKay, Dods & Grant.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smith, Rae & Greer.\n"}

Shortly after it was discovered that a trespasser had cut timber on said land and sold it to G. who bought in good faith and sold to another bon\u00e2 fide purchaser. In an action by F.\u2019s wife against the two purchasers the money was paid into court and an interpleader issue granted to decide which of the claimants, the plaintiff or G., was entitled to have it.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (16 Ont. L.R. 123) which reversed the decision of the Divisional Court (14 Ont. L.R. 160) that the plaintiff was entitled to the whole sum. Duff J. expressed no opinion on the question.\nHeld, also, Idington J. dubitante and Duff J. dissenting, that if necessary the writ and interpleader order could be amended by adding F. as a co-plaintiff with his wife.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] by which the damages awarded to the plaintiff at the trial were reduced.\nMr. Justice Osler in giving reasons for the judgment in the Court of Appeal stated the facts as follows: \u201cThis was an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of a Divisional Court varying the judgment of Magee J. at the trial and holding that the plaintiff was entitled to $600 only instead of to the whole of the moneys which had been paid into court under the interpleader order.\n\u201cThe question arose upon an interpleader issue and the facts are not complicated.\n\u201cThe plaintiff was the owner in fee of a lot in the township of McTavish, in the District of Thunder Bay, and she was also equitably entitled on the grounds mentioned in the judgments below, from which I see no reason to differ, to a quantity of spruce and tamarac piles which had been wrongfully cut thereon by persons named Dunn and Evoy, for the purpose of carrying out an agreement theretofore made by them with the defendants. The piles were delivered to the defendants on the lake shore at Black Bay, at a point not far from where they had been cut, and were afterwards rafted by them for the defendants, who towed them to Port Arthur, where they sold them to the Barnett-McQueen Co., Limited, for $3,781.11, which was not disputed to be about their value there. The standing trees from which they were cut were found by the learned trial judge to be of the value of $600, or thereabouts in situ. He also found that the defendants were ignorant of the plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the piles or where they had been cut, and had dealt with Dunn and Evoy as the owners. Before the purchase money had been actually paid over to the defendants the plaintiff discovered the theft of her property and traced it to Port Arthur, and found it in the possession of the Barnett-McQueen Co., from whom she demanded possession or payment of its full value there, warning the holders against paying over the purchase money to the defendant. Attempts to settle the differences between the parties having failed the plaintiff brought an action against the Greers and the Barnett-McQueen Co., claiming damages for cutting and taking her property or a declaration that she was entitled to the proceeds of the sale. Thereupon the Barnett-McQueen Co. applied for and obtained an interpleader order by which it was directed that the plaintiff and the defendants should proceed to the trial of an issue in the High Court, and that the question to be tried should be whether at the time of the issue of the summons in the action the plaintiff was entitled to the proceeds of the piles in question. The Barnett-McQueen Co. were ordered to pay into court to the credit of the interpleader issue the alleged proceeds of the sale, being $3,781.11, less their costs, and the action against them was thereupon to be discontinued.\n\u201cThe issue was framed in the terms of the order, and upon the trial the learned judge held that the piles in question had been cut and removed from the plaintiff\u2019s lot; that they were her property in the hands of the defendants and of the Barnett-McQueen Co., and that the money paid into court was the proceeds of the sale thereof by the former to the latter. He further held that the plaintiff was entitled to the whole of such proceeds under the terms of the issue and not merely to so much thereof as represented the value of the piles at the place where they were cut, or standing in the trees, before they were cut and manufactured into piles and transported to Port Arthur. The contrary view was taken by the Divisional Court, and the plaintiff\u2019s recovery was restricted accordingly to $600.\u201d The action was brought in the name of Mrs. Faulkner as owner of the fee. As the trespass was committed before the land was conveyed to her, however, a question arose as to her right to recover and Mr. Justice Meredith in the Court of Appeal thought that an amendment could be allowed joining her husband as co-plaintiff but no such order was made by the court.\nW.H. Blake K.C. and Anglin K.C. for the appellants. That an innocent purchaser is in the same position as a wrongdoer is true as respects the property itself but not as to the proceeds. See Hollins v. Fowler[3].\nThe plaintiff having elected to waive the tort and claim the proceeds the seller can only be regarded as her agent. See Hovil v. Pack[4]; Bristow v. Whitmore[5]. Evans on Principal and Agents (2 ed.), pp. 76, 82; and whatever may be her remedies she had no right of action against this specific purchase money. White v. Spettigue[6]; Brewer v. Sparrow[7]; Railway Company v. Hutchins[8].\nThe plaintiff has no title, legal or equitable, to the timber cut before she received the deed of the land. See Attwood v. Small[9]; Bell v. Macklin[10].\nShepley K.C. and C.A. Moss for the respondent. The appellant has no higher title to the timber or its proceeds than the original wrongdoer would have had. See Bavins Junior & Sims v. London & Southwestern Bank[11]. GIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion for the reasons contained in the judgments of Davies and Maclennan JJ. that this appeal should be dismissed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree in substance with the judgment of Meredith J. in the Court of Appeal. I think in order to maintain the action the amendment asked at the trial and during the several stages of the successive appeals and now repeated in this court to add the name of the husband of Mrs. Faulkner as a plaintiff is necessary. I think further it should be granted. It does not in my opinion change, modify or alter the substantial question directed to be tried by the interpleader order. It is an amendment necessary to be made in order to determine the issue stated in that interpleader order but does not prejudice any one. As to the wife\u2019s title under the deed, to the trees cut before its execution, it seems fairly clear that the intention of the parties was to convey the land with the trees upon it. Neither grantor nor grantee, at the time of the execution of the deed, had the slightest idea that a wrongdoer had spoiled the land of the trees. The husband\u2019s subsequent action, in endeavouring to secure the proceeds of the sale of the trees for his wife and his acting in that regard as his wife\u2019s agent, is strong evidence of the common intention of the parties to transfer the trees with the land to the wife. Counsel in asking for the amendment claims to represent the husband and I cannot see any good ground why an amendment necessary to try the real issue involved in the interpleader order should not be made.\nThen, as to the question of damages, I agree we cannot go behind the interpleader order or enter into the question whether it was rightly made or not. The order was not appealed from. The money being the purchase price of the ties in dispute, sold by the defendant to the Barnett-McQueen Co., is in court brought in by that company when they, as a then defendant in this suit brought by Mrs. Faulkner against them and Greer & Co., the appellants, obtained the interpleader order and so discharged themselves. We cannot go behind the issue. The granting of the interpleader order was not appealed from. We have simply to decide on that issue as formulated in the order. It reads as follows:\nThe plaintiff affirms and the defendants deny that on the 29th day of September, 1905, the plaintiff was entitled to the sum of $3,788.11 now in court herein (having been paid into court to abide the result of this issue, by the Barnett-McQueen Company, Limited, pursuant to the order hereinafter referred to) being the proceeds of 1,230 spruce and tamarac piles claimed by the plaintiff to have been cut from lot number one in Donnelly\u2019s survey on the west shore of Black Bay, in the Township of McTavish, in the District of Thunder Bay, as against the defendants, who delivered the piles, so claimed to have been cut from the said lot one; to the Barnett-McQueen Company, Limited, prior to the 29th day of September, 1905, which proceeds were alleged by the plaintiff to amount to $3,788.11.\nThe question is what is to be done with that money. The plaintiff had the right to waive the tort of the conversion of her property by the appellants and to sue for money had and received. Had the money been paid to Greer & Co. by the purchaser that doubtless would have been the form the action would have taken. Under the issue as formulated the right to the money substituted for the ties is the substantial question to be tried. Is the plaintiff, as owner of the trees from which the ties were made, entitled to the moneys paid into court by the purchaser of the ties as against the appellants who wrongfully sold them to the purchaser? I think the letters and correspondence shew clearly that the plaintiff did elect to waive the tort and affirm the sale; and that being so, is entitled under the authorities to recover the full amount of the purchase money without deducting the expenses of transport paid by the defendants who converted their property. There may be some hardship in adopting this rule in some cases but the hardship to the owner of only allowing him the actual value of the property when first stolen and at the place where stolen might be very much greater.\nHollins v. Fowler[12]; Smith v. Baker[13], and the cases collected in Mayne on Damages (3 ed.), p. 343.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants and a company to whom they had sold piles, stolen by those under whom appellants claim, having been sued by respondents for damages, an issue in the nature of interpleader was directed to try whether the appellants or respondent was entitled to the sum the company owed, or but for respondent\u2019s intervention would have owed, as the price of the piles and which is described as \u201cthe proceeds\u201d of the piles.\nHaving regard to the nature of the action, which might have shewn at the next step an action of trover, in which the interpleader order was made, the object of the parties moving for it, the evident purpose of the court in making it, and the further facts that though, as we are told, the appellants protested against its making yet refrained from appealing and fought out the issue, we are precluded from giving effect to nice distinctions about the legal meaning of the word \u201cproceeds\u201d or a technical application thereof.\nThe broad issue presented by the proceedings in this case, and fought out, was the right to the timber, and, as a result thereof, to the money in court substituted therefor by the directions of the court; and no appeal having been taken we may assume the concurrence of or submission of all parties thereto.\nThe timber from which these piles were made having been stolen from land which (let us assume at present) was vested at the time of the theft in respondent\u2019s husband could he have been prevented from recovering in trover the full value of the piles from the appellants or the company to whom they sold or were selling them? No case was cited to us, though urgently asked for, shewing law or semblance thereof that would have entitled the defendant in such a case to have the value of the piles at the time of the conversion by the party sued therefor reduced to that which the timber was worth when standing on the ground.\nIn some cases of trover such as the Chinery v. Viall[14] case, arising out of contract, courts have seen their way to reduce the damages below the value of the goods involved at the time of their conversion, but I have not been able to find anything that would help in that way the wilful or negligent tortfeasor much less the bare thief.\nI treat the case as one where clearly the title to the piles rested ultimately in theft though I do not wish to imply that the appellants or even all those they claimed through are to be set down as thieves.\nUnfortunately the appellants have no higher legal right of property than the thieves under whom in tracing title they have to claim.\nThe coal cases relied on are nearly all cases of trespass to land in which the court has been enabled in dealing with trespassers to weigh, or permit a jury to weigh, the circumstances for there the rule of law being to find the damages done the estate of the plaintiff enabled the distinction if we might call it so.\nIn truth such a trespass is entirely another case.\nIn the case of Wood v. Morewood[15], though a reversioner\u2019s suit, a count in trover presented for consideration from that point of view the results of the wrong done. But in that, or in any like case I have seen with like results, where good faith was assumed the only question was the value of the goods at the time of the conversion thereof, that is when severed from the realty.\nIn Lamb v. Kincaid[16], we could not find absolute good faith and a harsher rule was adopted by this court.\nThe piles in question remained the property of the owner of the land when the appellants first asserted dominion over them which was long after the added value (of which we now hear so much) had been given thereto by the labour of those engaged in the theft, except as to the item of transportation which I will refer to presently.\nAn action of replevin or trover might have been brought against appellants then but not before.\nWhat right could they have set up to be recouped the money paid, through their mistake or negligence, to the thieves or at all events those representing them? This money in court was put there as the price or value the owner of the piles was entitled to. It never could have been supposed otherwise else another form of issue would have been presented.\nThe form of the issue directed in such a suit and under such circumstances precludes the splitting up process tried in the Divisional Court.\nBut for that I would have been disposed to have allowed the cost of transportation out of the fund.\nIf the appellants had been alone sued in trover it does not appear to me that any other damages than the value of the piles lying on the ice when they first asserted dominion over them could have been given.\nThe action against the company makes the same rule applied to them the test of value when they first asserted dominion and thus the matter has become so complicated that I do not see how, unless we throw all form and law on which it rests to the wind, to do the kind of justice we are asked for here.\nThe law bearing on the rights of those who have bought stolen property of little value, and increased, and even multiplied, its original value by many improvements and changes of situation I fear must remain as it was for the present.\nThis leaves nothing for us to consider but whether or not the title shewn by the respondent, who was made the plaintiff in the issue, is such as to uphold the judgment in her favour.\nNotwithstanding the opinion entertained by so many, whose judgment is entitled to the greatest respect, I cannot help doubting the sufficiency of the evidence upon which this alleged equitable title rests.\nThe husband owned the land during all the happenings complained of but on the 2nd June, 1905, conveyed to his wife for one hundred dollars and assum- ing she was, as possibly she was, as the result of their bargain or otherwise, the party entitled in equity to the timber when cut and remained so, he instructed, when he discovered what had been done, proceedings in her name. We are not given, as we might have been but for the loose methods prevailing in the proceedings, the title asserted by the claimant on affidavit before the learned judge who made the order. She should have been required before the interpleader order to shew what title she did claim and to adhere to it throughout, unless upon some proper application in chambers that could have been opened up on proper terms.\nWhat happened at the trial in the way of proof of respondent\u2019s title is simply the following:\nMr. Keefer.\u2014Then I will put in, as exhibit 2, the abstract of title, shewing the property in Lot No. 1 west of Black Bay, in the Township of McTavish, in the District of Thunder Bay, to be equitably in Mrs. Faulkner.\nHis Lordship. Is the abstract admitted?\nMr. Keefer. I think it is, my Lord. I have the registrar here if necessary. Practically it is admitted.\nMr. Blake. As the abstract shews that, yes.\nAn abstract of title of the lot in question forms part of the case from which abstract it appears the husband bought this lot at a tax sale in March, 1903, and on the 2nd June, 1905, conveyed to his wife the respondent for $100.00.\nIs that evidence of any title whatever in these piles though made from timber on that lot in April or May preceding the deed? The husband\u2019s energetic maintenance of the title of his wife may preclude him from hereafter complaining. But how does that warrant any inference of law that a bargain preceded the deed and leading up to it or collateral to it on which to rest any right equitable or otherwise? I concede to the fullest extent that by reason of the bargain between the vendor and vendee there may have been created a right in equity to property that the deed of grant, though supposed to execute the bargain, yet failed by reason of mutual mistake to convey. Put a simpler case than this, a bargain for sale of lots A. & B. and by mistake B. is omitted from the deed, no one would deny the right of the vendee to have that rectified and pending rectification to assert as against third parties every right he ought to have had conveyed. Another case may be supposed of the vendor and vendee actually negotiating on the basis of the value of the timber yet keeping to the language of the form of a bargain for fee simple of the land which consisted of little but rocks when the chief subject matter of their mutual consideration and bargaining was the timber. Suppose that timber swept away by fire pending negotiations and then unaware of such fact the transaction is closed; I fancy it would puzzle any one to find a remedy for the unfortunate vendee. But suppose, instead of being swept by fire, pending the negotiations, thieves cut and carried it away, unknown to the parties, surely any court of equity could reach it in the hands of the thieves or any one claiming under them.\nI cannot see how in law those owning and claiming such timber could ever be even partially answered by such persons as claimed under thieves, by setting up improvements made by themselves or their predecessors in title, who must ultimately rest such right as had on bare theft.\nNow in what different state can the vendee be whose title is only an equitable one from that of one in whom the legal estate vested? The equitable owner asserts an equity it is true and appeals to a court of equity which has always acted upon the maxim that he coming into equity must do equity. But for what purpose has he come into court? Not that the thief should give him a title. He had none to give. But to have the vendor convey that which by mutual mistake he had failed to pass.\nHe seeks to be clothed first with that title he has become entitled to by rights preceding the theft and, once clothed with that, to assert his legal title in the same court in the same action, it may be, as against the thief or the thief\u2019s successors.\nAnother rule of equity intervenes, as it were, quite as efficacious as the former, and that is that the court assumes that to have been done which ought to have been done and adjudges the right between the parties on that basis.\nThere is no room for the operation in such a case of the maxim that he seeking equity must do it.\nThis suggestion that he coming into equity must do equity seemed to me the strongest position the appellants might have been entitled to hold, yet, on reflection and analysis of the matter, as I have just set forth, I find it without a shadow of foundation.\nI present the position, which in law I would find the parties in, if all the embarrassments this issue and the making of it have created were swept away and the action had been tried out as originally launched in such a way (including if need be the adding of the husband as a party defendant therein) as to give amplest scope for the parties to assert their equitable rights as well as legal.\nI fear it comes back to an assertion of the strong though rough meaning of the common law; and after all I doubt if in the interest of society it better not remain so. I am not aware of any case save where founded on trespass to the land any modification, if it be a modification, has crept in as in the coal mining cases.\nI would, if parties desire to be satisfied that the timber was intended to pass from husband to wife by virtue of the bargain or whatever right she had antecedent to the cutting, prefer giving a new trial to amending an issue such as this where I do not find we have power to do so any more than the court below which I do not think had such power.\nIt seems to have been assumed at one time, and as far as I can see by mutual mistake for which I cannot blame any one, that counsel\u2019s admission went further than he can strictly be held to.\nI find since writing the foregoing that the majority of the court think we can amend by adding the husband and though somewhat doubtful of that and hesitating at the doing so I am, for reasons set forth above, in accord with the majority on the substantial merits of the case.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nIt was contended that the action must fail inasmuch as the wood had been cut and removed from the land before the conveyance made by the respondent\u2019s husband to her.\nI think that objection would probably have been fatal if we had no power to amend by adding the husband as a party. To this there can be no substantial objection, inasmuch as the husband has been his wife\u2019s active agent in the litigation throughout.\nBut it is said we have no power to amend an interpleader order.\nI do not see why, if we have power to amend the pleadings in an ordinary action, we may not amend an interpleader order. The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues which are to be tried, and an interpleader order does no more. Its function is the same.\nThen sections 54, 55 & 56 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d give this court the amplest power of amendment\nfor the purpose of determining the appeal, or the real question or controversy between the parties, as disclosed by the pleadings, evidence or proceedings.\nThe respondent\u2019s husband has throughout treated the timber, now represented by the money in court, as the property of his wife, while it turns out that the legal title is in himself, and I think it plain that the proposed amendment can work no legal injury to anyone, and, on the other hand, that unless it be made a failure of justice would be the result.\nDUFF J.\u2014With diffidence I cannot agree that this court has power to substitute Greer for his wife as plaintiff in the issue out of which the appeal arises, and consequently, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the merits, assuming the amendment made, I express no opinion.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Wm.

I agree so entirely with the reasoning of the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario that no useful purpose can be served by repeating it here.\nI, however, desire to call attention to the following evidence of defendant McLeod explaining why the agreement of 24th April, 1905, was entered into.\nQ. Do you remember giving an agreement to Browning? A. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember why you gave that? A. Yes.\nQ. Why? A. Some time previous to this Mr. Timmons had called me to his office at the Larose Mine and told me a certain amount of the circumstances.\nQ. And as a result of that? A. As a result of that we were willing to give an agreement.\nQ. That was an agreement to protect these men against loss in regard to the moneys they had advanced. A. Yes, he asked me if we would accept Hanson\u2019s position and pay them back the money they had advanced for the removal of the caution. If we would they would release. And I said no, the only thing we could possibly do then was to sell the property to them, and I agreed to do so.\nQ. Hanson wanted to protect Browning, and there is no dispute about that; that Browning wanted to be protected? A. Yes.\nQ. And you would not give an agreement of that kind to Browning, except what? A. Except we had a release.\nQ. And you got the release? A. Yes.\nQ. Subsequently the property was sold to Ferguson; do you know how that was? A. Yes.\nQ. Tell us how that came about? A. Mr. Browning and Mr. Ferguson or both made representations to us that Mr. Ferguson was putting up the money or instrumental in putting up the money and he would be the party that would be represented, and an agreement was drawn at my office. We agreed to sell.\nQ. Had the sale to Ferguson anything whatever to do with any commission or any arrangement with regard to Hanson? A. No, none whatever.\nThere is in the case such a repetition by witnesses and others of the view that the later transaction was \u201can independent sale\u201d that, until I found this explicit statement of the reason for \u201cthe independent sale,\u201d I was somewhat embarrassed. This witness also calls it so.\nThe \u201cindependent sale\u201d was merely a method of carrying out exactly what the assignees of Hanson\u2019s bargain or some of them desired and were entitled to.\nIt was his bargain that was carried out. I prefer looking for the substance of things to adopting the mere form.\nEvery one got as the result all they ever had any right to expect except the plaintiffs whom the defendants seek to deprive of their commission.\nTo treat such an \u201cindependent sale\u201d as a legal reason for depriving brokers of commission would, I fear, if adopted, lead to an undue development of human ingenuity.\nAs to the claim made before us for commission on the $20,000 of reduction made from the price fixed in the original agreement I do not see any ground to allow it. It is somewhat difficult to say exactly what the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s retainer were. I do not think the commission was payable immediately upon the execution of the agreement with Hanson. Something more effective was needed as I read the understanding such as we are left to infer it was.\nThe bargain by which this reduction of price came about was the effective basis upon which the only hopes of the plaintiffs could possibly rest for a commission such as is allowed.\nThere is only another alternative which no doubt was present to the mind of Chief Justice Meredith in granting a new trial. I suspect plaintiffs prefer what has been adjudged.\nMACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Idington J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.N.

It was sought to enforce a mortgage against the defendant ship merely, no personal claim being made under the covenants in the mortgage. The ship was arrested under a warrant and the writ served by nailing it to the mast The Union Steamship Company of British Columbia, as the owners of the ship at the time of the arrest, entered an appearance to the action and obtained an order releasing the ship upon bail. The plaintiffs claimed \u00a321,638, sterling, with interest and expenses, condemnation of the bail given on release of the ship and judgment against the sureties.\nThe owners filed a defence, and with it a counterclaim, of which the material words were as follows:\nThe plaintiffs did not build the * * * ship * * * \"Camosun\" in accordance with * * * contract * * * but on the contrary * * * negligently and with defective work and materials, with the result that the said owners were forced to expend, in restoring and replacing defective materials and bad workmanship, \u00a33638.\nThey gave particulars of the damages so claimed which were the same, and for the same amount, as the first particulars afterwards given under the paragraph, recited below, in question on this appeal.\nThe counterclaim was struck out on the ground that the Exchequer Court of Canada, in admiralty, had no jurisdiction to entertain claims or disputes arising out of breaches of contracts for the construction of ships, such subject matter not being within the admiralty, as distinguished from the common law or general plenary jurisdiction of the High Court in England, the admiralty jurisdiction alone of that court being attributed to Colonial Courts of Admiralty, by the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" sec. 2. The respondents then obtained from Mr. Justice Martin leave to amend by pleading paragraph 7, now in dispute, the material allegations of which are:\nAlternatively and by way of equitable defence to the plaintiffs' action, in the event of it being held that the said owners have made default under the said agreement and mortgages and that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendant in this action, the said owners say that the plaintiffs did not build the said ship \"Camosun\" in accordance with the terms of the contract, plans, etc., but on the contrary the said ship \"Camosun\" was built by the plaintiffs negligently and with defective work and materials, etc., with the result that the said owners were forced to expend in repairing and replacing defective materials and bad workmanship * * * the sum of \u00a33638, particulars whereof have already been delivered to the plaintiffs, (as they had been under the counterclaim), and the defendants, the owners of the said ship \"Camosun,\" claim they are in equity entitled to, and injustice should be permitted to set off and deduct from any and all sums of money which may be payable by the said owners to the plaintiff the said sum of \u00a33638 so expended by them as aforesaid, with interest and costs.\nThe plaintiffs resisted the application on the ground that the paragraph was the counterclaim over again under another name. Martin J., allowed the amendment, and his order was affirmed by the Exchequer Court.\nThere never was any motion, in lieu of demurrer, to strike paragraph 7 off the files. It happened that the paragraph was put on the files under the order of Martin J., before the plaintiff had time to appeal from that order, and the plaintiffs asked that\nif the said order is reversed, it be further ordered that the amended statement of defence delivered and filed herein in pursuance of the said order hereby appealed from be amended by striking out therefrom paragraph 7 thereof.\nThe owners gave the same particulars under paragraph 7 as they had already given under the counter- claim, being for expenses incurred in Monte Video, San Francisco, and Vancouver, by reason of the alleged breach of contract, demurrage, etc., etc.\nThe plaintiffs, by their reply, amongst other matters, pleaded estoppel, set forth the mortgage sued on, verbatim, reciting that it was given by one Legg in consideration of money lent to him by the plaintiff, covenanting to pay the amount of the mortgage and interest, and, for better securing repayment, mortgaging to the said plaintiffs 64 shares in the ship \"Camosun,\" and the respondents' right to assert that the mortgage is for other than a loan of money was denied. They also took objections in law to paragraph 7, which may be stated shortly as follows:\u2014\nThat the action is in rem against the ship, no claim being made against the respondents, and no defence, set-off or claim, equitable or otherwise, personal to the respondents, is admissible against the plaintiffs' claim; that the action is not and cannot be treated as an action for the price of the ship, and that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain actions for the price of ships, unless the ship is under arrest at the time of its commencement, which was not so in this case; estoppel by recital in the mortgage that it is given for a loan; that the claim in paragraph 7 is not a proper subject of set-off; that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain claims or disputes in regard to breaches of contracts to construct ships or for negligent or improper construction either by way of counterclaim, set-off or otherwise, and that any cause of action in assumpsit for the price of the ship was merged in the mortgage. They also raised the question that the cause of complaint in paragraph 7 arose outside the territorial jurisdiction. By rejoinder it was objected that the points of law raised were not open to the appellants because they were res adljudicata by the orders of Martin J., and Burbidge J., respectively, putting paragraph 7 on the record and dismissing appellants' appeal from that order.\nAll the points of law raised were heard before Martin J., who \"held that paragraph 7 of the amended statement of defence constituted a good defence in law pro tanto to the action, that the defence could properly be pleaded and that the court had jurisdiction to entertain the questions thereby raised. On an appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada, this decision was upheld by the judgment from which the present appeal is asserted, the late Mr. Justice Burbidge stating that he dismissed the appeal for the reasons which he had given on the former application.\nCassidy K.C., for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice dissented from the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nDavies J.\u2014For the reasons given by the late Mr. Justice Burbidge, in the Exchequer Court, I agree, though entertaining many doubts, that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI desire to emphasize his opinion as to the limitation set by law upon the defendant's right to claim an abatement upon the contract price of the ship in an action such as this.\nIn view of the claim made by the defendants in the particulars they have delivered, it may not be undesirable to re-state that the defendants have no right to set-off special or consequential damages arising out of the alleged breach of the building contract. Their rights to an abatement of the contract price of the ship if established at all must be limited to the difference at the time of delivery between the ship as she was and what she ought to have been according to the contract. Their right does not extend beyond this or cover damages on account of any subsequent necessity for more extensive repairs. See Mondel v. Steel[1], at page 871.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Exchequer Court of Canada, in admiralty, maintaining a pleading by way of a defence set up in answer to a suit to enforce a mortgage.\nThe respondents are the owners of the ship, which was built for them by the appellants, and a mortgage was given by respondents' trustee to appellants for the supposed balance of the price that was to be paid for the ship as and when completed according to plans and specifications.\nThe respondents allege amongst other things in answer to this mortgage claim that the ship never was completed, and in effect that a deduction of over three thousand pounds should be made in respect of the many omissions found to exist through failure to comply with the specification.\nThe wording of the pleading suggests some grounds of defence, possibly ill-founded in law or beyond the court's jurisdiction, but the late Mr. Justice Burbidge by the terms of his opinion judgment on a prior motion defined how far he thought respondents were entitled to go and they do not claim now to be entitled to go further than he so defined. They only claim the pleading attacked will support them that distance.\nThe issue thus raised before us is quite distinct and clear, and it is this; the mortgagees assert their mortgage was taken for a fixed sum understood to be the balance due on account of construction and that if anything was omitted in such construction the respondents must rely on a cross-action or separate action which it is said the court below has no jurisdiction to entertain.\nThe pleading, whatever may be said reproachfully of it, and much might I think be well said so in view of what counsel supporting it alleges to be the real facts, shews at all events that by reason of non-completion of the construction which was the very consideration for which the mortgage was given there never was nor can be justly due to the mortgagees the amount claimed to have been fixed and that proper reductions ought to be made in respect of their failure in regard to some parts of the consideration.\nThe consequential damages are discarded by the court below and in deference to that judgment are abandoned by the respondents so far as this action is concerned.\nI have no manner of doubt that the court has ample power if not to reform the instruments at least to so rectify the results which the stated or settled account for which the mortgage was given might lead to if adopted, that judgment will not be given for more than that amount should have been for, or can rightfully stand for, just as fully as if by reason of express fraud as to a part or mistake in the addition of the figures entering into the computation the correct consideration had been unjustly augmented.\nThe proof may fail. The right to completion may have been expressly waived. Other considerations may have been substituted for the omitted parts.\nThat is something we have not just now to do with. Nor have we to do with the merit of paragraph 7 of the pleading as if it stood as a single plea. No point is or should be now made of that which as a mere matter of form or procedure may have been objectionable and liable to be struck out on motion so long as the frame of the whole statement discloses a defence and ha\u00bb not been permitted to so obscure the real issue that we should hold there is no possible defence shewn.\nThe sole contestation made here by appellants and deserving consideration is that the amount of the mortgage is so fixed no matter what partial failures there may have been of consideration that the wrong, if wrong there be, can only be remedied in another court and by another action.\nIn my view no other action is necessary. Everything within the ambit of the consideration for which or upon which the mortgage rests can be fully and effectually investigated by the court below in this action by means of any of the methods open to the court to determine such matters as may be necessary to determine the rights between the parties in that regard; saving of course the possible claims for consequential damages already disposed of and about which I say nothing.\nThe jurisdiction is founded upon section 11 of \"The Admiralty Court Act, 1861\" (24 & 25 Vict. ch. 10), which reads as follows: The High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim in respect of any mortgage duly registered according to the provisions of \"The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854,\" whether the ship or the proceeds thereof be under arrest of the said court or not.\nWhen that Act was passed even the incidental jurisdiction arising from the necessity of the Admiralty Court dealing with mortgage claims by way of mortgage against ships under arrest by process of that court had only been duly recognized for some twenty years or so by 3 & 4 Vict. ch. 65.\nThen only fourteen years after the passing of the \"Admiralty Court Act,\" in 1861, the court's jurisdiction was transferred bodily to the new 'High Court of Justice by \"The Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1873,\" brought into effect in 1875.\nUnder these circumstances and the further circumstance arising from the operation of the last mentioned Act, to which I will presently refer, we need not be surprised at the absence of any precedent determining the questions now raised.\nThe language conferring the jurisdiction is so very sweeping and comprehensive that it possibly required some temerity to raise or extraordinary conditions to justify the raising of the question that a mortgagee seeking to enforce a claim has, under and by virtue of such language, the right to deny the mortgagor his ordinary right of defence involving an investigation of the very foundation of the mortgage claim.\nWhether the development of such a jurisdiction should without specific provision follow the practice of an old existing court where rights of mortgagor and mortgagees were most usually dealt with, such as the then Court of Chancery, or that which the Admiralty Court had followed in dealing with maritime liens, as bottomry for example, it ought now, nothing in law being in the way, I venture to think, at all events since the \"Judicature Act, 1873\/' became operative, to be administered in such a way that justice be done, circuity of actions avoided, and needless multiplicity thereof be spared the unfortunate litigants.\nThe language being fitted for such purposes I would act in accordance with the views I thus suggest as possible and practicable. Although it was suggested, early in the argument, to the appellants' counsel that the \"Judicature Act\" might be found to have thrown obstacles in the way of depriving the defendant in such a case as this of the defence claimed, the point was not argued. A reference to that Act and consideration of section 24, sub-section 2, thereof tends to confirm the impression I had.\nI am unable to find anything to restrict the High Court of Justice when exercising admiralty jurisdiction from applying the said sub-section 2.\nThe right of defence given there, if not previously existent, is not at all the case of The \"Cheapside\"[2], where entirely separate causes of action each independent in regard to the subject matter out of which it arose were the subject of some remarks strongly impressed upon us here.\nIt is to be remarked that the jurisdiction of the court below is to be\nover the like places, persons, matters and things that the admiralty jurisdiction of High Court in England had (in 1890) whether existing by virtue of any statute or otherwise * * *.\nThat court in exercising that jurisdiction would, I assume, have acted upon the said sub-section 2 of section 24 I cite, and surely there can be no manner of doubt as to the Court of Chancery on a mortgage suit entertaining such a defence.\nMoreover, section 70 of the Merchant Shipping \"Act,\" 17 & 18 Vict. ch. 104, which is as follows;\nA mortgagee shall not by reason of his mortgage be deemed to be the owner of a ship or my share therein, nor shall the mortgagor be deemed to have ceased to be owner of such mortgaged ship or share, except in so far as may be necessary for making such ship or share available as a security for the mortgage debt,\nis worthy of consideration.\nIt is borrowed from the civil law, parent of so much admiralty law, and is distinctly different in this regard from the usual idea that prevails with us as to the legal rights of the mortgagee, as owner of the thing mortgaged, subject only to be redeemed, and lends a reason why the security should be measured as the law and justice of the case require before adjudging the property to be sold or become that of another. It re-appears in substance in section 34 of the \"Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.\" The mortgage in question was given by virtue of this latter Act.\nA hypothec, by the civil law, pre-supposed an obligation that a simple agreement secured. It might be conditional as to a debt to be incurred, but only became effective when the debt came into existence.\nThe cases of The \"Cathcart\"[3], and The \"Rose\"[4], shew that, so far as the Admiralty Court, whilst a separate and independent jurisdiction, guided by a strong hand, developed this new jurisdiction, it was in accord with the spirit which the court below has evinced in the judgment complained of. It is in accord with that I think we. ought to act.\nIn leaving the case I may say the parties assume the jurisdiction in question covers a mortgage given as that under the \"Shipping Act,\" 1894, though the expression in the \"Admiralty Act\" of 1861 mentions only mortgages under a then prior Act. As the parties are content I need not inquire how or express any opinion upon the question of how this jurisdiction proceeded upon is affected by such conditions or made effective in regard to a mortgage under an Act not named in nor anticipated by the original Act.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court and, subject to two observations, in his reasons also.\nThe first observation is that the rule in Mondel v. Steel[5], on which the defence impugned by the appellants is based, proceeds upon principles of English law which may or may not have a place in the law of Scotland; and I should not wish to be understood as implying an opinion that the claim of the owners to compensation for defects in the ship (by way of abatement in price or otherwise) is a claim whose validity is to be determined by the application of the law of England rather than the law of Scotland. The question does not arise on this appeal because a litigant who wishes in the Exchequer Court of Canada to rest his claim upon the law of Scotland (which in that court is a foreign law), must allege and prove it.\nThe second observation is, assuming the law of England\u2014or what for this purpose is the same thing, the law of British Columbia\u2014to apply, the owners will, in these proceedings, be entitled to the benefit of an abatement of the price only to the extent to which they shall shew that, by reason of the failure of the appellants to fulfil their contract, the value of the ship, at the time of delivery, was less than it would have been had the appellants been chargeable with no such default. I refer to this because, in some instances, the particulars of compensation claimed by the owners would appear to be outside the limits drawn by this rule.\nAppeal dismissed with costs*\nSolicitor for the appellants: Robert Cassidy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis, Marshall & Mac-Neill.\n*Leave to appeal to Privy Council was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada, on 30th June, 1908, under the provisions of sec. 6, sub-sec. 2(a), of the \"Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890,\" 53 & 54 Vict. ch. 27 (Imp.).\n[1] 8 M. & W. 858.\n[2] [1904] P.D. 339.\n[3] 1 Ad. & Ecc. 314.\n[4] 4 Ad. & Ecc. 6.\n[5] 8 M. & W. 858.\n"}

It is admitted that the Intercolonial Railway is a public work of Canada, but it is argued that the place where the accident happened is not a part of a public work of Canada, and, therefore, the suppliant has no right of action under the statute, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 140, sec. 20(c).\n\"That contention raises, I think, the question as to whether or not the part of the Grand Trunk Railway over which the government has running powers may with propriety be considered an extension of the Intercolonial Railway as defined in the 80th section of the 'Government Railways Act,' (R.S.C., 1906, ch. 36), which is in these terms: 'All railways and all branches and extensions thereof and ferries in connection therewith vested in His Majesty under the control and management of the Minister and situated in the Provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, are hereby declared to constitute and form the Intercolonial Railway.' \"In my view, I think that the place where the accident happened may properly be taken to be an extension of the Intercolonial Railway. I am, therefore, of opinion that the accident complained of happened on a public work, and that the question of law raised should be determined against the respondent and in favour of the suppliant.\"\nNewcombe K.C., for the appellant.\nLane K.C. for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014If the small portion of the railway in question in this cause is not an \"extension\" of the Intercolonial Railway, within the meaning of section 67 of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 50, then I do not know what it is in so far as the Dominion Government is concerned.\nI quite agree with my brother Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal from the Exchequer Court raises the simple question, whether or not a small part of the Grand Trunk Railway connecting the eastern and western parts of the Intercolonial Railway, and about a mile in length, is an extension of the Intercolonial Railway within the meaning of those words in section 67 of \"The Government Railways Act,\" as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 50.\nThe Government, under an agreement entered into with the Grand Trunk Railway Company, confirmed by statute, possesses powers and rights over this section of the Grand Trunk Railway lines\nin perpetuity and free from charge to run their trains and engines separately or combined and as frequently and at such times as the character and extent of the traffic may require under the reasonable rules and regulations of the Grand Trunk Railway Company and under the direction of the officials thereof, between Hadlow and Point Levis Station, to and from places' between these points in the yard at Point Levis and to and from and beyond that station.\nFor all practical railway purposes this little section of the Grand Trunk Railway is part of the Intercolonial system. Without running rights over it, an Intercolonial train could not pass from Montreal to Halifax or from any intervening points east or west of the section in question.\nSection 67, as amended by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 50, reads as follows:\nAll railways and all branches and extensions thereof and ferries in connection therewith, vested in Her Majesty under the control and management of the minister and situated in the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, are hereby declared to constitute and form the Intercolonial Railway.\nThe Intercolonial Railway is admittedly one of the public works of Canada and, if the section in question is an extension of that road within the meaning of the section just quoted, that determines the appeal.\nThe running rights secured in perpetuity and free of charge over the section may, I think, very well be said \"to be vested in the Crown under the control and management of the minister.\"\nIt is not necessary that the rights of the Crown should be exclusive. The mere fact that its rights over the section are held and enjoyed concurrently with the Grand Trunk Railway Company and subject to the reasonable rules and regulations for its user by both railways cannot, I think, exclude it from the section quoted. The perpetual and free exercise of running rights over it are secured by virtue of the agreement quoted and are vested in the Crown and make it to all intents and purposes practically an extension within the statute of the Intercolonial Railway.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed. Idington J.\u2014The respondent's husband, it appears from the pleadings and particulars, was killed in consequence of a train despatcher of the Intercolonial Railway giving conflicting orders which brought about a collision of two engines of that road, on one of which engines deceased was a fireman.\nThe collision took place on a part of the Intercolonial Railway system that runs over a road owned by the Grand Trunk Railway Company and over which the Intercolonial had perpetual running rights free of charge which were subject to the regulations that the Grand Trunk Railway Company, owning the road, might make from time to time.\nIt is urged for the appellant that it cannot be said the accident occurred on any \"public work\" within the meaning of the statute 50 & 51 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 16(c).\nI cannot agree. I think it was a part of \"a public work\" such as referred to in the said Act.\nWe must apply the plain or ordinary sense of the words and then we find that it is not the real estate title to any part of the road bed or track thereon that has to be thought of at all, but the work, that \"public work\" which is being carried on over that road bed owned by somebody else leased or used by virtue of some right for the public purposes of a great public work for which respondent is responsible and was intended to be held by the Act in question fully responsible in respect of such happenings as those now in question.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\n*R.S.C., 1906, ch. 140, sec. 20(c). Duff J.\u2014Having regard to the previous decisions of this court, the phrase \"on a public work\" in section 20, sub-section (c), of \"The Exchequer Court Act\" must, I think, be read as descriptive of the locality in which the death or injury giving rise to the claim in question occurs. The effect of these decisions seems to be that no such claim is within the enactment unless \"the death or injury\" of which it is the subject happened at a place which is within the area of something which falls within the description \"public work.\" Paul v. The King[1] and the cases there cited.\nBut, adopting that view, I do not think it is taking any unwarrantable liberty with the language of the \"Government Railways Act\" to hold that the short piece of track in question here is, in the circumstances, a part of the Intercolonial Railway as defined by section 80 of that Act; and is, consequently\u2014as part of a government railway\u2014within the limits of a \"public work.\"\nAppeal dismissed with costs.*\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

Gillies (Defendant) Respondent.\n1908: May 15, 18; 1908: June 16.\nPresent: Girouard, Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nCompany\u2014Sale of shares\u2014Misrepresentation\u2014Fraud\u2014Action for deceit\u2014Accord and satisfaction.\nG. a director in an industrial company transferred 290 shares of the capital stock to the president to be sold for him. The president instructed an agent to sell said shares along with some of his own and some belonging to the company. The agent sold 25 shares of G.'s stock to J. G. representing, and believing that it was treasury stock and getting a note for the price in favour of the company. The note was indorsed over to G. Later J. G. discovered that the stock he had bought was not treasury stock and had some correspondence with the secretary of the company in which he complained of having been deceived by the agent. Eventually he gave a four months' note in renewal of that given for the price of the stock but when it fell due refused to pay it the company having in the meantime become insolvent. In an action on the renewal note he filed a counterclaim for damages based on the misrepresentation and deceit. Judgment was given against him on the note and for him on the counterclaim.\nHeld, that G. was responsible for the fraud, practised on the purchaser of his shares by the misrepresentations of the agent who sold them.\nHeld, also, Girouard and Davies JJ. dissenting, that the settlement of the claim for the price of the shares by giving the renewal note and thus obtaining further time for payment was not a release of the purchaser's right of action for deceit.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant on a counterclaim. This action proper is upon a promissory note for $2,405.62, with interest at 5 per cent., since due. The note is dated the 29th day of December, 1904, payable four months after date, at the Bank of British North America, Halifax, to the appellant (plaintiff), as payee.\nThe defence is, in short, that the note was obtained from the respondent (defendant) J. A. Gillies by the fraud and deceit of the appellant and the appellant's agent. Such fraud and deceit being as follows:\u2014\n(a) The false representation that the twenty-five shares of common stock of the International Mercantile Agency, for which a note\u2014of which the note sued on herein was a renewal\u2014was given, was treasury stock of said Mercantile Agency, whereas in fact the stock was the stock of the plaintiff, one of the company's directors.\n(b) The further false representation that, at the time of the sale of said stock, the plaintiff's agent represented to the defendant J. A. Gillies that the preferred stock of the company had already paid an 8 per cent, dividend.\n(c) That the International Mercantile Agency was itself a swindle. That the plaintiff Goold, a director, knew its character, and conspired with the other officers of the company whereby they unloaded their stock upon the public as treasury stock.\nBesides the defence, alternatively the respondent counterclaims damages for deceit, setting up the same grounds as urged in the defence.\nThe respondent, at the time of purchasing the twenty-five shares of common stock of the Mercantile Agency, also purchased from the same agency twenty-five shares of preferred stock of the same company. The agent who sold was under the impression, and so-represented, that both the common and preferred stock were treasury stock. The respondent signed a subscription for the stock to the company. He was led to buy by the representations of the agent, whose name was Jackson. As a matter of fact, it was proved on the trial that the common stock sold to the respondent was the property of the appellant, but the preferred stock was the property of the company, that is, treasury stock.\nThe respondent gave notes for both the preferred and the common stock. These notes were made direct to the Mercantile Agency. It appeared that the Mercantile Agency, by its president, had an arrangement with the appellant, one of its directors, whereby the company undertook to sell for appellant $29,000.00 worth of the company's common stock, of which appellant was owner. When the agent, Jackson, sold to respondent and took notes from him, one of the notes taken was for $2,500.00 in payment for the preferred stock. Another of the notes was for $2,250.00 in payment for the common stock; that is, for what now turns out to have been appellant's stock.\nThe note for $2,250.00, payable to the Mercantile Agency, was sent in by Jackson to the agency, and the company indorsed the note over to appellant in part settlement with him for the $29,000.00 of common stock belonging to appellant that the company had taken to sell. The respondent, knowing nothing of appellant in the transaction, but finding himself, at a later date, called upon to pay the note for $2,250 to appellant when the same was about falling due, supposed that appellant was the indorsee of the note and a bon\u00e0 fide holder for value. Accordingly, being pressed for payment, he, although protesting at the time that the representations that had been made to him at the time he purchased stock were untrue, and as to some of them had not materialized, nevertheless renewed the note by giving a new note for principal and interest to appellant through appellant's solicitors. Upon this note, given direct to the appellant, and under the above mentioned conditions, this action was brought to trial. The action was tried by Mr. Justice Russell, who found that the shares were the property of the. appellant and were sold for the benefit of the appellant by an agent who, whether the agent was guilty in the transaction or not, had made untruthful representations while acting within the scope of his authority. But the trial judge found that, although the respondent, at the time that he gave the renewal note to the appellant, did not in fact know that the representations made to him were untrue, yet, because of certain letters which had been written to him, even though (as he found), the full significance of. these letters and the real state of the facts had not been borne in upon his mind, he must nevertheless be held to have known at the time when he gave such renewal, that the representations made to him were untrue, and so he must be held to have adopted the transaction; that consequently the plaintiff must recover upon the note. But the learned judge found as a fact that there had been false representations inducing the purchase; that there was \"a rogue somewhere in the transaction, and that he did not think the plaintiff could be allowed to reap the profits of his rascality.\" Accordingly, he gave judgment for the respondent, upon the counterclaim for damages to be assessed.\nThe appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, in banc, of Nova Scotia, from so much of the decision of the trial judge as gave judgment to the respondent upon the counterclaim. The respondent appealed to the same court from so much of the decision of the trial judge as gave judgment for the appellant upon the claim.\nThe appeal came on before Graham E.J. and Meagher and Longley JJ. The majority, Graham E.J. and Longley J., concurred in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal and the defendant's cross-appeal with costs. Meagher J. was of opinion that the plaintiff's appeal should be allowed, and the defendant's cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada; the defendant did not give notice of cross-appeal because the defence and counterclaim raise the same issues, and because he submitted that if the court should see fit to dismiss the action it had power to do so under the rules without any cross-appeal.\nMatthew Wilson K.C. and W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nW. F. O'Connor for the respondent.\nMatthew Wilson K.C. and W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The renewal note and extension of time given by it to the respondent discharged appellant from liability for damages caused by the alleged fraud. See Doherty v. Bell[1]; Beatty v. Neelon[2].\nThe respondent did not allege the facts necessary to support a claim for damages. Squier v. Plunkett[3], and he has not proved them. Webb v. Roberts[4].\nThe appellant was not himself guilty of any fraud and cannot be held liable. Weir v. Bell[5]; Pollock on Torts (7 ed.), pp. 106-7. W. F. O'Connor for the respondent. The respondent purchased because he thought his money would be used to develop the company's business and help to make his investment profitable. The representation to this effect being untrue, entitles him to damages for deceit. Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[6].\nThe appellant is liable for the fraud committed, even unintentionally, by his agent. Mackay v. Commercial Bank of New Brunswick[7]. See also Gordon v. Street[8].\nGirouard J.\u2014I dissent for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The ground upon which I would allow this appeal and dismiss the respondent's counterclaim is that such claim was compromised, settled and satisfied by the giving of the note sued on.\nJudgment was allowed against the respondent for this note and against that judgment no appeal has been taken.\nDefendant contested the action on the ground that the note had been obtained from him by false and fraudulent representations. At the trial of the action he was granted leave to put in a counterclaim against the plaintiff claiming damages for the same alleged false and fraudulent representations on which he sought to defraud the action on the note.\nIn effect the respondent now says, it is true he compromised and settled appellant's claim against him on the note sued on and that he submitted without appeal to the judgment on that note which went against him, but such compromise and settlement left open to him a right to sue for damages for the same deceit and fraud he unsuccessfully put forward to escape liability on the note, and did not operate as a compromise and settlement of the entire matter about which they were negotiating.\nI am quite unable to accept the respondent's contention. In my opinion his claim for damages for the misrepresentation and deceit on which he sought to avoid liability on the note was included in the settlement and compromise made on the note itself. It seems perfectly clear to me that it was the intention of both parties to put an end to their then existing disputes and to all possible litigation which might arise out of them.\nDuring the negotiations lasting from March 25th, 1904, till the giving of the note sued on, December 29th, 1904, and in which period the International Mercantile Agency, for stock in which the original note was given, became insolvent, the following facts appear:\nEarly in the spring of that year respondent became aware that the stock at the time of its sale to him belonged to appellant Goold and was not treasury stock as represented to him when he bought.\nHe also became aware that the note he had given for this stock in favour of the company had been indorsed to the plaintiff Goold. This information was conveyed to him in the clearest and most explicit language by the company's treasurer, Sterling, in his letters of April 2nd and 21st and May 12th.\nRespondent was urging by correspondence with the officials of the company that he had been induced to enter into the contract for the purchase of the shares sold to him and to sign the note given for the purchase price by representations of the agent of the company who sold him the shares and which had not materialized. He was asking for a liberal compromise of the claim on account of these alleged misrepresentations but affirming that he did not want any litigation. He then learns that the stock he had bought was Goold stock and not treasury stock as represented to him when he bought. It was open to him then to repudiate the transaction and the note he had given on the ground of misrepresentation and deceit.\nAfter a great deal of correspondence in which Gillies was put in possession of the material facts with reference to the stock and with respect to the payment of the notes, for which he was endeavouring to effect a compromise, he succeeded in effecting a settlement, and, on the 4th January, 1905, enclosed to the plaintiff's solicitors the notes sued upon in a letter in which he says:\nThis is worse than throwing it into the sea as the transaction was an unmitigated swindle.\nWith knowledge that the representations made to him respecting the stock and the company \"had not materialized,\" with knowledge that the stock sold him \"was not treasury stock,\" but belonged to the plaintiff Goold; with belief on his part that the transaction he was settling was as he expressed it \"an unmitigated swindle\" but threats that if they wanted litigation he did not, but, as he says, \"if I must I will,\" and after months of negotiation he settled the transaction, got extended time for payment and gave his note for the amount now sued on.\nIn my judgment respondent fully intended at the time he gave this new note to suffer the entire loss of the amount of the claim and had no idea of asserting any claim for damages in. answer to or in reduction of appellant's claim.\nThe question on this branch of the case is whether under all the circumstances of the case the parties intended merely to extend the time for payment of the purchase money of the stock or to settle by compromise the matters in dispute between them, and which had for months been carried on by correspondence, the one party abandoning his rights by reason of the alleged misrepresentations, and the other conceding to him a substantial concession in the shape of a long extension of credit. A careful perusal of the evidence and correspondence leaves no room for doubt in my mind that the settlement was not merely an extension of the time for payment but a settlement also of any claims the defendant might have arising out of the alleged misrepresentations.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and enter judgment for the appellant on the counterclaim with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014 In 1901 the appellant was a director on the Board of the Sprague Collecting Agency of Chicago and also on the Board of Directors of the Sprague Collecting Agency of Ontario which was the offspring, so to speak, of the former.\nThis was the outcome \"of stock chiefly if not altogether acquired by him from one McCauley and as the appellant explains\nwith the distinct understanding that the business was to be converted into the Mercantile Agency.\nI assume he means the International Mercantile Agency Company now in question.\nI infer therefore he joined forces with McCauley who later on became the purchaser of the various Sprague companies and the remains of a bankrupt concern of the same nature.\nBut what he paid for any or all to justify the floating of a company with a capital of $2,000,000 of which $1,200,000 should belong to McCauley and his friends such as the appellant does not appear.\nThe appellant aided in the promotion by a eulogy of Mr. McCauley and some of the concerns he was planning to have amalgamated in the International Mercantile Agency now in question.\nThe appellant was informed by a letter of the 18th January, 1902, written from New York by Mr. McCauley of the accomplishment of the new incorporation and its organization and that all the members of the boards of the old Sprague companies had thus become directors of the new company. The appellant recognizes he thereby became a director of the new company.\nThe evidence shews that the executive committee of this latter company did not meet very regularly or often but that the Board of Directors met as often probably as they had necessity to do so.\nThe appellant was, as a director, in attendance at, I think, all these board meetings.\nHe had as a result of foregoing events become a shareholder of common stock in this new company to the extent of $40,000. I infer as to a small part of it he was merely trustee for some relatives.\nHe concluded to sell 290 shares of nominal value of $29,000 of this stock and in the office in New York of the president, McCauley, on the 18th December, 1902, arranged with him who was selling stock of the company through its agents to sell this for him. He named no price. He fixed no commission. He never paid any commission though the agent selling got on those sales four per cent. from the company.\nHe says he indorsed a transfer of this stock and handed it to McCauley. But we are not favoured with the production of these documents or any writing up to that time shewing what the transaction really was save the following receipt:\nInternational Mercantile Agency,\n346 Broadway, New York.\nOffice of the President.\nReceived of E. L. Goold twenty-nine thousand ($29,000.00) Common Stock to be sold on his account.\n(Sgd.) T. N. McCauley,\nPresident.\nDecember 18, 1902.\nThe president, to whom I infer appellant trusted, though not blindly, everything, sold these shares along with others of his own and of the company by and through the agents of the company for such purposes of sale.\nI do not think the appellant is done any injustice in assuming not only that he knew what was being done but that it was because he knew Mr. McCauley had adopted or was about to adopt the method he did of mixing the sales of company stock with his own for the purpose of disposing of his own shares of which these had but recently formed, a part that the appellant entrusted him, as president be it noted, on the face of the transaction with such proposed sales of 290 shares of common stock.\nThese shares were accordingly sold by one of the company's agents who admits not that he acted fraudulently but that he made the false representation found by the court below to have been made as the result of the method adopted of handling the business. The appellant received, not from the man McCauley but from the auditor of the company, a letter dated 28th February, 1903, enclosing a cheque for $1l,702, being the balance of proceeds of sale and the note of the respondent with other notes and a voucher to be signed and returned,\nThis letter contains the following paragraph:\u2014\nYou will notice that the total of Mr. Lefurgey's notes makes more than the amount due?. but this was in payment of some preferred stock,. and finding it impossible to separate these notes, we send them to you. Also the one of R. C. Wetmore for $2,000 was made in payment for both preferred and common, and as, it was impossible to divide this note we have also sent it.\nIt hardly lies in the mouth of the appellant who got that letter to assume and claim he did not know and could not be held responsible for, McCauley's methods. Moreover it was his duty as a director to have seen that such things as happened should not have had a. possibility of happening.\nThe appellant was clearly liable for deceit, and I hold him so, without, relying on the foregoing further than to find therefrom that he clearly profited by a false statement made in the course of his (appellant's) business, and which statement had in it the necessary, qualities of falsity to make it the subject of an action for deceit, and was to the detriment of another. I think he falls within the principles upon which the Privy Council proceeded, in the case, of MacKay v. Commercial Bank of New Brunswick[9].\nBut the foregoing history and inferences are, though not all necessary to fix liability, useful to have in mind as lights upon the alleged evidence, which the correspondence it is claimed furnishes, of, a defence, of accord and satisfaction. It is urged that by a renewal by this respondent of his promissory note given for this stock and the extension of time he got, such a defence of accord and satisfaction is made out and is a complete answer to the claim set up by way of counterclaim for the deceit referred to above.\nThere is no plea to the counterclaim making any such defence to it.\nThere never was a bargain to forego any action of deceit.\nThere never was put before the appellant's mind much less set up by him a cause of action for deceit from which he sought a release, when, and as part of the dealing whereby, he sought a confirmation of the sale. He never condescends to notice such charges as were made.\nThere never was present to the respondent's mind, when writing the letters he did, such a case as the foregoing presents. I fail to see how we can find what those concerned never supposed they were agreeing to was agreed to.\nThe respondent certainly used very emphatic language as to the company and the value of what he was getting by having given his note and giving the renewal secured as it was. But it was all quite consistent with his entire ignorance of the relations between the appellant and McCauley and the appellant and the company and this appellant's intimate knowledge of the dealings of both.\nIt is to be observed that what was presented to the respondent's mind was that he had merely got the shares of another stockholder who for aught that appears might have been victimized as he had been, or might in truth have bought but had not yet paid for actual treasury stock and thus was getting rid of it and. so substituting the respondent, and after all giving respondent treasury stock.\nFor aught he knew appellant was an indorsee for value without notice of any fraud. He had given his note to the company and it was indorsed by the company to the appellant. Such was the face of the transaction.\nThere is in law on the facts no release of the action of deceit that had enured to the respondent and for which he has judgment on his counterclaim though what happened may have been as held an answer to the claim for rescission.\nThe adroit suppression of the appellant's position as a director and representing him merely as a stockholder when explaining how he came to get the respondent's note would, I incline to think, have made it difficult to have upheld an express release of the action of deceit if such had been got under all the facts and circumstances I have referred to.\nI think, if the able man of business I take him for on the evidence, that the appellant (whatever his position may have been at the outset or earlier stages) had by this time of renewal got so much light as to the probable fate of the company and the causes of its. fate as to have rendered his duty towards the respondent as a director and otherwise to think twice before pressing such a claim and involving others as sureties without disclosing the facts.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. agreed with Idington J. Duff J.\u2014In Cornfoot v. Fowke[10], it was said by Rolfe B., at page 370, that:\u2014\nIf the plaintiff * * * purposely employed an agent, ignorant of the truth, in order that such agent might innocently make a false statement believing it to be true, and might so deceive the party with whom he was dealing, * * * he would be guilty of a fraud:\u2014\nby Alderson B., at page 372:\u2014\nIt is said that this will open a door to fraud, by enabling parties in the situation of this principal, themselves conscious of objections to their premises, to appoint agents who, unconsciously, may make misrepresentations to the injury of third persons. This does not follow. If the fact could be shewn it would be a fraud on the part of the principal with such a motive to appoint such an agent:\u2014\nand by Parke B., at page 373:\u2014\nIt must be admitted that if the plaintiff not merely knew of the nuisance, but purposely employed an ignorant agent, suspecting that a question would be asked from him, and at the same time believing or suspecting that it would, by reason of such ignorance, be answered in the negative, the plaintiff would unquestionably be guilty of a fraud * * *; for then the representation of the agent, which he intended to be made, would be the same as his own; and his own representation, coupled with his knowledge of its falsehood, would doubtless be a fraud.\nThese observations were quoted with approval in Ludgater v. Love[11], at page 696, by Brett L.J., and in substance re-stated by Lord Selborne, in the same case at page 697; and there is nothing in Berry v. Peek[12], which conflicts with them. The principle sanctioned by the authority of these eminent lawyers seems to me, after a careful examination of the whole evidence, to fit precisely the facts disclosed by it as touching the responsibility of McCauley for the representations of his agents; and the fraud of McCauley, for which Goold is responsible, having been a material inducement leading Gillies to enter into the purchase of the shares, the measure of damages is the difference between the purchase price and the value of the shares (that is to say, a fair price for them), at the time of the purchase. Davidson v. Tulloch[13]; Arkwright v Newbold[14]; Holmes v. Jones[15].\nThe only serious difficulty arises upon the contention of the appellants that Gillies has released his right of action. The contention is based upon the correspondence which passed between him and the appellant's solicitors before the execution of the note sued upon \u2014which was given in renewal of the note of February 1903. Now it is plain that, Goold insisting on holding Gillies to his bargain, Gillies might after the discovery of the fraud affirm the bargain by renewing his note or paying it and still retain his right to sue for deceit Houldsworth v. City of Glasgow Bank[16], at page 323; Kerr on Fraud (3 ed.) 352; Lindley on Companies (6 ed.) 683; Arnison v. Smith[17] at pages 372, 378. In his action for deceit the respondent can recover, as I have mentioned, only the difference between the value of the shares at the time of his purchase and the purchase price; and that right of action is not displaced merely because he has precluded himself from resisting an action for the latter. The waiver, in a word, of his right to set up the fraud in answer to this last mentioned action, does not by any rule or implication of law import a satisfaction of his substantive right of action for damages.\nThe appellant can, consequently, succeed in this contention only by shewing that this cause of action has been released. In this, I think he fails. His contention is that Gillies, in December, 1904, after the note of February, 1903, was overdue, applied for an extension of time which he granted by accepting in renewal of that note a fresh note payable some months later; and that the consideration for this extension of time, as shewn by a correspondence between Gillies and the appellant's solicitors, was the release of Goold from all liability in respect of Gillies's purchase, including the claim now in question.\nI will state briefly why I am unable to accept the contention that the correspondence referred to discloses any agreement having the effect mentioned.\nFirst of all there are the concurrent findings of the two courts below that the appellant was not, when he executed the note of December, 1904, aware of the fraud practised upon him.\nThese findings, it is true, seem, at first sight, inconsistent with some earlier letters (which are in evidence), between Gillies and the secretary of the company shewing that Gillies was, months before the execution of the note of December, 1904, informed that the shares allotted to him had been Goold's. But the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal accepted Gillies's testimony that this statement made no impression upon him, partly because of his pre-occupation with other affairs and partly because he thought the writer of the letter was endeavouring to mislead him; and that, in spite of it, he remained under the belief that the shares were what they had been represented to be at the time of the purchase.\nAnother and I think quite sufficient ground is that Gillies was not aware at the time of the execution of the note of December, 1904, of the real character of McCauley's fraud. He did not know until months afterwards that McCauley and his co-directors (under the cover of the company's name, and under the pretence first of allotting to subscribers the company's unissued capital, and then of acting in behalf of the company in receiving the subscribers' payments they were acting on behalf of the company), had been getting rid of their own shares and appropriating the proceeds of the subscriptions in payment of them\u2014 and that he, Gillies, had been one of the victims of this imposition.\nIn these circumstances, it would not be sufficient to support this contention I am considering, that, in the letters relied upon, there should be found language sufficiently comprehensive in its broadest sense to extend to a right of action for deceit as against Goold. Once it appears that Gillies was not acquainted with the facts of the fraud in respect of which the present claim is made the appellant is bound to make out that an intention is manifested by the correspondence to include within the composition any such rights of action, whether then known or not known to exist; and the question is, whether, fairly read in the light of all the circumstances, the correspondence shews that such was the intention of the parties. I confess, with the highest respect for the views of others, that, to my thinking, that question must very plainly be answered in the negative; and, consequently, that it would be repugnant to principle to give effect to the language of the letters in the sense for which the appellant contends.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry, C.

The ship was delivered to the hirers at Rotterdam where she took on cargo and sailed for Montreal. On arriving at Montreal she unloaded and re-loaded for a voyage to Rotterdam, with the intention of returning to Montreal, and obtained a supply of coal from the plaintiffs which was furnished on the order of the hirers' agent at Montreal. The ship sailed to Rotterdam and returned to Montreal in about one month, touching at Havre and Quebec, discharged her cargo and proceeded to re-load, obtaining another supply of coal from the plaintiffs in the same manner as the first supply had been furnished. Within a few days, the price of these supplies of coal being still owing and unpaid, the hirers became insolvent, and the plaintiffs arrested the ship at Montreal, claiming special privilege upon her as derniers \u00e9quipeurs in furnishing the first supply of coal on her last round voyage, the right of attachment before judgment in respect of both supplies, and seizing her under the provisions of articles 2391 of the Civil Code and 931 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Held, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Maclennan and Duff JJ., that the voyage from Montreal to Rotterdam and return was not the ship's \"last voyage\" within the meaning of article 2383 (5) of the Civil Code; that the voyage out from Montreal and that returning from Rotterdam did not constitute one round voyage but were separate and complete voyages, and that, consequently, there was no privilege upon the ship for the supply of coal furnished for her voyage from Montreal to Rotterdam. And also, that the provisions of article 2391 of the Civil Code did not render the ship liable to seizure for personal debts of the hirers, and, consequently, that she could not be attached therefor by saisie-arr\u00eat.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 16 K.B. 16) affirmed, Girouard J. dissenting.\n*Per Davies J.\u2014The \"last voyage\" mentioned in art. 2383 C.C. refers only to a voyage ending in the Province of Quebec.\n*Per Idington J.\u2014As the terms of the charter-party expressly excluded authority in the hirers to bind the, ship for any expenses of supply and as nothing arose later that could by any implication of law confer any such authority on anyone and especially so in a port where the owners had their own agents any possible rights that might in a proper case arise under article 2383 of the Civil Code did not so arise here; and, therefore, though agreeing in the result he expressed no opinion on the meaning of the term \"last voyage\" therein. Lloyd v. Guibert (L.R. 1 Q.B. 115) should govern this case.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head-note and the judgments now reported.\nT. Chase Casgrain K.C. for the appellants.\nD. MacMaster K.C. and Hickson for the respondents.\nT. Chase Casgrain K.C. for the appellants. We claim, as declared by Mr. Justice Dunlop, in the Superior Court[3], that, even if Elder, Dempster & Co. are not personally liable, there is a privileged claim upon the ship for both supplies of coal.\nThe ship sailed from Montreal for the last time, in July, 1904, when the first sale of coal was made, and was about to sail again with the second supply of coal, in September, 1904, when she was stopped by appellants' attachment. The voyage from Montreal to Rotterdam and back was the first of a series of round voyages, with an interchange of cargo, contemplated by the charterers of the ship, and it constituted a single voyage; The \"Red Jacket\"'[4], per Stuart J., at page 306; McLea v. Holman[5]; 1 Valroyer, Dr. Mar. n. 42, p. 125; DeCourcy, Maritime Law, pp. 15-16; Dalloz, 1872, 2. 34; 1 Hennebicq, Dr. Mar. n. 232, p. 268; 5 Ruben de Conder, Dr. Mar. vo. \"Navire,\" n. 274; Boistel, Dr. Comm. n. 1139, p. 844; 1 Cresp, p. 113; Gazette des Trib. 1905, 3, 103, vo. \"Navire,\" n. 24; Pand. Fr. Rec. 1898, 1, 331; The \"Scarsdale\"[6], and in the same case on appeal[7], per Vaughan Williams L.J., at page 257, per Sterling L.J., at page 258, and in another report[8], per Vaughan Williams L.J., at page 33, referring to the \"Sailors' Word Book.\" See also The \"Martha\"[9]; The \"Mary Adelaide Randall\"[10].\nThe attachment, under article 931 C.P.Q., could be validly effected and treated as an ordinary saisie-arr\u00eat or a conservatory attachment[11], as the plain- tiffs were privileged creditors for the supplies of coal necessary to enable the steamship to sail; 1 Maud & Pollock, \"Law Merchant\" (4 ed.), p. 86; Abbott on Shipping, p. 186, sec. 4; 19 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law (2 ed.), vo. \"Maritime Liens,\" pp. 1094-1111.\nOur codifiers do not claim to have changed the French law on this particular point. The privilege of the dernier \u00e9quipeur has always been recognized by our jurisprudence. Girard v. St. Louis[12], at page 57; Henn v. Kennedy[13].\nThe reasoning of the court below leads to strange consequences, when, in effect, it says: \"So long as the ship is in the port, you have no privilege for necessaries supplied in that port, but as soon as the ship has reached another port, then your claim becomes privileged, and you may take all provisional measures which the law gives you to enforce it.\" This carries too far the rule that privileges must be strictly interpreted. Modern law-writers have all protested against such narrow interpretations. DeCourcy, Dr. Mar., page 94, T.I.; Hennebicq, Dr. Mar., page 268, no. 232. The French Commentators read the article as meaning the supplies \"before the departure for the last voyage.\" 1 Valroger, page 139, no. 61. In fact, this privilege has existed from time immemorial in the jurisprudence and in popular parlance and is, moreover, essentially equitable.\nIf we have not, as dernier \u00e9quipeur, a privilege or right of preference on the steamship in the sense of articles 1983, 1994, and 2383 CO., we have the extraordinary right conferred by article 931 C.P.Q., and the attachments before judgment and conserva- tory attachments[14] may be taken together[15], and under one or the other of these names; Bourassa v. Lorigan[16]. The latter rests on a privilege, but the former is given in the case of the dernier \u00e9quipeur[17]. The procedure on both attachments is the same[18].\nD. MacMaster K.C. and Hickson for the respondents. The \"round voyage\" theory was not suggested in the plaintiffs' declaration, but adopted at the trial; the first theory was that the voyage in question was the last voyage from the port of Montreal. Such a qualification has no place in the law; it would unsettle it. \"Last voyage,\" unless otherwise qualified, must mean the last complete transit from the shipping port to the port of delivery. We are not concerned with the convenience of the supplier, on credit, following the ship for the purpose of attaching her at the journey's end. Nor can an ensuing voyage be construed as a \"last voyage.\"\nThe right of the plaintiffs to attach the ship must be determined by articles 6 and 2383 C.C., and article 931 C.P.Q., neither of which can authorize an attachment or privilege in respect of, goods supplied for an ensuing voyage. Article 931 C.P.Q. recognizes only the right to attach the property of the debtor. Here there is no personal debt due by the owners of the ship. We refer to Pickford v. Dart[19]; Gracie v. Marine Insurance Go, of Baltimore[20]. The dernier equipeur has no place in the laws of Quebec save under sub-section 5 of article 2383 CO., and that article gives him a privilege only in respect to \"provisions\" for the last voyage. See also, Sirey on article 191 Code de Commerce. The qualified ownership conferred by article 2391 CO., does not involve a lien or privilege on the ship; it occurs in another part of the Code dealing with \"owners, masters and seamen\" and not dealing with the questions of privilege or liens provided for in a previous chapter. Transfers of British ships can be effected only in conformity with the laws respecting shipping[21]; Baumwoll Manufactur von Carl Scheibler v. Furness[22]; The \"David Wallace\" v. Bain[23]. See also Sirey, Code Ann., art. 191, para. 17, page 219; Valente v. Gibbs[24]; The \"Castlegate\"[25], at page 51; and DeNicols v. Curlier[26].\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the opinion stated by Maclennan J.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The facts of this case are not in dispute. We are called upon to decide two questions of law. First: What is the meaning of the words \"last voyage\" used in paragraph 5 of art. 2383 of the Civil Code? And secondly: Who is the dernier \u00e9quipeur within the meaning of arts. 931 and 983 of the Code of Civil Procedure? . Art. 2383 reads as follows:\nThere is a privilege upon vessels for the payment of the following debts:\n*****\n5. The sum due for repairing, and furnishing the ship on her last voyage,\n\"pour son dernier voyage,\" according to the French text. This article is borrowed from the Ordonnances de la Marine of 1681 and from the common law of France as it existed at that time. See art. 18, tit. XIV., liv. 1, as explained by Valin in his commentaries on this ordinance, pages 397 and following, \u00e9dition B\u00e9cane.\nThe framers of the Quebec Code express some doubt as to that ordinance, and also the ordinance of commerce of 1673, having ever been in force in Canada for want of registration by the Superior Council, and it may be added that such has been the general impression among Quebec jurists for many years. This registration was a prerogative of the Parliaments of France, recognized by the Sovereign himself, so that his laws would receive some sort of popular sanction; Decl. 7th July, 1572, 14 Isambert, Anciennes lois fran\u00e7aises, p. 252; and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has declared on several occasions that it was extended to the Superior Council of Quebec. Hutchinson v. Gillepsie[27], in 1844; Symes v. Cuvillier[28], in 1879. In view of documents recently made public, more particularly Jugements et deliberations du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur, published by the Government of Quebec in 1885-1891, that doubt cannot any longer be entertained. This collection, forming six immense volumes, is most valuable, but unfortunately it is without index and unfinished. I had to spend several days in perusing the two last ones to obtain the information I desired. These volumes were stopped at the year 1716, and it is impossible to ascertain the jurisprudence of the Council from that date till the Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents of Perrault, commencing in 1727. I am convinced that, if this collection was completed at least to Perrault's Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents and a proper index made, more important information would be of easy reach on the laws of Quebec generally under the French r\u00e9gime and more particularly on the subject before us.\nIt is true that the sheet or sheets of registration of said ordinances cannot be found, but it is a well-known fact that they are not the only ones missing. Too often they were not recorded in a bound register or book and were kept loose. To quote one or two instances, how is it that the commission of one of the judges in admiralty, le Sieur Boucault, \"lieutenant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'amiraut\u00e9 de Quebec,\" is not in the third volume of the revised edition of Edits et Ordonnances, published in 1854 by the Government of the late Province of Canada, which is supposed to contain all the commissions of the officers of justice. The commission of Couillard de l'Espinay, the first judge, is there, pages 94 and 95; likewise that of the last judge, le Sieur Guillemin; but that of his predecessor, Boucault, is missing. The archives of the Juridiction Royale of Montreal disclose a still more flagrant example of carelessness and looseness in the keeping of the archives of the Council. In the first report of the Provincial Secretary of Quebec for 1886-87, Division of the Registrar, page 54, the proof is made that an important r\u00e8glement or statute of the Council of the 5th May, 1727, concerning the keeping of registers of civil status, in thirteen sheets and twelve articles, was passed for the whole government of Canada. It is on file in the greffe of the Royal Court of Montreal, but it is not to be found in the Edits et Ordonnances which are represented to contain all the r\u00e8glements of the Council. Why? Simply because it had been mislaid, and this in violation of the arr\u00eat of the 28th February, 1664, passed one year after the establishment of the Council, which provided for the keeping of a plumitif or register where the arr\u00eats et ordonnances of the Council should be transcribed \"et non en feuille volante\" (2 Ed. et Ord. 15). It is remarkable that this regulation which no doubt applied to the acceptance or registration by the Council of the King's Edits et Ordonnances did not extend, at least expressly, to the transcription of the text of these statutes. Later on, a few years before the cession, the King and the Council made some enactments concerning the registration of said statutes, which will be found at pages 224 and 481, but nothing is said as to the manner of making the registration.\nIf the ordinances of 1673 and 1681 were not law in Canada, how can we explain the fact that all the courts including the Superior Council, followed them as law? We find in Perrault's Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents du Conseil, p. 16, a decision relating to a bill of exchange, where undoubtedly the ordinance or Code of Commerce of 1673 is quoted as law. Perrault, an advocate and prothonotary of the King's Bench in Quebec for many years, and who had personally known many praticiens under the old French r\u00e9gime (he was born in 1753) observes in his Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de la Pr\u00e9vost\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec that that ordinance was one of the fundamental laws of the Canadian courts. (See also p. 26.) On the 19th September, 1712, and consequently before the creation of the Quebec admiralty court, at an extraordinary sitting of the Superior Council reported in the 6th volume of the Jugements et D\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, p. 504, reference is made to the Ordonnance de la Marine as being in force in La Nouvelle France, and also to the \"Greffe d'Amiraut\u00e9\" which must have been a branch of the Pr\u00e9vost\u00e9 or ordinary civil tribunal of the Town of Quebec.\nAre not these declarations made not only by inferior courts but also by the very body who could declare whether these laws of national importance should be in force or not, equivalent to registration? I believe that it is the only conclusion we can arrive at.\nBut if any doubt be possible, it disappears in face of the King's r\u00e8glement of the 12th January, 1717, registered the same year by the Superior Council, Edits et Ord., Vol. 1, p. 358. His Majesty does not complain that the ordinance was not registered. He supposes it had been, for he represents that the ordinance had not been put fully into operation, because admiralty courts had not been established in the colonies of America, and provides for the creation of such courts.\nArticle 1 says:\nIl y aura \u00e0 l'avenir dans tous les ports des isles et colonies . fran\u00e7oises, en quelque partie du monde qu'elles soient situ\u00e9es, des juges pour connoitre des causes maritimes, sous le nom d'officier d'amiraut\u00e9, privativement \u00e0 tous autres juges, et pour \u00eatre par eux les dites causes jug\u00e9es suivant l'ordonnance de 1681, et autres ordonnances et r\u00e8glements touchant la marine.\nThis admiralty court was organized in Quebec in 1717 (see Edits et Ordonnances, Vol. 3, p. 94). I find in Perrault, Pr\u00e9vost\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, p. 48, an arr\u00eat of the 4th December, 1737, dismissing an action and ordering the parties to proceed elsewhere \"attendu que le fait dont il s'agit est un fait maritime.\" But it must be observed that the ordinance of 1681, title 2, art. 1, and the r\u00e8glement of 1717 quoted above, gave exclusive jurisdiction to admiralty courts in maritime cases. Likewise under the French Code de Commerce, arts. 631, 633, the jurisdiction of the tribunals of commerce, which have replaced admiralty courts, has been held to be exclusive, although the word is not used.\nThis digression is not only interesting from an historical point of view; it is not without practical importance in the determination of marine cases, for whenever the Civil Code of Quebec has no provision upon any maritime matter, recourse can be had to the ordinance of 1681 and other French laws in force in the Parliament of Paris at the time of the creation of the Superior Council in 1663, or registered by the Council if enacted after its creation. Art. 2613, C.C.\nAfter the cession of the country to Great Britain the ordinance and the French law generally ceased to be enforced in the Quebec admiralty court and the English law was substituted for them as part of the public law of Great Britain. By his commission, the first admiralty judge in Quebec, appointed in 1764, was empowered to hold a vice-admiralty court like the High Court of Admiralty in England, and, of course, according to the English laws. The Civil Code of Quebec, art. 2383, recognized that rule in express. terms:\nThe provisions in this chapter (chapter 4th relating to privilege and maritime lien) do not apply in cases before the court of vice-admiralty.\nCases in that court are determined according to the civil and. maritime laws of England.\nFinally, the Imperial statute, 53 & 54 Vict. ch. 27, passed in 1890, empowering the legislature of a British possession to create colonial courts of admiralty, declares that the jurisdiction of such courts shall be\nas the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England,. For many years, ever since the cession, until the organization of colonial courts of admiralty by virtue of the said Imperial statute and the Canadian statute in pursuance thereof, there was only one admiralty court in Lower Canada, and that was the Quebec vice-admiralty court, having jurisdiction only over tidal waters. Under the new statutes, admiralty courts have been established all over Canada and the navigable waters thereof, whether tidal or non-tidal, but it is remarkable that their jurisdiction is not exclusive, at least expressly. It may be so impliedly, a point we are not called upon to decide. In the United States it is now well settled, after some years of hesitation and uncertainty, that admiralty jurisdiction is exclusive, although some of the states, for instance, Louisiana, have special laws like those of Quebec, governing the subject matter, and this in spite of the following saving clause in the constitution:\nsaving to suitors in all cases the rights of a common law remedy where the common law. is competent to give it;\nBerwin v. Steamship \"Matdnzas\"[29].\nStrong grounds of public policy may be advanced against the maintenance of concurrent jurisdiction. It may be said that it is of national importance to the British Empire that British ships, whether owned or registered in the British Isles or the colonies, carrying the same flag, shall be governed by the same laws. But Parliament alone can so decree either expressly or impliedly. Whatever may be the rule of law in this respect, concurrent jurisdiction of ordinary courts in maritime matters provided for by the French laws has been so long exercised and recognized by the juris- prudence of Quebec, from the cession to the present date, that I would hesitate to disturb it, especially as the point has not been taken either in the courts below or in this court. Therefore, in arriving at the conclusion I have reached upon the two points of law submitted for our decision, I have taken for granted that the case was properly before the courts below and this court, and is governed by Quebec law, a point which was, moreover, conceded by the respondent's counsel at the hearing before us.\nWhat is therefore the meaning of the words \"last voyage\" within art. 2383, par. 5, of the Civil Code?\nThe trial judge, Dunlop J., who is also a judge in admiralty, after delivering a very elaborate opinion, gave judgment in favour of the appellants, and held that the \"last voyage\" means the round trip, or when the ship was last in the port of Montreal, as she intended to return to Montreal and did in fact return within about one month. In appeal, this judgment was reversed by all the judges who expressed the view that the \"last voyage\" means the return voyage only, or the voyage from Rotterdam to Montreal, and that the supplies having been furnished on the previous voyage, that is the voyage from Montreal to Rotterdam, the privilege existed no longer. It must be remarked that the case was not argued and was only submitted on the factums.\nThe respondents' counsel urged, both at the hearing before us and in his factum, that the appellants could only enforce their privilege by seizure of the coal before departure and of the ship at the port of destination in Europe. I must confess that I cannot conceive that that could be the intention of the legislature. That privilege was given not only to secure to our own people the payment of necessaries for a ship, but also to give the credit she may need. It would be illusory for a master to get supplies, if the latter be exposed to be revendicated before the voyage commenced. And is it not extraordinary to suppose that a merchant who has advanced necessaries, as in this case, to enable a ship to proceed to sea, cannot enforce any privilege he may have unless he enforces it either before departure or at the European port? In this case, that port was within easy reach. But suppose the port of destination was unknown or distant in Asia or Australia, can it be expected that this coal merchant will be obliged to follow the ship by cable, correspondence or otherwise to maintain his privilege upon her? Will that privilege be recognized in foreign courts? Will the local privileges be preferred? I think this situation is too absurd, to be well founded. The privilege upon the ship, it is obvious, has been created not only in favour of commerce and navigation, but also to protect our own merchants, and the \"last voyage\" must mean the last trip she made from the port of Montreal, as held by the trial judge. We are bound to give to our statutes\u2014and the Quebec Code is a statute adopted by the late Province of Canada before confederation\u2014such interpretation as will fulfil the intention of the legislature and will give them effect.\nThe words \"last voyage,\" to be found in several paragraphs of art. 2383 C.C., have not always the same meaning, because the circumstances are not the same. A seaman, for instance, runs no risk, because he follows the ship and is always in a position to enforce his rights. Chief Justice Lacoste admits that the words have a different meaning, but he holds, and the whole court with him, that in this case the \"last voyage\" means the voyage from Rotterdam to Montreal.\nIt is perhaps impossible to lay down an absolute definition of what may be the last voyage. When a ship has no regular service to perform, a tramp, for instance, her last voyage may perhaps mean her last trip from the port of sailing, but when the ship belongs to a regular line, especially a Canadian line, as in this case, between Canadian ports and European ports and return, offering return passage, surely when that ship leaves the port of Montreal with a view of returning, and in fact returning regularly, it cannot be said that the voyage is only for one crossing and not also for the return crossing. It is not necessary to say more for the purposes of this case. Neither the Code nor the ordinance defines the last voyage. It is undoubtedly more a question of fact, or rather of intention, than of law. The very recent decision of the House of Lords in Board of Trade v. Baxter; The \"Scarsdale\"[30], in July, 1907, supports this view:\nIt cannot be said that the jurisprudence of Quebec is well settled. I know only of two decisions, Henn v. Kennedy[31], decided by Mr. Justice Routhier, in 1890, and adopted by Chief Justice Lacoste, and the other one McLea v. Holman[32], decided by Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, in 1892, and reported in the Quebec Law Reports, and followed in this case by Mr. Justice Dunlop.\nMr. Justice Pagnuelo has examined very fully the authorities, and I cannot add anything to what he says on the subject. I refer, therefore, to his elabor- ate opinion and also to the authorities quoted by the appellants' counsel in his factum. For the moment I will content myself with quoting the following passage from Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, in which I concur:\nIl faut en cette mati\u00e8re, comme en toute autre, rechercher l'esprit de la loi et l'interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 lui donner effet, en prot\u00e9geant, d'une mani\u00e8re efficace, ceux que la loi a voulu prot\u00e9ger.\nLe ma\u00eetre d'un navire qui le fait r\u00e9parer ou l'approvisionne \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit avant de faire un voyage, n'agit ainsi que parce qu'il n'a pas l'argent pour payer. La loi accorde un privil\u00e8ge pour les r\u00e9parations faites ou les provisions fournies pour le dernier voyage. Si la course que le vaisseau doit faire, disons de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Liverpool, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme constituant et compl\u00e9tant le dernier voyage \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de celui qui a fait les r\u00e9parations ou fourni les provisions \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, il lui faudra suivre le vaisseau \u00e0 Liverpool et Vy saisir sous peine de perdre son privil\u00e8ge, ou bien le saisir avant qu'il ne parte de Montr\u00e9al. En effect du moment que le navire laisserait le port de Liverpool pour naviguer durant l'hiver entre les ports de l'Europe ou de l'Am\u00e9rique, le cr\u00e9ancier de Montr\u00e9al perdrait son privil\u00e8ge sur le navire; il lui faudrait donc suivre le navire en Angleterre pour le faire saisir, ou le saisir \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al avant son d\u00e9part. Ce sont deux alternatives que rendraient impossible au ma\u00eetre du navire de faire r\u00e9parer son vaisseau, ou de le faire approvisioner, s'il lui faillait payer avant de partir ou si le vaisseau \u00e9tait saisi avant son d\u00e9part.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur l'a entendu autrement; il a voulu que le navire put \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 ou approvisionn\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit lorsque le ma\u00eetre n'a pas d'argent pour payer et la loi accorde au fournisseur un privil\u00e8ge sur le navire pour ses avances. Exiger qu'il suive le vaisseau en pays \u00e9tranger pour l'y faire saisir sous peine de perdre son privil\u00e8ge, c'est aller contre l'esprit de la loi et rendre impossible ce qu'elle a voulu favoriser.\nLe mot voyage et dernier voyage sont employ\u00e9s plusieurs fois par notre code civil et par l'ordonnance de la marine. On se tromperait en leur donnant dans tous les cas la m\u00eame port\u00e9e, la m\u00eame signification.\nLorsque le code parle du privil\u00e8ge pour les gages et loyers du ma\u00eetre et de l'\u00e9quipage pour le dernier voyage (art. 2383; 4 Ord. de la Marine, liv. 1, titre XIV., art. 16) des sommes dues pour r\u00e9parer le b\u00e2timent et l'approvisionner pour son dernier voyage (id. 5) de la prime d'assurance sur le navire pour le dernier voyage (id. 7) du cas o\u00f9 navire n'a pas encore fait de voyage (id. 8) de la prescription pour les gages des matelots, qui ne commence \u00e0 courir qu'apr\u00e8s le parach\u00e8vement du voyage (art. 2406); et des pr\u00eats \u00e0 la grosse, soit sur le b\u00e2timent ou sur les merchandises, faits pour le dernier voyage, lesquels sont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux faits pour le voyage pr\u00eacedent (art. 2605), il n'entend pas toujours la m\u00eame chose par le mot voyage et dans chaque cas Ton doit interpr\u00e9ter la loi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer \u00e0 chacun le privil\u00e8ge qu'il a voulu conf\u00e9rer. C'est se tromper que de vouloir donner au mot voyage la m\u00eame signification dans tous les cas comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans la cause de Henn v. Kennedy[33].\nAs to the other reasons advanced by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, Chief Justice Lacoste has answered them to the satisfaction of the majority of his court and to mine also. It is not necessary that the coal should have been ordered by a captain appointed by the real owners. The article of the Code makes no distinction whatever, whether the captain is the agent of the real owner or of the charterer, a British or a Quebec ship, navigating Quebec or interprovincial waters, the high seas or foreign waters. It is sufficient that the coal was put on board the steamer and used there; a legal privilege or lien is granted if the coal has been for the last voyage, and is enforced before another voyage is undertaken from the Quebec ports.\nUnder article 2391 of the Civil Code, the charterer in a case like this is supposed to be the owner for the time being, and to be responsible as such owner to third parties. Article 2397 C.C. does not apply. Here the coal was ordered by the g\u00e9rant du b\u00e2timent and the reputed owners, that is the charterers and their agent in Montreal having the sole control of the ship.\nThat is all I have to say about the first item of the claim of the appellants. They have a privilege for the payment of the same which they can enforce by a conservatory process as they have done under article 955 of the Code of Procedure. They might have had recourse to the saisie-arr\u00eat of article 931 C.P.Q., if they had attached the steamer on her arrival in the port of Montreal; but instead of doing this, they delivered more coal and thereby became dernier \u00e9quipeur for that last delivery, remaining privileged creditors for the first one, being merely entitled to be paid by preference, as long as another voyage is not commenced. It is a lien of temporary duration, unknown, I believe, to the English law, and under the Ordonnance de la Marine is subject to a prescription of one year. For the first supply they invoke the conservatory process of article 955. The trial judge found the procedure correct; no objection was taken against it. I believe none can be raised and judgment should go for plaintiffs to the extent of the first supply at least.\nWith regard to the second delivery of coal delivered after the return voyage to Montreal and before the departure of the \"Lake Simcoe\" on her next crossing, which the appellants claim \u00e0 titre de dernier \u00e9quipeur under articles 931 and 933 of the Code of Civil Procedure, I think they are likewise entitled to judgment in their favour.\nOne would naturally ask here, who is the dernier \u00e9quipeur? No mention is made of him in any of the French ordinances, law dictionaries or books. He must have an exceptional position and a peculiar meaning, for whenever he appears in the statutes of Canada or Quebec, from the year 1787 to the present time, our legislative, even when using the English language, calls him by his French name only. Sir Alexander Lacoste C.J., looks upon him almost like a ghost conjured up to frighten navigators and craft owners:\nQuel est (he asks) ce personnage myst\u00e9rieux que Ton appelle le dernier \u00e9quipeur, qui a travers\u00e9 les si\u00e8cles et que personne ne semble avoir d\u00e9crit avec pr\u00e9cision? Mr. Justice Stuart remarks in the case of Plante v. Clarke[34], that it has been thought by some that the words \"dernier \u00e9quipeur\" means the person who formerly equipped voyageurs going to the Indian country. That is perfectly correct. The origin of the dernier \u00e9quipeur is purely Canadian. For nearly 150, years he was a most important factor in the trade of Canada. He was no less a personage than the merchant who, in Montreal and elsewhere, had last outfitted on credit the canoes of the voyageurs, coureurs des bois and traiteurs dealing with the Indians of the far west. It was always understood that the suppliers would be paid out of the furs which these adventurers would take down in return for their goods. The voyageurs were not always scrupulous and not un-frequently disposed of their loads on the way down, especially at the posts on the lake of Two Mountains, at Carillon, Oka, Ile sur Tourtes, Ile Perrot, and Ste. Anne's, where a very large trade was illegally carried on at various times during the French r\u00e9gime. (6 Juge et Del. 456; Canadian Archives, Cor. G\u00e9n. XXII. 319.) In such emergency cases, the outfitter could resort to a saisie-arr\u00eat before judgment, even in the hands of third parties. I recognize one of these cases in Perrault's Pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents of the Pr\u00e9vost\u00e9, p. 59, where one d'Ailleboust de Coulonge was allowed to be paid by privilege out of certain furs seized in the hands of a third party. There is another case reported in vol. 5 of the Jugements et Deliberations, pp.927, 930, where a similar provision was made by the Superior Council in favour of Trottier des Ruisseaux, also a merchant and seignior of Ile Perrot.\nIn vol. 3 of La Collection des Manuscrits, p. 171, special mention is made of certain regulations adopted by the Government of Canada against \"les voyageurs et \u00e9quipeurs de Montr\u00e9al\" to prevent them from purchasing in the New England colonies the goods that they require \"pour faire leur traite et, leurs \u00e9quipements.\"\nOn the 14th November, 1685, Governor de Denonville informs the minister in Paris that Berth\u00e9 de Chailly, a notorious merchant of Ste. Anne's, had left the country for France, after having amassed a fortune of 40,000 livres, too often by means of various frauds and especially by intercepting part of the pelleteries of canoes which the voyageur \"devait apporter toutes au marchand qui Va \u00e9quip\u00e9\" (Canadian Archives, Cor. G\u00e9n. VII. 666; VIII. 18).\nThese attachments before judgment were easily obtained. No affidavit was.required and it was sufficient for the plaintiff to mention his indebtedness. In the early days of the colony, it was not even necessary that the title upon which he relied should be authentic. It was sufficient that the debt was claire et liquide and exigible or that the debtor was insolvent. Pigeau, Proc\u00e9dure Civile, Vol. 1, pp. 121, 122, refers to a certain practice which, he says, was sanctioned par Vusage, and often made more easy, even in France, the recourse by saisie-arr\u00eat before judgment, especially in cases of insolvency. Insolvency was almost the normal condition of these voyageurs.\nIn the year 1734, the Superior Council of Quebec put an end to attachments based only upon instruments under hand, and required authentic deeds or an order of the judge authorizing the seizure, \"\u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9.\" (Perrault, Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur, p. 22.)\nThis mode of procedure continued until 1787, when the legislature introduced the English practice by 27 Geo. III., ch. 4, sec. 10, and for the first time required the affidavit which has been de rigueur ever since, except in the case of dernier \u00e9quipeur suivant l'usage du pays. The same enactments have been made by the legislature from time to time, first in the old Revised Statutes of Lower Canada of 1845, next in the Consolidated Statutes of 1860, then in the Code of Civil Procedure of 1867, and finally in the Revised Statutes of Quebec of 1888, and the new Code of Civil Procedure of 1897, which provides, by article 933, for an affidavit disclosing \"the existence of the required indebtedness.\"\nThus it appears that, although the days of canoes and bateaux have gone long ago and new modes of transportation and commerce have been devised, the last \u00e9quipeur is still in the mind of our legislature. Who is he under these recent statutes? He is the butcher, baker, grocer, coal merchant, and other suppliers of necessaries for the voyage. He is exactly what the word implies, what he always has been, that is the last outfitter of a vessel for the purposes of navigation in contemplation. \"Equiper, Equipement, Equipeur\" says Hartfield in his dictionary of the French language,\nc'est pour voir une embarcation de tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour la man\u0153uvre et pour la subsistance des hommes embarqu\u00e9s.\nIn other words, the last \u00e9quipeur is the last outfitter of the vessel, the one who has advanced last. He is not the supplier for the last voyage which he has allowed to terminate without taking any proceedings, he even making fresh advances.\nOur law reports contain many precedents where the exceptional rights of the dernier \u00e9quipeur have been considered. They will be found collected in Martineau\u2019s Code of Procedure, art. 931, pars. 8, 9, 10; art. 955, pars. 6 and following. In this case the affidavit, required in all other cases that the defendant is about to secrete or abscond, etc., is not necessary, for it is sufficient to relate the existence of the required indebtedness, as prescribed by article 933.\nThe court of appeal rejected the contention of the respondents that, as they were not personally liable for the last delivery of coal, their ship' could not be attached in payment of the same under art. 931, C.P.Q. They held that the other defendants were personally liable, and that this was sufficient, as for the time being they were the reputed owners and under article 385, C.C., ships are movable. Chief Justice Lacoste said:\nNous avons ne dette personnelle contract\u00e9e par le locataire, qui est d\u00e9fendeur; ceci satisfait aux exigences de l'article.\nThe only objection the learned judges had as to the issue of the writ of saisie-arr\u00eat under article 931 was that the last \u00e9quipeur has no privilege. With due respect I believe this is a misconception of his position. Whether he has a lien or not, article 931 gives him a remedy which he can exercise, whether finally he is paid his debt or not. He has a right to demand that the vessel or at least the coal be sold in satisfaction of his debt, of course after the payment of the hypothecs and privileged claims. The question of privilege will present itself after the sale, at the time of. the distribution of the moneys. Is he dernier \u00e9quipeur? That is the whole question. Every privileged creditor on a vessel, even a sailor, is not entitled to a saisie-arr\u00eat under article 931; he must be dernier \u00e9quipeur, as was decided by several learned judges familiar with ancient practice. Delisle v. L\u00e9cuyer[35], decided by Berthelot, Mackay and Torrance JJ. and Dagenais v. Douglas[36], decided by Mondelet, Mackay and Caron, JJ.\nBut is it so clear that the dernier \u00e9quipeur has no lien or privilege? He may have none under article 2383, C.C., although the point is not very clear in face of par. 3. But is it necessary to go that far? Is he not entitled to a privilege under the ordinance of 1881, liv. 1, tit. XIV., which was law before the Code?\nCeux qui auront pr\u00eate pour radoub, victuailles et \u00e9quipement avant le d\u00e9part.\nCan a privilege exist without express language? Can it be created by implication? Under articles 191 and 192 of the French Code of Commerce, the negative seems to be the prevailing doctrine. See B\u00e9darride, 1 Dr. Mar. nn. 51, 52, 53. But are they not more restrictive than the ordinance liv. 1, tit. XIV., arts. 16 and 17, or the Quebec Code, articles 2383 to 2386? The latter article refers to\nother privileged debts, according to the circumstances under which the claim has arisen and the usage of trade.\nThe old French jurisprudence was well settled that the ordinance was not exclusive and that the privileges of the common law continued to exist, when not inconsistent. Em\u00e9rigon in his treatise Assurances et Contrats \u00e0 la grosse, observes, p. 571:\nL'ordonnance, art. 16, titre de la saisie, place au troisi\u00e8me rang ceux qui auront pr\u00eat\u00e9 pour radoub, victuailles ou \u00e9quipement avant le d\u00e9part.\nEn 1755, je fus consult\u00e9 si le rang devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 pour bois et cordages fournis au navire avant le d\u00e9part. Je r\u00e9pondis qu'oui; car peu importe qu'on ait prete de l'argent ou qu'on ait fourni les mat\u00e9riaux, Le cas du fournisseur a m\u00eame quelque chose de plus favorable, puisque les fournisseurs ne sont pas \u00e9quivoques; au. lieu que Futile emploi des deniers est toujours susceptible de quelque doute. Cette interpr\u00e9tation non est extensiva, sed intellectiva. Telle est notre jurisprudence.\nValin, who wrote his commentaries in 1760, mentions (page 400) necessary equipments of the ship made before her departure on any voyage.\nLes fournisseurs des bois, des planches et du fer qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s; les fournisseurs de voiles et de cordages, et g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de tout ce qui a servi \u00e0 mettre le navire en \u00e9tat de faire le voyage,\nAt page 443, Valin goes as far as to lay down the principle that provisions and equipments ordered by the captain at the domicile of the owners, although prohibited without special authority, should be paid if they were necessary, quoting the maxim of the ordinance de Wisbuy, generally followed by all maritime nations, article 65, memo debet locupletari cum alterius jactura. Such is also the opinion of Boulay- P\u00e2ty, 2 Dr. Mar. 52. It must be so especially in the present case with regard to the second item of the supply of coal, as it profited the real owners who took possession of it and consumed the same.\nGranting that the privileges upon ships are limited to the cases expressly provided for in article 2383 C.C., and I must confess that this contention has a great deal of force, is it indispensable for the appellants to rely upon it? Upon what ground can it be said that they have no privilege upon the very coal they sold and seized in this cause with the ship as one of her accessories? Mr. Macmaster K.C, for the respondents, admitted, as already observed, that they were entitled to revendicate the same. But if they can revendicate, surely they can be paid by privilege. As I read articles 1998, 1999 and 2000 of the Civil Code, the unpaid vendor has two privileged rights: (1) A right to revendicate; (2) A right of preference upon the price or the proceeds. Article 1994, par. 3, likewise provides for a privilege upon the article sold.\nThe appellants have, therefore, an ordinary privilege for the last delivery upon the coal which, I believe, they can enforce by saisie-arr\u00eat under article 931 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as being derniers \u00e9quipeurs. The debt is personal to the charterers, and I cannot understand why the appellants cannot proceed by attachment upon the coal under article 931, for they are derniers \u00e9quipeurs and the coal seized in this case is the property of the personal debtor. In any event, they had a right to a saisie-conservatoire under article 955.\nFor all these reasons, I am satisfied that the judgment of the trial judge was the only one that could be rendered. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and maintain the saisie-arr\u00eat and saisie-conservatoire and the action of the appellants with costs before all the courts.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action begun by the appellant company in Montreal against three defend- ants: The Canadian Lines, Ltd.; William Peterson, Ltd.; and Elder, Dempster & Co., the respondents, to recover the price of certain quantities of coal delivered at different times aboard the SS. \"Lake Simcoe\" while in Montreal. The action was accompanied by a seizure of the steamship for the amount sued for on the grounds that with respect to $4,940 of the claim, article 2383 of the Civil Code created a privilege or lien upon the vessel for the payment of same as a sum due \"for furnishing the ship on her last voyage\" and with respect to $1,082.77, that the appellant was the dernier \u00e9quipeur referred to in article 931 C.C.P., and as such entitled to recover for this latter sum, although the coal supplied was not for the \"last voyage\" of the ship, but for her then ensuing voyage.\nThe Canadian Lines, Ltd., and Wm. Peterson, Ltd., entered no defence to the action, and judgment went against them by default. Elder, Dempster & Co., the owners of the ship, alone contested the action, and the Superior Court held that although they were not personally liable for the coal, the ship was liable and its seizure legal.\nThe Court of King's Bench unanimously reversed this judgment, holding that the first quantity of coal delivered to the ship was not for her \"last voyage\" within the meaning of that phrase in article 2383 C.C., and that for the second quantity delivered, it was avowedly for an ensuing and not a last voyage, and for coal so supplied there was no lien or privilege.\nThe facts necessary to be ascertained for the solution of the questions in dispute are few and about them there is no serious dispute, but there is much controversy as to the conclusions to be drawn from these facts.\nThe SS. \"Lake Simcoe\" is a British ship owned by the Elder, Dempster Co., and registered in England.\nShe was chartered by her owners to the defendants, Wm. Peterson, Ltd., of Newcastle-on-Tyne, on the 10th day of June, 1904,\nfor six months from the 16th of June, 1904, for voyages from and between Rotterdam, Havre or Dunkirk and Canadian ports, Quebec or Montreal,\nand it was provided that under no circumstances should the steamer sail from or to or touch at any port in the United Kingdom or be employed in trading between any United Kingdom ports and Canada. Further it was provided that the hirers should bear all expenses in connection with the navigation and upkeep of the vessel and\nprovide coal stoves, emigrant outfits, and captain, officers and necessary crew, who should be their servants and bear all expenses in connection with the steamer from the time of delivery\nuntil re-delivery to owners.\nPart of the consideration payable by the hirers to the owners was to be\na sum equal to one-half of the profits accruing from the working of the vessel as provided in the charter-party.\nIt was argued in the courts below that this provision constituted the owners partners with the hirers, but the contention was, I think properly, not sustained, and it was not very strongly pressed before us.\nThe last clause provides that the contract \"should be governed solely by the law of England,\" but this, of course, can have no application to the plaintiffs if their contentions with respect to the meaning and application of the articles of the Code are correct.\nAfter the charter party was entered into the SS. \"Lake Simcoe\" was delivered to Peterson & Co., and proceeded from Birkenhead to Rotterdam, at which latter place, from which according to the charter party her voyages were to start, she loaded and sailed on her first voyage to Montreal, touching at Havre and Quebec. While at Montreal she unloaded and reloaded, and on the 29th July, 1904, took in a quantity of coal as supplies for her voyage from Montreal back to Rotterdam.\nThis coal was ordered by Thomas Harling, the agent in Montreal, of Wm. Peterson, Ltd., and the Canadian Lines, Ltd., which latter company was practically Peterson, Ltd., under another name. It is quite clear beyond any controversy that there is was no personal liability attaching to the defendants, Elder, Dempster & Co., with respect to this coal, and both courts below have so held.\nThe captain of the ship had nothing to do with the contract of purchase. The sale was made by the plaintiffs to the Canadian Lines, Ltd., acting by their agent in Montreal, Thomas Harling, to whom the plaintiffs in due course rendered its account for the coal; and a draft was drawn by the appellants at Harling's request for the amount of the account upon William Peterson, Ltd., for acceptance, and was duly accepted by that firm on 10th August following.\nOn the 20th September, William Peterson, Ltd., suspended payment, and on the 23rd September the draft was presented for payment and was refused. Two days afterwards the ship, still being under charter as stated before, was seized in Montreal, where at the time she happened to be loading for what the respondents call her fourth voyage, under an attachment for the price of the coal, $4,490, and also for the price of another lot of coal sold on the 6th September by the plaintiffs to Harling as agent of the Canadian Lines, Ltd., for the said SS. \"Lake Simcoe,\" and about that day delivered aboard of such ship for her use, amounting to $1,082.77.\nThe facts with reference to the sale of the latter lot of coal were substantially the same as the former, with the exception that no draft was drawn upon Peterson & Co., Ltd., for the amount, and that it was not contended that the voyage for which it was supplied was the last voyage on the ship within article 2383 of the Code.\nIn each case the coal was sold by the plaintiffs to Harling as the agent of the Canadian Lines, Ltd., and Peterson, Ltd., without the intervention or knowledge of the captain, and there is no pretence of personal liability therefor on the part of the defendants, Elder, Dempster & Co., nor was their agent in Montreal ever communicated with on the subject of the sale and delivery of either lot of coal.\nImmediately after the sale of the first lot of coal, in July, and its delivery aboard the SS. \"Lake Simcoe,\" the steamer being re-loaded sailed for Rotterdam, calling at Quebec and Havre, on what the respondents call her second voyage.\nAt Rotterdam she again re-loaded and sailed back to Montreal on what is called by the respondents her third voyage, and it was while at the latter port on the 6th of September, 1904, and while outfitting and loading for what respondents call her fourth voyage that she took on the second quantity of coal, $1,082.77, which forms part of the amount sued for and for which the steamer was seized.\nPeterson & Co. did not suspend payment until about a fortnight after the delivery aboard of this second lot of coal, namely, on the 20th September. The seizure was made on the 26th September.\nThere does not appear to be or to have been any pretence of a revendication of this latter lot of coal, and the only question as it seems to me which can arise upon the record as to this second lot is whether the Code in any of its articles provides in express terms for a privilege or lien upon the ship seized for the price of this lot of coal, and if not whether the seizure can be maintained as to it under the article 931 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nI fully concur in the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, that no such privilege or lien is given expressly. Article 2383 of the Civil Code on which the plaintiffs rely to sustain their seizure for the price of the first lot of coal delivered, $4,951.29, clearly and admittedly does not cover the second lot delivered in September, which was delivered not for the last voyage, but for a future and ensuing voyage, and article 931 of the Code of Civil Procedure only provides and is intended to provide a remedy for an existing right and not to create a right itself unless indeed in the . special contingencies and with respect to the special persons and properties specified in the article. It only applies to a case as expressed in the article\nwherein the defendant is personally indebted to the plaintiff in a sum exceeding five dollars,\nand then only where one or other of the several contingencies specified in the sections of the article have arisen, such as in the case of a dernier \u00e9quipeur where a debtor absconds with intent to defraud creditors, etc., or secretes, or makes away with property with intent, etc., or being a trader, ceases to make payments and refuses an abandonment of property to creditors, etc.\nThe article could not, in my opinion, be successfully invoked in such a case as the present where there neither was any personal liability of the contesting debtor whose property has been seized, nor where any one of the contingencies which justify the invocation of the article by the dernier \u00ebquipeur can be said to have existed.\nThe right of the plaintiff to attach the ship for the price of the first lot of coal supplied in July, $4,951.29, depends entirely upon the true construction of the words \"last voyage\" in sub-section 5 of article 2383 of the Civil Code of Quebec, and to succeed he must shew that the voyage for which such coal was supplied on the 29th July, 1904, from Montreal to Rotterdam. was the \"last voyage\" of the steamer within the meaning of that phrase in the 5th sub-section of the article. In my view in order to reach a proper conclusion as to the meaning of the much-disputed phrase \"last voyage\" the article must be read and construed as a whole, and therefore I find it necessary to set it out fully. It reads as follows:\n2383. There is a privilege upon vessels for the payment of the following debts:\u2014\n1. The costs of seizure and sale, according to article 1995;\n2. Pilotage, wharfage, and harbour dues, and penalties for the infraction of lawful regulations;\n3. The expense of keeping the vessel and rigging, and of repairing the latter since the last voyage;\n4. The wages of the master and crew for the last voyage;\n5. The sums due for repairing and furnishing the ship on her last voyage, and for merchandise sold by the captain for the same purpose.\n6. Hypothecations upon the ship, according to the rules declared in the third chapter of this title and in the title of Bottomry and Respondentia.\n7. Premiums of insurance upon the ship for the last voyage;\n8. Damages due to freighters for not delivering the goods shipped by them, and in reimbursement for injury caused to such goods by the fault of the master or crew;\nIf the ship sold have not yet made a voyage, the seller, the workman employed in building and completing her, and the persons by whom the materials have been furnished, are paid by reference to all creditors, except those for debts enumerated in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nNo contention has been made before us as to whether this article of the Code applies at all to British registered ships or to foreign ships in the Province of Quebec, nor is it necessary, in the view I take of the case, to express any opinion whatever upon the point. If it became necessary it is obvious that articles 2355 and 2374 C.C. would have to be carefully considered together and in conjunction with the power of the legislature which, enacted the Code, and I would not desire to be understood as expressing any opinion whatever upon the points.\nThe submission of the plaintiffs as I understand is that the SS. \"Lake Simcoe\" was engaged in making round voyages and that the starting point of such round voyages was Montreal. That the first round voyage was from Montreal to Rotterdam and back, touching both ways at Quebec and Havre, and that in this view the delivery of the lot of coal in Montreal in July was a delivery on a part of that round voyage, which would be the \"last voyage\" of the steamer within the meaning of the article in question before the seizure took place, the next and subsequent round voyage when the steamer was seized in Montreal in September being about to commence from that port at the time of seizure. This view has the inherent defect of entirely ignoring the first voyage of the steamer from Rotterdam to Montreal and the designation of the former port as the starting point of the steamer's voyages under her charter. The alternative view presented was that even if the round voyage be determined to have begun in Rotterdam in July, it meant a voyage from Rotterdam to Montreal and back to Rotterdam, and that the coal was delivered in Montreal during the course of and to complete that round voyage in July and August, and that this round voyage would therefore be the \"last voyage\" of the steamer before the seizure, within article 2383 CO., such seizure having been made during the progress of the second round voyage of the ship in September.\nThe defendants on the other hand contend that each trip of the steamer was a complete and separate adventure; that neither Rotterdam nor Montreal was the ship's home port, she being a British registered ship; that each trip the vessel made from Europe to Canada and Canada to Europe she discharged her cargo on arrival at her destined port and took a new cargo aboard for another voyage, and that each trip was complete in itself and constituted a voyage; that the coal supplied in July, in dispute, was for the steamer's second voyage, so that the second voyage could not be called in any sense, after she had completed her third voyage, the \"last voyage\" of the article of the Code.\nThey contended that the \"last voyage\" of the article unless otherwise defined, must mean the last complete transit of the ship from the shipping port to the port of delivery, and if the supplies were not paid for at the port of outfitting and furnishing, the supplier might follow the ship and attach her at her journey's end, and that with the argument as to convenience we have nothing to do. They also contended that the fact of the Canadian Lines, Ltd., having advertised in Montreal to carry passengers from Montreal to Havre and Rotterdam at certain specified fares and \"return fare double above rates less 10%\" was a mere incident which could not control or override the purpose and object of the hirers of the ship as evidenced by the broad facts to be drawn from the charter party and the actual sailings and loadings, ownership and chartering of the ship.\nNo evidence appears to have been given of the hiring of the crew whether for the single trip or voyage or the round trip or voyage, or for the time, six months, of the hiring of the ship under the charter party.\nI attach little importance to the advertisement offering a holiday round trip from Montreal to Havre and Rotterdam and back as determining whether each trip was a voyage in itself or as transferring the starting point from Rotterdam to Montreal; nor do I think that there is any evidence in the case to justify us in holding that the round trip theory should prevail.\nIf one desired evidence of facts from which a conclusion might be drawn that the round trip theory was the correct one he would have to go outside of the record. Neither Rotterdam nor Montreal was her home port from which the steamer was sailing to a foreign port, and as I have said there was no evidence as to the hiring of the crew of the ship whether it was from Birkenhead where she was by the terms of the charter party received by Peterson, Ltd., from respondents, or from Rotterdam or from Montreal, or whether for a specified time or for a specified voyage. All we know is that the ship carried cargoes between each of the latter ports on each trip she made between them, and that there does not seem to have been any necessary relation between these trips as adventures. They were not the same kind of trips or voyages as are made by such of the regular transatlantic lines of steamers as sail from their home ports in either Europe or America across the Atlantic and back with crews hired for the round trip.\nApplying as far as applicable the principles for the determination of the question of fact stated by the Lord Chancellor Lord Loreburn in the late ease in the House of Lords of Board of Trade v. Baxter; The \"Scarsdale\"[37], at page 378, I have concluded that under the evidence in this case each trip of the steamer beginning at Rotterdam when and from which port she first started to Montreal, and from Montreal back again, constituted a voyage, and that in this view of the case the plaintiffs must fail because the trip or voyage for which the coal in dispute was supplied could not with reference to the seizure be in any sense the last voyage of the ship.\nBut if I am wrong in this conclusion of fact and the voyages of the ship are held to be round voyages, they must, in my opinion, be held to start from Rotterdam and end there, and in my judgment the last voyage contemplated in the article 2383 is a voyage ending in a port of the Province of Quebec. Whether the article must be construed as applying simply to home registered ships or not I pass by as not being argued and not necessary for decision.\nI think each sub-section of the article in question shews that it is intended to refer to a voyage home to Quebec, to the ship's home port, either in the sense of registry there or ownership there or completing and ending her adventure there. I think when we find the same phrase used and repeated so often in the different sub-sections of the article we must ascribe to the legislature an intention of having the same meaning in each sub-section with reference to it, unless the context shews the contrary to be the case.\nNow let us analyze the article a little closely. Its object is to give a preference upon vessels for the payment of certain specified debts; in other words, to create a new maritime lien. It provides that after the costs of seizure there shall be a privilege for the payment of pilotage, wharfage, harbour dues, etc., debts obviously of a local character, but without any limitations beyond that as to voyages or otherwise; (2) expenses of keeping the vessel and rigging and of repairing the latter since the last voyage. To my mind the subject matter dealt with and the language used in this sub-section shews that it was intended to relate to the close of an adventure in some Quebec port after a trip or trips abroad or to other Quebec ports. It covers unstripping the vessel, docking and. laying her up for repairs or otherwise, men in charge, machinery or rigging, repairs, etc., etc. I should conclude that the phrase \"last voyage\" as there used can only have one relation and that is to a voyage, whether round or single, ending in some port in Quebec province. So in sub-section 4 with regard to the wages of the master and crew, I draw the same conclusion. The voyage, the adventure, is over and ended, the ship is in the province and the wages of the men who brought her home is made a privileged debt. So I would agree it might reasonably be held with regard to premiums of insurance which are limited to those paid for the \"last voyage\" a reasonable and necessary expenditure to get the vessel to her home port and so privileged. So again with regard to hypothecations which it will be seen are to be according to the rules declared in the third chapter of that part of the Code relating to merchant shipping and do not contemplate registered British ships which; by article 2374 C.C. are to be governed in such matters by\nthe provisions contained in the Imperial law respecting merchant shipping.\nAnd so I conclude the last voyage in the sub-section 5 means the voyage home to Quebec, and gives the material and necessaries man who repairs or supplies the ship with necessaries to complete her voyage, to close her adventure, whatever it may have been, by returning to her home port in Quebec a preference on the ship for such necessary repairs or supplies. The latter part of sub-section 5 strengthens this argument. It provides for the cases where the master has to sell part of his freight or merchandise to raise money to enable his ship to complete her last voyage which I conclude must mean her voyage to her home port in Quebec and the merchant or freighter whose goods are so sold for such a necessary purpose has the privilege created for their value because the sale was for the necessary purpose of bringing home the ship. I cannot place a different meaning on the same phrase the \"last voyage\" used in the several sub-sections. I think the meaning I suggest is the true one. The argument that the article is applicable only to Quebec registered ships has additional strength given to it by the latter part of sub-section 8, which has exclusive reference to ships built in the province, and which have not yet made a voyage.\nThe article was not enacted as was argued and assumed by appellants for the benefit of the material or necessaries man in the ports of Montreal or Quebec so as to give him a privilege or lien for supplies furnished to ships leaving those ports. I reason so not only because of its express limitations, but also because its main purport and object seems to have been to provide such security for the material and necessaries man in a foreign port as would induce him to furnish the supplies required by the ship to reach her home port in Quebec. To what extent this legislation, if it means what I think it does, may be beyond the legislative powers of the legislature that enacted it I do not stop to inquire. The question was not mooted or argued at bar, and its consideration is not necessary in the view I have taken of the facts.\nSome suggestions were made as to the hardships such a construction as I suggest would make for the material and necessaries man in the Quebec ports. But apart from these suggested hardships which should not in any case be allowed to govern the construction of a statute, and which in my judgment are more figments of the imagination than business realir ties (because the material man is not obliged to give credit and in doing so to ship-owners or charterers does so on the same principles as he acts on in his general dealings, that is, gives credit when he thinks it safe to do so and withholds it when he does not), I do not think the construction of the language of the article justifies its application to ordinary trading ships leaving Quebec ports and the voyages of which could not in most cases be known to the supplier whether as last voyages or ensuing voyages or round voyages or single voyages.\nThe sole and only question is whether with reference to this British registered ship trading under such a charter-party as we have here from Rotterdam ta Montreal, supplies furnished in the latter city to the agent of the charterer or hirer of the ship for the uses and purposes of the ship, but for which the ship-owner was in no way personally responsible, can be held to be within sub-section 5 of article 2383 of the Civil Code, and create a preference upon the ship itself so as to enable the material man or supplier to seize and sell it for the cost or value of the supplies on the ground that they were \"for the furnishing of the ship for the last voyage.\"\nI would dismiss this appeal and confirm the judgment below on the grounds, first, that each trip of the steamer across the Atlantic in the circumstances of this case constituted a voyage in itself which view, if correct, of course disposes of plaintiffs' action; and, secondly, if I am wrong in that, and whether or not the article of the Code in question extends to ships other than those registered in the Province of Quebec, that it does not cover the particular voyage of this ship for which the coal delivered in July and sued for in this action was furnished, a voyage either round or single ending in Rotterdam.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was brought by appellants in the Superior Court of Quebec against the Canadian Lines, Ltd., William Peterson, Limited, and Sir Alfred Jones and William John Davey, to recover the price of coal sold to them, it is claimed, and delivered at the port of Montreal on the \"Lake Simcoe\" on two different occasions for use in navigating that ' vessel.\nThe first delivery was on the 29th July, 1904, and the price was $4,940. The second was on or about the 6th and 7th September, 1904, and the price was $1,082.77. The orders therefor in each case were given by one Harling, the agent, at said port, of the William Peterson, Limited.\nThe master of the ship had nothing to do with ordering any of the coal, or so far as I can see in any way relative to it, beyond receiving and certifying to the quantity received on each occasion.\nThe ship was registered at Liverpool and belonged to the firm called \"The Elder, Dempster & Company,\" which was composed of defendants Jones & Davey.\nBy a time charter these owners let the ship to the defendants William Peterson, Limited, for the period of six months from the 10th of June, 1904,\nfor voyages from and between Rotterdam, Havre or Dunkirk and Canadian ports. The second clause of the charter party is as follows:\nThe hirers shall purchase any coal and consumable stores now on board at current rates and shall bear all expenses in connection with' the navigation and upkeep of the vessel and shall provide coal, stores, emigrant outfits and shall provide captain, officers and necessary crew who shall be the servants of the hirers and shall bear all expenses in connection with the steamer from the time of delivery until the re-delivery of the steamer to the owners as aforesaid.\nClauses 3 and 4 thereof provided that the hirers pay cost of insurance and seven per cent. per annum upon \u00a340,000 from time of delivery to re-delivery or sale, in case they exercised the option given them to buy her.\nClause 5 provides that\nthe hirers, as further consideration for the hire of the steamer, shall pay to the owners a sum equal to one-half of the profits which shall accrue from the working of the vessel during each whole or part voyage during the time of hire,\nand describes the charges to be considered in arriving at such profits.\nClause 7 provided if any voyage should result in a loss the owners should be under no liability in respect thereof.\nClause 11 provided that this contract should be governed solely by the law of England.\nThe appellants seek, notwithstanding the foregoing condition of things, to render the said sum of $ 4,940 a charge upon the vessel which was seized at the commencement of the action in the port of Montreal. Article 2383 of the Civil Code of Quebec province is invoked to maintain this claim.\nThen the second claim of $1,082.77 is rested upon article 931 of the Code of Procedure.\nThe appellants also sought to rest their claims on the ground that by reason of the provision I have quoted for sharing profits there was a partnership between the owners and the charterers that rendered the former liable for the debts thus incurred by the latter.\nI cannot find under the terms of this charter-party, when looked at as a whole, that such partnership existed. I will deal with other aspects of this profit sharing clause hereafter.\nThere may be cases to which the respective provisions of these articles in these several Codes above referred to will apply.\nWherever one has supplied coal to a ship pursuant to the order of the ship owner, or one authorized to bind him, such provision might properly so bind the owner and ship as to enable the court of a province where the coal was thus ordered and supplied to seize and, if need be, sell the ship so supplied to satisfy the demand for payment.\nBut what authority had any one Here concerned to bind the respondents, the ship owners?\nThe master in charge was not the owner nor in the employment of the owner at all. And, as already shewn, none of the orders were given by him and he only with the engineer certified to the weights being correct.\nThen Mr. Harling, who gave the orders had no relation whatever to or with the owners. Clearly, I should infer every one knew at that port, where the orders were given, that he represented only William Peterson, Limited, or their creation, if I might say so, and ally, the Canadian Lines, Limited, but in no way the Elder, Dempster Co., who had in that very port their own offices and agents who never were, but should have been, asked or consulted if it ever had been intended to bind their company. Then, at the suggestion of Mr. Harling, a draft was drawn for the amount of the account arising from the first transaction upon William Peterson Co., Limited. I do not say this necessarily waived any right to charge the party properly chargeable with the price of the coal, but I do think it an important fact for consideration in relation to the question of knowledge that the ship was then under charter-party to the William Peterson Co., Limited.\nWith such knowledge of that fact on the part of appellants, of which evidence meets one at every turn, in considering the cardinal features of the case it would seem quite impossible to suppose that the appellants imagined they were selling on the credit of the owners of the ship or to any one at all authorized to bind the ship itself by any lien or charge.\nThe master, even if representing directly the owner, has no power to create such a lien. True, the owners being rendered liable in such a case, the court of admiralty may get possession of the ship, and enforce, by sale of the ship if need be, its judgment for the debt thus created.\nThis case is not within the range of operation of any such principle of law, or of any other principle of law, that would imply the right in any one concerned, in acting here, to bind, on these facts, the ship, or the owners thereof. The form of invoice gives the transaction no greater force.\nAll the rights springing from article 2383 of the Code in a proper case, have no foundation in fact to rest upon here.\nI do not see, therefore, that I am called upon to interpret that article of the Code, so as to determine exactly what the phrase \"last voyage\" occurring therein may mean. To reach, by said article of the Code, such results as claimed here it seems to me necessary to refrain from looking at anything else in the case and hold that a ship owner may by virtue of said article lose his ship by acts not his own directly or indirectly, but of some one acting without his authority. Maritime liens may arise out of wholly unauthorized acts. This claim is not founded on one of such maritime liens. Nor does the article create a lien. Nor did the law on which it was founded contemplate doing so in that sense. Can it be said that the privilege could be enforced in an English court in Liverpool as a maritime lien could be? Article 1983 of the Code defines what is meant by it in using the word privilege.\nThe English law would probably have as the law of the flag of the ship governed the limits of authority. See Lloyd v. Guibert[38]. But we are not left to guess at the intention of the parties in that regard.\nIt is by the clause 11 referred to above put beyond dispute, that only by the law of England are we to find the authority for binding this ship.\nThe fact that the owners had a right to a share of the profits in addition to the sum or percentage fixed for compensation has given me a good deal of concern. In some cases the owner's interest that the ship should sail and earn profits has been found a determining factor in implying an authority in the master to bind the owner.\nBut on the whole case and including all the terms of agreement, and especially seeing the master was not he who ordered, or was employed by the owner, I do not think that the matter of right to profits without any correlative obligation as to losses can out- weigh all else. I have not been able to find an exactly similar case.\nOnly one thing remains, and that is the extent of the rights, if any, of the dernier \u00e9quipeur under article 931 of the Code of Procedure, and the features of that claim of the appellants which may distinguish it from all else I have said relative to facts common to both items claimed.\nThere is no right that can be claimed as of privilege or lien for such account, but there is a right given to stop the vessel and all therein when necessary to secure a debt properly incurred for equipment. It must, however, be a debt due from the defendant to the plaintiff.\nThat herein, not existing when the proceedings were taken, can any after ratification or adoption make it such a debt? A good deal may be said in favour of the proposition that the respondents, the Elder, Dempster Company, adopted this last order and liability thereon as theirs.\nCan the owners come in and say as they did here, give us our vessel and we undertake to return it, if it be adjudged we are liable, and by that means carry away the coal just delivered and use it and profit by it and then repudiate all liability for it?\nI fear these acts cannot in this action at all events The held to shew a ratification or adoption and in either case a relation back that would bind.\nI regret to find a most righteous claim for the coal with which the vessel steamed away from port by virtue of the respondents' bail cannot, in this case, at least, be recovered from them.\nI am compelled to hold the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Maclennan J.\u2014The questions in this appeal relate to a steamship called the \"Lake Simcoe,\" of British register, seized in the month of September, 1904, at the port of Montreal, under process for the enforcement of a privilege, claimed by the appellants upon the vessel, for coal supplied by them to the ship while lying in the port of Montreal.\nThe respondents, Sir Alfred Lewis Jones and William John Davey, carry on business as ship-owners in England and in Montreal, under the name and firm of Elder, Dempster & Co., and being the owners of the \"Lake Simcoe,\" they on the 10th June, 1904, chartered her as she then lay at the port of Liverpool, to persons by the name of William Peterson, Limited, for six months from the sixteenth of June, 1904, for voyages from and between Rotterdam, Havre or Dunkirk and Canadian ports, Quebec and or, Montreal. But the ship was under no circumstances to sail from or to or touch at, any port in the United Kingdom, and not, directly or indirectly, to be used or employed in trading between any United Kingdom ports and Canada.\nThe ship commenced the voyages between the named European ports and Canada, which were contemplated by the charter-party; and on pr about the first day of August, 1904, was lying in the port of Montreal; and the charterers on that day obtained from the appellants a supply of coal for the use of the ship, amounting; to the sum of $ 4,951.29.\nThe ship afterwards sailed to Europe, and returned to Montreal; and on or about the 6th September, 1904, obtained a further supply of coal from the appellants of the value of $1,082.77. The charterers soon afterwards became insolvent, and default having been made in payment of both supplies of coal, and of the obligations given therefor, the ship was arrested by way of privilege for both supplies, and the question in the appeal is whether the arrest of the ship can be maintained against the owners for both or either of the supplies.\nThe learned trial judge upheld the claim of the plaintiffs against the ship for both supplies; but his judgment was reversed on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, so far as it maintained the seizure and directed a sale of the ship to satisfy the plaintiffs' claims.\nThe two claims are rested upon different articles of the Code, and I shall first consider the second supply.\nThis claim depends upon article 931 of the Code of Procedure, and article 2391 of the Civil Code.\nArticle 931 enables a creditor, in certain specified circumstances, to attach the goods of his debtor in any case wherein the defendant is personally indebted to the plaintiff in a sum exceeding five dollars. But there is nothing in the article which warrants the attachment of property, such as the ship in the present case, which is not the property of the debtor, or the attachment of one man's goods for another man's debt. Jones & Co. were not the plaintiffs' debtors, and they were the owners of the ship. Peterson & Co. alone were the debtors, and they were only the charterers of the ship, and not the owners.\nBut it was urged that article 2391, C.C., made, Peterson & Co. the owners for the purposes of the attachment, because it declares that a charterer such as they were, is held to be the owner,\nwith the rights and liabilities of an owner as respects third persons. But that is very far from declaring that the charterer may charge the ship with his debts or liabilities. It is the rights and liabilities of the charterer which this article is dealing with and defining, not those of the owner. I think this article means only that the charterer may not escape liability for his engagements with third parties, in the management of the ship under his charter, by saying that he is not the owner.\nI also think that article 2397 CC., is a difficulty in the way of the appellants, for the owners of the ship were present at the port of Montreal, by agents who represented them, and it is not pretended that they authorized the purchase of the coal in question.\nI am therefore clearly of opinion that the judgment is right with respect to the second supply of coal, and should be maintained.\nThe question of the first supply is one of greater difficulty.\nArticle 2383 C.C declares that there is a privilege upon vessels for payment of the following debts:\n1 The costs of seizure and sale, according to article 1995;\n2 Pilotage, wharfage and harbour dues, and penalties for the infraction of lawful harbour regulations;\n3 The expenses of keeping the vessel and riging and of repairing the latter since the last voyage;\n4 The wages of the master and crew for the last voyage;\n5 The sums due for repairing and furnishing the ship on her last voyage, and for merchandise sold by the captain for the same purpose; 7 Premiums of insurance upon the ship for the last voyage.\nThere are other two sub-sections (6) and (8), but they afford no assistance with reference, to the present claim. The important sub-section is No. 5, and the question is whether the first supply of coal was furnished to the ship, pour son dernier voyage, as expressed in the French version, or on her last voyage, as expressed in the English version.\nThe coal was supplied at the request of the charterers while the ship was lying in the port of Montreal, after which she proceeded to sea, sailed to a European port, and then returned to Montreal, when the seizure was effected.\nThe question to be decided is: Was the coal supplied on or for the ship's last voyage? In other words what is the meaning of the words last voyage, as used in sub-section 5?\nThe meaning of the word \"voyage\" when applied to a ship, depends, in any particular case, on the employment in which the ship is engaged. If a ship of war, or other ship, is sent on a particular expedition, her voyage would generally include her return home, as a voyage of convoy, or of exploration or discovery, such as the voyages of Columbus, Captain Cook, Jacques Cartier, and other famous explorers.\nIt is otherwise in the case of the great Atlantic passenger steamships. In their case I think speaking generally, each passage across the sea is a voyage; and I think the same is true of ships like that in question, for their business is similar to that of the great liners, namely, the carrying of passengers and cargoes across the sea, and loading and discharging on both sides. The ship in question was chartered in Liverpool, where she was then lying, expressly for voyages between certain named European ports and Canada; and she was to be delivered to her owners, when the charter expired, either at Liverpool, or in some continental port at the option of her owners.\nThe ship's first voyage began in Europe, and her last voyage was to end there, whether the voyages were to be regarded as round voyages, that is including the crossing of the ocean and return, or whether each passage across the ocean was a separate voyage. If they are to be regarded as round voyages, then the appellants ought to succeed, for in that view the first coal was supplied in the middle of a voyage, and the seizure was made in the middle of the next voyage, and while it was still incomplete.\nThe same conclusion follows if the voyages are to be regarded as round voyages, even if we suppose them to have commenced in the port of Montreal.\nBut if each passage across the ocean is to be regarded as a voyage, within the meaning of the subsection, then the coal was not supplied on or for the last voyage, for, on that construction, she would have made a complete voyage between that for which she received the coal and her seizure.\nI am of opinion that the fair and obvious meaning of the word \"voyage,\" as applied to this ship, having regard to her charter and her employment, and to the ordinary and common use and understanding of the word, is a single passage across the ocean; and that the ship having made two voyages across the sea between the supply of coal and the seizure, the sub-section 5 of the article is inapplicable, and the seizure cannot be maintained. I am further of opinion that the same conclusion follows from an attentive consideration of sub-section 5 itself.\nIt provides a remedy for supplies and repairs obtained for the ship in two ways, namely, first, on credit, and secondly, by the sale of cargo by the captain in case of necessity, as authorized by article 2399 of the Civil Code. The voyage referred to in the sub-section must be the same voyage with reference to both kinds of debt, that is the debt for supplies and repairs obtained on credit, and those obtained, by sale of cargo. The extreme act of selling merchandise for repairs or furnishings could not lawfully be resorted to by the captain either at the loading port, before sailing, or at the port of discharge after arrival. The sale which he is authorized to make must be one made in the course of his voyage, at some way port of call, between the time of loading and the time of unloading; and by reason of necessity, to enable him to complete his voyage. When, upon the arrival of the ship at the port of discharge, the owner or consignee of the cargo, or any part of it, goes to the ship for his goods, and finds that they have been sold by the captain, he has a privilege upon the ship by virtue of the sub-section. The conclusion is, therefore, plain that the word voyage, used in the subjection, means a voyage between the port where the ship has been loaded, and the port of discharge, that is, in the present case, each separate passage across the sea.\nThat being so, the seizure for the first supply of coal was too late, and was unauthorized, as the coal was not supplied either on or for the last voyage.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal fails and ought to be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The facts in evidence in this case do not, I think, afford any satisfactory reason for holding a passage of the respondents' ship from Rotterdam to Montreal or a passage from Montreal to Rotterdam to be other than that which in the ordinary sense of the words it would seem to be\u2014a single complete voyage. Neither do I see anything in article 2383 of the Civil Code, which we are called upon to apply, justifying the view that a given voyage can be regarded as the \"last voyage\" within the meaning of the article if it be not the \"last voyage\" in fact.\nIt follows in the view I have indicated\u2014since between the complete voyage from Montreal to Rotterdam and the proceedings to enforce the appellant's claim there intervened a complete voyage from Rotterdam to Montreal\u2014that a debt incurred in respect of supplies furnished for the first of these voyages alone cannot be made a foundation for a valid claim of privilege under the paragraph 5 referred to; and that part of the appellants' claim which is based upon such a debt must consequently fail.\nWith respect to that part of the claim which is based upon the second supply of coal\u2014upon that also I think the appellants fail, for the reasons given by my brother Maclennan.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McGibbon, Casgrain,Mitchell & Surveyer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: MacMaster, Hickson & Campbell.\n[1] Q.R. 16 K.B. 16; sub nom.

It was arranged that the goods covered by the warehouse receipts were to be held and sold on joint account, each sharing equally in the profits or losses on the transaction. Subsequently R. altered the note, without the knowledge or consent of H., by adding thereto the words \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent. par an,\" and falsely represented to the bank that H. held the warehouse receipts as collateral security for his indorsement. A couple of months later H., for the first time, became aware that the goods had never been purchased or placed in warehouse, that no warehouse receipt had been assigned to the bank and did not, until some months later, know that the alteration had been made in the note. There was some evidence that H. had asked for time to make a settlement of the amount due to the bank upon the note after he had become aware of the fraud and the alteration so made.\nHeld, by Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ. that the instrument was a forgery and could . not be ratified by an ex post facto assent. The Merchants Bank v. Lucas (18 Can. S.C.R. 704; Cam. Cas. 275), and Brook v. Hook (L.R. 6 Ex'. 89), followed.\nPer Idington J.\u2014The circumstances of the case did not shew that there had been any assent to the alteration within the meaning of section 145 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act.\"\nPer Maclennan J.\u2014The assent* required to bring an altered bill within the exception provided by section 145 of the \"Bills of Ex- change Act,\" R.S.C. (1906), ch. 119, must be given by the party sought to be bound at the time or of before the making of the alteration.\nHeld, also, the Chief Justice and. Davies J. contra, that, in\" the special circumstances of the case, there was no partnership relation between the parties to the note for the purposes of the transaction in question and there could be no implied authorisation for the making of the alteration in the note.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J.\u2014The. transaction in question was a joint venture or particular partnership for the enterprise in contemplation of the parties and, consequently, R. had a mandate to make whatever agreement was necessary with the bank to obtain the funds and to provide for the payment of interest on the advances . required to carry out the. business.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 16 K.B. 191) reversed, the Chief Justice and Davies J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Iberville (Paradis J.), which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions raised on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nBisaillon K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellant.\nLaurendeau K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014In September, 1903, the appellant entered into an agreement with one Roy to buy on joint account butter to be warehoused and held for a rise in the market. Roy was a manufacturer of and dealer in that article and H\u00e9bert, the appellant, was a merchant tailor; they both resided at and carried on business in the Town of St. Johns, in the Province of Quebec, and were apparently on friendly terms. It was at the same time agreed that the money required to carry on the venture would be borrowed from the respondents on the credit of Roy and H\u00e9bert, the warehouse receipts for the butter to be given as collateral security for the loan, and Roy was authorized to make the necessary financial arrangements with the bank. . It was finally settled that the money would be advanced on their joint demand note. Roy represented to the bank agent when the note was discounted that the warehouse receipts which the bank was to receive and hold as collateral were in the possession of the appellant H\u00e9bert, whereas the latter assumed that they were transferred to the bank in pursuance of his agreement with Roy. At, that time Roy pretended that he had in his warehouse about 10,000 pounds of butter: The proceeds of the note were put to Roy's personal credit.\nThe controversy here arises out of the fact that, when Roy came to the bank with the demand note signed by himself and H\u00e9bert, Audet, the bank agent, said that, as the loan was being made for an indefinite period, it was necessary to provide for the bank interest by adding to the note the words \"avec'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent. par an\" Roy was then asked to see H\u00e9bert and get his consent to the necessary addition and he immediately left the bank, ostensibly for that purpose, and returned In a few minutes professing untruly, as found by the trial judge, to have seen H\u00e9bert and obtained the required assent and he then and there altered the note by adding; the words \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent, par an.\" Subsequently, it was ascertained that a fraud had been perpetrated by Roy, that he had no butter in warehouse as he represented, that he did not use the money borrowed from the bank to purchase butter, and that in a word he had grossly deceived both H\u00e9bert and the bank. In the interval, and before that discovery was made, another note for $1,000, made in the same way and for the same purpose had been discounted under similar circumstances with the same bank, and altered by the addition of the same words. That note, however, was paid to the extent of f 900 by the appellant with a cheque received in payment of a sale of butter to one Bryce and as to the balance of $100, by Roy; and when fully paid the note was sent by the bank through the mail to H\u00e9bert, who destroyed it after having kept it in his possession for some days without a word of protest. I am of opinion that H\u00e9bert then knew of the alteration made in that note by Roy with respect to the interest and acquiesced in what had been done.\nWhen some months later H\u00e9bert discovered the fraud practised on him by Roy in connection with the warehouse receipts, he obtained from the bank a copy of the note now sued on, and, without objecting in any way to the alteration by addition of the words as to interest though his attention was specially drawn to it, he consulted his counsel and instituted criminal proceedings against Roy not for forgery, but for having obtained his signature to the note on the false representation that he then had in warehouse 10,000 lbs. of butter. The respondent asserts that H\u00e9bert did not then object to the alteration, but, on the contrary, formally approved and ratified what had been done by Roy with respect to the addition of the necessary words to provide for the interest (as he had done impliedly with respect to the note for $1,000) and undertook to pay the note now sued on. Subsequently, however, H\u00e9bert repudiated all liability on the ground that the note was forged, having been, altered in a material part without his authority or consent and he denied that he ever authorized, ratified, approved or confirmed what had been done by Roy to provide for the interest; hence this suit.\nIn my view the purchase of the butter was a joint venture, or a particular partnership contracted for a single enterprise; (art. 1862 C.C.) and Roy had a mandate to make an agreement with the bank to provide for the interest on the money which he was authorized to borrow and which could not be got otherwise to carry on the venture; (art. 1851 C.C.). If instead of adding the words, which were inserted in the note, Roy had simply given a joint undertaking verbally or in writing to pay the interest on the loan at 7%, can it be doubted that H\u00e9bert would have been bound? H\u00e9bert explains the negotiations with the bank with respect to the loan and the arrangement as to division of the profit or loss on the venture; interest, insurance, warehouse and other charges having first been provided for I make this extract from his evidence:\nQ. Veuillez donc dire dans quelles circonstances et pour quelles raisons vous avez ainsi sign\u00e9 et endoss\u00e9 ce billet?\nR. Le 10 septembre dernier M. Roy est venu chez moi dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi me dire que si je voulais enmagasiner du beurre, comme il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question avant avec lui, que c'\u00e9tait le temps. Il m'a fait la d\u00e9claration qu'il avait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 pour $2,000.00 de beurre qu'il pouvait exp\u00e9dier \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et toucher l'argent imm\u00e9diatement.\nQ. O\u00f9 avait-il ce beurre-l\u00e0? L'a-t-il dit?\nR. Dans ses entrep\u00f4ts, \u00e0 St.-Jean, dans sa manufacture de beurre, \u00e0 ce qu'il m'a dit. En m\u00eame temps, M. Roy m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un billet rempli au montant de $2,000.00 pour que je l'endosse. J'ai refus\u00e9 carr\u00e9ment, en dis ant \u00e0 M. Roy que ce n'\u00e9tait pas de cette mani\u00e8re que j'entendais faire de l'entrep\u00f4t. Je lui ai dit qu'il fallait voir d'abord si la banque avancerait les fonds; que je croyais que cela se faisait autrement que cela. M. Roy m'a dit: \"J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque et ils sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 nous avancer les fonds pour enmagasiner le beurre de septembre et d'octobre.\" J'ai dit \u00e0 M. Roy: \"Retournez \u00e0 la banque et vous reviendrez demain; renseignez-vous davantage. Mon impression est que la banque va vouloir avoir d'abord les re\u00e7us d'entrep\u00f4t, c'est une chose qu'ils exigent, et un billet additionnel, pour les garantir davantage, au cas o\u00f9 le beurre perdrait de la valeur pour se rattrapper sur le billet dans c\u20ac cas-l\u00e0.\" J'ai dit que c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 les conditions que j'entendais suivre. * * * Le lendemain, apr\u00e8s-d\u00eener, M. Roy est revenu et m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce billet-ci, exhibit A, en blanc, me disant que c'\u00e9tait dans le sens que j'avais compris la chose, que la banque voulait que \u00e7a se passe. Il m'a dit qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque et j'en ai conclu qu'il avait vu le g\u00e9rant, et il m'a demand\u00e9 de remplir le billet.\nQ. Dites-vous qu'il vous a dit que la banque voulait que ce soit comme vous aviez indiqu\u00e9 la veille?\nR. Oui, que c'\u00e9tait comme cela que \u00e7a devait se faire et que \u00e7a devait \u00eatre rempli comme je l'avais sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la veille. J'ai dit \u00e0 M. Roy: \"Comme cela vous avez pour $2,000.00 de beurre?\" Il a dit: \"Oui.\" J'ai dit: \"Vous avez par cons\u00e9quent 10,000 livres de beurre en entrep\u00f4t?\" M. Roy a dit: \"Oui.\"\nQ. O\u00f9 cela?\nR. Toujours \u00e0 son entrep\u00f4t, \u00e0 St.-Jean. Sur cette r\u00e9ponse affirmative de M. Roy, j'ai dit: \"Il faut maintenant s'entendre quant aux profits ou aux pertes' s'il y en a. D'abord il va falloir assurer le beurre.\" M. Roy a dit: \"Pour cette quantit\u00e9-ci ce n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\" Il a dit qu'il avait suffisamment d'assurance pour le couvrir; mais que si on en enmagasinait d'autre par la suite on prendrait de l'assurance. J'ai dit: \"Combien allez-vous' me charger pour le loyer de votre entrep\u00f4t? Je n'entends pas me servir de votre entrep\u00f4t sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer. Sera-ce au pied ou au mois ou au mille livres? Je ne connais pas ces conditions-l\u00e0.\" M. Roy m'a dit: \"J'irai \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al; et je m'informerai; je chargerai \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s comme ils chargent \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al mais ce ne sera pas grand'chose dans tous les cas.\" J'ai dit: \"Maintenant, c'est bien entendu que vous allez donner les re\u00e7us d'entrep\u00f4t \u00e0 la banque, et une fois les int\u00e9r\u00eats pay\u00e9s ainsi que l'assurance et les frais d'entrep\u00f4t, s'il y en a, une fois' toutes les d\u00e9penses en rapport avec cette transaction pay\u00e9es, les pertes ou les profits devront \u00eatre divis\u00e9s \u00e9galement entre nous.\" C'est \u00e0 cette condition-l\u00e0 que j'ai rempli ce billet-l\u00e0 \u00e0 demande. Je l'ai sign\u00e9 et je l'ai endoss\u00e9. M. Roy l'a sign\u00e9 et endoss\u00e9 aussi devant moi. Mais je me suis aper\u00e7u quand M. Girard, mon avocat, m'a dit d'aller chercher une copie de ce billet, qu'apr\u00e8s que je l'eusse sign\u00e9, et hors de ma connaissance, il y a eu d'ajout\u00e9 sur le billet \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de sept pour cent.\" Je n'ai pas eu connaissance de cela, je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 'consult\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet non plus et ce n'est pas moi qui l'ai \u00e9crit.\"\nAnd again at page 21:\nQ. Vous deviez \u00eatre de moiti\u00e9 dans les profits?\nR. Profits ou pertes. And at page 22:\nEtant donn\u00e9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 que vous avez faite avec M. Roy, vous' avez sign\u00e9 ce billet-l\u00e0 pour participer dans les profits qui pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9s sur l'enmagasinage du beurre?\nR. S'il y avait pertes ou profits, apr\u00e8s que toutes les d\u00e9penses \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es, on divisait \u00e9galement dans l'une ou l'autre. Le beurre pouvait \u00eatre vendu le lendemain si on voulait, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion favorable qu'on aurait trouv\u00e9.\nFrom this I conclude that Roy and H\u00e9bert were undoubtedly partners in the purchase of this butter and there was undoubtedly an agreement to share the losses or profits of the venture which was to be financed by money obtained from the bank by Roy on their joint credit. To get the loan, under the circumstances, for an indefinite period, H\u00e9bert knew that interest must be provided for, and Roy had authority to bind both with respect to the payment of this interest and an alteration of the note by the addition of words to provide for the payment of interest on money advanced for the benefit of the partnership is not under the special circumstances a fraudulent alteration which constitutes forgery.\nNow as to subsequent adoption and ratification. The fact that a note for $1,000 was given under similar circumstances and altered in the same way is very material. That note was paid in part by H\u00e9bert and it subsequently came into his possession; so it is impossible to believe that he did not see the alteration by the addition of the words as to interest. When he called at the bank to make a copy of the note now sued upon, H\u00e9bert saw \"the similar alteration in this note and without protest undertook to pay it. Here are his words, as given by witness Camaraire:\nP. 83: M. H\u00e9bert a dit:. \"C'est mon.billet,, je-le reconnais; je vous paierai mais M. Roy en paiera la fa\u00e7on. Je vais le faire arr\u00eater aujourd'hui m\u00eame.\" M. H\u00e9bert a ajout\u00e9: \"La banque ne perdra pas un sou; je vais le payer, et je vais faire arr\u00eater M. Roy aujourd'hui m\u00eame.\"\nP. 84: Il a dit: \"Que sert-il \u00e0 la banque de me faire faire les frais d'emprunter sur ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour un mois ou un mois et demi; lorsque je vous assure que le premier juin je paierai mon billet.\" J'ai dit \u00e0 M. Pl\u00e9bert que j'allais en parler \u00e0 M. Dorais, le g\u00e9rant, et que j'\u00e9tais convaincu que la chose allait lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9e; que c'\u00e9tait raisonnable. Il a ajout\u00e9 que sa femme \u00e9tait pein\u00e9e de voir qu'il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de payer $2,000.00; qu'il avait une nombreuse famille; qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas riche, et qu'il connaissait ce que c'\u00e9tait que de gagner de l'argent. Il a dit: \"J'ai dit \u00e0 ma femme: 'Tu ne penses pas qu'on a $2,000.00 \u00e0 retirer; de sorte que notre position se trouvera la m\u00eame.\"'\nI would confirm because, in my opinion, there is sufficient evidence to shew that the alteration by addition of the words necessary to provide for the payment of interest on the loan made for the joint benefit of Roy and H\u00e9bert was made with authority and to eon-form to the original intention of the parties and that the joint maker subsequently agreed to it. .\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed. I prefer, however, not to rest my judgment upon the ground of the existence of an implied authority on Roy's part arising out of his special partnership relations with H\u00e9bert to make the alteration in the note, but upon the ground that when Roy took the note to the respondent bank to have it discounted and added the words \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent. par an\" he did so claiming to have had the authority of his co-maker, H\u00e9bert, to add these words and that H\u00e9bert subsequently assented to the alteration and so confirmed Roy's representation of authority.\nIf subsequent assent to an alteration of a note made with full knowledge of the facts is sufficient to hold the person so assenting to his liability on the bill, I am of opinion that the evidence is amply sufficient in this case to find such assent and I concur in the Chief Justice's reasoning on this point.\nThen, with respect to the law of the case, I think the case of Merchants Bank v. Lucas[2] relied on by the appellant, does not govern or apply to the facts before us. That was the case of a simple forgery of a man's name to a note and an attempt to hold the person whose name was forged liable because of a subsequent promise to pay it. Here we have a note admittedly signed by the party sought to be charged but alleged to have been altered by his co-maker, but, so far as the holder is concerned, altered professedly by Roy under the authority of the party sought to be charged. As is said in appellant's own factum, in stating the circumstances under which the respondent's manager discounted the note:\nLooking over the note he, the bank manager, noticed that there was no mention of interest on it. So he asked Hoy to call upon Mr. H\u00e9bert, the appellant, in order to have the interest mentioned on the note. Roy left the bank to go to H\u00e9bert's, apparently, and came back 15 or 20 minutes later with the same note with the words \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent. par an\" added to the wording of the note and without any possible doubt most evidently of the handwriting of Roy himself.\nUpon Roy's declaration that the appellant had acquiesced to the addition on the note, the manager, Mr. Audet, accepted his word as to this, just as' he had accepted his word concerning the warehouse receipts.\nThe ratification or assent relied upon here is that of an act done by a person professing himself to have been for the purpose the agent of the person subsequently ratifying it. The distinction between such an act and that of a mere forgery is distinctly pointed out in the case of Merchants Bank v. Lucas[3], above referred to, in the report of the reasons for their judgment given by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to be found in 15 Ontario Appeal Reports, at page 600, and affirmed in this court on appeal (1).\nIn the case of Brook v. Hook[4], cited and relied upon in the Lucas's Case3, the Chief Baron Kelly, in delivering the judgment of the court, at page 100, says:\nIn all the cases cited for the plaintiff the act ratified was an act pretended to have been done for or under the authority of the party sought to be charged; and such would have been the case here, if Jones had pretended to have had the authority of the defendant to put his name to the note, and that he had signed the note for the defendant accordingly, and had thus induced the plaintiff to take it. In that case, although there had been no previous authority, it would have been competent to the defendant to ratify the act, and the maxim before mentioned would have applied.\nApart from authority respecting the law as it stood before the codification of the law on bills and notes, I am of opinion that the subsequent assent of the defendant to the alteration is sufficient to bind him under the \"Bills of Exchange Act of 1890,\" now chapter 119 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906. Section 49 of this revised Act deals with a forged signature to a bill or note and provides that nothing therein\nshall affect the ratification of an authorized signature not amounting to a forgery;\nwhile section 145 deals with material alterations made in such an instrument. In this latter section it is declared with respect to patent material alterations that where a bill or acceptance, is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable on the bill the bill is voided, except against a party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and subsequent indorsers.\nNow, here are three specified and distinct exceptions from the conditions under which a material alteration is declared to avoid the bill. First; Where the party sought to be charged has himself made it; Secondly; Where he has authorized it to be made; and, Thirdly; Where he has assented to it having been made.\nIt has been argued that the assent must be an assent given previous to the alteration, or at any rate previous to the issue of the bill or note.\nI do not see any reason or justification for putting such a limitation upon the meaning of the phrase used in the section. The first two exceptions may well relate to an alteration made before the issue of the note but are not necessarily confined to such an antecedent period; the last exception, it seems to me, was, introduced for the very purpose of covering a subsequent assent to a previous alteration.\nIn section 49, relating to the simple forgery of a naine to a bill or note, a proviso is introduced saying that\nnothing in this section shall affect the ratification of an unauthorized signature not amounting to a forgery.\nIt may be argued that section 145 is to be construed as only applying to alterations under the circumstances mentioned by the learned judges who de livered the judgment in Merchants Bank v. Lucas[5], and in Brook v. Hook[6], that is, where the alteration was an act pretended to have been done for, or under the authority of the party sought to be charged.\nEven if limited to such cases (as to which. I express no opinion), it is clear to my mind that it at least covers them and that this case is one of them.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant says he was asked by one Roy in September, 1903, to indorse for him a note of two thousand dollars to be discounted with respondents at St. John's, in Quebec, where the parties live, and to be secured by warehouse receipts covering ten thousand pounds of butter estimated worth at least twenty cents a pound.\nHe says the arrangement was finally agreed to between him and Roy on this basis and the further understanding that he should be compensated for his indorsement by getting half the profits on the butter when it might be realized on later and he also suffer half the loss if any.\nThis made it a joint venture, but nothing like a general partnership was thought of, though possibly future similar speculations may have been contemplated by appellant as possible.\nHe drew up a demand note and signed it jointly and also indorsed it jointly with Roy, whom he entrusted with it, and also the carrying out of the giving to the bank the promised warehouse receipts. He saw no more of Roy on the subject and always supposed until the following November that the bank had got and held the warehouse receipts. Then the bank agent surprised him by calling upon him for the warehouse receipts and explaining that Roy had put the transaction through with the bank by representing that H\u00e9bert was to get and hold the warehouse receipts as security for both himself and the bank. Roy was enabled by this double fraud to get the money without the security of warehouse receipts.\nHis story is that H\u00e9bert signed merely for accomodation, never demanded security, never asked compensation for indorsement or joining in the note, and that the bank never asked for nor were offered any security but that of H\u00e9bert signing.\nHe says future possibilities of speculation may have been spoken of between him and H\u00e9bert, but they had no relation to this business.\nThe line of reasoning upon which the courts below proceed renders it necessary the foregoing evidence should be prominently borne in mind.\nThe note as made in H\u00e9bert's handwriting was found by him in the following April to have been altered by Roy adding the words \"with interest at seven per cent. per annum.\"\nThis alteration, the bank agent and Roy agree, came about by reason of the suggestion of the agent that as it was a demand note it should bear interest on the face of it.\nThe agent says Roy at once acceded to the suggestion when made and left the bank to get H\u00e9bert's sanction to it .and returned in fifteen minutes or half an hour with the note thus altered. In one way be puts it as if Roy had reported on his return that H\u00e9bert had expressly assented to this particular alteration, but in another, and, when repeating the words that passed, he puts it as if he had simply taken Roy's word that the bill was all right now.\nIn my view there is no difference under the' circumstances in question here. The appellant swears Roy never saw him on the subject or spoke to him on the subject of alteration.\nRoy says that on the occasion of presenting the note to be discounted the appellant was at the bank and had left before the agent had observed the omission to provide in this way for the interest, but instantly it was mentioned he followed and caught H\u00e9bert as or before reaching the pavement, just outside the bank, and explained what the agent had said as to interest, got H\u00e9bert's instant assent to the change being made, returned inside and, in the agent's private office and his presence, wrote the alteration.\nAll this circumstantial but somewhat improbable story of getting and acting on the authority of H\u00e9bert in the manner just related is denied by both the agent and H\u00e9bert.\nThe courts below seem to have discredited Roy. The learned trial judge proceeded on the assumption that the business being a joint one Roy had an implied authority and that H\u00e9bert, after he had knowledge of the alteration, acquiesced therein and recognized his responsibility and promised the respondent to pay the bill. The only judge in appeal who gives reasons does not hold that he consented, but that the whole question was, had he acquiesced? And he finds he did.\nThese several positions are taken by respondent here, and also that Roy professing to act as an agent or on behalf of H\u00e9bert, as agent his acts could be and were ratified.\nThe bank never looked upon appellant in any other light than that of a mere surety as Roy had represented and still represents him.\nHow can we impute to the parties for the purposes of this case that relation which is denied by him whose act is being enquired into? How can we find he in truth acted or represented he acted as an agent in making the alteration? In the first place he in reality only said \"tout correct\" and the agent accepted his word. That did not imply he had the authority to write the alteration. It rather implied in the face of what had proceeded that\" H\u00e9bert had finished the writing.\nIn the next place he was doing nothing but simply completing the fraud which is the essence of every forgery either of making or altering, and implies a representation that it is the act of another or done by the express or implied authority of another.\nTo adopt such a refinement as suggested and is required in order to impute to the act in question the nature of agency, in order that the rules relative to the ratification of an act of supposed agency might apply and thus escape the consequences of holding this to be a forgery, would be to go beyond any case I have seen or principle of any case that exists, and do much to break down the useful rigour of the law maintained so long for the protection of business men.\nNo doubt Roy was afraid to disturb appellant again lest doing so would lead to inconvenient inquiries or a possible meeting of the agent and H\u00e9bert. Let us now see exactly what the appellant did thereafter and try to assign to it only its true legal weight, in shewing the question of his liability.\nThe appellant had under consideration the prosecution of Roy for the fraud alleged in relation to the representations as to the warehouse receipts and desired a copy of the note.\nHe went to the bank and got a copy there. On this occasion the accountant of the bank tells that the appellant, even after he had as the account- ant infers, seen the alteration, used expressions indicating his intention to pay the note.\nNo court, I should hope, would hold him liable upon that evidence alone even if it stood quite unimpeached, but here it is absolutely contradicted, and as it stands does not seem at all the probable result of a man who appreciated the discovery he had made and understandingly intended to give that effect to the words imputed to him that is now claimed ought to be given. Acquiescence and ratification must be founded on a full knowledge of the facts.\nThis was on the 4th April or thereabout.\nThe same witness relates that ten days later, as he and appellant returned from court where Roy had been up for examination on the charge\" of false pretences laid by the appellant, he asked him (the accountant) if he would be good enough to ask Mr. Dorais (meaning the then agent of the bank) if he would wait until the first of June for payment. He alleges appellant referred to some life policies he had as falling in then.\nThere was no assent or promise surely in this interrogative conditional remark. The utmost that can be said is he may have had by that time a recognition of the facts. This witness says he reported this query and more as to the policies, and explained to Mr. Dorais he had better see appellant for himself as the time asked would not be long to wait.\nDorais, the agent, pursuant to this went next day and saw appellant at his shop, and as what he relates is the strongest thing which appears to be relied upon as indicative of an assent by appellant; after he had seen or known of the alteration, I copy here, from this agent's evidence, its material parts: Le soir m\u00eame, ou le lendemain je suis all\u00e9 voir monsieur H\u00e9bert dans son magasin, dans la ville de St. Jean, et l\u00e0 monsieur H\u00e9bert m'a dit qu'il avait une police d'assurance qui devanait due dans le mois de juin. Il m'a dit: \"Si la banque voulait m'attendre jusqu'\u00e0 ce temps-l\u00e0, cela m'\u00e9viterait les d\u00e9penses d'une hypoth\u00e8que ainsi que les d\u00e9penses d'une quittance.\" Il m'a alors dit que si la banque voulait lui donner une chance et l'attendre jusqu'alors il nous paierait;'l\u00e0-dessus je-ne lui ai pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse affirmative.\nQ. Avez-vous eu d'autres conversations avec le d\u00e9fendeur H\u00e9bert au sujet de ce billet-l\u00e0, apr\u00e8s cette date-l\u00e0, ainsi qu'au cours des proc\u00e8s que M. H\u00e9bert a eu avec M. Roy, alors qu'il a fait arr\u00eater ce dernier.\nR. Non, mais j'ai vu M. H\u00e9bert plusieurs fois au bureau avant l'arrestation de M. Roy. A partir du mois de janvier ou du mois de f\u00e9vrier, j'ai eu plusieurs visites de la part de M. H\u00e9bert. Il a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans le temps d'acheter les garanties que nous avions. M. H\u00e9bert m'a dit en differentes circonstances \"quand la banque voudra \u00eatre pay\u00e9e elle sera pay\u00e9e.\"\nAll these promises preceding the arrest of Roy of course go for nothing, as no one pretends now, except possibly Roy, that H\u00e9bert had the slightest knowledge of the alteration before April.\nThe respondents are thus reduced to depend on a proposal made subject to a condition and never accepted or assented to.\nI am at a loss to know how these expressions can be twisted into any assent such as the Act requires or even if ratification was permissible to render a void instrument valid.\nSuppose such a proposition had been made to Roy by appellant after the agent had required an alteration and suppose Roy had before altering reported it to him as a condition of this appellant's consent, could the agent take from Roy and hold a bill altered in his presence by virtue of no greater authority than implied in such a question without first yielding an acceptance of these conditional terms? Surely no one could venture to claim so. Yet this is that in substance. Calvert v. Baker[7]is a case of a defendant whose acceptance had been so altered as to place of payment from being at his house to some place else. His solicitor wrote for him after it was due and he fully realized the change and ended\nhe has been prepared far payment and the party may have his money by calling at Bulbrook.\nIt was held this was not such an acknowledgment as would support either the bill or a claim for account stated, but was a mere conditional proposal. That case illustrates what I mean as to a conditional offer.\nThe case of Perring v. Hone[8], in 1826, is valuable here by reason of its having arisen out of a note given for a partnership liability and which was intended to have been joint and several but was written only as joint when defendant signed, and altered to conform to words used in one of which it was part renewal, and which was joint and several. The defendant on its falling due was asked by letter to pay his joint and several note.\nHe replied that the communication should have his earliest attention.\nThe court held that the defendant was not liable. Best C. J., in his judgment, remarks,\ngiving attention to a matter is a very different thing from giving assent.\nThere was no question of forgery for all was done apparently in good faith, in short a case where ratification could legally have been given.\nI might well rest here, but the case suggests the desirability of a full examination of the law respecting \"assent,\" which with great respect I submit has been quite misapprehended. The court below so far as appears relied solely on an American text book. Daniel shews that English and American cases differ. Certainly American cases exist widely different from the results this court has reached heretofore on the subject of ratifying forged bills of exchange.\nMoreover, our law resting on English and Canadian authorities has been codified in language appropriate thereto, which as a rule is not identical with such codification as arrived at in some of the United States. We must be guided by ours, now known as \"The Bills of Exchange Act,\" R.S.C. 1906, ch. 119, of which sections 49 and 145 are identical with sections 24 and 63 of the former Act under which this case falls. For convenience I will refer to the sections as they now stand.\nThe first, and for this case material, part of section 145 is as follows:\n145. Where a bill or acceptance is materially altered without the assent] of all parties liable on the bill, the bill is voided, except as against a party who has himself made, authorized, or assented to the alteration and subsequent indorsers.\nIt is upon getting us to give the words \"assented to\"' therein such an extensive meaning as they have not yet been given in England or Canada that the hope of respondent lies.\nSome formidable difficulties stand in the way. In the first place for the reasons already stated there was no assent and none in the way at all events of consent which is to be implied in what I will for the present and as a convenience call the primary meaning of assent which the law required or had in View.\nIn the next place, if the word \"assent\" is to be given a wider and I will call secondary meaning such as involved in ratification, then this was clearly a forgery and incapable of ratification.\nI will deal with the primary meaning first and later take up the secondary.\nThis quotation from section 145 is but a declaration of the law as it had existed for at least a hundred years prior to the \"Bills of Exchange Act.\"\nThe case of Master v. Miller[9], put beyond all doubt that a material alteration of a bill of exchange after acceptance rendered it void.\nThis rule extended to or had been extended long before this legislation to all written instruments. It was not confined to an alteration made before issue of the bill or the coming into operation of the contract or instrument.\nThe case of Davidson v. Cooper[10], where no explanation was offered, leaves us to infer the like results if alteration take place after the due date or right of action had accrued.\nIt was not necessary that it should alter the contract.\nEach of these propositions is, I submit, supported by the decision in Suffell v. Bank of England[11], 1882, in the Court of Appeal, which was a case in regard to the erasure of a number on a Bank of England note.\nThe statement of Chief Justice Dallas in the case of Bander son v. Symonds[12], that\nthe original rule was not intended so much to guard against fraud as to insure the identity of the instrument and prevent the substitution of another without the privity of the party concerned,\nis quoted with approval in that case by Cotton L.J.\nUnless we can infer, for which we have no warrant, that a radical change of the law was intended by the Act, such a decision as Suffell v. Bank of England[13] by the Court of Appeal, about four months before the passage of the \"Bills of Exchange Act, 1882,\" from which ours is taken, sheds a flood of light on the meaning to be attached to the words \"altered\" and \"alteration\" in section 84 of that Act, which is identical with section 145 of our Act as above quoted.\nCan there be any question but that the meaning of these words, set in the context as they are, was intended to be the law that had thus recently been declared?\nThen we find in the several opinions of the eminent judges who agreed in that decision no fault found with the rule there quoted from Pigot's Case[14], and Which was in fact the modern root of the law and, as said by Jessel M.R., in his judgment, never had been doubted.\nThe quotation thus both explicitly and tacitly affirmed is as follows:\nThat when any deed is altered in a point material by the plaintiff himself or by any stranger without the privity of the obligee, be it by interlineation, addition, raising or by drawing of a pen through a line or through the midst of any material word, the deed thereby becomes void.\nWe find moreover in the plea used, to set up this defence of alteration, that the allegation in the approved forms was invariably that it was so altered \"without the consent of the defendant.\" We find text-writers such as Mr. Leake treat of it under the head of discharge, and we find the \"Bills of Exchange Act, 1882\/' classify it under the head of discharge and our own Act treat of it under the head of discharge of the bill.\nIn face of all that, must we not say this note was void and appellant as a maker of it discharged at least from the 11th of September, 1903, until 4th April, 1904.\nAnd how could he then become bound again by something then said or done unless it came up to the full meaning of a ratification?\nThen in this application of what I have called a secondary meaning or that of ratification if, as I will for the present assume, such a thing is within the intended scope of the words \"assented to\" in this section, the respondent is face to face with the rule of law that forgery cannot be ratified.\nThe case of the Merchants Bank v. Lucas[15] binds this court. There the defendant's firm name had been forged by a brother of a member of the firm who recognized it as a forgery and at last promised to send next day a cheque for the amount.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the defendants there were not liable, that a forgery could not be ratified, and that there was not enough shewn to create an estoppel, and thereby the defendants were discharged and this court upheld that.\nThe case here is as against the appellant infinitely weaker than that case was against the defendants unless we distinguish forgery by alteration as different in effect in this regard from a forging of the sig- nature. Is there in principle room for such a distinction? I cannot see how, if due regard be had to the essential nature of the things dealt with. Why discriminate so between things, so essentially requiring the same treatment, in laying down rules for the guidance of men?\nAt common law forgery was defined to be the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right.\nThis remains good law though supplemented by statute and is applicable to the making or alteration of bills falling respectively within sections 49 and 145 above referred to.\nMoreover, we have to bear in mind that, when the English \"-Bills of Exchange Act, 1882,\" from which ours is taken was passed, the case of Brook v. Hook[16], in 1871, had declared that forgery could not be ratified.\nThis court in like manner had, immediately preceding our \"Bills of Exchange Act, 1890,\" decided the case of the Merchants Bank v. Lucas[17].\nNow let us consider both sections together and see if there is any room for distinction in this regard. Each of these sections respectively declares the forgery or alteration void.\nThe language is just as strong in law in the one case as the other. The subject about which it is used being different makes all the difference there is.\nIn both cases there are exceptions to the absolute operation of the voiding words and these exceptions when examined in detail and viewed in light of history of the law on the subject have the same general purposes in view.\nIn section 49 the exception turns upon the word \"precluded\" which Chalmers in his comment on it tells us was substituted in the passing through committee of the English Act, from which ours is taken, for the word \"estopped\" which had not in Scotch as in English law a technical meaning.\nHave we not thus a key to the secondary meaning to be put upon the words \"assented to\" in the section 145?\nThere are also provisos following the main part of each section. These seem to have for a common purpose the protection of the innocent holder and to rest upon what is essentially at bottom but a recognition of that which is akin to the principle of estoppel and in truth, in many cases, but that principle itself and a statutory declaration defining certain limits of application thereof which mercantile experience had developed as found necessary in the business world.\nIt is to be observed that there is not in regard to alteration an express provision in section 145 like unto that which there is in section 49 in regard to a forged signature, for preserving rights springing from \"ratification of an unauthorized signature not amounting to a forgery.\" Why is this so? Is there no substitute for it?\nIt seems to me that the words \"assented to\" are apt words to expressly cover not only the use or meaning of the words \"consented to\" which imply a privity to the act itself, but also the cases of ratification of an alteration made by an agent or one professing to act as an agent, in any innocent way. I say in any innocent way, because we find in the section relative to a cognate subject this expressed, and we cannot impute to the legislature an intention to carry into such words as we are interpreting what was regarded up to that moment as. utterly repugnant to the policy of the law. Giving the. words \"assented to\" this application we harmonize the otherwise apparently discrepant purposes of the two sections when dealing with that which in either case is void and is so declared.\nThere can be no more reason for rehabilitating the one void act than the other. Nor can there be any reason for making that rehabilitation more extensive or comprehensive in the one case than in the other.\nThe principle of acquiescence relied on below and running through many cases has never been effective of itself when attempted to be applied to validating a forgery. What has been and, short of a new agreement, has alone been made effective in such cases, is where the acts or words, or either, of the party having a right to repudiate the forgery, have led another party to rely on such acts or words and act on the faith thereof.\nUnless such estoppel could be shewn there could be, before the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" no dependence put upon ratification of a forgery and certainly it never was intended thereby to imply differently by using the words \"assented to\" therein.\nThe fraudulent purpose which is the essence of forgery is here only too apparent.\nIt has long been laid down that there cannot be in law the ratification of a forgery. The reasons assigned therefor have varied. The existence of the rule has even been questioned. It has been determined in this court affirmatively. To apply that affirmation to one form of forgery and deny it to another would seem like making a travesty of legal principles.\nIn any form this case presents or in which it can be presented to escape this rule, we must either ignore the forgery, self-confessed as it stands, or find that an alleged promise not relied upon, not accepted, nor shewn to have been acted upon, is an estoppel that bars the right to appeal to the rule.\nI would for a clear statement of the rule and reasons of or for the same refer to Daniel on Negotiable Securities (5 ed.), sec. 1352(5), which follows a review of English and American cases.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgments in the courts below reversed with costs in all and here to the appellant.\nMaClbnnan J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed. The first question is whether the addition made to the note was a forgery.\nI think it was. The addition made was material. Originally the note contained no stipulation for the payment of interest, and was payable on demand. The alteration was the addition of the words \"avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 sept par cent. par an.\"\nThe relations of the parties were not such as to authorize Roy to make the alteration without express authority. They were not partners. The appellant was merely an accommodation maker, for which it was agreed he should share the profit or loss on the sale of certain goods of Roy. Roy did not pretend to have authority to make the alteration. He pretended to go and get authority, and then pretended he had obtained it, and I agree with the learned judges below that it was not true that he had, as he pretended, obtained authority.\nThe banker discounted the note, and nothing further happened until the beginning of April, more than six months afterwards, when the appellant went to the bank to obtain a copy of the note. During all that time the note was, in my opinion, an undoubted forgery, and, on the authority of The Merchants Bank, v. Lucas[18], affirmed in this court[19], incapable of ratification.\nBut it is argued that section 145 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act, 1906,\" is applicable, and that certain alleged promises of the appellant, after he became aware of the alteration, have made him liable. That section, so far as applicable, is as follows:\nWhere a bill or acceptance is materially altered, without the assent of all parties liable on the bill, the bill is voided, except as against a party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and subsequent indorsers.\nIn what sense is this word alteration here used? The word itself is ambiguous. It may mean the doing of the act or it may mean the act done. The statute speaks of an assent to an alteration. Does that mean assent to the making of the alteration, or does it mean an assent to it after it is made? A bill to which three or more persons are parties is altered. One of the parties made the alteration, that is, did the act. He is not discharged, he remains liable. Another authorized it, that is, as before, authorized the doing of the act. Then comes another who has neither done the act nor authorized the doing of it, but has assented to it. Assented to what?. Plainly, as before, to the doing of the act. The. word alteration must have the same meaning in all three cases, that is, the doing of the act, the making of the alteration.\nThe statute says, in effect, voided except as against a party who has himself made, who has himself authorized or who has himself assented to the making of the alteration.\nThe use of the perfect tense also favours the same construction. The bill which the legislature declares to be voided, is a bill materially altered without the assent of all the parties. Then it says that any party who has assented to that alteration is still to be bound. It is not any party who assents, but who has assented,\nThe statute, in effect, declares that a bill altered without assent is voided, but, if altered with assent it is binding on him who has so assented.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below.\nDuff J.\u2014The construction of section 145 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" presents considerable difficulty. Read grammatically, the section would seem to enact that a material alteration of a bill has the effect of nullifying it, as against all parties except the party who made the alteration and such as, at the time of or before the making of it, had authorized or assented to it. But I do not think it necessary for the purpose of this appeal to decide whether that is or is not the true effect of the enactment. Assuming that, under it, an assent may in some circumstances take effect, though given after the alteration is a completed act, it by no means follows that such an assent would give validity to an alteration amounting to a pure forgery. The legislature appears (section 49) to have adopted the view of the majority of the Court of Exchequer in Brook v. Hook[20], that \u00e0 forgery consisting in the false making of a bill is incapable of ratification \u2014a view acted upon by this court in Lucas v. The Merchants Bank[21]. Having regard to the legislature's manifestation (in the section last mentioned), of this view of the policy of the law, it would, I think, involve an unwarranted expansion of the strict grammatical sense of section 145 to hold that a simple ex post facto assent can by the force of that section give legal effect to a fraudulent alteration amounting to forgery and, apart from the enactment in that section, incapable of ratification.\nWith great respect for the opinions of those who take a contrary view, I am unable to escape the conclusion that the alteration in question here was simple forgery and (within the principle of the decisions referred to), legally incapable of adoption by the appellant as his act. Neither in making the alteration nor in negotiating the promissory note did Roy intend or profess to act on behalf of the appellant. On this point the whole of the evidence is in a very narrow compass, and it shews plainly that, in negotiating the notes, Roy presented himself to the respondent bank as a borrower on the security of the appellant's indorsement\u2014representing, at the same time, that the appellant held certain warehouse receipts as security against his liability as accommodation indorser. There was, at the time, no suggestion that Roy and the appellant stood to one another in the relation of partners or in any other relation implying that in the transaction Roy bore a representative character. The agent who acted for the bank in the business does not say that he received any such impression; nor, I think, could anything that Roy said or did\u2014as related in the agent's testimony\u2014convey such an impression. According to that testimony, Roy's conduct would, I think, appear in this light only, that, on his own behalf with a view to the negotiation of the promissory note for his own purposes, he had made the alteration required by the agent and that the appellant, as his accommodation indorser, had assented to it; or that he had procured the appellant himself to make it. That was a very different thing from professing that what he had done was done for the appellant and as the appellant's act, or for the joint behoof of himself and the appellant and as their joint act.\nIt seems equally clear, moreover, that Roy did not in fact, in making the alteration or in negotiating the instrument, intend to act for the behoof of the appellant or of the appellant and himself jointly. The appellant had, it is true, lent his indorsement on the understanding that the bank should be secured by a deposit of warehouse receipts in furtherance of an adventure which Roy had proposed, and in which he supposed himself to be engaged as the associate of Roy. But the substratum of this adventure\u2014the merchandise which was to stand as security for the loan, and which was to be held and sold for their joint benefit\u2014was a pure myth; and this proposal, a mere device on the part of Roy, to enable him, by the use of the appellant's indorsement, to obtain an advance from the bank for his own benefit.\nEverything which Roy did\u2014including the making of the alteration in question\u2014from the time of his interview with the appellant, was done in furtherance of this fraudulent design; and not, of course, at all in furtherance of the mythical speculation in which H\u00e9bert supposed himself to be a party.\nRoy's act in making the alteration in these circumstances, without H\u00e9bert's consent, and with the intent, moreover, of tendering it to the agent of the bank as made by H\u00e9bert or with his assent, bears all the characters of a forgery; and, in the view I have expressed, the subsequent sanction of it in fact by H\u00e9bert could not give it legal validity either as an assent within the meaning of the statute or as ratification apart from the statute.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bisaillou & Brossard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Court, District of Montreal (Fortin J.), dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe case is stated as follows in the judgment of Mr. Justice Mathieu in his dissenting judgment delivered on the appeal to the Court of Review.\n\"Mathieu J.\u2014The plaintiff inscribed in review, from a judgment of the Superior Court (Fortin J.), rendered at Montreal 24th October, 1905, maintaining the pleas of the defendant, William McNally \u00eas qualit\u00e9, and dismissing her action, with costs. \"The plaintiff is the daughter of the late Owen McGarvey and Margaret Cooper.\n\"On the 23rd of May, 1894, Owen McGarvey made his will, in authentic form, before Labadie, N.P.\n\"The will contains, among others, the following provision:\n'I give and bequeath after the death of my said wife, to my said daughter, Margaret McGarvey, during her lifetime, the income or revenue of the capital sum of fifty thousand dollars, current money of Canada, which capital shall be invested with first-class security by my executors for the best advantage of my said daughter; and at the death of my said daughter, the said capital I give and bequeath to her lawful children and descendants, to be divided amongst them, share and share alike by families, par souche, according to law, and to be then their own and absolute property forever.'\n\"The will also contains the following order: 'I wish and direct that my estate be settled and wound up within one year from the day of the death of my said wife.'\n\"The testator and his wife were common as to property.\n\"Owen McGarvey died on the 7th July, 1897.\n\"On the 9th day of July, 1898, his widow, Margaret Cooper, made her last will, in notarial form, before Cox, N.P.\n\"She appointed as executors the defendants, William McNally, her son-in-law, and Joseph Cooper, of Lindsay, Ontario, her brother, who had been appointed executors of the estate of her husband, in the place of the executors mentioned in his will, who had resigned.\n\"As regards the plaintiff, the will of Margaret Cooper contains the following disposition: 'Inasmuch as, by his last will and testament, executed before J. E. O. Labadie and colleague, notaries, on the twenty-third of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-four, my deceased husband gave and bequeathed, after my death, to my daughter, Margaret McGarvey, during her lifetime, the income or revenue of the capital sum of fifty thousand dollars, should it appear to my executors, either at my death or at the time fixed for the winding up of his estate, that his estate would not be sufficient to pay in full the various legacies bequeathed by him under his said will, and that, in consequence, my said daughter, in common with the other legatees, would be obliged to suffer a proportionate diminution of her legacy, I direct my said executors to pay, out of my estate, to my said daughter, Margaret McGarvey, such sum of money as my said executors may deem sufficient to make up the deficiency in the bequest to her made by my husband's will, should there be any, so that my said daughter, Margaret McGarvey, shall, with the sum of money to be set aside for her advantage, by the executors of his will, with, in addition, the sum of money to be paid to her by my executors, in the event of there being any deficiency, as above mentioned, be assured of obtaining the revenue or interest of the sum of fifty thousand dollars.'\n'In the event of there being any diminution in the bequest to my said daughter, under my husband's will, and my executors paying to her such sum as may, in their opinion, be necessary to cover such deficiency, such sum as shall be paid to my said daughter, Margaret McGarvey, by my executors, shall be her own and absolute property, and shall be used, enjoyed and disposed of as she may think proper.' \"Margaret Cooper died on the 31st October, 1902, and, under the provision hereinabove cited in her husband's will, the estate of the latter was to be wound up on the 31st October, 1903.\n\"The wife of defendant McNally, Annie McGarvey, is the residuary legatee, under the will of her father, and, also, residuary legatee, together with the plaintiff, her elder sister, under her mother's will.\n\"On the 25th April, 1903, a bill was passed by the Legislature of Quebec (3 Edw. VII. ch. 136), 'to interpret the will of the late Owen McGarvey, to extend the powers of the executors, provide for the payment of legacies and make provision for the administration and winding up of the estate.'\n\"The only dispositions of the said statute of 1903, which might have any bearing on this cause are the following:\n'1.\u2014The said executors or their successors in office duly appointed are hereby declared seized and possessed of all the property, movable and immovable, of the estate and succession of the late Owen McGarvey, until the complete execution and fulfilment of the said will is accomplished, or until the same is otherwise disposed of under the provisions of this Act, and are declared to be vested with and to have the fullest and most unrestricted power in respect of such property and estate for the following purposes, to wit:\n'(a) To sell all or any portion thereof, by private sale or otherwise upon such terms and for such prices as they see fit without the necessity of judicial authorization, but with the consent or the assistance of the tutor to the minors or of the curator to any substitution under the said will; to join with others in all deeds of partition or otherwise concerning property held jointly or forming part of any community; to grant good and effectual title to all or any of the same; to lease, mortgage, hypothecate or in any other way dispose of or alienate the same or any part thereof; to make any and all conveyances, transfers or assignments and all contracts and agreements of and concerning the same which they may see fit; to grant all receipts and discharges necessary in the premises and all delays for payment or otherwise which in their discretion they may deem necessary or advisable; to borrow upon the security of such property or any part thereof all sums they may deem necessary in the interest of the estate; to invest all moneys now in their hands or hereafter realized and collected and the proceeds of all sales in such manner as they may deem advisable, and until such time as the same are paid or handed over to the legatees entitled thereto under the said will or otherwise disposed of according to the provisions of this Act.'\n'(b) To pay over, out of the cash assets of the estate and the amount realized from any sales of the property of the succession to the legatees named in the said will, the respective amounts of their legacies on the basis hereinafter provided at such time or times and in such amount or amounts as the executors shall have on hand; provided, however, that, at the date of distribution of any moneys in payment of legacies, each legatee shall receive a \"pro rat\u00e0\" amount of his or her legacy.'\n'(c) To capitalize the annuity of five hundred dollars per annum payable to Miss Jane Cooper and the annuity of one thousand dollars per annum payable to Dame Theresa Heney, widow of the testator's son, the late John McGarvey, at five per centum interest, to wit: ten thousand dollars and twenty thou- sand dollars respectively; the revenue upon which capitalized sums shall represent the annual value to each of the said legatees of her legacy respectively, whether the amount derived from the same is equal to the amounts mentioned in the will or not. The legacy of the annuity of five hundred dollars per annum shall be due and payable to Miss Jane Cooper on and after the 31st October, 1903.'\n'3.\u2014All the legacies of whatsoever kind, other than that of the testator's share in the immovable lot No. 910 of St. Antoine Ward of the City of Montreal, shall be subject to a uniform reduction in proportion to their respective amounts in the event of the estate not realizing sufficient to pay them in full.'\n'This section shall not apply to the legacy to Dame Theresa Heney and Margaret McGarvey before the 31st of October, 1903,'\n'4.\u2014The said executors are authorized to pay and hand over to the residuary legatee, Dame Annie McGarvey, wife of the said William McNally, and she is authorized to receive, and hold upon such security as the Superior Court or any judge thereof shall, upon application of the executors or the said residuary legatee, determine, the capital of all annuities and amounts which may form part of the residue of said estate until her death, or her handing over thereof according to law and the provisions of the said will.'\n\"As we have just seen, the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 136, sec. 3, states no reduction will be made in the \" plaintiff's legacy, before October 31st, 1903. We must remember that the 31st October, 1903, is the date fixed by the will of Owen McGarvey, for the winding-up of his estate. \"The defendants took possession of the estate of Owen McGarvey, as executors, and Joseph Cooper, being a resident of Lindsay, Ontario, had very little, if anything, to do with the administration of the estate, and defendant McNally, on the other hand, left the whole administration in the hands of John W. Grier, of Montreal.\n\"It appears, from the evidence, that the defendants did not change, in any manner, the investments made by the late Owen McGarvey, in his lifetime, and did not invest or set apart $ 50,000, for the plaintiff; and the plaintiff complains that she received considerably less than the legal interest on the sum of $50,000, even during the year immediately following the decease of Margaret Cooper, during which year, according to the statute of 1903, there was to be no reduction.\n\"The plaintiff caused her attorneys to write, on the 18th of October, 1904, a letter, whereby she asked that the legacy upon which she depends be invested, as provided for in the will, and, in the second place, that she should receive a regular income, at stated intervals.\n\"The defendant McNally having refused to meet her wishes, she took the present action. The plaintiff alleges in her declaration, that, in and by section 3 of the said Act of 1903, it was ordained and decreed that all legacies, with one exception, should be subject to a uniform reduction, in the event of the estate not realizing sufficient to pay them in full, said reduction, however, not being applicable to the plaintiff, in any event, before October 31st, 1903; that the plaintiff has not been notified, by the defendants, of any reduction being necessary, as regards her said legacy, and is entitled to have the full benefit thereof; that the said defendants have always failed and neglected to invest the said capital sum of $50,000 with first-class security, as bound and obliged to do by the said last will and testament of the said Owen McGarvey, although duly requested so to do, particularly, by letter bearing date October 18th, 1904; that the said defendants, \u00e9s qualit\u00e9 have failed and neglected to pay and satisfy to the said plaintiff the interest on the said sum of $50,000 at the legal rate of 5 per cent, per annum, and the said plaintiff has only received, on account of the said annuity, for the years ending October 31st, 1904, the sum of $3,725, leaving a balance due to her, for the said years, of $1,275; that the said plaintiff has just cause to fear that, unless the said sum of $50,000 is invested in first-class security, as provided for in and by the said testament and Act, she will lose her claim and sustain damage. And, by her conclusions, the plaintiff prays:\n'(a) That the said defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, be adjudged and condemned jointly and severally, to pay and satisfy to her, out of the assets of the said estate, the sum of $1,275, with interest, on the sum of $350, from 31st October, 1903, and, on $925, from 31st October, 1904.'\n'(b) That, in the event of the said defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, being unable to pay and satisfy to the said plaintiff the said sum of $1,275, with interest, as aforesaid, out of the assets of the said estate, the said defendants be personally condemned, jointly and severally, to the payment of the said sum, or such part thereof, as may not be paid by the said estate.'\n'(c) That the said defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, be ordered and condemned, jointly and severally, to invest the said sum of $50,000, with first-class security, for the benefit of the said plaintiff, within such delay as the court may fix, and to pay her interest on the said sum, at the legal rate of 5 per cent. per annum, on the 31st of October of each year, or at such date or dates as the court may decide.'\n'(d) That, in the event of the said defendants declaring themselves unable to set aside the whole of the said sum of $50,000 for the purpose and in the manner aforesaid, they be, jointly and severally, adjudged and condemned to render to the said plaintiff a true and faithful account of the estates of the said late Owen McGarvey and Dame Margaret Cooper, with receipts and vouchers (pi\u00e8ces justificatives), indicating why the whole of the said sum of $50,000 cannot be set aside, as aforesaid, the whole with costs.'\n\"The defendant James Cooper has not pleaded to the action, but the defendant McNally pleads, as executor of the estate of the late Dame Margaret Cooper, by demurrer, that plaintiff's action is premature, inasmuch as she is only entitled to her bequest, under the will of the Dame Margaret Cooper, in the event of her having suffered a diminution of her legacy under the will of the late Owen .McGarvey and no such diminution is alleged.\n\"By a further plea, he admits, in substance, the making of the wills, their contents, the death of the testators, defendants' appointments, and the passing of the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 136, and denies that the defendants have failed to invest the capital sum of $50,000, and alleges that the plaintiff has always received the full income and revenue of her legacy, and he further says that the late Dame Margaret Cooper, and Owen McGarvey, were in community as to property, the assets of which community consisted almost wholly of real estate held and administered in undivided ownership by the executors of their respective estates; that the sale or division of the properties, if forced, would entail great loss, and the defendant would be unable to carry out the provisions of the will of the said late Margaret Cooper, and that defendant, in the exercise of his discretion, deems it advisable to dispose of the said property only as the demand for the same may arise and at prices nearly representing their value, and that, until the final sale and division of the said properties, it is impossible to say what sum, if any, may be due to the plaintiff, under Dame Margaret Cooper's will.\n\"As executor of the will of the late Owen McGarvey, defendant McNally pleads, making substantially the same admissions and denials as in the foregoing plea, and, especially, invoking the whole of the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 136, and alleges that plaintiff's legacy, together with the residue of the said two estates was invested in hypothecs upon real estate and real estate chosen by the testator himself, and that the plaintiff has always been paid the full revenue of her legacy; that the assets of the said estates consisted, for the most part, of real estate which can only be divided at a loss, and the defendant, in the exercise of his discretion, admits the advisability of selling the said real estate to the best advantage, only when a demand for the same arise, in accordance with the terms of the said will, and with the Act, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 136.\n\"On the twenty-fourth day of October, 1905, the Superior Court, at Montreal, Fortin J., dismissed plaintiff's action, with costs, for the following reasons: 'Considering that plaintiff has not established the allegations of her declaration, and that defendant McNally has established his pleas.'\n'Considering that, neither by the will of the late Owen McGarvey, nor by the statute, 3 Edw. VII. ch. 136, are the executors bound to sell and dispose of the assets of the testator's succession, within any specified delay, or to change the nature of the investments made by said deceased.'\n'Considering that plaintiff has received, from the said succession the revenue of the said sum of $50,000.'\n'Considering that plaintiff, as legatee by particular title, cannot compel defendants to render, at the present time, an account of their administration of said succession.'\n'Doth maintain defendant McNally's pleas, and dismiss plaintiff's action, with costs.'\n\"McNally pretends that the part of the plaintiff's. action, and her last conclusion, relating to the estate of the late Margaret Cooper is premature, inasmuch as she is only entitled to her bequest under the will of the said Dame Margaret Cooper, in the event of her having suffered a diminution of her legacy under the will of the late Owen McGarvey, and no such diminution is alleged.\n\"The plaintiff alleges, and it is shewn, in the record, that the defendants, as executors of the will of the late Owen McGarvey, are not now in a position to invest the whole of the sum of $50,000 for the plaintiff, as directed by the will of the late Owen McGarvey, and, consequently, her demand of an account seems pertinent.\n\"Defendant McNally denies that he has failed to invest the said sum of $50,000, and alleges that the plaintiff has received the full income or revenue of her legacy.\n\"I am not prepared to say that the defendants could not, in executing the will of Owen McGarvey, set apart some property of his estate, as an investment of the whole or of part of the said $ 50,000, because, by article 981 C.C., investments can be made in real estate; but I say that, to execute the will of the late Owen McGarvey, the defendants must set apart, for the plaintiff, some property of the estate, or make an investment otherwise according to law.\n\"The defendant maintains that the plaintiff has received the full income or revenue of her legacy.\n\"The defendants have not proved that; and they are not in a position to prove what was the income or revenue of the investment of f 50,000, because they have made no investment. And, having made no investment, I believe they are bound to pay to the plaintiff the legal interest on the said sum of $50,000, as compensation for the revenues of the investment which they were bound to make and which they did not make.\n\"The defendant says that this is not the proper-time to dispose of the real property.\n\"This might be said in the interest of the defendant's wife, who is the universal legatee of Owen McGarvey, but the defendants must execute the will.\n\"I have already cited a clause of the will of Owen McGarvey expressing a desire and direction that his estate be closed, within one year from the death of his wife. The same direction is expressly given later: 'As to the balance or remainder of my estate, I give and bequeath the enjoyment and usufruct thereof to my daughter, Annie McGarvey, wife of William McNally, during her lifetime, from the close and final settlement of my estate, which is to be within one year after the death of my wife.'\n\" 'Winding-up' means the realization of the assets and investments, as in the case of corporations (R.S.C. ch. 129).\n\" 'Wind up' is defined in the standard dictionary, 'to bring into a conclusion or a settlement.' Surely this is not done by leaving everything in statu quo.\n\"The executors' obligation to invest is further expressed by clause 11 of the will:\n'I desire that, in so far as regards the investment of any money, which they should deem necessary to make, my said executors shall not be restricted to investments in which, by law, executors are bound to invest, and that they shall not be responsible for any loss which may happen in consequence.'\n\"Such clause is hardly necessary, if defendants can leave everything in abeyance.\n\"McNally contends that the clear and imperative terms of the wills of both Mr. and Mrs. McGarvey were rendered inexistent by the bill which he obtained from the Legislative Assembly, in Quebec, and for which he saddled the estate with the sum of $1,918.41.\n\"The parties have not submitted to us the question whether the Legislature of Quebec, had the right to pass this extraordinary bill. It seems hard to believe that our legislators in Quebec have any mandate from the electors to change wills. We might perhaps properly say that they are sent there to administer the public affairs of the province.\n\"The object of the bill, as appears by the title and preamble, is threefold:\n\"To extend the powers of the executors; \"To provide for the payment of legacies;\n\"To make .provision for the administration and 'winding-up' of the estate.\n\"Clause 1, and sub-section (a) thereof, leave no doubt as to the powers of the executors to sell the real estate; but do not, in any way, relieve them from the obligation of investing $50,000, to pay the plaintiff as prayed for in the conclusion (c) of her declaration.\n\"Sub-sections (b) and (c) of clause 1 provide that the legacies will suffer a shrinkage, their total amount being $86,729.15, as against $80,167.34, being the assessed or estimated value of the estate, which consists mainly of immovable property.\n\"Moreover, by clause 3, the reduction does not apply to plaintiff's legacy before October 31st, 1903.\n\"What would be the use of such a clause, if the legislature, as well as the testator, had not had in view the proceeds invested before the 31st of October, 1903? Thereafter, of course, any diminution in the value of the properties in which the fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) would be invested, and of the revenue derived therefrom, would fall upon the plaintiff.\n\"Moreover, how could the amount be completed with funds accruing from Margaret Cooper's estate, if the whole of the two estates remained intact, and no investments were made, for the purpose of paying plaintiff the income, revenue or interest thereof?\n\"The bill contains no provision regarding the winding-up of the estate, save clause 4, which empowers the executors to hand over to Mrs. William McNally the residue of the estate which may not have been otherwise invested for the carrying out of particular legacies, upon giving proper security.\n\"On the whole, I say that the executors were bound to sell enough of the real estate of Owen McGarvey to put aside for the plaintiff a sum of $50,000, or such portion thereof as \u00abmay correspond to the proportion between the assets of the estate with the amount of the particular legacies, or to set apart, for her, properties to that amount, and, in any event, to complete the said amount of $50,000, by means of a sum realized out of Margaret Cooper's estate.\n\"I also believe that it is in the interest of all parties concerned that this estate be wound up as soon as possible; for the administration which is made of the same is not an advantageous administration. One of the executors resides at Lindsay, Ontario, and he takes no part in the administration. The other executor, McNally, resides at Montreal, but he, as well, does not bother himself much about the estate. He knows nothing of the affairs of the estate, and, when he is asked what are the revenues, he answers that he does not know, and to ask John Hyde, an accountant, a stranger, who, of course, will ask Mr. Grier. Grier seems to administer that estate as he pleases, and he gets ten per cent, on the gross revenues, when that administration could be better attended to by responsible companies who charge only five per cent.\n\"In conclusion, I say that the plaintiff has good grounds of complaint, and that it is the duty of the court to come to her relief.\n\"I am of opinion to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court, and to dismiss the pleas of the defendant McNally, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, with costs, and to maintain the demand of the plaintiff, and condemn the defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, as executors of the will of the late Owen McGarvey to pay to the said plaintiff the sum of $1,275, with interest, on the same, from 10th day of September, 1904, the date of the service of this action, and to order and condemn the defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, to invest within six months from this date, the sum of $50,000 or so much as the plaintiff is entitled to have from the estate of the late Owen McGarvey, with first-class securities, for the benefit of the said plaintiff, and to condemn the defendants to pay the costs of the plaintiff's demand in the Superior Court and the costs in this court, reserving to adjudicate hereafter on the other portions of the plaintiff's demands, and reserving also to the said plaintiff all other recourse which she may have in the premises.\"\nSurveyer, for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C. and Duclos K.C., for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014We are again invited to give effect to a statute of the Legislature of Quebec undertaking to substitute a will of its own for the will of the testator, Owen McGarvey, in his lifetime, furniture manufacturer, of Montreal, and this in spite of the strongest enactment made by the Imperial Parliament as early as 1774, in 14 Geo. III., ch. 83, generally known as \"The Quebec Act,\" which is the first Imperial charter of Canada outside the capitulation and the Treaty of Paris.\nSection 10 of that Act provides that it shall be lawful for any person freely to \"devise or bequeath * * by last will and testament\" any property he may have or leave at his death. This enactment has been reproduced in the Civil Code, forms the general law of the province and has always been looked upon as one of the dearest rights of. every British subject. Mr. Owen McGarvey has made a will under these laws; but, after his death, the provincial legislature was requested by his heirs to make another will or at least materially change the same. Mr. Justice Mathieu, who dissented in the Court of Review, observes that\nit seems hard to believe that our legislators in Quebec have any mandate from the electors to change wills.\nBut, as long as these extraordinary bills are not disallowed by the Government of Canada, which is the constitutional guardian of the liberties of the people of the Dominion, we must accept them as binding laws. The Imperial Parliament always could and still can change these laws, but, with regard to property and civil rights, a provincial legislature is as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament, subject to the veto power.\nI do not intend to review all the facts of the case. They are fully set forth in Mr. Justice Mathieu's dissenting judgment in which I concur and I merely refer to it to ascertain what they are.\nWe are unanimously of opinion that the judgments of the two courts below are wrong and must be reversed. It is contended by the respondent that the time for winding up the estate has been extended indefinitely, just as the executors deem expedient. This court does not entertain that view; and, although I have some doubt upon the point, it is not strong enough to induce me to dissent from the majority, and, as usual in cases like this, as I observed in the case of Pr\u00e9vost v. Lamarche[1], that doubt should be given in favour of the will of the testator.\nWith regard to the second point involved in the appeal, viz., that the sum of $50,000 be invested for the benefit of the appellant, no doubt is possible. The clause of the will is clear and is not in any way changed or affected by the Quebec statute. Here it is, word for word:\nI give and bequeath, after the death of my said wife, to my said daughter, Margaret McGarvey, during her lifetime, the income or revenue of the capital sum of fifty thousand dollars, current money of Canada, which capital shall be invested with first-class security by my executors for the best advantage of my said daughter, and at the death of my said daughter, the said capital I give and bequeath to her lawful children and descendants, to be divided amongst them, share and share alike, by families, \"par souche?' according to law, and to be then their own and absolute property for ever.\nWe are, therefore, of opinion that the appellant is entitled to the main conclusions of her action. If the estate of the late Mr. McGarvey be not sufficient to bear the investment of the whole amount, then the deficit should be met by the estate of his late wife.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and, adopting the formal judgment suggested by Mr. Justice Mathieu, the demand of the appellant should be maintained with costs in all courts and the defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, as executors of the will of the late Owen McGarvey, as amended by the Quebec statute, 3 Edw. VII., ch. 136, are condemned to pay to the said appellant (plaintiff in the court below), the sum of $1,275 with interest on the same from the 10th day of September, 1904, the date of the service of this action, and they are further ordered and condemned es qualit\u00e9 to invest, within six months from this date, the sum of $50,000, or so much as the plaintiff is entitled to have from the estate of the said late Owen McGarvey, with first-class security for the benefit of said plaintiff, reserving to adjudicate hereafter on any other portion of the plaintiff's demand and reserving also to the said plaintiff all other recourses she may have in the premises. The motion to quash should be dismissed with costs, as the amount involved in this appeal is the investment of a sum of $ 50,000, which is quite sufficient to give us jurisdiction.\nDavies J.\u2014I am to allow this appeal.\nI do not think the statute enlarges the express limitations of the will as to the time within which the estate should be wound up.\nI think there should be judgment accordingly and a declaration to that effect and also that the executors should proceed without delay to administer the estate and render full accounts to the appellant (plaintiff) of their administration in the proper court.\nIdington J.\u2014I think the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Justice Mathieu, who dissented in the court below are correct.\nI adopt, speaking generally, his reasoning save as indicated hereunder and that questioning the right of the legislature as to amending wills. In this latter regard, I neither approve nor disapprove of what may have been done. The clear purpose of the testator was that, at least within the year next after the death of his wife, the estate would be wound up.\nThe legislation got facilitated this being done.\nThe same legislation as clearly as possible indicates that the appellant's rights should not be interfered with.\nIt seems idle to talk of the testator's real estate as he left it being such an investment as he contemplated when he directed as follows:\nI give and bequeath, after the death of my said wife, to my said daughter, Margaret MeGarvey, during her lifetime, the income or revenue of the capital sum of fifty thousand dollars current money of Canada, which capital shall be invested with first-class security by my executors for the best advantage of my said daughter; and, at the death of' my said daughter, the said capital I give and bequeath to her lawful children and descendants, to be divided amongst them, share and share alike, by families, \"par souche\" according to law, and to be then their own and absolute property forever.\nThe will also contains the following order:\nI wish and direct that my estate be settled and wound up within one year from the day of the death of my said wife.\nI venture to say that the testator's language is so clear in respect to the duty to be discharged by the executors as regards appellant's rights in the estate that, if they delayed obeying the directions given thereby so that the appellant has suffered any loss, they must make it good.\nI should suppose that five per cent, could easily have been got in good safe investments and, for that reason, assent to the conclusion of Mr. Justice Mathieu that no investment having been made the legal rate may properly be adopted as the measure of appellant's claim in the absence of such investment.\nI would not desire to be bound to that holding as a rule of law under all circumstances.\nPrima facie it may well be accepted as a guide.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the courts below to the appellant throughout.\nSince writing the foregoing, I have concurred in the form of judgment drawn up by Mr. Justice Girouard, the acting Chief Justice.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. agreed with Mr. Justice Girouard.\nThe formal judgment, concurred in by all the judges, was as follows: The appeal is allowed with costs; the demand of the appellant is maintained with costs in all courts and the defendants, \u00eas qualit\u00e9, as executors of the will of the late Owen McGarvey, as amended by the Quebec statute, 3 Edw. VII., ch. 136, are condemned to pay to the said appellant (the plaintiff in the court below), the sum of $1,275 with interest on the same from the 10th of September, 1904, the date of the service of this action, and they are further ordered and condemned es qualit\u00e9 to invest, within six months from this date, the sum of $50,000, or so much as the plaintiff is entitled to have from the estate of the said late Owen McGarvey, with first-class security, for the benefit of said plaintiff, reserving to adjudicate hereafter on any other portion of the plaintiff's demand and reserving also to the said plaintiff all other recourses she may have in the premises.\nThe motion to quash is dismissed with costs fixed at fifty dollars.\nMotion dismissed with costs and appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, Mitchell & Surveyer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Atwater & Duclos.\n[1] 38 Can.

The company in question is the Acadia Pulp & Paper Mills Company, Limited, incorporated by special Act of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia, being ch. 95 of the Acts of 1897, giving the company power among other things: \"2 (c). To carry on a general manufacturing business, including the manufacture of lumber, wood, pulp, paper, and all sorts of wooden goods, and in connection therewith to purchase, supply, dispose of and sell the usual commodities, goods and supplies incidental to any business undertaken by the company.\n\"(d) In connection with the foregoing, to have all the rights, powers, franchises and privileges that a private individual would possess and enjoy.\"\nThe company by trust deed dated the 1st day of May, 1897, conveyed to the respondent, therein called \"the present trustees\" as trustee for bondholders, its freehold lands, hereditaments, water, and other rights and premises respectively specified and referred to in schedule with the mills, buildings, fixed machinery, and other fixtures, boilers, engines, machines and plant affixed or appertaining thereto, to hold the same unto and to the use of the trustee, subject nevertheless as thereinafter provided. The trust deed also contains. the following clause:\n\"3. The company hereby charges in favour of the present trustees its other assets whatsoever and wheresoever for the time being both present and future including its uncalled capital with the payment of all monies for the time being owing on the security of these presents and such charge shall rank as a floating charge and shall accordingly in no way hinder the company from selling, alienating, leasing, paying dividends out of profits or otherwise disposing of or dealing with such assets in the ordinary course of its business and for the purpose of carrying on the same but the company shall not be entitled to mortgage or charge the same in priority to or pari passu with the security hereby constituted.\"\nThe company carried on its business until June, 1903. In September, 1901, the company arranged with the appellant for a loan of $40,000 security to be given under the Bank Act upon its pulp wood piled at various places. This loan to the extent of $33,753 was required to pay for pulp wood, and the balance for carrying on the company's business, i.e., to convert the wood into pulp and market same.\nThe loan was advanced in two sums, of $16,000, October 3rd, 1901, and $24,000 November 11th, 1901. For the $16,000, security under the Bank Act was given.\nThe company made all payments secured by the trust deed till May, 1903. $10,000.00 of the $16,000.00 was then and is still due to appellant.\nThe appellant, when the balance of the $40,000 loan, i.e., $24,000, was advanced November 11th, 1901, received from the company an agreement to give security on its pulp wood.\nThe security in accordance with this agreement was no doubt given, but it has been lost. Of this $24,000.00, the sum of $16,000.00 remains unpaid.\nThe bank, when the company defaulted its bonds, took possession under its securities of the pulp wood on hand. The trustee thereupon claimed to be entitled to the pulp wood under the trust deed.\nPursuant to agreement this pulp wood was manufactured and converted into money, without prejudice to the rights of either party, realizing $14,661.00, which is the fund in question in this action. The action was brought by the respondent hereinafter called The Trustee against the appellant, hereinafter called \"The Bank\u201d The Acadia Pulp and Paper Mills Company, Limited, hereinafter called \"The Company,\" and Walter G. Jones, receiver and manager for the bondholders, plaintiff claiming a declaration that the fund in question is subject to the lien of the trust deed and that same is a first charge thereon and that the receiver is in duty bound to pay over the fund to plaintiff. The action was defended by the bank, which also counterclaimed for a declaration that the fund in question was subject to the lien of securities under section 74(2) of the Bank Act (53 Vict. ch. 31), given by the company to the bank, and that such securities have priority to lien or charge created by the trust deed, and that the receiver is in duty bound to pay over the fund to the .bank. The action was tried before the Judge in Equity (Mr. Justice Graham) at the April sittings, 1907, at Halifax, and he subsequently filed a decision in favour of the bank upon which an order for judgment was taken out on the 10th day of July, 1907, dismissing the action of the trustee and adjudging that the fund in question is subject to first lien in favour of the bank upon securities under the Bank Act for a sum exceeding the amount of the fund, and adjudging and decreeing that the receiver and manager for the bondholders do pay over the fund, with interest, to the bank. From this decision and order thereon, the trustee appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, and the appeal was heard before three judges of that court, namely: the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Meagher, and Mr. Justice Longley, in February, 1908, and subsequently the judges who heard the appeal pronounced their decision allowing such appeal and reversing the judgment and order appealed from and ordering payment of the fund to the trustee, and on the 14th day of March, 1908, order was taken out in accordance with this decision. From such decision and order the present appeal has been taken by the bank.\nW. B. A: Ritchie K.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe K.C. and J. J. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nW. B. A: Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The trust deed prevents the company imposing a general charge on its property but not the giving of a special security such as that in favour of appellants. See Lindley on Companies (6 ed.), p. 321; In re Old Bushmills Distillery Co.[1].\nThe advances from the bank were for the purpose of carrying on the business of the company which was not a violation of the terms of the trust deed. Wheatley v. Silkstone and Haigh Moor Coal Co.[2]; Government Stock Investment Co., v. Manila Railway Co.[3].\nThe bank was a purchaser for value and the burden of proving notice of the restriction in the trust deed was on the respondents. Robson v. Smith[4]. The conversation over the telephone, even if proved, was too late to amount to notice. See English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co. v. Brunton[5].\nNewcombe K.C. and J. J. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents. The security given to the bank is clearly within the prohibition contained in the trust deed.\nThe only question is whether or not the bank had notice of this prohibitive clause, and if the onus of proving notice is on the respondents it has been satisfied. See Lindley on Companies (6 ed.), PP- 321-2. Cox v. Dublin City Distillery Co.[6].\nThe manager of the company gave affirmative evidence of the conversation by which notice was given to the bank manager. Such evidence must prevail over that of the manager who merely swore that he had no recollection of the conversation. Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin[7].\nGirouard, Davies and Maclennan JJ. agreed in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons that appear in the judgments of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and others in which reasons I fully concur.\nI may add that I think it quite probable that at the time Mr. Jones says he read over the paragraph of the contract now in question to Mr. Thorne, the latter supposed that the remote contingency of the floating security becoming mature and enforcible before the pulp wood taken by the bank as security had been fully realized upon and the loan it secured repaid was not worth much consideration. In such case, a matter so dismissed would not likely impress his memory.\nProbably that way of looking at the matter was, as things then appeared, quite reasonable.\nIf the security receipts had been enforced as the notes fell due, it may well be that the respondents never would have intervened.\nIt seems to me a ease where of two respectable men one might have no reason to be impressed and the other, from his point of view, felt so impressed, that, unless he made the explanation he says he did, he might be in the way of becoming a candidate for the penitentiary.\nIt was urged upon us that the following part of a paragraph of the floating security deed, that is,\nbut the company shall not be entitled to mortgage or charge the same in priority to or pari passu with the security hereby constituted,\ndid not extend to such a charge as usual security receipts; I do not see why not. The mode of reasoning that would exclude it might be applied to any number of other securities of which each covered only a part of the available assets of the company, and thus render the debenture security worthless.\nIf it had become necessary to hold otherwise, I should have felt pressed to consider thoroughly, as I have not done, section 74 of the Bank Act on which the appellants' claim rests and the company's Act of incorporation.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondents are the trustees under a trust deed to secure the debentures of the Acadia Pulp Company, dated 1st May, 1907. The deed contains the following clause:\nThe company hereby charges in favour of the present trustees its other assets whatsoever and wheresoever for the time being both present and future, including its uncalled capital and the payment of all moneys for the time being owing on the security of these presents, and such charge shall rank as a floating charge, and shall, accordingly, in no way hinder the company from selling, alienating, leasing, paying dividends out of profits or otherwise disposing of or dealing with such assets in ordinary course of its business and for the purposes of carrying out the same, but the company shall not be entitled to mortgage or charge the same in priority to or pari passu with the security hereby constituted.\nThe question in the action out of which the appeal arises, and the sole question in the appeal, is whether or not certain pulp wood acquired by the pulp company, after the issue of the debentures, is subject to the charge created by this clause to the exclusion of the claim of the appellant bank.\nThe bank's claim is based upon a security, dated 3rd October, 1901, given to it under section 74 (now section 88), of the Bank Act, which professes to charge in its favour the pulp wood in question with the re-payment of an advance of $16,000. There was a further advance in the following month, with respect to which different considerations might apply, but they need not concern us as the proceeds of the pulp wood mentioned, assuming them to be applicable in liquidation of the bank's claim, are less than $16,000, the amount of the first advance.\nThe grounds on which the bank bases its appeal are two:\u2014First, it is argued that the instrument creating the security upon which its claim rests, is not one which, within the meaning of the clause I have quoted above, professes to \"mortgage or charge\" the subject of the security \"in priority to or in pari passu with the security\" constituted by the trust deed; and secondly, the bank sets up the defence of purchaser for value without notice.\nAs regards the first of these contentions, after a close consideration of Mr. Ritchie's ingenious argument, I do not think that one fails to do justice to it in saying that a sufficient answer appears to be that the bank's security is within the plain meaning of the words quoted, and I am quite unable to discover any adequate reason for so restricting their meaning as to exclude that security from their operation.\nThe point of substance arises out of the second ground. It is not disputed that before making the advance, in respect of which its security was taken, the bank had notice of the fact that the pulp company had issued debentures and had executed an instrument of some character charging its property or some of its property with the payment of the debentures. At this point, however, agreement on the facts ends and controversy begins. The general manager of the bank said he had no knowledge of what property of the company was affected by this charge. The manager of the pulp company says that, on the day on which the security was given, he had a discussion with the general manager of the bank in which he called the attention of the latter to an addendum to the printed form of the security he had executed, quoting section 75 of the Bank Act; and to the statement in the security itself to the effect that the goods comprised in it were free from any charge; and asked that, if in view of the existence of the debentures, and of the mortgage securing them, it was right that he should commit himself to that statement; and he says he was assured by the general manager that the bank understood the circumstances, and the course taken Vas quite usual. He added, that later on the same day, at the request of the general manager of the bank, he read to him over the telephone the clause referred to. The general manager denies that the first of these interviews took place; as to the second he was unable to say that the clause referred to was not read over to him; he could only say that he did not remember it.\nIn this state of the evidence it is, perhaps, unfortunate that we have not any findings of the learned trial judge dealing expressly with the point whether through its general manager the bank had or had not actual notice of the material provisions of the trust deed. The language of the learned judge seems to imply that he accepts the evidence of the manager of the pulp company, but I am not entirely satisfied that it was his intention to pass upon the point. The full court, taking the view that the onus in this controversy is with the respondents, unanimously accepted that evidence and held it sufficient to determine the question of notice or no notice against the bank. In these circumstances it would, perhaps, be sufficient to say that (assuming the view of the court below on the question of onus to prevail), the credibility of neither of the witnesses referred to being seriously impugned, there is a great weight of probability in favour of the view that the witness who related in detail an occurrence which he says he recollects is not mistaken; and that, as regards the second and more important incident, there is really no ground on which a court of justice can properly refuse to accept his testimony as against a bare want of recollection on the part of the other witness; at least it may be said that there is no sufficient ground for disturbing a decision of the court of appeal based upon these considerations. There is another ground upon which the decision of the court below may be sustained. The respondents were the holders of a floating security which created a charge on their property but, subject to that charge, giving the company the right in the course of its business to dispose of its property subject again, however, to a particular qualification. The qualification was that the company was not to create any mortgage or charge ranking in priority to or in pari passu with the debentures. Such a charge is an equitable charge. It prevails by virtue of its priority in time as against subsequent equitable charges, if the equities of the two incumbrancers are otherwise equal. Re Castell & Brown Limited[8]. It prevails also against any subsequent incumbrancer acquiring the legal estate who does not fall within the category of purchaser for value without notice; any incumbrancer, that is to say, who does not make out, to adopt the language of Sir Francis Palmer, Company Precedents (9 ed.), part 3, page 71\n(a), that he was not aware of the existence of the floating charge; or (5) that though he was aware of the charge he was not aware of the qualification.\nThe learned judges below, as I have mentioned, have dealt with the question of notice upon the assumption that in that controversy the onus was upon the respondents; that, I think with very great respect, is a misapprehension of the law.\nThe plea of purchase for value without notice is (to quote Far-well J.\" in Re Nisbet & Potts Contract[9], at page 402) a single plea to be proved by the person pleading it; it is not to be regarded as a plea of purchase for value to be met by reply of notice.\nThat is perfectly well established by the authority to which Mr. Justice Farwell referred, namely the decision of the Court of Appeal (James, Baggallay and Thesiger L.JJ.), in Attorney-General v. Biphosphated Guano Co.[10], at page 337; and the opinion of Far-well J. himself was expressly approved in the Court of Appeal[11], at page 404, per Collins M.R.; at page 409, per Romer L.J., and at page 410, per Cozens-Hardy L.J. I have not overlooked the expressions in the Irish Court of Appeal, in Cox v. Dublin City Distillery Go.[12]; but the authorities I have mentioned do not appear to have been brought to the attention of the court, and, with great respect for the learned judges who took part in that decision, the observations there made cannot, I think, in view of these authorities, be accepted as correct statements of the law.\nThe onus is, then, upon the bank to shew that it acquired a legal title to the goods in question; and that the advance, which in this case constituted the consideration, was made without notice of the restriction which the trust deed placed upon the power of the pulp company to deal with its own assets. It is not necessary, I think, for the purposes of this case, to consider whether notice of the fact that there were debentures, and a trust deed affecting some sort of a charge upon the company's property, would, in itself, be sufficient to preclude the bank from setting up this defence. There is a dictum of Lord Esher, in English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co. v. Brunton[13], at page 711, to the effect that that alone would not be sufficient; there is a dictum of Lord Bowen, in the same case, that it is\npossible that he (the person setting up the defence) might escape, if in respect of a deed or debenture, such as is in question here, he does not know or honestly think, that the instrument was one which must affect his right.\nKay L.J. expressly abstains from accepting these views. Whether, however, Lord Esher is right in saying that what the subsequent incumbrancer has to prove is absence of actual notice of the particular restriction which is being infringed; or whether the suggestion of Bowen L.J., that, given notice of the deed or debentures, the reasonableness of abstaining from further inquiry is the true test; or whether, given such notice, the failure to inquire entails the consequences of actual notice of the contents of the instrument,\u2014these are questions which, in this case, may be put aside and upon which I desire to reserve any expression of opinion. I ought, perhaps, to add that the decision of Swinfen Eady J., in Re Valletort Steam Laundry Co., Limited[14] proceeds upon the view that, in the special circumstances of that case, the subsequent incumbrancers had a stronger equity than the debenture holders.\nIn this case, accepting the view of the law most favourable to the appellant, that expressed in the dictum of Lord Esher, that the bank has cast upon it the burden of proving only that it was not aware at the time it made the advance of the existence of the clause in question, and having regard to the evidence to which I referred, it seems quite impossible to hold that this burden has been discharged.\nTherefore, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

[1897] c. 142, s. 13.\nBy R.S.O. [1897] ch. 142, sec. 13 the owner of improvements in a river of stream used for floating down logs may obtain from a district judge an order fixing the tolls to be paid by other parties using such improvements. On application for a writ of mandamus to compel the judge to make such an order:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (16 Ont. L.R. 21) Davies J. dubitante and Idington J. expressing no opinion, that such an order had effect only in case of logs floated down the river or stream after it was made.\nHeld per Idington J.\u2014As sec. 15 gives the applicant for the order an appeal from the judge\u2019s refusal to make it mandamus will not lie.\nHeld, per Duff J.\u2014The mandamus could issue if the judge had jurisdiction to make the order though he refused to do so in the belief that a prior decision of a Divisional Court was res judicata as to his power.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court which sustained the refusal of a judge in chambers to issue a writ of mandamus.\nIn 1903 the C. Beck Mfg. Co. obtained an order from the judge of the District of Nipissing fixing the tolls to be paid on logs floated down a stream called Post Creek. This order was set aside by a Divisional Court on the ground that it related to operations before it was made and that the judge had not the necessary evidence before him to make a proper order and had not considered certain matters required by the Act. A fresh order was then obtained fixing the tolls, as the respondents, the Ontario Lumber Company, claimed, for future operations. The C. Beck Company claimed to be entitled under this to payment of tolls for logs floated before it was made and brought action to recover the same, but failed in all the courts. The decision of the Court of Appeal in that action is reported[2], and affirms that of the Divisional Court[3].\nIn 1906 the C. Beck Co. applied to the district judge to take evidence for the purpose of fixing tolls which might be charged for logs driven on Post Creek in 1903 and on his refusal to hear the evidence or make the order they applied to a judge of the High Court for a writ of mandamus to compel him to do so. The writ was refused and the refusal sustained by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBicknell K.C., for the appellants. The respondents, the Ontario Lumber Co., in floating their logs down the stream and taking the benefit of the appellants\u2019 improvements must be held to have done so subject to payment of reasonable tolls therefor under the statute. See Burnett v. Lynch[4]; Moule v. Garrett[5]; Kelloch v. Enthoven[6]; Woodhouse v. Walker[7]. If the statute had not provided a mode for fixing the tolls the reasonableness or otherwise of appellants\u2019 demand would have been a question for the jury. Gunning on Tolls, p. 61.\nIf the judge has jurisdiction to make the order asked for, the judgment of the Divisional Court was wrong and cannot be res judicata against us. The judge may, in that case, be compelled by mandamus to exercise the jurisdiction he possesses. See Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago v. Erich\u00e9[8]; Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[9]; Reg. v. Judge of Southampton County Court[10]; Sawyer Massey Co. v. Parkin[11].\nShepley K.C. and A.G.F. Laurence, for the respondents. The statute by its terms only authorizes tolls to be fixed for the future. See judgments in C. Beck Mfg. Co. v. Ontario Lumber Co.[12], and in appeal[13].\nThe only remedy given to appellants for user of their improvements when no tolls are fixed is the lien on the logs passing through or over the same. Vestry of St. Pancras v. Batterbury[14]; Atkinson v. Newcastle & Gateshead Waterworks Co.[15]; The Queen v. County Court Judge of Essex[16].\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. It involves a mode of taxation, and as I read the statute its language does not justify the imposition of tolls for the past. I agree with Mr. Justice Meredith. DAVIES J.\u2014At the close of the argument in this case my inclination was to concur in the construction of the Act reached by Mr. Justice Garrow in the Court of Appeal and to hold that the fixing of what was a reasonable rate of toll to be charged for the use of the river improvements by those who used them applied as well to past as to future uses.\nI also reached the conclusion that in obedience to what he considered the judgment of the Divisional Court had declared the law to be the district judge had declined to hear or consider the application made to him to fix rates under the statute for the past user of the applicant\u2019s river improvements.\nI afterwards gave the case much consideration without changing the inclination I had reached after the argument at bar.\nI have since carefully read the judgments prepared by my brother judges and confess that their consideration has left my mind in some doubt on the main question of the construction of the statute authorizing rates to be fixed.\nUnder these circumstances I do not feel justified in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal or in dissenting from the judgment now proposed to be given.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014We are asked, as it seems to me, under the guise of an application for an order by way of mandamus, to sit in appeal upon not only an opinion of a Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice, but also by way of anticipation upon what that or another Divisional Court might see fit hereafter to hold; and that in a case in which the legislature created certain rights and deliberately decided that such rights should in the measuring of the same abide by the arbitrament of a power or powers the legislature saw fit to entrust with the determination in regard thereto.\nI decline to express any opinion upon any phase of the question raised save so far as to the necessity for, or right to make an application for writ of mandamus.\nThe applicants, now appellants, seem to have found a great deal of difficulty in getting to the point they set out to reach.\nI see none. It applied under R.S.O., [1897] ch. 142, for an order settling certain tolls which that Act provided for being paid, upon certain things happening, and according to a scale to be determined by the district judge. He made an order on appellant\u2019s application which provided, it is alleged, for tolls for uses of the stream improvements anterior to the application under the Act as well as posterior thereto. This was set aside. The reason for setting aside did not of necessity give rise to the consideration of the questions whereon the Divisional Court, setting it aside, passed an opinion. The learned judge thereupon made an order of the 30th March, 1904, upon the application of the appellants herein and in presence of counsel for all parties, but in accordance with the expressed opinions of the learned judges of the Divisional Court as he understood them, confined his order, it is said, to future uses of the improvements. Just here I would remark that if the appellants supposed this judgment erroneous they should at once have appealed to the court of appeal duly appointed by the said Act to hear any appeal from such erroneous decision, and have asked that the order be amended so as to decide as to, and if possible in law to embrace, the establishment of tolls for these anterior services.\nThat appellate jurisdiction was given by the following section fifteen of the said Act as follows:\nIn case a party interested is dissatisfied with the order or judgment of the judge or stipendiary magistrate, he may within fifteen days from the date thereof appeal from the order or judgment to a Divisional Court of the High Court; and a judge of the said court shall determine the time within which the appeal shall be set down to be heard, the security (if any) to be given by the appellant, and the persons upon whom notice of the appeal shall be served, the manner of service and all such other matters as he may deem necessary for the most speedy and least expensive determination of the matter of the appeal.\nInstead of asking the learned judge in disposing of that application to formulate a judicial order setting forth (which I have not the slightest doubt he, if asked, would have done) his reason for refusing, in such a way as to remove, if any doubt existed thereupon, all question of right to appeal to the proper court, the appellants dropped the application there, failed to take out any order, failed to appeal to the Divisional Court and applied afterwards for an order by way of mandamus which was refused and hence this appeal. I think section 15, quoted above, wide enough to have covered all and everything that could arise and which the legislature ever intended should arise in the way of regulating or enforcing the rights created by the statute.\nThe right to assert an appeal against a court asserting jurisdiction where it has none is a very common case, and I have not the slightest doubt of the right to appeal on the converse ground of failure to assert jurisdiction.\nProhibition and mandamus are useful remedies but not in either alternative the only remedies, where so wide and comprehensive an appellate right is given as here.\nThe appellant has not shewn any real difficulty to have arisen. It merely seems to have shied at the appearances in its way.\nIf authority be needed for the proposition that an objection for want of jurisdiction may be taken successfully in appeal though overruled in the court appealed from, I may refer to the case of Ferguson v. Corporation of Howick[17], and the numerous authorities therein cited.\nThe original theory was that the court when it found itself without jurisdiction or was found by an appellate court to be so, could neither make an order, nor be directed to make an order even as to costs.\nHoward v. Herrington[18] illustrates the later development.\nI am not concerned to do more here than shew that, where the words conferring appellate jurisdiction are unrestricted, no words specially dealing with the question of the inferior court\u2019s jurisdiction are needed.\nThe question of its jurisdiction is the first one an inferior court has to determine, whether arising on demurrer, or by plea in abatement as of old, or thrown in as an ingredient in the mixture composing a statement of defence under the modern system, or upon the mere suggestion that reaches the ear of the court in any regular way, or taken by the court, of its own mere motion.\nI cannot accept the theory that where the very essence of the matter over which jurisdiction is given is so limited in its sphere of existence or of operation as in this section, and that a jurisdiction is conferred, and is conditioned upon certain things having been done, it could ever have been intended to exclude from an appellate inquiry all that relates to such conditions or otherwise affects the limits of power.\nAn application for mandamus or for prohibition may not be merely discretionary when it comes to a question of having right done and no other way open.\nBut assuredly we should be slow to lead suitors to feel at liberty to travel beyond the assigned path for asserting rights created by a legislature that designated the path to be travelled to assert such rights.\nI do not think that path has been properly tried and for that if no other reason I would as already intimated reject this attempt to enlarge the sphere of action of this court.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons stated by Duff J.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an application of the appellants for a mandamus directing the respondent Valin, the judge of the district court of the District of Nipissing, to hear an application by the appellants for fixing tolls to be charged by them in respect of logs driven on Post Creek in the year 1903 under chapter 142, R.S.O. [1897]. The courts below have upheld the order of Mr. Justice Mabee in chambers dismissing the appellants\u2019 application. The appellants admittedly effected certain improvements in Post Creek in the years 1900 to 1902 which are improvements within the meaning of the statute refer- red to. It is not disputed, either, that an order, made by the respondent upon the application of the appellants fixing the tolls to be exacted from persons using these improvements for the floating of logs after the date of the order, was properly made; but it is contended that the statute confers no authority upon him to fix any toll in respect of any use of the improvements anterior to the fixing of the toll; and consequently that the learned judge has now no jurisdiction to hear any such application as that which the appellants ask the court to direct him to hear.\nTwo questions arise. The first is a question of substance, viz.: whether the statute does or does not authorize the maker of such improvements to exact tolls for the use of them anterior to the fixing of the tolls in the manner provided by the statute; the second is the question whether or not, assuming the point just stated to be decided in favour of the appellants, they are entitled, in view of the proceedings which have taken place, to be heard upon an application to fix tolls in respect of the use of their improvements during the years 1902 and 1903.\nTo deal first with the last-mentioned question. At the outset I am unable to entertain any doubt that the learned district judge refused to hear the appellants\u2019 application. What he did shews, I think, that he intended to decline to entertain it, and to decline on the ground that he had no jurisdiction. It follows that the appellants are right in the course they have taken to test the question of their right to a hearing.\nThe principal difficulty which in this branch of the argument the appellants have to meet is a difficulty which arises out of a previous judgment of the Divisional Court pronounced on the 10th of March, 1904, in an appeal under the statute referred to from an order made by the respondent Valin on the 25th of January, 1904. The last-mentioned order; which was made upon the application of the appellants, professed to fix generally a toll to be paid by the respondents, the Ontario Lumber Company, to the appellants in respect of timber transmitted through their improvements. This order was rescinded by the Divisional Court in the judgment just mentioned. The formal order set aside the order of the district judge,\nwithout prejudice to a further application by either party to the judge to fix a proper rate of tolls to be taken for the future by the Beck Company under the further evidence necessary.\nThe Divisional Court, therefore, did not profess to decide finally upon the merits of the application before the learned district judge; but they, assuming that the order of the learned district judge had the effect of fixing a toll in respect of a past user, did profess to determine finally that the district judge had no power under the statute to make an order with respect to such user. I think we may assume, for the purposes of this discussion, that the Divisional Court was right in its view of the scope of the learned judge\u2019s order; still I do not think that their decision touching the point of jurisdiction finally concludes the appellants in respect of it.\nThe right of appeal from the county or district judge given by the statute is an appeal from an order fixing the \u201camounts which any person entitled to tolls under the Act shall be at liberty to charge\u201d; without stopping to consider the extreme view that the function of the Divisional Court on the appeal is limited to a review of the decision of the judge upon any question of the amount of the toll, it does appear to me that, having regard to the provisions of the Act, it is hardly possible that the legislature could have intended the decision of a Divisional Court on such an appeal finally to conclude every question of law as well as of fact touching the power of the judge under the Act. It would have been easy to frame a statute in such terms as to make the decision of the county or district judge conclusive on every such question, subject only to an appeal to the Divisional Court. If the legislature had intended that I think some language would be found indicating it more pointedly than anything one finds in the Act. Indeed, I am quite unable to see how such a view can be taken of this statute consistently with what nobody of course disputes\u2014that the proceedings of courts of special statutory jurisdiction are (notwithstanding a right of appeal now almost invariably given from the decisions of such courts) every day the subjects of process in prohibition and mandamus.\nMoreover, here the case against such a construction appears unusually strong because of the circumstance that (for reasons to be mentioned presently) it seems clear that an order fixing tolls under this statute is very much in the nature of an order in rem, affecting quite conceivably, and I should think not uncommonly, people who hear of it for the first time long after the time prescribed by the Act for appeal has expired. I do not, of course, suggest that the Divisional Court may not have to consider, as the judge himself must have to consider, the scope of the judge\u2019s powers under the Act, but that is a very different thing from saying that every judgment of theirs upon such a question is necessarily decisive. If the judge assumes through a misconception of the statute to exercise a jurisdiction which the statute does not give him what he professes to do is I think a nullity; and the Divisional Court cannot, I think, by concurring in the misconception make that nullity a valid proceeding. If he declines jurisdiction where the statute enjoins him to act the remedy of the party aggrieved is, I think, to be pursued through an application to the general jurisdiction of the High Court.\nIt was argued indeed that the appellants\u2019 application ought not to be granted because the learned district judge would be bound on the hearing of the application by the decision of the Divisional Court already on appeal from him. It is quite clear, however, that no order for a mandamus could be granted except as the result of a determination that the respondent has the jurisdiction which the Divisional Court has held he has not; and it is not to be supposed that in such circumstances he would feel himself at liberty to disregard such a determination. It follows that if in substance the appellants are right there is nothing in the previous proceedings to prevent this court making the order which they ask.\nI think, nevertheless, that the appeal must fail because the construction placed by the Divisional Court upon the Act is the true construction.\nUnder the statutes in force at the time the Act was passed the law of Ontario was that all persons had the right during freshets to float timber down rivers and streams; and, to facilitate the floating of timber, to remove obstructions and construct such works as might be necessary.\nThe Act under consideration affirms these rights, but in another respect alters the law. The earlier statute in effect gave to all persons the right for the purpose of floating timber down stream to use with out compensation improvements made by others; the law was thus settled by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Caldwell v. McLaren[19]. The statute upon which the present dispute arises affirms this right also, but declares that it shall be subject to the payment of reasonable tolls to the person who has made the improvement; and the judge of the county court or the judge or stipendiary magistrate of the district where the improvement is situated is required, upon the application of the \u201cowner thereof or of any person who may desire to use the same\u201d to fix the amounts of such tolls, which amounts the judge, or stipendiary magistrate, as the case may be, is authorized to vary from time to time; and (section 13) the statute directs that\nthe judge or stipendiary magistrate in fixing the tolls shall have regard to and take into consideration the original cost of the construction and improvements, the amount required to maintain the same and to cover interest upon the original cost, as well as such other matters as under all the circumstances may seem just and equitable.\nIt would seem to be reasonably clear (although the language might have been perhaps a little more apt to the purpose) that the toll to be charged under the Act in respect of the use of a given improvement is to be a general toll equal in its operation; and what the judge or magistrate is authorized to fix is the amount of such a toll which, until varied under the power given by the Act, shall be chargeable uniformly against all persons alike who come under the statutory liability to pay. The power conferred upon these judicial officers is the power to determine the sum to be payable by the public in respect of the exercise of that which the statute declares to be a public right; and I think that the rule of construction applicable to such an enactment is that, in the absence of express provision, or at all events reasonable implication to the contrary, the statutory power is not to be exercised with reference to individuals as distinguished from the whole of those members of the public to whom the enactment may be applicable.\nThe construction placed by the Divisional Court upon the enactment is that the use of an improvement does not subject the user to any liability to the payment of tolls unless the amount of the toll was ascertained in the manner prescribed by the statute anterior to the use; and this construction the appellant impugns.\nA very little consideration will shew that the adoption of the appellant\u2019s construction will lead to rather startling results. It is common ground that the amounts payable in respect of tolls are not exigible until fixed by the statutory method. The statute prescribes no limitation upon the retrospective operation of an order fixing a toll; if such an order may operate retrospectively at all it may, it seems very clear, so operate over an unlimited period. Mr. Justice Street in delivering the judgment of the Divisional Court, to which reference has already been made, suggests a limitation of six years after the use of the improvement upon actions for tolls; but I think this is putting the case too favourably to the appellants\u2019 contention. Since the cause of action would not arise until the amount is fixed one does not easily see why until then the Statute of Limi- tations should begin to run. It is not unimportant to observe here that where the statutory conditions are fulfilled, that is to say, where there is an improvement within the meaning of the statute, the proper judicial officer is required to entertain the application and to make the order fixing the amount of toll. If the construction contended for by the appellant be the true one it would, I have no doubt, lead to the conclusion that the judicial officer would have authority in fixing the amount of a toll to be exacted in respect of a given improvement to distinguish between the sums chargeable for a past use and those chargeable for the future; but if the liability to pay for a use anterior to the fixing of tolls is created by the statute, then I think the statute must be held imperatively to require the proper judicial officer upon application to fix the amount of such tolls; and, as I have already said, there is nothing in the statute, expressly or impliedly, limiting the time within which the application is to be made.\nAgain, if the liability imposed by the statute upon persons making use of such improvements be such as is contended for one would naturally have expected\u2014in the view I have indicated that the incidence of the toll is general and equal\u2014that the legislature is empowering the owner of the improvement to make the application at any time after the use would have put it in the power of persons using an improvement to take steps themselves in the same circumstances to have the amount of the toll ascertained. It is not easy to believe that the legislature could have contemplated as a result of their legislation that the amount of this impost, levied in respect of the exercise of what it was at pains to declare to be a public right, might remain undetermined for an indefinite period during which persons who should have incurred liability to pay it, should be unable to relieve themselves from that liability or definitely to ascertain its extent. Yet it seems to be very clear that as regards users the legislature did not contemplate any application for the purpose of fixing the amount of tolls in respect of a past use; the language employed points very clearly to future use only. It may be said that the intended user has it in his power to have the toll fixed before incurring any liability; but many cases might occur in which this would be impracticable or altogether impossible.\nThere are in the statute other indications, mentioned in the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith in the court below, telling against the appellant\u2019s contention. I will not dwell upon these, but say simply that if that contention were accepted, the exaction of this impost might be attended with circumstances of inconvenience, to say nothing of injustice, wholly disproportionate to any sort of public advantage that can be conceived as possibly arising from the ex post facto operation of orders fixing tolls. A statute creating a liability of this kind ought not, I think, to receive a construction having that effect unless, as a matter of interpretation, the case in favour of it be overwhelming. Here I do not think that is so. I see no difficulty in reading the 11th section, which creates the liability in such a way as to make the ascertainment of the amount anterior to the use a condition of liability.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bicknell, Morine, Bain & Strathy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Laurence & Wadsworth.\n[1] 16 Ont. L.R. 21.\n[2] 12 Ont.

Co. provides that \u201cwhen approaching crossings and crowded places where there is a possibility of accidents the speed must be reduced and the car kept carefully under control. Go very slowly over all curves, switches and intersections; never faster than three miles an hour * *.\u201d A girl on the south side of Queen Street wished to cross to University Avenue which reaches but does not cross Queen. She saw a car coming along the latter street from the east and thought she had time to cross, but was struck and severely injured. On the trial of an action for damages the judge in his charge said: \u201cIt is not a question, gentlemen of the jury, as to the motorman\u2019s duty under the rule, it is a question of what is reasonable for him to do.\u201d The jury found that defendants were not guilty of negligence; that plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable care could have avoided the injury; and that she failed to exercise such care by not taking proper precautions before crossing. The action was dismissed at the trial; a Divisional Court ordered a new trial on the ground that the judge had misdirected the jury in withdrawing from their consideration the rules of the company; the Court of Appeal restored the judgment at the trial.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (15 Ont. L.R. 195) which set aside the order of the Divisional Court for a new trial (13 Ont. L.R. 423) Idington J dissenting, that the action was properly dismissed. Held, per Girouard and Duff JJ.\u2014The judge\u2019s charge was open to objection but as under the findings of the jury and the evidence plaintiff could not possibly recover a new trial should be refused.\nPer Davies J.\u2014There was no misdirection. The jury were not led to believe that the rules were not to be considered, but only that they should not be the standard as to what was or was not negligence, which question should be decided on the facts proved.\nPer Maclennan J.\u2014The place at which the accident occurred, where University Av. meets Queen Street, is not a crossing nor intersection within the meaning of the rules and they do not apply in this case.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the order of the Divisional Court for a new trial[2] and restoring the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. for the appellants.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. for the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The findings of the jury in this case are all against the plaintiff. They negative negligence on the part of the company and its mortorman and they find that the plaintiff could by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the injuries she sustained and that she neglected to take precautions in crossing the road. The trial judge on these findings entered judgment for the defendant. The Divisional Court on appeal, thinking there had been misdirection in the charge to the jury in having withdrawn from their consideration the rules of the defendant company, directed a new trial. On appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment was unanimously reversed and the judgment entered by the trial judge restored.\nI have read and re-read the judge\u2019s charge most carefully and have reached the conclusion that as a whole it was a painstaking and careful summing up of the facts and is not open to the charge of misdirection. I do not think the jury were misled into the belief that they were to banish these rules from their minds. What they were told was that they should not accept these rules as their standard or guide as to what was or was not negligence but should decide that question upon the facts as proved before them.\nThe crucial question was whether or not the motorman had his car under control at the time or was going at an improper rate of speed.\nThe learned judge charged: \u201cIt is not a question, gentlemen of the jury, as to the motorman\u2019s duty under the rule, it is a question of what is reasonable for him to do.\u201d That again is another way of saying the rules are not the standard to guide you to your conclusion as to the speed of the car or its control, but the determination of what was reasonable under the circumstances as proved. He may have obeyed the rule and still have been guilty of negligence. He may again have disobeyed the rule under circumstances and conditions which did not make him so guilty. The question was whether or not, under the proved facts, negligence on his part was shewn. I think this was the substance of his charge and I think it was right in law and was properly understood by the jury. I agree with the Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an accident case in which the motorman of respondent company ran down the appellant, a young woman whom he saw from the time she stepped off the south sidewalk on Queen Street to cross to the north side of that street in order to reach University Street or University Avenue running at right angles to the north side of Queen Street, until she was hit by the fender of the car he was driving with such force that she was tossed to one side and run over.\nIt so happened that she, in order to avoid a car running in a contrary direction to that of the one in question, had walked past the line of the point of junction of these streets and therefore had to cross so obliquely to reach her destination that her back was turned towards the motorman who saw her.\nShe says she had seen the car coming and had supposed she could have reached her destination on the north side of the track before the car in question, travelling at an ordinary rate, would overtake her.\nShe evidently miscalculated, and I am not going to pass any opinion upon whether that miscalculation was negligence or not when coupled with her failure to keep an eye on the moving car.\nThe only point in the case for present consideration is whether or not the motorman was negligent and whether or not the learned trial judge properly directed the jury in this regard.\nOne of the rules of the company for guidance of conductors and motormen is as follows: Rule 58. Curves and Crossings\u2014When approaching crossings and crowded places where there is a possibility of accidents, the speed must be reduced and the car kept carefully under control.\nGo very slowly over all curves, switches and intersections; never faster than three miles an hour, and extra caution must be used in handling double truck cars at such places.\nAn intersection must never be taken when another car is approaching.\nCross streets must not be blocked nor must any crossing be taken until the road ahead is clear.\nThe company called a witness named Whitehead who had been in their service for fourteen years as a motorman and previous to that had served in the same capacity in Cleveland.\nHe gave the results of his long experience and of his experience as an instructor of motormen for the company in the following evidence:\nQ. In the special instructions to motormen on page 16 of the Rules, it says, \u201cThe moment any person, waggon or obstacle is seen to be in danger on the track, bring car under perfect control.\u201d Are you familiar with that? A. Yes.\nQ. And you drum that into your men when you are training them? A. All ever I can.\nQ. Then I notice Rule 55, \u201cReversing is a severe strain on the apparatus, especially when the car is under high speed, and should never be resorted to except when absolutely necessary.\u201d I suppose you also impress that on your men? A. Yes.\nQ. Not to resort to the reverse unless it is absolutely necessary? A. Yes.\nQ. Not till the last moment? A. Not until it is necessary.\nQ. And is not there a rule that you shut off the power on approaching a street? A. Yes, they are supposed at all cross streets to shut off the power and ring the gong.\nQ. How far? A. A reasonable distance; it depends on the speed you are travelling at.\nQ. You will have to tell me, you know; how far do you consider a reasonable distance? \u201cWhen approaching crossings and crowded places where there is a possibility of accidents, the speed must be reduced and the car kept carefully under control.\u201d That is 58, do you impress that on your motormen? A. Yes.\nQ. Then at what distance from a crossing do you consider that a man should shut off his power and begin ringing his gong? A. It depends on the speed at which he is travelling.\nQ. Suppose he is travelling six miles an hour? A. He should shut off his power sixty, eighty or a hundred feet away from the street crossing.\nQ. And at ten miles an hour? A. A little sooner.\nQ. How much sooner? A. Not necessarily much sooner.\nQ. How much sooner? A. I could not tell you for a few yards, if a man knows when he has his car under control he knows what distance he can stop in.\nQ. I want an answer to that question. You say if a man is travelling at six miles an hour he should shut off his power from eighty to a hundred feet. Now if he is travelling at ten miles an hour when should he shut it off? You say a little sooner? A. Well, twenty or thirty feet.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Smythe: Q. Now, I suppose we may put you down as a thoroughly competent efficient motorman, or you would not occupy the position you do occupy? A. I think so.\nQ. You know this car? A. Yes.\nQ. Would you advocate this car 736 running down Queen Street from York to University at a speed of fifteen miles an hour at nine o\u2019clock in the evening? A. Well, I don\u2019t know; if all was clear, and there was nothing to obstruct me, and the car would run fifteen miles an hour, I might.\nQ. How far away from Osgoode Hall corner would you throw off your power and slacken the speed? A. I could not get to a speed of fifteen miles an hour going from York Street to University.\nQ. Assuming that you had your power on full where would you turn it off? A. A car is not always running at full speed when the power is on full.\nQ. If you had your power on full after leaving York Street where would you turn it off? A. I would shut it off forty or fifty feet back from the corner of University Street, or whatever you call it.\nQ. Is that your answer? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. That is what you are telling me now? A. Yes.\nQ. And you would not shut it off before? A. That would be quite enough to slow down, you are not supposed to stop unless it is necessary.\nQ. That is your answer now, is it? A. Yes.\nQ. If you saw a girl walking toward the track with her back toward you, would you consider it your duty to get your car under control and ring the gong? A. Yes.\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Smythe: Q. If a competent man were operating a car, and saw a girl approaching the track with her back towards him, at what distance should he get his car under control, it being obvious that she did not see him, at what distance from the girl should he get his car under control, running at a speed of, say six miles an hour? A. Well, he should get his car under control say within fifty or sixty feet of where the girl was.\nQ. Say he was running ten miles an hour at what distance from the girl should he get his car under control? A. Then he would want twenty-five feet more.\nQ. And at fifteen miles an hour? A. An equal ratio, about twenty-five feet more.\nQ. And that is what a careful, competent man should do? A. Yes.\nQ. Now, I understand you to say to my learned friend, that with the car under control, by the use of the reverse a car of this type could be brought to a dead stop in fifty feet? A. I said about fifty feet, running at six miles an hour.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Now, would a competent motorman who says he had applied the reverse a moment before or at the instant of striking a person in the street allow his car to be run 150 feet after that? A. I would naturally think he would stop his car as soon as he could.\nQ. Could he not stop it long before 150 feet? A. I should think, as I told you, about fifty feet.\nQ. And if it ran 150 feet? A. It might be a bad rail.\nQ. Would a competent motorman under those circumstances allow his car to run 150 feet? A. I have seen the rail when you could not stop in less than 150 feet, when the reverse bit the car would slide along the rail. A good deal depends on the rail.\nQ. We are speaking now of a moderate rail. Would a competent motorman who had applied his reverse at the moment of collision permit his car to run 150 feet after? A. I should not think so.\n* * * * * * *\nQ. Then there is no such rule, Mr. Whitehead? A. I don\u2019t think so.\nQ. There is a rule that you have to throw off your power before approaching intersections? A. At intersections you have to stop.\nMr. Smythe: My learned friend has insisted throughout that the instructions to motormen were not to be found in that book. This witness is an instructor, and I asked him if it was part of the instructions to throw the power off, and he said yes.\nThe Witness: As a precaution.\n* * * * * * *\nHis Lordship: Q. Do I understand there are instructions to motormen to stop at cross streets? A. Decidedly not, only at intersections of other tracks.\nQ. You did not mean to say at all cross streets? A. No, but a man naturally, as a precaution, shuts off the power when coming to a street, but he is not supposed to stop unless it is necessary.\nMr. Smythe: Q. He has to shut the power off? A. Well, I do it at every cross street as a precaution. Q. Coming to every cross street you shut it off? A. I shut off my current.\nMr. McCarthy: Q. For what purpose is that? A. Just as a precaution, in case of anything happening, not that I am expecting anything, but we never know what is coming.\nQ. Would you do that when approaching a crossing at five or six miles an hour? A. Yes, decidedly.\nMr. Smythe: Q. And much more so if you were approaching it at fifteen miles an hour? A.I would not approach a crossing at fifteen miles an hour, if I knew it.\nAnother witness of the company corroborates a great deal of this.\nThe learned trial judge in an exceedingly painstaking charge failed to direct the jury as to this evidence and its important bearing on the issue raised thereby of the negligence of the company.\nIt is true he spoke in general terms of the duty of the motorman to have his car under control.\nBut what that meant or he intended to convey by it does not appear.\nA great deal was said and no doubt in view of the complexity of the case properly said about the rate of speed the car had been going at between York Street and University Street.\nBut the relation between the speed, whatever it was, and the necessary steps to control that speed, and all else, when and where such throwing off the power as indicated had become necessary, according to the evidence above, was not, I submit, referred to or direction given as to it. We have not a word directly bearing on it unless covered up in the phrase relative to having the car under control. Nay more, we have the following passage in the charge which shews all that was present to the learned judge\u2019s mind \u201cup to the approach of the girl.\u201d He says:\nApart from the condition of the car, the excessive speed, and the not ringing of the gong there is no other allegation of negligence made against the defendant until the approach of the girl. The approach of the girl part of the case relates to what the motorman did when the ringing of the gong failed.\nHe reversed, when within ten feet of the girl, after he had gone far past the point at which the above evidence indicates power ought to have been thrown off.\nThe needful elaborateness of the charge which had to deal with many issues raised besides the one I am dealing with, tended to obscure the one I now deal with, and the evidence on the point.\nAt the close of a charge of that character counsel for respondent objected as to this, and the learned judge\u2019s remarks supplementing his main charge appear, in response to these objections as follows:\nMr. Smythe: Then I would ask your Lordship to charge the jury that in addition to the original negligence you spoke of, there was evidence from the motorman himself that he had not the car under control, according to the proper method of running as given by the witnesses for the defence themselves. Your Lordship will remember that the witnesses Whiteside and Cosgrove both said that the proper way to run the car was to turn off the power 100 feet east of Osgoode Hall corner, and the motorman himself says he did not turn off the power until immediately before the accident. They both also said that the proper way to run it was to get the car under control when approaching the corner, by slackening the speed. The motorman says he did not put on the brake until he saw the girl would be run over.\nHis Lordship: \u201cIt is not a question, gentlemen of the jury, as to the motorman\u2019s duty under the rule, it is a question of what is reasonable for him to do. He may break the rules four hundred times a day, but the question is whether under the particular circumstances of the case he acted reasonably, just as any other man going on the road. You heard, however, what he said, that he sounded the gong before he got to the west fence of Osgoode Hall, and then you heard that he had not slowed down because he was not going at a speed which he thought called for that.\nMr. Smythe: There was the evidence of the witness who said that he ought to have taken off the power.\n* * * * * * *\nHis Lordship (to the jury): It is said that ordinarily it would be the duty of the motorman to throw the power off before approach- ing the corner, so as to let the car roll, that he would then be in a better position to have the car under control, and, if necessary, to stop. Under the rules and under the practice of the company it is the duty of the motorman to throw off the power ordinarily, before approaching a corner, so as to be ready to get the car under control, and more readily to have it under control. But the question is, was he going at such a speed as was excessive? It is not a question of what the rule was, but was he acting improperly in going at an excessive speed at the time?\n* * * * * * *\nMr. Smythe: Then I would ask your Lordship to charge the jury that there was evidence that the motorman should have had his car under control at an earlier period than the period when he had it under control.\nHis Lordship: I think I have already said that.\nThis, I think, might well be taken by the jury as a withdrawal of the evidence in question.\nIt seems to me quite clear that the jury did so treat it.\nIt was uncontradicted evidence coming from a source the respondents could not question and did not question.\nIf regard were had to it at all I think it was impossible not to find negligence on the part of the company.\nThe motorman did not pretend he had observed the means this evidence points out as his duty, that is, by throwing off the power.\nThat the rules of the company and the experience of the company are not the law of the land is true. But what the experience of this and the like companies have discovered to be necessary as reasonable precaution in carrying on their business in the like conditions presented in any given case is evidence of the very highest value.\nThe remarks anent the reversing of power are all beside this question, for, as already remarked, that took place when within ten feet of the girl and a con- siderable distance beyond the street junction relative to approaching which, part of the evidence speaks.\nHad the car been rolling along, with the power off from the point indicated it should have been, it would in all probability never have reached the girl. There possibly never would have been any collision or any need for the consideration of the alleged contributory negligence.\nIt is but a second of time that is involved in the inquiry.\nAnd again, had the power been off and consequently, both the momentum of force propelling the car and the speed been reduced, the reversing operation, if it had ever become necessary, would have had more decided effect and probably avoided any collision. The jury should have had a fair chance to deal with all this.\nIn a sense the matter is, when analyzed, a question of speed, as the learned judge truly said, but he did not make that analysis for the jury and shew the bearing of his remark if he intended it to have any such relation to the evidence in question. If the speed of the car had, for example, been only a snail sort of pace no need possibly for a throwing off of such power. But it clearly was moving at so high a rate of speed that consideration directed to the point and the evidence upon it, was much needed in this connection.\nThe trial had proceeded on the particulars of negligence that dealt with excessive speed, but the evidence of the expert motorman, Whitehead, as counsel for respondents frankly admits, was a surprise.\nHe had two alternatives before him on this disclosure of very unexpected evidence. One was to object to the evidence as not admissible within the specified particulars.\nThis he did not adopt.\nProbably he wisely foresaw an amendment and that thereby increased prominence might be given the point.\nThe other alternative and which he adopted was to take his chances of war, and of the possible escape in the confusion that might ensue, seeing it was only other things that were specified as negligence, and this the gross act of negligence apparent on the evidence, as a whole, and which should have been made earlier apparent might come to be, as it was, overlooked.\nWisdom has its reward sometimes. But it cannot now be said, nor was it attempted on Mr. Smythe\u2019s objection or in argument here, to set up that this negligence was not pleaded. After treating it as fairly before the court at the trial and afterward, the issue thus raised is to be treated as if specified in the particulars.\nIt is not the case of any ultimate negligence that concerns me. That might have arisen for consideration or never have been reached.\nI, in face of what, with the greatest regard, I conceive to be a serious error in the way of misdirecting the jury, cannot find any consolation or way of escape from a new trial in the finding of contributory negligence, for if the primary negligence was found on the above evidence the really proximate cause of the collision the plaintiff\u2019s negligence could not be so.\nThe jury if properly directed in light of this evidence might never have reached the point of contributory negligence. The motorman asserts he threw off the power when some distance past the street line, but being like much else in his evidence not very definite I need not for the present purpose deal with it. I mention it merely lest expressions used relative to the reversal of power might indicate I had overlooked it. I might guess it immediately preceded reversal.\nSince writing the foregoing the report of the case of Toronto Rly. Co. v. King[3], has come to hand and shews how very differently from this charge the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dealt with the very rule in question here; though it was not there supplemented by evidence such as above and though the rule was unexplained or extended as by the said evidence given in this case and quoted above.\nAnother point of difference is that there the motorman never saw the man or cart his car struck at the crossing whereas here the motorman not only saw the girl in question, but describes her manner of carrying herself with great minuteness.\nThe judgment, in that case, I submit supports what I have written.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the order of the Divisional Court for a new trial be restored.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I think the judgment appealed against in this case is right, and for the reasons given therefor by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal.\nThe argument of the appellants\u2019 counsel appears to me to rest upon a misconstruction of the company\u2019s rule, No. 58. This rule is as follows: Rule 58. Curves and Crossings\u2014When approaching crossings and crowded places where there is a possibility of accidents, the speed must be reduced and the car kept carefully under control.\nGo very slowly over all curves, switches and intersections; never faster than three miles an hour, and extra caution must be used in handling double truck cars at such places.\nAn intersection must never be taken when another car is approaching.\nCross streets must not be blocked nor must any crossing be taken until the road ahead is clear.\nI am unable to agree with the opinion of the learned judges of the Divisional Court, that the place where this accident occurred is either a crossing or an intersection within the fair meaning of this rule. There is no crossing and there is no intersection of any kind. University Avenue, and University Street, and the several paths and ways there meet Queen Street, but do no more. They do not cross it, nor intersect it. A vehicle or a pedestrian coming down University Avenue or street may turn east or west upon Queen Street and go his way with perfect safety, without crossing either the rails of the company or the street. The citations from the dictionaries, in my opinion, are clearly against the interpretation of the Divisional Court.\nMr. Nix, the roadmaster of the company, called by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, at page 56, speaking of University Street, says it is not a cross street, that the rules for ringing the gong and having his car down to a low rate of speed apply to cross streets, and that an intersection is a cross street.\nHe further says that, as between a street which merely meets another and one which crosses it, the duty to slacken speed and sound the gong exists in the one case and not in the other, and, finally, that the company had a right to run past the place where the accident occurred without slackening speed. The only seeming qualification of this is in the evidence of Whitehead, another roadmaster of the defendants, and called on their behalf. In cross-examination by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel he is being questioned as to the practice and duty of motormen when approaching crossings under rule 58, and the following questions were put and answers made:\nQ. You know this car? A. Yes.\nQ. Would you advocate this car, 736, running down Queen Street, from York to University, at a speed of fifteen miles an hour, at nine o\u2019clock in the evening? A. Well, I don\u2019t know; if all was clear, and there was nothing to obstruct me, and the car would run fifteen miles an hour, I might.\nQ. How far from Osgoode Hall corner would you throw off your power and slacken your speed? A. I could not get to a speed of fifteen miles an hour going from York Street to University.\nQ. Assuming that you had your power on full where would you turn it off? A. A car is not always running at full speed when the power is on full.\nQ. If you had your power on full, after leaving York Street, where would you turn it off? A. I would shut it off forty or fifty feet back from the corner of University Street, or whatever you call it.\nQ. Is that your answer? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. That is what you are telling me now? A. Yes.\nQ. And you would not shut it off before? A. That would be quite enough to slow down, you are not supposed to stop unless it is necessary.\nQ. That is your answer now, is it? A. Yes.\nNow, I do not think this evidence can be construed as a statement that University Street was a crossing or an intersection within rule 58, or a place where it was necessary to ring a gong or slacken speed, when approaching it. He is not asked that question, but only, at what point he would turn off power if he wanted to stop at University corner. That is, evidently, how he understood it, for he says he might, if all was clear and nothing to obstruct and the car would run so fast, from York to University street, at fifteen miles an hour. And that you are not supposed to stop unless it is necessary. I, therefore, think the fact that this place was where two streets met each other had no bearing upon the case at all. The motorman was approaching the place of accident just as if there had been no avenue or other street at that point, and the unfortunate plaintiff was intending to cross just as she might have done at any other point not a crossing nor intersection.\nViewed in that way, as I think the case ought to be, I think there was no misdirection or non-direction of which the appellants can complain, and that the appeal fails.\nDUFF J.\u2014I agree that the learned judge\u2019s instructions to the jury upon the appellants\u2019 contention that the motorman was negligent in not sooner bringing his car under his control is not satisfactory; but although, upon this head the appellant may have some cause of complaint, I cannot convince myself that, in view of the finding of the jury on the issue of the contributory negligence, she can be said to have suffered any substantial wrong entitling her to a new trial.\nThe contributory negligence charged against the appellant and found by the jury was that in crossing the street she attempted to pass in front of an approaching car without taking proper (that is to say, reasonable) precautions. The appellant being on the south side of Queen Street, wished to cross to the north side. As she left the curb she observed the car which ran her down (on the north track some distance to the eastward) heading in her direction; but assumed that she would have time to cross before it reached her line of march. On this assumption she proceeded to set foot on the track on which she knew the car was approaching, without again looking in the direction of it. It was no doubt this last mentioned act\u2014the act of going upon the track along which she knew a car was, within a short distance, approaching\u2014without first looking to see the position of the car, that in the opinion of the jury constituted the contributory negligence they attributed to the appellant. Given this finding\u2014that this act of the appellant (by which she passed from a position of perfect security into a position in which, in the circumstances of the moment, a collision with the respondents\u2019 car was inevitable) was an act of negligence\u2014I am unable to see any ground on which she could hope to recover. The principle is too firmly settled to admit, in this court, any controversy upon it, that in an action of negligence, a plaintiff, whose want of care was a direct and effective contributory cause of the injury complained of, cannot recover, however clearly it may be established that, but for the defendant\u2019s earlier or concurrent negligence, this mishap, in which the injury was received, would not have occurred.

Tedcastle[5] at page 226; The \u201cBernina\u201d[6] at pages 88 and 89.\nIt was not argued that the question of the contributory negligence was not fairly left to the jury; as indeed it could not well be, since at the trial no objection was taken to the charge upon the head.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Samuel King.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n[1] 15 Ont.

In 1881 another agreement replaced this and conveyed all the timber standing, growing or being on the land to have and to hold the same unto the said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns \u201cforever\u201d with a right at all reasonable times during years to enter and cut and remove the same. B. exercised his rights over the timber at times up to his death in 1893 and his executors did so after his death, M. not objecting. In 1903 persons authorized by said executors entered and cut timber and continued until 1905. The following year B. brought an action for an injunction against further cutting, a declaration that the right to take the timber had lapsed and for damages.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (15 Ont. L.R. 557), Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the instrument executed in 1881 did not convey to B. the fee simple in the standing timber but only gave him the right to cut and remove it within a reasonable time and that such time had elapsed before the entry to cut in 1903 and M. was entitled to damages.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. Under the agreement mentioned in the above head-note the executors of William Beatty, the grantee therein, authorized certain persons who were defendants in the action but not parties to this appeal, to enter on plaintiff\u2019s land in 1903, 1904 and 1905, and cut timber. Plaintiff did not protest against this until 1905, and brought his action in March, 1906, by which he claimed damages for trespass during the previous three years. At the trial he recovered damages, a declaration that the rights of defendants had lapsed before the trespasses complained of in 1903, and an injunction. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHodgins K.C. and H.E. Stone for the appellants. The agreement is clear and unambiguous and the sense in which its provisions were intended by the parties cannot affect its construction. North Eastern Railway Co. v. Hastings[2].\nThe grant of the right to enter and cut is a grant of a license for profit to be exercised according to commercial requirements. See Wickham v. Hawker[3].\nThe words \u201cduring the term of * * years\u201d can be struck out of the document. See Inglis v. Buttery[4].\nIf the appellants were bound to exercise their rights within a reasonable time such time must be fixed by the commercial necessities of the transaction and the evidence shews that the timber could not have been profitably cut before the years 1903-1905. See Carvill v. Schofield[5]. F.R. Powell K.C. for the respondent. As the agreement only conveyed the timber standing at the time it was made and not the future growth it necessarily meant that it should be removed within a reasonable time. Challis on Real Property p. 224.\nAs to what is a reasonable time see Dolan v. Baker[6]; McRae v. Stillwell, Millen & Co.[7]; Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 2 ed., vol. 28, p. 542.\nHodgins K.C in reply referred to Hick v. Raymond & Reid[8]; Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Others[9]; Patterson v. Graham[10].\nGIROUARD J. agreed in the opinion stated by Idington J.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The dispute in this case arises out of the proper construction of the deed under which the appellant Beatty claimed and exercised the right of cutting the trees on respondent Mathewson\u2019s land. It is not the case of a mere right to cut trees being given but one where a grant of the trees themselves is given. Where a right to cut merely is given I can well understand either the document itself containing a clause restrictive as to the time within which the cutting was to take place or in its absence the necessity arising for a judicial determination of a reasonable time within which the right was intended under all the circumstances to be exercised. Authorities were cited at the argument in support of this latter position with which I do not propose to quarrel. I cannot however accept these authorities as applicable to a case where a grant of the trees themselves is made in or over a parcel of land.\nIn such case where apt words are used an estate of inheritance in the trees is vested in the grantee together with the necessary incidents of such an estate.\nThat is the case in the deed before us and which we are called upon to construe. It grants and conveys to Beatty all the pine, oak, birch, hemlock and other timber at the time of the execution growing or being in or upon the land described to hold to the grantee his heirs and assigns forever.\nUnder English law as laid down in authorities which I do not think we have the right to disregard this language vested in Beatty an estate of inheritance in the timber described and as a necessary incident the right to enter upon the land at all reasonable times for the purpose of cutting and removing the timber.\nThe subsequent clause now in dispute professing to confer this incidental right upon the grantee was in my view necessary. No negative words were introduced into the clause prohibiting the cutting of the trees after a specified time but the clause which was in a printed form professed to confer such a limited right. In the case before us the blank left for stating the limited time, months or years, was not filled up, and so the clause merely professed to confer this right for blank years. The court below assume under these circumstances the right to insert in this blank what they hold must have been intended under the circumstances, namely, a reasonable time from the date of the deed. I do not think if I am right in my construction of the clause that we have any right to read such a limitation into the deed. It certainly would be inconsistent with the estate granted and might well be held bad for that reason even if it had been inserted by the parties themselves.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action of the plaintiff dismissed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal depends upon the interpretation to be given to a deed drawn by the party under whom appellant claims title, and like most ill-drawn documents, as it is, gives rise to some puzzling questions.\nInasmuch as it relates to what has been held to be an interest in land the difficulty arises of reaching a conclusion that will not infringe on the one hand on well-known rules of interpretation applicable to deeds of conveyance of real estate, or on the other hand, frustrate the intentions of the parties to it, or defeat the reasonable expectations of either of the parties who may have misconceived the rigid rules applicable to the conveyance of real estate.\nThe document is ambiguous. The surrounding facts and circumstances may therefore be looked at and borne in mind in the task of interpreting it.\nOne very essential thing in this regard is that the vendee had previously bought the pine timber on this same land with a right to take it in ten years from the purchase, and as that happened not to have been practicable, he desired the time extended. In coming to an agreement for such extension of time, the vendee desired to extend the subject matter of it so as to include timber of other kinds named, in addition to the pine, and that part of the price originally agreed on for the pine alone should form and be part of the aggregate price, to be made up of such part of the original consideration and a further small sum named.\nThe transactions are so intimately connected, that this one now in question may be well said to form but a continuation of the prior one with some modifications in same.\nLet us consider the scope of the entire document. Let us observe also that there is a blank in which evidently it had been intended something should be agreed on and inserted specifying the number of years the vendee should have to remove the timber.\nMust we, under such conditions, say as we are asked by the appellants to say, that an unconditional estate in fee simple has been granted?\nThis would so clearly defeat the obvious intentions of the parties to be inferred from the external circumstance as well as that within the document itself when considered as a whole, and lead to such unjust results, that I pause to see if we are driven to adopt such contention.\nIn the first place I do not admit that the terms of the premises and habendum necessarily imply an estate in fee simple. To begin with, it is not of the timber for all time grown upon the lot that a sale is made, but of that \u201cnow standing growing or being in or upon\u201d the land described. We know that timber such as named does not live and remain obtainable for any useful purpose for such length of time as an estate in fee simple prim\u00e2 facie implies, or as the expression \u201cforever\u201d used in this habendum implies, apart altogether from what the words immediately preceding the word \u201cforever\u201d imply.\nThis is not the case of any conditional fee dependent on the life of man or tree or other thing.\nThe premises and habendum are indeed inconsistent and insensible when we consider the life of the tree, that lives longest of those sold, as the utmost term that by any possibility can have been intended.\nWe cannot, as might happen in a differently drawn instrument dealing with such a subject matter, reject that following the habendum which had so clearly granted an estate such as would render it imperative to reject what followed the habendum as inconsistent with or repugnant to it.\nThe case of a grant of a fee conditioned on the life of the longest lived of the trees in question would not need the provision for the right of entry to make roads to take the timber.\nThat being expressly provided for implies also that such a conditional fee was not intended.\nThe case of Re Hammersly[11], presents a document not unlike this one. The court rejected the word \u201cheirs\u201d as inconsistent with what the parties were contracting for.\nIn this case there is evidently an imperfect document. Its condition in that respect must also be borne in mind.\nIn the case of a limitation to \u201cA\u201d and his heirs for a term of years, it is said only a chattel interest is conferred, and it passes to the executor on death of \u201cA\u201d. See Elphinstone, Blackstone edition, p. 245, and the authorities cited there, and the recent Norton edition, at p. 299 and the authorities cited therein. I think, for these reasons and those set forth above, that this curiosity of an inapt use of words cannot be held to be a grant of any such estate in the land as would make it imperative to reject the later part of the document, and that it is to be taken as of a kind that we can, as was done in the Hammersly Case[12], reject the word \u201cheirs\u201d entirely, or hold that it is impossible to give a greater effect to it than the later expressions imply should be given it.\nIt thus comes, I think, to what was a reasonable term of years, as implied in the document as it stands, and giving effect to its entire scope for removal of the timber in question. I agree with the learned trial judge that that limit of time had been so far passed before the acts complained of, that the rights the vendee once had under the agreement in question had then expired.\nI, think though Dolan v. Baker[13] may not be binding on us, the reasonable time adopted there was the proper measure and could well be followed here.\nI may observe that. I have not overlooked the fact that the instrument purports to be made in pursuance of \u201cthe Act respecting short forms of conveyances,\u201d and was made after the \u201cAct respecting the transfer of real property\u201d as it stood in R.S.O. of 1877, ch. 98, and before the later Acts on the same subject in 49 Vict. and 50 Vict.\nThe argument put forward by the appellants\u2019 counsel that the commercial conditions of the case are to be considered, and that a time when it would be profitable to remove the timber ought to govern, is unsound. Such a thing clearly was not within the contemplation of the parties.\nThe judgment ought, I think, to stand and the appeal be dismissed with costs.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I would dismiss for the reasons given in the Court of Appeal.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the respondents to recover damages from the appellants for alleged trespasses consisting of the cutting and removal of timber from the respondents\u2019 land.\nThe appellants, who are trustees under the will of one William Beatty, justify under a deed of conveyance dated 15th September, 1881, made between the respondents and Beatty.\nThe question to be determined turns wholly upon the true construction of this deed. It was not argued on behalf of the respondents that upon the evidence there is any sufficient ground for holding that the instrument was not executed by the parties with the intention of thereby recording the transaction between them, or that it is not binding on the parties as failing to record that transaction truly; and no such point appears to have been taken in the courts below or finds a place in the pleadings. We have consequently to ascertain the rights of the parties from the language of the instrument with such assistance as may be obtained from the relevant circumstances under the rules of law governing the interpretation of written instruments.\nBy the deed in question the respondent, who was the owner of lots 115 \u201cA\u201d and 116 \u201cB\u201d in the Township of Foley, Parry Sound, professed to grant, bargain, sell and assign unto (Beatty) his heirs and assigns, all the pine, oak, birch, hemlock and other timber now standing, growing or being in or upon all and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate lying and being (describing them). To have and to hold the same unto the said party of the second part his heirs and assigns forever, together with full power, liberty, right and authority for the said party of the second part, his servants, workmen and agents from time to time and at all reasonable times hereafter during the term of years to fell, cut down, grub up, saw, dress, hew and work up the said timber, and together with full and free ingress, egress and regress, for the said party of the second part his servants, workmen and agents with or without horses, oxen, waggons, carts, sleighs, trucks and teams to enter into and upon and over the said lands and premises for the purposes aforesaid, and also for the purpose of taking and carrying away the said timber with liberty also to make all such roads as may from time to time be necessary for getting out and removing the said timber, and for that purpose to cut, fell, hew and remove such trees, logs and brush as may be deemed necessary.\nFurther the grantors entered into covenants\u2014in the form prescribed by the schedule of the Ontario \u201cAct respecting short forms of conveyances,\u201d save that in the deed the word \u201ctimber\u201d is substituted for the word \u201cland\u201d appearing in the form\u2014for quiet possession; for further assurances; and that the grantors have done no act to encumber the subject of the grant. Finally the grantors profess to release to the grantee \u201call their claims upon the said lands in so far as the same may affect the said timber.\u201d\nThe respondents put their case thus:\u2014They say the deed in its true construction is to be read as an agreement for the sale of standing timber to be cut and removed by the vendee; and inasmuch as the instrument itself fixes no time within which the work of removing it is to be completed the law implies an agreement between the parties that it shall be removed within a reasonable time; and that after the expiry of a period which in fact is in the circum- stances reasonable for that purpose, the appellants\u2019 rights under the agreement must be held to have lapsed. In a word the instrument provides, according to the respondents, for a sale of timber conditional upon the cutting and removal of it by the vendee within a reasonable time.\nThe courts below have held in substance that this is the true construction of the document; and further that the appellants\u2019 rights had lapsed at the time the acts were done in respect of which the action was brought and consequently that the respondent cannot justify under the deed. With great respect I have come to the conclusion that another construction must be given to the instrument; and in my view of its legal effect the last mentioned point\u2014whether a reasonable period for cutting and removing the timber has or has not elapsed\u2014which the courts below have decided in favour of the respondent, is a point which it will not be necessary to consider.\nIt will be noticed that the instrument at the outset professes to grant to the grantee his heirs and assigns all the timber \u201cstanding, growing or being\u201d upon the lands referred to. I think it is quite important to determine the legal effect of this part of the instrument; that is to say, to ascertain what the words in themselves mean, and what their legal effect would be, if they stood by themselves in a deed without any other provision. I think it is very clear that such words in such a document would have the effect of vesting in the grantee an estate in fee simple in the growing timber described. I do not know that anybody disputes that the owner of an estate of fee simple in land on which trees are growing may by an appropriate assurance vest in another an estate of inheritance in one or more of the trees. My own view is clear, and it may be, I think, of some importance to emphasize it. The law touching the point is I think correctly stated by two modern text writers, and I quote the passages. The first, from Mr. Leake\u2019s Uses and Profits of Land at page 30:\nA grant or an exception from a grant, of the trees growing in certain land, creates a property in the trees, separate from the property in the soil; but with the right of having them grow and subsist upon it. (b) An estate of inheritance in a tree may thus be created.\nThe second, from Washburn on Real Property at page 16:\nBut if the owner of land grants the trees growing thereon to another and his heirs, with liberty to cut and carry them away at his pleasure, forever, the grantee acquires an estate in fee in the trees, with an interest in the soil sufficient for their growth, while the fee in the soil itself remains in the grantor.\nThe views of these writers seem to be fully supported by authority. Those cited by Mr. Challis at p. 229 of his book on the Law of Real Property establish beyond question that a determinable fee may be validly limited to a man and his heirs \u201cas long as such a tree shall grow\u201d or \u201cas long as such a tree stands\u201d; and the reason why such limitations are good is given in Liford\u2019s Case[14], and is there said to be \u201cbecause a man may have an inheritance in the tree itself.\u201d In the same case at page 49b there occurs this passage:\nIf I by deed grant all my trees within my manor of G. to one and his heirs the grantee shall have an inheritance in them,\nalthough it is quite clear from Liford\u2019s Case14, as well as from other authorities; Ive\u2019s Case[15]; Whilster v. Paslow[16]; that by a grant of trees simpliciter no soil passes but \u201csufficient nutriment to sustain the vegetative life of the trees\u201d only.\nIt seems nevertheless to be indisputable that growing timber may be so granted as to vest it in sit\u00fb in the grantee as a chattel; Stukeley v. Butler[17]; Herlakenden\u2019s Case[18]; Anon[19]; Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone, 471; Williams, Executors, 543; notwithstanding the vigorous criticism by Chitty J. in Lavery v. Pursell[20], at pp. 515-517, I think it is too late to dispute that doctrine. I have however been unable to find any shred of authority or any suggestion of a good reason for doubting the proposition stated by Mr. Leake and Prof. Washburn\u2014in the passages I have quoted\u2014that growing timber in sit\u00fb may as such by apt words be vested in a grantee for an estate of inheritance apart from the property in the soil.\nIt follows from this that the words last quoted from the instrument in question would if they stood alone unquestionably have the effect of vesting in the grantee an estate in fee simple in the timber described. I think moreover that when you have a grant of timber in sit\u00fb in fee simple the law confers as one of the legal incidents of the grant the right to go upon the land to enjoy the timber, including of course the right of cutting and removing it. In Liford\u2019s Case[21] it was resolved (52a):\nWhen the lessor excepted the trees, and afterwards had an intention to sell them, the law gave him, and them who would buy, power, as incident to the exception, to enter and shew the trees to those who would have them; for without sight none would buy, and without entry they could not see them. and it is further said:\nIf I grant you my trees in my wood, you may come with carts over my land to carry the wood, temp. Ed. 1, Grants 41. Lex est cuicunque aliquis quid concedit, concedere videtur, et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potuit.\nIn Stukeley v. Butler[22], Hobart C.J. gives many examples of the application of this principle, and it was there held that even when the timber is sold as a chattel such a right is vested in the grantee of standing timber as incident to the grant.\nThe majority of the court below have held that this principle is not applicable here, and this view appears to be based upon two distinct grounds; first, that the principle itself, stated broadly as I have stated it, is no longer law, but that, when from the facts of the case it can be gathered that the removal of the timber was contemplated by the parties, then, in the absence of a specific stipulation to the contrary, the law places a restriction upon the implied right of entry requiring it to be exercised within a reasonable time; and secondly, that assuming the rule to be still applicable to cases where there is no express right of entry given by the instrument of grant, it has no application in cases where, by the instrument of grant itself the parties expressly stipulate\u2014as it is said they have in the instrument in question here stipulated\u2014for a right of entry; in which case it is said the grantee\u2019s right in that regard must be ascertained from the terms of the instrument.\nIt will be convenient to consider these two grounds in the order I have stated them.\nThe question raised by the first is whether, given a grant of standing timber in fee, the fact that the parties have contemplated the removal of the timber is in itself sufficient to limit the right of entry in the manner stated.\nStukeley v. Butler[23], at page 173, is an authority directly in point; and the question stated cannot be answered in the affirmative without repudiating the authority of Stukeley v. Butler23. For whatever may be said of that case as an authority on other points its ratio obviously involves this; that a grant of the absolute property in standing timber in sit\u00fb without more confers by implication a right of entry for the purpose of cutting and removing it so long as the grantee\u2019s interest lasts.\nNow Stukeley v. Butler23 has stood for some hundreds of years; and the principle upon which it proceeds must have been acted upon in thousands of transactions. These circumstances together afford very powerful reasons against refusing at this date to follow it; and in my opinion they are conclusive reasons unless it can be shewn that by some competent authority the law has been declared in a different sense.\nThe court below adopted the decision of the Divisional Court in Dolan v. Baker[24]. In that case the Divisional Court proceeded in part upon the principle of a long series of decisions in the state courts of the United States and in part upon the authority of a series of decisions in the courts of Ontario. These last mentioned decisions, however, (which are collected in the judgment of Magee J. at p. 271), appear to rest in every case upon the view that on the true construction of the transaction under consideration the vendee had acquired only a right to take away such of the timber as he should remove within a limited time. Such decisions plainly have no bearing upon the question I am now considering. On the other hand some of the American decisions relied upon in Dolan v. Baker[25] do unquestionably proceed upon the principle that a grant of standing timber apart from the soil is in the absence of express stipulation to the contrary subject to a condition that it is to be removed within a reasonable time; but the American decisions are by no means in harmony; and I can find in them no satisfactory grounds for impugning the authority of Stukeley v. Butler[26]. Neither does the actual decision in Dolan v. Baker25 itself seem to touch very closely the point now under consideration. The instrument there dealt with did not profess to grant a present interest in the timber which was the subject of the sale; it provided for selection by the vendee and vested in the grantee the property in so much of any of the timber referred to \u201cas he should see fit to remove.\u201d (See Boyd C. at p. 265.) Until selection and removal, I gather from the report, the property was not to pass. The ratio of the decision is stated by Magee J. at pp. 270 and 271 in these words:\nThere was here an implied condition that the timber should be selected and removed within a reasonable time. It would be intolerable that the vendee should be left for an unreasonable time without the use either of his land or his money and in ignorance even of what trees the purchaser might select and so unable to sell or clear off any.\nSuch reasoning, appropriate and cogent as applied to the facts of that case, seems to have little bearing upon the questions raised by the instrument now before us. There are however in the judgment of Boyd C. in Dolan v. Baker25 observations which lend support to the view that as a general rule in grants of growing timber the stipulation suggested is implied by law. Boyd C. indeed accepts \u201cas a reasonable doctrine\u201d the doctrine laid down in some comparatively recent decisions in Georgia\u2014that it is \u201cincumbent upon the grantees to cut and remove such timber within a reasonable time from the sale and that on failure to do so their interest ceases\u201d; and that the question of reasonable time is a question of fact in the circumstances. No English authority is referred to in support of this position except a dictum of Parke B. in Hewitt v. Isham[27], cited from the report of that case at page 79 to this effect:\nWherever trees are excepted from a demise, there is, by implication, a right in the landlord to enter the land, and cut the trees at all reasonable times. If, indeed, he leaves them on the land for an unreasonable time, he does more than the law authorizes him to do.\nThis, the learned chancellor suggests, contains the germ of the doctrine he adopts from the American cases.\nA reference however to the report of that case in the Law Journal[28] shews that Parke B. was speaking only of the duty of the grantee of the timber to remove it within a reasonable time after it is felled. In that report the passage appears thus:\nIf the trees were excepted out of the lease, the lessor had a right to go upon the land and enjoy the trees and cut them down. If indeed he saws them upon the land and leaves them an unreasonable time, he does more than he is justified in doing, and is liable to an action. With unaffected great respect for the opinion of the learned Chancellor of Ontario, I am compelled to come to the conclusion that the principle I have stated (for which Liford\u2019s Case[29] and Stukeley v. Butler[30] have for so long stood as authorities unquestioned in England), still stands, and ought to be applied in jurisdictions where the law of England prevails.\nIn considering the second ground referred to, the first question which naturally arises is, whether or not, assuming the blank in the clause relating to the right of entry to be filled in and the exercise of that right, so conferred, expressly limited to a specified term of years, such a clause could have any legal effect in derogation of the rights vested in the grantee under the grant expressed in the earlier part of the instrument. If I am right in my view that the right of entry incident to the grant is a right which the law annexes to the interest passing under the grant then it would seem to follow that any attempt in one and the same conveyance to grant the interest and to withhold the incidental right is an attempt which the law will not permit to succeed. The condition or stipulation professing to effect the deprivation of the right is in the language of the law void, as repugnant to the grant.\nI do not, however, think the appellants depend for their success in this appeal upon this rule of law. Treating the question as a matter of interpretation simply, and assuming that a clause giving a right of entry for a specified period could be held to displace the right of entry incident to the grant itself, still I can find nothing in the clause before us to justify the conclusion that the grantee\u2019s right of entry is more limited than it would be if that clause were not found in the deed. What in view of all the facts is the fair inference from the omission of the parties to specify the term of years? The learned trial judge says:\nThis land, it appears, is poor farming land. Far the greater part of it is rocky and unfit for farming. During the thirty-five years of Mr. Mathewson\u2019s ownership there has only been some thirty-five or thirty-seven acres cleared. The rest of it is unfenced, and has only been used by him for pasturing cattle with occasional taking of timber.\nAt the date of the execution of the deed there was admittedly no market for a good deal of the timber; for over twenty years after that date the parties acted upon the view that the deed imposed no limit of time in respect of the grantee\u2019s right of entry. These circumstances seem to me to point to the conclusion that the blank was not filled in because the parties never touched the point in their transaction, and never thought of it. If then one discard the blank from consideration and treat the clause as one conferring a right of entry without specific limitation, I do not understand on what principle it can be held that, so read, it displaces the implication arising from the grant. The right of entry is given as accessory to the grant, which is a grant of an interest in perpetuity; on what ground is it to be held to limit or condition that interest? Are we first to imply a condition that the exercise of the right of entry is to be limited in time; and then with that implication deprive the grantee of a right which otherwise would pass to him as a legal consequence of the grant? To me the weight of argument lies in the suggestion that such right of entry conferred in general or equivocal terms takes its character from the interest to which it is accessory. I think that in such a case the rule which implies a stipulation that things agreed to be done inter partes shall be done within a reasonable time has no application. That rule must always yield where the terms of the instrument are on their true construction sufficient to manifest a contrary intention; and in this case such contrary intention would seem to be sufficiently manifested by the terms of the grant itself.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pirie & Stone.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.R.

As the result of this fault in construction the pipes became disjointed and the plaintiff's goods, consisting largely of cases containing wines in labelled bottles, were damaged. The plaintiff notified defendant that he would hold him liable for the damages thus sustained and requested him to attend at an expert valuation to be made by fire insurance adjusters and valuators, but plaintiff disregarded the notification and did not attend. The experts assessed the damages, in the manner usually adopted in similar cases of damages caused by fire, at $3,397.11, and the plaintiff's action was maintained for this amount with amounts added for expenses incurred in repairs to the pipes, fees to the experts and costs of protest. The court below by the judgment appealed from[2] affirmed the judgment of the trial judge, Tellier J.[3], which maintained the action for the full amount demanded, and held that, under the provisions of articles 1055, 1688 and 1696 of the Civil Code, the contractor was responsible for the damages sustained, that the plaintiff, as subsequent purchaser of the building, had a right of action against the contractor as he was the person injured through the latent faults in construction, that the method of assessment of damages adopted was a proper mode to follow, under the circumstances, and that the repairs, experts' fees and costs of protest were items of damages which could properly be recovered in the action.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties, on the appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs, Davies J. dubitante.\nThe following notes were delivered by the judges.\nGirouard J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause plut\u00f4t de questions de fait que de questions de droit.

It was shewn that there might possibly have been an escape of gas from the controllers or other fixtures in the room or in the blow-room adjoining it; that, there had been no special precautions by the defendants to detect any such escape of gas that might occasionally happen; and that the meter-room, had always been and, at the time of the accident, was lighted by means of open gas jets. There was no exact proof of any particular fault, attributable to the defendants, which could1 have been the whole cause of the explosion, and its origin and course were not explained. In an action for damages by the widow and representatives of deceased, the jury found that the explosion had resulted from the fault and imprudence of the defendants in lighting the meter-room by open gas jets, and contributory negligence on the part of deceased' was negatived.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R.16 K.B.246), Davies and Maclennan JJ., dissenting, that, m the circumstances, the jury were justified in finding that there had been such negligence and imprudence on the part of the defendants, in such use of open gas jets, as. would render them responsible for the injury complained of.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment rendered in the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal[2], which ordered that judgment for the plaintiff should be entered upon the findings of the jury at the trial, in the Superior Court for the District of Montreal.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G H. Montgomery for the appellants.\nOughtred K.C. and W. H. Butler for the respondent.\nGirouard J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs, for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014The conclusion which I have reached with respect to this appeal is that it should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nThe findings of the jury on all of the questions asked them are not apparently consistent, but I do not think that reading them together there can be any reasonable doubt as to their meaning.\nThe form in which the 8th question was put to them is doubtless responsible for the answer given. Indeed it is difficult to see how any other answer than the one given could have been given unless indeed the answer was divided so as to cover separately each of the periods they were asked to cover. The question read:\u2014 8. Was the plant and machinery in use in the said building in perfect running order at the time the explosion occurred and immediately afterwards?\nThe answer is \"No,\"\nIf the gas fittings and pipes were understood by the jury as being part of the plant and machinery in use, of course as they were all wrecked and destroyed by the explosion they could not be said to be in perfect running order immediately after it occurred. The jury may or may not have understood these gas fittings and pipes to have been part of the plant and machinery. Nor does it appear to me that standing alone even if it had been limited to the time when the explosion occurred a categorical answer, yes, or no, would have been of much service. Something other and further than such an answer would be necessary to found any reasonable inference of fault or negligence on the company's part for which they could be held liable in this action.\nIf the gas pipes for the lighting of the power house were not considered by the jury as part of the plant or machinery then the answer seems to me to be one impossible under the evidence to uphold.\nIt is argued that, reading the judge's charge with the answer given, the meaning of the jury was that they intended to find there was a leak in the plant but the uncontroverted evidence of the perfect condition of the plant immediately after the explosion is inconsistent with any such meaning being read into the jury's finding. Probably their meaning was that which they subsequently stated in answer to the 12th question that the plant was not in perfect running order with the use of the gas jets to light the room. In their answer to this latter question they find that the explosion was caused by the fault, negligence, want of care and imprudence of the defendants \"by lighting the meter and blow-rooms by ordinary gas jets\" and negative any such fault or negligence either in the ventilation of the room or in the sufficiency of the plant or machinery. As I construe their answers to the 12th question they negative any fault or negligence other than that expressly found of \"lighting the meter and blow-rooms by ordinary gas jets.\"\nThey also expressly negative contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.\nWith these findings of the jury the question is: Was there any evidence from which the jury could as reasonable men conclude that the method adopted and maintained for nearly half a century of lighting the room by gas was in itself fault and negligence on the defendants' part?\nThe evidence of the experts was that this method of lighting the meter-room was, with the exception of one establishment in or near Boston, the method and practice adopted everywhere in Europe as well as America. There was no reason whatever as I gather from the evidence why a leak or escape of gas should occur in the meter-room any more than in any other room in the establishment, and the jury were unanimous in the finding that the explosion was not caused by \"insufficient plant or machinery\" which I construe as meaning was not caused by any defective plant or machinery.\nThe cause of the presence of gas in explosive quantities in the room is left by the evidence and the findings of the jury a mystery unsolved.\nThe alleged faults and negligence of the defendants in the matter of ventilation and plant and machinery being negatived and eliminated we are left alone with the finding of negligence in the fact of the lighting of the room with gas jets.\nIs this alone negligence? It does not appear to me to be so in the absence of any evidence shewing special damage to be reasonably apprehended in this meter-room beyond that of other rooms, and in the presence of the evidence that the practice of so lighting the room was one almost universally adopted by gas factories throughout the world without so far as the evidence shews any explosions such as the one we are considering having occurred.\nSome observations of the Judicial Committee in the case of McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[3], at page 76, have been relied on. But any such observations must, of course, be read in the light of the facts of the case then before their Lordships and as found by them.\nTheir Lordships in that case say, with reference to the mechanism of the cartridge machine the working of which was being considered:\u2014\nBut these automatic fingers occasionally at any rate acted in an uncertain not to say aii erratic manner. Up to the time of the explosion though no doubt less frequently at the last than at the first cartridges were now and then presented in a wrong posture and the blow or punch fell sometimes on the side of the cartridge and sometimes on the metal end in which the primer or percussion cap had been inserted. The evidence was that a considerable number of these failures occurred from time to time and that the injured cartridges were collected and sent away to be scrapped or broken. It seems to be not an unreasonable inference from the facts proved that in one of these blows that failed a percussion cap was ignited and so caused the explosion. There was no other reasonable explanation of the mishap when once it was established to the satisfaction of the jury. that the injury was not owing to any negligence or carelessness on the part of the operator. The wonder really is not that the explosion happened as and when it did but that things went on so long without an explosion.\nNow the ground of that decision seems to me to be the proof of existing defects in the working of the machinery which experience had brought to the notice of the company and which from time to time caused failures in the loading of the cartridges from which danger ought reasonably to have been anticipated and (other possible causes having been eliminated) from which it was not an unreasonable inference actually did cause the explosion there in question.\nBut where in the case before us are the analogous facts from which it might reasonably be inferred the explosion here in question occurred.\nI am unable to find any. The evidence as to the lighting of the room with gas jets being negligence in itself or likely to cause an explosion is all the other way. It is true, no explanation of the presence of explosive gas in the room is or can be given, and that the deceased operator is absolved from any negligence. There is, in fact, no explanation of the said mishap at all. It remains an unexplained mystery. But the facts and findings from which a \"not unreasonable inference\" should be drawn that the mishap was occasioned by fault or negligence on defendants' part are wanting. In the face of the jury's finding of the condition of the plant and the machinery, and of the evidence as to its being put into successful operation again immediately after the explosion without any defect being shewn and also of the evidence of universal experience with the method of lighting condemned by the jury, I would say any such inference attributing the mishap to defendants' negligence would be unreasonable. The burden of proof which lay upon the plaintiff has not been discharged and under the circumstances and on the findings actionable negligence cannot be imputed to them.\nIdington J.\u2014I think for the reasons that appear in the judgments of Chief Justice Tait, in the Superior Court, in review, and of Mr. Justice Carroll in the Court of King's Bench, in appeal, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI may add that I have felt much pressed by the form of .the questions framed before trial for the submission of the case to the jury. There has been a consequent difficulty in considering the answers made by the jury.\nTaking, for example, that to part of the 12th question, it appears at first sight as if the use of gas to light a room was an act of negligence in the opinion of the jury.\nTaking the answer to the 8th question it might be doubtful whether it was before or after the explosion that it was found that the plant and machinery were not in good running order.\nI think the charge of the learned trial judge in dealing with this 8th question, whereby he directed the attention of the jury to finding in their answer to the question whether or not there \"was a leak, that necessitated the explosion\" must be kept in view in considering the question and the answer made.\nThe same need arises for considering the charge in relation to the 12th question, and of trying to understand the answer in light of the charge.\nThe jury are not to blame. It is the frame of the question they had to deal with. the appellant was not entirely blameless in allowing such questions to be submitted to the jury without making some better effort than appears to have been made to rectify the matter.\nThe evidence, the charge, and the answers, when read together, leave little doubt however as to the: meaning of the findings.\nThe deceased was exonerated entirely from blame and so clearly was he entitled to be so exonerated that the appellant assented to it being done.\nIn face of that we were troubled with suggestions of how he might have brought about the explosion. Diverting attention to that question, which ought to be considered as absolutely settled, only helps to confuse matters already confused enough.\nThere can be no doubt that the jury found that there was a leak through somebody's fault or some defect of the apparatus used whereby the gas escaped into a room where there was fire to light it.\nThe evidence furnished such a case for plaintiff as could not in law be withdrawn from the jury, when deceased was exonerated.\nThat is all we have to do with, unless by reason of misdirection the trial should be set aside. As a whole I do not think the charge did in fact prejudice any one.\nIt was urged upon us that legal negligence is a mixed question of law and fact and that the jury ought not to be allowed to pass upon it, but merely find the facts upon which the court should pass.\nThis sort of objection has been, in a former case, ineffectually brought before this court. There should be no difficulty in the matter. The trial judge is supposed to direct the jury as to the law bearing on the facts, and the jury is bound to follow the instruction they get in this way. If the learned judge fail to direct aright, on the law, then the party affected, objecting, can have the verdict set aside. And on the other hand, if the jury fail to follow the law thus properly and correctly given them, their verdict will be set aside.\nThe common case of larceny usually presents no difficult question of law, but yet it may. There can only, as a rule, be one issue of guilty or not guilty presented to the jury. Yet no one ever was heard to raise any doubt as to the propriety of submitting such questions of mixed law and fact to a jury.\nThere is just about as little difficulty in making a jury understand the law of negligence (which is but the outcome or growth of law derived in the last analysis from the common sense of the common people) as in the law regarding larceny.\nMaclennan J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree in the opinion given by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014The respondent's husband, John Douglas, was killed in an explosion in the gas works of the appellants in Montreal. The explosion occurred in a compartment of the works comprising two rooms connected by a door, known as the meter-room and the blow-room, respectively; and was admittedly the result of gas which had escaped from the appellants' pipes coming in contact with the open flame of the gas jets by which these rooms were lighted.\nThe jury found that the disaster was attributable to the negligence of the appellants in lighting the rooms by means of a flame exposed to the atmosphere, and the judgment for the plaintiff in the Court of Review, based upon this finding, was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants assail this judgment in two ways: \u2014First, there is, they contend, no evidence to support the finding that the practice of lighting the rooms by the means employed was a negligent practice; and,\u2014Secondly; assuming the appellants to have been at fault therein, the evidence does not, it is argued, afford any basis for a conclusion that it was that fault which led to the catastrophe.\nEither of these contentions would, of course, if accepted, be sufficient to maintain the appeal; but, in my opinion, they ought both to be rejected. The questions raised by them being perfectly distinct I will discuss them separately.\nBy the law of the Province of Quebec an employer is bound to take reasonable care that his employees shall not in the prosecution of their duties, by reason of any defect or insufficiency in his plant or appliances, be exposed to any risk of injury which, having regard to the character of the work, is an unnecessary risk; and it is but a corollary to this rule that where the work in which the employee is engaged is of such a character that a reasonably prudent and competent employer would anticipate that, in the prosecution of it, his safety may be endangered it is the duty of the employer to take all reasonable measures to protect him from that danger.\nI do not stop to consider whether the law of Quebec imposes upon the employer any higher obligation; it is enough, I think, for the purposes of this appeal, that unquestionably the obligation, as I have stated it, does rest upon him; and it will (in the view I take of the case) be a sufficient test of the first of the above contentions to ascertain whether a finding that the appellants have failed in the discharge of this obligation is a finding which, upon the evidence, can be sustained.\nI shall state very briefly why I think the evidence is sufficient; but before doing so I wish to touch upon a question which gave rise to some controversy in the court below, and upon which there was not a little discussion before this court.\nCounsel for the appellants pressed upon us the view that the question of fault or no fault, in so far as it involves a judgment upon the conduct of the appellant, is a question of law in the sense that it is a question for the court and not for the jury; and, in view of the urgency with which their contention was advanced, it may be worth while stating why in my opinion that is a proposition which cannot be maintained.\nMore than once the Judicial Committee of the. Privy Council has said that the question of negligence under the law of Quebec is a question of fact for the jury: e.g. in Lambkin v. South Eastern Railway Company[4], by Sir Robert Collier, at page 354; and in Tobin v, Murison[5], by Lord Brougham, at page 126; but I do not in the least disagree with the view of the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the question of negligence or no negligence is a mixed question of law and fact when that phrase is understood in the sense in which it was used by him. It is for the court to state to the jury the rule of law which prescribes the standard of care by which the defendants' conduct is in such an action to be tested; it is for the jury in any given case to say whether he has or has not come up to that standard. It was, in this case, the duty of the jury to accept from the court and to act upon the instructions given by the court concerning the character of the duty which an employer owes to his employees as touching the safety and sufficiency of his plant and appliances; it was on the other hand a question exclusively for the jury whether, in lighting the rooms in question by the means employed, the appellants made default in the performance of that duty.\nAs regards this last question (assuming the evidence to be such that as to the effect of it more than one reasonable view be possible) the jury are the constitutional tribunal appointed to determine it and upon it their judgment is decisive. If, on the other hand, the evidence be in such a state that one reasonable view only is admissible, and the verdict of the jury is incompatible with that view, the verdict, of course, may be set aside; but it is well perhaps once again to repeat that the question for the Court of Appeal upon an application for such a purpose is not whether the view of the jury is right or wrong, but whether it is a view that jurymen, regarding the question as persons appointed to decide a question of fact \u2014to try a question of conduct in the light of every day experience\u2014may reasonably and fairly take.\nThe respondent's case was that owing to one cause or another there was a foreseeable danger of an escape of gas from the appellants' pipes into the rooms in question; and that although gas of that character, when escaping in the open is quite harmless, it may, when introduced in considerable quantities into a confined space filled with atmospheric air, become a dangerous agent; and that, consequently, upon the principle stated above, it was the duty of the appellants to take reasonable care to protect their employees against injury from it. Especially, they say, it was, in the circumstances, their duty to protect their employees from the danger which might arise from the accumulation of gas in such quantities as with the atmosphere of the room would form an explosive compound.\nIt is not disputed that the chances of an explosion ensuing upon such an accumulation of gas might have been almost if not wholly eliminated by lighting the rooms with properly protected incandescent electric lights instead of gas jets necessarily exposed to the atmosphere; or that, if the appellants ought to have anticipated the danger of such an accumulation of gas, it was their duty, in the circumstances, to protect their employees from the consequential risk of an explosion by adopting the safer method of lighting their premises.\nThe point, therefore, upon which the controversy before the jury turned was whether or not the risk of an escape of gas in such volume as, in this manner, to endanger the safety of the appellants' employees, was a risk which the appellants as reasonably prudent employers ought to have foreseen; and the question for us is whether or not the evidence reasonably supports a finding upon that point in the affirmative. The meter-room contained two large meters for measuring the gas supplied to the consumers in the city; two large appliances known as controllers for regulating the pressure of the gas in the company's mains; and one small controller for regulating the pressure in the pipes supplying the works themselves. Through all these appliances gas, of course, necessarily passed. Appreciable risk of its escaping from the meters themselves does not appear to have been suggested; but the respondent gives evidence to shew that there was considerable risk of escape from the controllers.\nIn the blower-room it was said that there was some danger of escape from the pipes connected with the blower, a large fan devised for the purpose of increasing the pressure of the gas in the mains; and some support for this contention was afforded by the fact that since the mishap giving rise to these proceedings an accident to a valve attached to one of these pipes led to an escape of gas in such volume that an employee entering the room was overpowered by it and rendered unconscious.\nThe escape of gas from the controllers in the meter-room was in the ordinary course prevented by the presence in each of them of what is technically known as a water-seal. So long as these seals remained intact an escape of gas was admittedly impossible; and the appellants offered expert evidence to the fact that the protection thus afforded could only be impaired by the evaporation of the water. There was moreover a good deal of evidence to the effect that gas is generally employed as a means of lighting the meter-rooms of gas works. On the other hand the appellants' witnesses did not speak with any clearness when pressed with the question whether pressure controllers are generally placed in meter-rooms when these rooms are lighted with gas; nor did the appellants offer any evidence to shew the character of their own experience with the controllers in question as regards the possibility of an escape of gas from them.\nThe respondents, moreover, at the trial advanced the contention, which they supported with positive evidence, that long before the mishap in question experience had shewn that the pressure of gas in the mains and pipes might be so great as to break the water-seals in the controllers; and that in the case of the smaller controllers this was a contingency so likely to happen that it ought to have been anticipated and provided against. In support of this contention they called as a witness one Power, who for seventeen years had been the superintendent in charge of the appellants' station at Ottawa Street, in Montreal. The effect of his uncontradicted testimony was that at that station it was not an uncommon thing for the water in the larger controllers to overflow as a result of the pressure of the gas, and that the smaller controller sometimes became from the same cause wholly unsealed. A more significant fact disclosed by this witness (and on this point also there was no contradiction) was that at its Ottawa Street station the gas company had an employee whose special duty it was to remain in the meter-room for the purpose of taking steps to prevent any evil consequences from an accidental escape of gas. These statements, let me repeat, were uncontradicted; and it was not suggested in cross-examination or otherwise that the controllers which had been under the superintendence of Power differed in any way from those in use where the explosion occurred.\nIn this state of the evidence, and especially in view of the absence of any evidence shewing the actual experience of the appellants as touching the possibility of the escape of gas at the station where the accident in question took place, 1 am unable to say that the jury had not before them material from which they might reasonably conclude that the presence of gas in that part of the works in sufficient quantities to create a risk of explosion was a danger which the appellants ought to have anticipated; and that they had failed to take reasonable precautions for the protection of their employees against that danger.\nThe second contention remains. That contention, if I am right in the views I have expressed, admits of a short answer. If the fault of the appellants consists in that which I have just indicated, namely, that they failed to make reasonable provision for the protection of their employees from a danger which they should have anticipated, and that danger was the presence of gas in such quantities as to create the risk of explosion, then the jury were unquestionably entitled to find that the disaster in which the deceased John Douglas lost his life was attributable to that fault as one of its effective causes. We have not here the case of an accident due to some injury to the plant or appliances of an employer through the operation of force majeure or through the wilful intervention of a third person for whom the employer is not responsible or of the injured person himself; in such cases it might be necessary to consider whether chain of liability ought to be held to be interrupted by the novus actus interveniens; but it is here unnecessary to express any opinion upon any such hypothetical case.\nBy consent, the verdict of the jury negatived any fault on the part of Douglas; and there is no hint in the evidence of the presence of either of the other causes mentioned.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Filion & Butler.\n[1] Q.R.16 K.B.246.\n[2] Q.R.30 S.C.104.\n[3] [1905] A.C.72.\n[4] 5 App.Cas.352.\n[5] 5 Moo.P.C.110.\n"}

Act, 1867, ss. 91 and 92.\nSub-sec. 2 of sec. 92 B.N.A. Act, 1867, giving a provincial legislature exclusive powers of legislation in respect to \"direct taxation within the province, etc.,\" is not in conflict with sub-sec. 8 of sec. 91 which provides that Parliament shall have exclusive legislative authority over \"the fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\" Girouard J. contra.\nHeld, therefore, Girouard J. dissenting, that a civil or other officer of the Government of Canada may be lawfully taxed in respect to his income as such by the municipality in which he resides.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick discharging a rule nisi for a writ of certiorari to quash an assessment.\nThe City of St. John, N.B., assessed the appellant, an official of the Dominion Government in the customs service, on his income as such. He obtained a rule for a writ on certiorari to quash the assessment on the ground that under the provisions of the B.N.A. 1.867, no power exists by which a provincial legislature can authorize a municipality to impose such taxes. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in refusing the writ, followed the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim[1] a case from Australia and held that there is no substantial distinction between the constitution of the Australian Commonwealth and that of the Dominion of Canada in respect to the matter in question.\nPowell K.C. for the appellant.\nSkinner K.C. tor the respondents.\nPowell K.C. for the appellant. The court below erred in saying that there is no distinction between our constitution and that of Australia. The Australian States had power, before the federation, to impose these taxes and such power was expressly reserved to them by not being given to the Federal Parliament. In Canada the provinces could only have the power, under the B.N.A. Act, by its being expressly bestowed which was not done.\nAt common law a public office could not be sold and the salary attached to it could not be assigned. Hence the salary could not be taken away by process of law. See Flarty v. Odium[2]; Arbuckle v. Cowtan[3]; Crowe v. Price[4]. The power to tax it, therefore, must be expressly given by the constitution or it does not exist.\nAnd property used in the public service is exempt from taxation at common law. Amherst v. Sommers[5]; The King v. Cooke[6].\nSkinner K.C. tor the respondents.\nGirouard J. (dissenting).\u2014The appeal involves a very important question of constitutional law which has already received the attention of the provincial courts of the Dominion on several occasions and has . obtained the same solution, almost unanimously, so much so that the counsel of the City of St. John in this case relies only upon the judgment appealed from and also upon the recent decision of the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim[7], an appeal from Australia. None of these cases has ever reached our own court. For at least twenty years the decisions of the provincial courts were accepted throughout the whole Dominion as being settled law. It is high time that the point involved should be carried to the Privy Council in order to set at rest what is becoming now the unsettled condition of the courts. I do not intend to review all those decisions. They number about twelve or fifteen. I will merely indicate some of them: Ex parte Owen[8]; Ackman v. Town of Moncton[9]; Coates v. Town of Moneton[10]; Ex parte Burke[11]; Ex parte Killam[12]; Evans v. Hudon[13]; Crevier v. DeGranpr\u00e9[14]; Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[15]; Bucke v. City of London[16]; Reg. v. Bowell[17].\nI am not prepared to say that all these decisions, rendered by the most eminent judges of our country and accepted by the whole community, are wrong. I will wait till the Privy Council so declares under our own constitution. The New Brunswick judges in this case, without, however, offering any reasoning, express the view that the rule laid down in this very long array of decisions has been disapproved by the judicial committee in Webb v. Ontrim7. There the Privy Council held that the respondent, an officer of the Australian Commonwealth, resident in Victoria, and receiving his official salary in that state, is liable to be assessed in respect thereof for income taxes imposed by an Act of the Victorian Legislature. This decision has been severely criticised in the Law Quarterly Review (vol. 23, pages 129, 373), and has given very little satisfaction in Australia, especially in the High Court of that Commonwealth whose former decisions in D'Emden v. Pedder and Deakin v. Webb[18] were disapproved. On a subsequent occasion, in Baxter v. Commissioners of Taxation[19], and Commissioners of Income v. Cooper[20], the High Court of Australia refused to follow Webb v. Outrim[21]. This may be strictly correct as it was not rendered on appeal from that court. On more than one occasion the courts of appeal in England refused to follow the rules laid down by the Privy Council, as that tribunal does not form part of the judicial hierarchy of the kingdom, although some, if not the majority of the learned judges sitting in that tribunal frequently sit in the House of Lords; see Dulieu v. White[22]. The Commissioners of Taxation thereupon applied for special leave to appeal from that judgment of the High Court, but the Privy Council refused to interfere upon the ground that since the decision in Webb v. Outrim21, the Commonwealth had passed a statute especially authorizing the states to impose taxation of the kind in question, so that the controversy was at an end.\nIf in the above cases the decisions of the Privy Council upon the Constitution of Australia were not binding upon all the courts of that Commonwealth, a fortiori, it cannot be binding upon us, unless clearly applicable to our own constitution; and that is exactly the point upon which, with due deference, I cannot agree with the court below.\nSection 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, declares that\nthe exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say:\u2014\nPar. 8. The fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of the civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\nAnd the same clause of the Act adds:\u2014\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThe power of a province to impose this tax must be found in section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, which enumerates all the powers given to. the provinces under our system, which, in that respect, differs entirely from the Australian system.\nWhatever is not given by the British North America Act, 1867, to the provincial legislatures rests with the Parliament of Canada. Newcombe, p. 193. In the Commonwealth Constitution the states retain exclusive control on all subjects, authority which has not been conferred even on the Commonwealth. Teece Companion, p. 34.\nAs I read clause 91, I believe the provincial legislatures have no power to do anything that may interfere with the \"fixing of and providing for the salaries,\" etc.; and, if they do so, their legislation is ultra vires. The power of direct taxation as provided for in para. 2 of section 92 cannot mean taxation of these salaries as the effect of that taxation would, undoubtedly, be the reducing of the same more or less as the legislature or the municipality might deem proper, and this, I submit, is contrary to para. 8 of section 91. The local legislatures and municipalities might by levying excessive taxation on the salaries of federal government officers either make it impossible for the government to maintain the present scale of renumeration or make it impossible to retain their present officials. That is the view taken by our own courts.\nIn the application on behalf of the Crown for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee in the case of Armstrong v. The King, involving the question under the \"Exchequer Court Act\" of the liability of the Crown for negligence and other questions, Lord MacNaghten stated as a ground for refusing the application\u2014\"This seems to have been the law for eighteen years.\"\nHis Lordship was referring to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of the City of Quebec v. The Queen[23], and Filion v. The Queen[24]. This application is, therefore, a distinct precedent for the position that the committee will not grant leave to appeal from a decision, right or wrong, where it is in accordance with the law which has been observed in the colony for many years.\nThe case of Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa[25], is a distinct authority which has been uniformly followed for many years that the local legislatures cannot tax salaries of the Dominion officials. The decision proceeds upon reasons which are fully elaborated by the various judges who pronounced opinions in that case. Their conclusions may be right or wrong, but the fact remains that it was acquiesced in for a long period, and the only thing which has now happened to disturb it seems to be the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Australian case of Webb v. Outrim[26].\nThat decision, however, is not, owing to the difference of constitutional provisions, in anywise inconsistent with the Leprohon Case[27], and if the Supreme Court of Canada were to follow the latter decision, the committee could not consistently with what they state in the Armstrong Case, grant leave to appeal.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This appeal raises for the first time before this court the important constitutional question of the right of the provinces of the Dominion to impose income taxes upon the Dominion officials resident in the respective provinces in respect of the official salaries paid to them in those provinces by the Dominion.\nThe same question had been raised years ago in several of the provinces and had been decided by the provincial courts adversely to such right. In the Province of New Brunswick the Supreme Court of that province so decided in the cases of Ex parte Owen[28] in 1881, and in Ackman v. The Town of Moneton[29] in 1884. When the case now in appeal came be fore that learned tribunal, the Chief Justice, speaking for the full court, held that its previous decisions had been practically overruled by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim[30], and that, as they could not distinguish that case from the one then before it, they were bound to reverse their previous decisions and uphold the constitutionality of provincial legislation imposing income taxation upon Dominion Government officials which they held that Act in dispute did.\nOn the argument before us it was contended that the radical and underlying differences in the constitutions of the Dominion and the Commonwealth were so great that little weight ought to have been given to a decision upon any one of them when sought to be applied to the other. Speaking generally, there is no doubt weight in the contention and care has to be taken, of course, so as to avoid necessarily applying observations alike apt and applicable to one constitution when the proper construction of the other is under consideration. In every case it is a question as to the proper construction of the language of the constitutional Acts and, in reaching such construction, due weight must, necessarily, be given to the general scheme involved in the construction so far as that is apparent. But with this general and probably trite observation in every case the meaning of any clause is a simple question of the construction of the language used. Chief Justice Barker in his judgment correctly summarizes, in my opinion, the cardinal distinction between the two constitutions when he says:\nIn the case of Australia, general powers were carved out of the powers which the provinces had previous to federation, and given to the federal parliament, the residuum of power remaining in the provinces. In Canada, specific powers of legislation were given to the provinces and the residuum of power was given to the Dominion.\nAnd so it has been laid down by the Judicial Committee as a canon of construction for the British North America Act, 1867, that, in order to ascertain whether any claimed power of legislation belongs to the provincial legislature you must seek and find it in some one of the various sub-sections of section 92. If you cannot find it there, then it must be held not to exist. But, even if you have found it there, you must go further and see whether the same or an equivalent power is not given to the Dominion Parliament under section 91. If it is not, then, of course, provincial legislation on the subject is constitutional. But, if it is found in section 91 also, then, at any rate in cases where the Dominion Parliament has legislated and to the extent it has legislated, the local legislature is incompetent to legislate.\nNow, it seems to me the questions before us are: First\u2014Whether or not the power to legislate upon the subject of taxation given to the provinces are wide and broad enough to cover the cases of Dominion officials resident within the province; and, if they are, whether or not such power is in conflict with or inconsistent with the powers given to the Dominion Parliament under the 91st section?\nSection 92 gives the provincial legislatures\npower exclusively to make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nSub-sec. 2. Direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nNow, it does not seem to me open to argument that these words are large and broad enough to cover a provincial income tax reaching all residents of the province.\nUnless, therefore, there is some implied exception, or some conflict with a power given to the Dominion Parliament in the 91st section, there would be an end to the case.\nSuch conflict, however, it is contended is found in sub-sec. 8 of section 91:\u2014\nThe fixing of and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\nI am unable, however, to see any necessary conflict between the two powers conferred.\nThe Dominion fixes and provides the salary and the province says \"you shall pay to us the same income tax upon your salary as all other residents of the province have to pay upon their incomes.\" The conflict is, to my mind, an imaginary one. The province does not attempt to interfere directly with the exercise of the Dominion power, but merely says that, when exercised, the recipients of the salaries shall be amenable to provincial legislation in like manner as all other residents.\nBut, then, it is suggested, the power, if conceded to the provincial legislature, may be so exercised as to practically defeat the power of the Dominion Government in fixing the salaries. In other words, the power which exists in plain language in sub-section 2 must be limited by the courts for fear of its improvident exercise by the legislature. Time and again the Judicial Committee have declined to give effect to this anticipatory argument or to assume to refuse to declare a power existed in the legislature of the province simply because its improvident exercise might bring it into conflict with an existing power of the Dominion. It is said; the legislature might authorize an income tax denuding a Dominion official of a tenth or even a fifth of his official income and, in this way, paralyze the Dominion service and impair the efficiency of the service. But it must be borne in mind that the law does not provide for a special tax on Dominion officials but for a general undiscriminatory tax upon the incomes of residents and that Dominion officials could only be taxed upon their incomes in the same ratio and proportion as other residents.\nAt any rate, if, under the guise of exercising power of taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other salaries were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question and not to assume beforehand such a suggested misuse of the power.\nThen, it was argued that inasmuch as at common law the salaries of officials of the Crown were incapable of being assigned, pledged or charged by the acts of the officials or by process of law any attempt to make them liable, like other residents, as income-taxpayers would be an illegal interf\u00e9rence with the prerogative of the Crown as executive head of the Dominion.\nI confess myself quite unable to follow this argument.\nThe question before us has nothing to do with the common law privileges or immunities of office holders. It is a question of statutory construction. Has the statute or has it not conferred the power claimed? It is admitted it has so far as provincial officials are concerned, and I am unable to appreciate the fine distinction which admits the King's prerogative was constitutionally interfered with in right of the province while it was excepted in right of the Dominion. The words conferring the power are, to my mind, too clear and broad and general to admit of the exception sought to be read into them.\nI fail to find any provisions in our British North America Act exclusively vesting in its Parliament or withdrawing from the provincial legislatures the power of taxing incomes earned within the state whether by Dominion officials or others.\nThen, as to the argument as to the implied exemption of Dominion officials' salaries sought to be supported by the decision of Chief Justice Marshall in McGulloch v. The State of Maryland[31], the Judicial Committee have in the case of Webb v. Outrim[32], while declaring (page 89),\nthat it was obvious there was no such analogy between the two systems of jurisprudence\nof the United States of America and the Australian Commonwealth as the learned Chief Justice of the latter suggested did exist, and that, therefore, the reasoning of Chief Justice Marshall and his conclusions did not apply, went on to say:\nThe enactments to which attention has been .directed do not seem to leave room for implied prohibition\u2014expression facit cessare taciturn;\nand, again, at page 91, their Lordships say:\u2014\nThe 114th section of the Constitution Act sufficiently shews that protection from interference on the part of the federal power was not lost sight of. It is impossible to suppose that the question now in debate was left to be decided on an implied prohibition when the power to enact laws on any subject whatsoever was before the legislature.\nThe 114th section of the Commonwealth constitution to which the Judicial Committee call attention, reads as follows:\u2014\nA state shall not without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth raise or maintain any naval or military force or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a state.\nFor the purposes of determining such a question as we have before us now as to reading into the subsection 2 of section 92 an implied prohibition upon the taxation of Dominion officials' salaries, I am unable to discern any substantial distinction between the 114th section of the Commonwealth Act and the 125th section of the British North America Act, 1867, which reads:\u2014\nNo lands or property belonging to Canada or any province shall be liable to taxation.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that, upon the true construction of the British North America Act, 1867, the power of\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes,\nhaving been given to the provincial legislatures, and the 125th section of the same Act having exempted the lands and property of the Dominion from liability to taxation, the argument seeking to read into the power a further prohibition and an implied one cannot prevail but that the fair and reasonable construction of the words conferring the power must be held to include resident Dominion officials and their salaries as well as all other residents.\nIdington J.\u2014The question is raised in this appeal of the power of a municipal corporation to tax the appellant (in common with other ratepayers taxable for income), in respect of that part of his income derived from salary for services in the civil service of the Dominion Government.\nIt was decided over thirty years ago in the case of Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa[33], first by the learned trial judge and, on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the municipalities had no such power. The late Chief Justice Spragge, in that case at page 526, put this holding on the ground of the incompatibility between the power of the Dominion, under the British North America Act, to fix a salary and the exercise of a municipal taxing power derived from the province to tax for municipal purposes such a salary in common with all other incomes by way of salaries.\nIt is a fundamental principle that must be observed in the exercise of any municipal power, either of taxation or otherwise, that it must be exercised uniformly and without discrimination of persons or corporations or classes. Such had been the exposition of municipal law in this country before confederation.\nIt therefore seems hard to conceive of it being intended that there should be implied (for it is not expressed) in section 92 of the British North America Act, in assigning to each province the exclusive power of making laws in relation \"to municipal institutions in the province\" that there must be one class which was to have this partial discrimination reserved in its favour. That, up to 1867, incomes had not been assessed or incomes derivable from this or other specified sources had not been assessed seems to me quite an irrelevant consideration. Municipal institutions such as those conceived of could only be carried on by some taxing power being confided to the municipal authorities by the legislature creating them and, when such comprehensive language was used as I have referred to it seems to me that it must have been intended that such subjects of taxation and modes of levying such necessary taxes thereon as the legislature saw fit to empower, was the only limit thereto save that reserved in the veto power given the Dominion Government.\nIt is said, however, that the power of taxation does not rest upon that which might, I submit, be very reasonably assumed as the basis upon which to have rested it, but upon the power of direct taxation given the provinces.\nLet us, if need be, assume that to be so; then, if it has been delegated to the municipality created by such legislature, what difference can it make in the disposition of this question? No one questions the right of taxation in either municipal or school corporations, however it be derived.\nThen why, if incomes be taxable, should not the-salary of the civil servant be so also? If Ave assume-the salary is given for a civil servant to live upon, then must we not suppose he has been given it to help to bear the burthen of the daily necessary expenses of living; such as educating his children; as-clearing and making a road to his dwelling; as lighting; watering, or cleaning and keeping in order such. road when so made; as trunk sewers for the common benefit; as the maintenance of the poor and the sick; and as the payments of what the Dominion has imposed, by virtue of its powers held to exist, in the imposition, through these very municipal organizations. of a tax directed by the Dominion to meet the demands of railways for providing and guarding street crossings; and, in short, the entire expense of municipal government. That expense flowing from the Dominion impositions I refer to is as yet trifling but it may grow and it illustrates in principle better than the others how little there is in the reasoning from incompatibility relied upon in the Leprohon Case[34].\nSurely, at least in the absence of express declaration of the Dominion to the contrary, it must be assumed that, at all events in those cases where the civil servant is prohibited from earning by other means of livelihood than his salary, the Dominion has given or intended to give a sufficient salary to meet the ordinary expenses of living, and that not to the extent of a single cent is the Dominion servant to live upon the products of the labours or incomes of other fellow townsmen.\n- He is entitled to live upon and be supported by the labour or at the expense of all those he serves that is of the inhabitants of the entire Dominion, not at the expense of the other persons in some particular places therein. It does not, I imagine, comport with the dignity of the Crown or the proper observation of justice on the part of the Dominion Parliament that any other rule should obtain.\nI will not impute to the framers of the British North America Act the intention of creating a condition of things that in principle is fraught with inequality and injustice.\nThe Dominion is and has always been able to keep in respectable condition all her civil servants and not to make them dependent on the bounty of any one part of the Dominion more than another.\nThese matters all bear upon the construction of the Act as an instrument of government\nNor does this construction interfere with these questions of the expediency of taxing these incomes when such considerations of state or municipal interest may arise as to lead to a proper modification or abandonment of the exercise of the right.\nThe expediency of an income tax as a method of taxation and the risks of unjust results therefrom are also entirely another matter.\nOne thing is quite clear that the subject of taxation so far as it might call for exemptions which were within the range of vision which the framers of the Act had, was foreseen and considered and the line drawn deliberately at the taxation of government property.\nThe express provision thus made was, I think, an exclusion of this exemption now contended for.\nThe case of McCulloch v. Maryland[35] cited and relied upon in nearly all the cases decided on this question since, as well as in, the Leprohon Case[36], seems to me to have little to do with the matter. The history leading up to the former decision is not to be overlooked in weighing it.\nBesides; the case of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[37], has, (if the line of argument in the McCulloch Case35 can have any bearing on the question, since that case was first thus used) conclusively established the right of the province to tax banks created by and solely within the creative power of the Dominion and yet doing business within the province seeking to tax it.\nI am not at all clear that Webb v. Outrim[38] relied upon here and in the court below can be said, upon close analysis, to have very much to do with the question presented here.\nI am unable, notwithstanding the array of judicial authority supporting and following the judgment in the Leprohon Case[39], to find that it proceeded upon a correct interpretation of the British North America Act.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. Even if Webb v. Outrim38 had been otherwise decided it would not, in my opinion, necessarily govern the present case, inasmuch as the act establishing the Australian Commonwealth differs in a very important respect from the British North America Act.\nI think the tax in question is within the powers conferred on the Canadian provinces by section 92, sub-sections (2), (8) and (13) of the latter Act, and is not affected by anything contained in section 91.\nBy those sub-sections jurisdiction is conferred upon the provinces, within their respective limits, over property and civil rights, direct taxation, and municipal institutions.\nThe Act contains no definition of \"municipal institutions.\" That was unnecessary, inasmuch as such institutions had existed in the several provinces for many years, and their nature and functions were well known and understood. These institutions included city and town corporations, which had numerous public duties to perform for the benefit of their respective inhabitants, and which required the annual expenditure of large sums of money, which was raised by taxation of real and personal property, and also of income.\nThe City of St. John is probably the oldest municipality in the Province of New Brunswick, and its present charter of incorporation is the statute, 52 Vict. ch. 27, which makes provision for the levy of the taxes required for the public service by a number of sections, beginning with number 112, and of which those bearing on this appeal are numbers 115, 116, 120, 149, and a \"Schedule A.\"\u2014\"Title Income.\"\nSection 120 provides that all taxes shall be raised by an equal rate upon the value of the real estate situate within the city, and upon the personal estate and the income of the inhabitants, being the income derived and coming in any manner except from real or personal estate actually assessed.\nSection 149 declares that income shall mean the annual gross sum arising to any male inhabitant, or rateable person, from any place, office, profession, trade, calling, employment, etc., except from real or personal estate actually assessed.\nSection 115 provides that the Board of Assessors shall on or before the first day of April in each year publish a notice within the city, requiring all persons liable to be taxed to furnish to the assessors true statements of their real estate, personal estate, and income, on forms obtainable at the office of the assessors.\nSection 116 requires every person liable to be rated, within thirty days after the foregoing notice, to furnish the assessors with a written statement, under oath, of his real and personal estate and income, in the form expressed in Schedule A.\nSchedule A. (Income) defines the income to be taxed as follows:\nIncome derived from office, profession, work, labour, trade, business, place, occupation, employment, skill or ability, during the twelve months next preceding the first day of April, and which has not before this date been invested in property subject to taxation. This amount has. not been offset by household or personal expense.\nFrom all this it is apparent that the tax to be levied in any year is not a part of the income, as such, of the inhabitant, but a sum of money to be measured by, or in proportion to the amount of his income during the preceding year. It is the inhabitant who is taxed for his fair and reasonable share of the expenses incurred by the municipality on his behalf, and on behalf of all the other inhabitants, and his income for the preceding year is referred to solely for the purpose of ascertaining what it is just and reasonable that he should be required to pay. No attempt is made to seize or appropriate the income itself, or to anticipate its payment. He receives it, and applies it as he thinks fit, in discharge of his obligations. Or if he invests it in real or personal property liable to taxation, then to the extent of such investment his income is exempt.\nSuch being the nature and purpose of what is called income tax, I see no ground whatever on which the appellant, merely because he is a civil servant of the Dominion Government, can claim exemption.\nHe is a citizen, an inhabitant of the municipality enjoying his due share of all the advantages of municipal government, in common with all other inhabitants, and if he were exempt, his exemption would be a plain injustice to the other inhabitants. Qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus.\nThe same thing may be said of the other taxes, the taxes upon real and personal property, or the poll-tax or the dog-tax. It is not the property, or the poll, or the dog, which is taxed, but the individual inhabitant or property owner, and I think there is absolutely nothing in the \"British North America Act\" which gives any ground for the exemption claimed on behalf of the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and with costs if asked for.\nDuff J.\u2014It is no longer open to dispute that by the combined operation of clauses numbered 2 and 8 of section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, a province may confer upon a municipality the power to tax persons resident within the territory subject to its control in respect of their incomes. Any question which might have been raised concerning that point was finally put at rest by the decision of the Judicial Committee in The Attorney-General of Ontario v. The Attorney-General of Canada[40]. The question presented by this appeal, therefore, is the question whether any of the enactments of section 91 of that Act have the effect of creating an exception in favour of officers of the Dominion Government in respect of the allowances paid to them by that Government.\nThe appellant argues that the authority vested in the province to impose taxes in respect of income does not extend to such allowances because the whole of the authority to legislate in respect to them (as subjects of taxation or otherwise) is exclusively conferred upon the Dominion by sub-section 8 of section 91, which assigns to the Dominion as a subject of legislation,\nthe fixing and providing for the salaries and allowances of civil and other officers of the Government of Canada.\nIt is said that the attempt by a province to impose taxes in respect of such salaries and allowances is an invasion of the field defined by this sub-section. I am quite unable to perceive that the power thus conferred in any way restricts the operation of the power of taxation committed to the province. The fixing and providing for salaries seems to be, as a subject of legislation, quite distinct from the power to levy taxes in respect of income. The principle upon which the burden of the fiscal contributions exacted by a municipality or a province shall be distributed among those persons subject to its fiscal jurisdiction seems to be a subject as far removed as possible from that dealt with in sub-section 8 of section 91. If one were to speculate upon the intentions of the framers of the Act, I should suppose nothing further from their intentions than the exemption of federal office holders as a class from the fiscal burdens incident to provincial or municipal citizenship.\nI do not think it would be profitable to examine in detail the decisions of the provincial courts to the opposite effect. Those decisions were largely founded upon reasoning of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa[41], which was decided in 1877. Judicial opinion upon the construction of the British North America Act has swept a rather wide arc since that date; to mention a single instance only, it would not be a light task to reconcile the views upon which Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa\n(1) proceeded with the views expressed by the Judicial Committee in the later case of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe (2). Indeed, although Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa (1) has not been expressly overruled, the grounds of it have been so thoroughly undermined by subsequent decisions of the Judicial Committee, that it can,\u2014I speak, of course, with the highest respect for the eminent judges who took part in it,\u2014no longer afford a guide to the interpretation of the British North America Act.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Powell & Harrison.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Co. to construct its line along a named highway in the municipality but the powers and privileges conferred were not to take effect unless a formal acceptance thereof should be filed within thirty days from the passing of the by-law. Such acceptance was filed on 12 Sept., 1905. This was too late and on 20 July, 1907, the council of Sandwich West and that of Sandwich East respectively passed by-laws containing the necessary authority.\nIn April, 1906, the location of the line of the E. T. Ry. Co. was approved by the Board. In June, 1906, the Board made an order allowing the W. E. etc., Ry. Co. to cross the line of the C.P.R. In March, 1907, another order respecting said crossing was made and also an order approving the location of the W. E. Ry. Co., the municipal consent being obtained three months later.\nThe E. T. Ry. Co. applied to the Board to have the orders of June, 1906, and March, 1907, rescinded and for an order requiring the W. E. Ry. Co. to remove its track from the highway at the point where the applicant proposed to cross it to discontinue its construction at such point or, in the alternative, for an order allowing it to cross the line of the W. E. Ry. Co. on said highway. The applicants claimed to be the senior road and that the W. E. Ry. Co. had never obtained the requisite authority for locating its line. On a case stated to the Supreme Court by the Board.\nHeld, that the Board had power to refuse to set aside the said orders; that, the by-laws passed in July, 1907, were sufficient to legalize the construction of the W. E. Ry. Co.'s line on said highway; and that the Board can now lawfully authorize the latter company to maintain and operate its railway thereon.\nHeld, further, that leave of the Board is necessary to enable the E. T. Ry. Co. to lay its tracks across the railway of the W. E. Ry. Co. on said highway.\nHeld, also, that the Board, in exercise of its discretion has power by order to authorize the maintenance and operation of the W. E. Ry. Co. along said highway and to give leave to the E. T. Ry. Co. to cross it and the line of the C.P.R. near the present crossing and to apportion the cost of maintaining such crossing equally between the two companies instead of imposing two-thirds thereof upon the E. T. Ry. Co. as was done by a former order not acted upon; and to order that if the E. T. Ry. Co. finds it necessary in its own interest to have the points of crossing differently placed it should bear the expense of removing the line of the W. E. Ry. Co. to the new point of crossing.\nAPPEAL on a case stated by the Board from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada[1], on application of the Essex Terminal Co. The material facts are stated in the above head-note. The text of the questions submitted will be found in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington.\nArmour K.C. and Coburn, for the appellants.\nMatthew Wilson K.C. for the respondents.\nGirouard J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDavies J.\u2014I agree with the general reasoning of the late Chief Commissioner Killam when proposing the judgment of the Board of Railway Commissioners on the application of the appellant and, in answer to the sixth question submitted to us in the stated case, I would say that the order proposed to be made by the Board is one which, in the exercise of its discretion, the Board has power to make.\nI would also answer questions two, four and five in the affirmative. In view of these answers, it does not seem necessary to answer questions one and three.\nIdington J.\u2014This is a case submitted by the Board of Railway Commissioners in the lifetime of the late Chief Commissioner.\nWe are asked to answer some half dozen questions submitted.\nIn order to understand thoroughly the bearing of these questions one would have to read the case and the judgment of the late Chief Commissioner.\nBriefly put, however, the contest between the two railway companies is to have the senior right of the one over the other determined.\nIncidentally to that determination, it is said that by reason of settled jurisprudence of the Board there ought to flow results much different from those settled by the Board in the order now in question.\nI am not prepared to assent to this contention.\nHowever desirable it may be to observe as a general rule as between contesting railway companies that, presumptively, a senior may or even should have advantages over its junior in settling such questions as have arisen between those before us, it would never do for us to treat such settlement of prior right in regard to such contests as so determined and fixed by law as to remove all discretion from the Board in the consequent results of such a matter as adjusting the respective burthens to be borne by the contestants. It was quite competent for the Board to have said here, as the judgment of the late Chief Commissioner practically does say, that, assuming the legal status of the respondent company was not technically that of senior, yet, in substance, it might by reason of the march of events be treated as in such a position as to have claimed seniority but for an unfortunate mistake made in the legal proceedings that were designed to complete its title and to give it that seniority.\nThis position of the Board was the more apparently right when we consider that so much had been done on the faith of a supposed acquired right as to give rise to quite exceptional considerations and quite exceptional treatment which was given.\nThe respondent company, in my opinion, had not until the 20th of July, 1907, acquired, as it supposed it had, the right to build upon the highway.\nBut, notwithstanding that, I agree with the late Chief Commissioner in thinking that if an application were made to the Board merely to approve of plans locating a proposed railway and the order were confined to that approval of location and in no way to be assumed to be a determination of right to proceed to build, regardless of all other considerations, or consideration such as the title in law to go upon or over any property covered by the location adopted and build thereupon, it could be properly made.\nThe orders complained of so far as before me (for they are not all copied in the copy of the case I have), do not seem expressly confined to this question of location and might be read as going beyond it, but for the explanation given in the judgment I have referred to, and the statutory declaration in section 159 of the Railway Act as to the meaning of such an order. That section, sub-section 2, reads as follows:\nThe Board by such sanction shall be deemed to have approved merely the location of the railway and the grades and curves thereof, as shewn in such plan, profile and book of reference, but not to have relieved the company from otherwise complying with this Act.\nI doubt if this entirely covers this case. It is not a question here of relief from otherwise complying with the \"Railway Act\" that is to be guarded against, but that the respondent company \"should not be relieved from\" otherwise complying with the Dominion Act which declared the work in question to be for the general advantage of Canada.\nIt is not the \"Railway Act,\" but this latter Act that prohibited the laying down of a railway upon any highway without the consent of the municipal council, which was not effectively got till after the 20th of July, 1907.\nIf the orders in question are to be construed as the following quotation from the judgment of the late Chief Commissioner indicates they were intended to be construed, then I see nothing in them to complain of.\nThe land across which a railway is sought to be located may belong to the Crown, or be a part of an Indian Reserve, and the consent of the Governor in Council to its use or occupation by the company may be necessary under sections 172 or 175 of the Railway Act, or it may have been reserved for naval or military purposes, when the license and consent of the Crown under the hand and seal of the Governor-General is required by section 174. It may belong to another railway company, in which case the new company cannot use or occupy it without the leave of the Board. under section 176, which, in approving the location plan, would not bind itself to grant such leave. The line may cross navigable waters, when the site, as well as the plans, must be approved by the Governor in Council, under section 233. In deciding whether to sanction plans and profiles shewing the proposed location of a railway, the Board does not usually consider matters of this kind or questions as to the existence of public highways along the route, or whether such highways or railways shall be crossed by the proposed new railway, or, if so, where or how, or the measures to be taken for the safety of the public or otherwise in connection with such crossings, or' whether, or where, the railway shall be operated upon or along a highway, or on what portions thereof, or the provisions to be made in connection with the same; and orders sanctioning such locations should not be considered as impliedly authorising obstruction of highways by railway works.\nThis is the settled jurisprudence of the Board.\nAnd it was not a necessary condition precedent to the approval of the location plans that the party should first have the consent of the municipal authority to the construction of the railway upon the public highway. This might be left until the company ascertained whether the proposed location would meet with the approval of the Board from an engineering standpoint.\nCan we say, however, that the orders do not go further?\nAre they in such shape as to enable us to categorically answer the questions put regarding them?\nI still adhere to the interpretation I gave in the case of the Montreal Street Railway Co. v. The Montreal Terminal Railway Co.[2], at page 391, to what, in substance, is now in sections 54 and 56, sub-section 9, of the \"Railway Act,\" Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, ch. 37.\nWe are told that a much wider effect is given by some courts to unauthorized orders of the Board that I am disposed to give and that a danger exists unless the orders in question are repealed that they may have such a wider effect than intended by the Board as above set forth.\nHaving regard, however, to the limitation, by section 159 above quoted, in regard to the meaning of such orders as within its scope, and the cognate nature of the orders in question, I think they can be similarly limited and ought to be read as so limited. As to the rescinding of any order beyond the jurisdiction of the Board, the doing so must be to a certain extent a matter of discretion.\nIn the view I have taken and referred to as above expressed, there may be for the protection of those who acted under such an order, as exceeded the jurisdiction of the Board, a duty to let the order stand for that purpose.\nI assume, of course, that in default of such need or similar proper purpose it is desirable to rescind any order found not to have fallen within the jurisdiction making it.\nI would answer, therefore, the questions submitted, as follows:\nQ. (1) \u2014Whether the Board of Railway Commissioners had jurisdiction, prior to the 20th day of July, 1907, to make the orders above complained of and each of them?\nA.\u2014Yes, so far as approving merely the location of the railway and the grades and curves thereof as shewn in a plan, profile and book of reference such as the \"Railway Act\" contemplates, but not to operate in the way of relieving the company from the condition imposed upon it of obtaining consent of the municipality or municipalities having jurisdiction over the highway in question.\nQ. (2)\u2014Whether the Board of Railway Commissioners had power to refuse to set aside its said orders so complained of?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ. (3)\u2014Whether, in view of the said by-law of the said Township of Sandwich West, passed in the year 1905, and the acceptance thereof at the time and in the matter herein above set forth, and the construction of the railway of the Windsor-Essex company upon and along the said gravel road, without objection on the part of the said municipality of Sandwich West, the Windsor-Essex company is now entitled to maintain and operate its railway upon and along the said gravel road?\nA.\u2014No.\nQ. (4)\u2014Whether the said by-laws of the said municipalities of the Townships of Sandwich East and Sandwich West, respectively passed on the 20th of July, 1907, are valid and sufficient to make lawful the construction and operation of the railway of the Windsor-Essex company upon and along the said gravel road; and whether the Board of Railway Commissioners may now lawfully authorize the Windsor-Essex company to so maintain and operate its said railway upon and along the said gravel road?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ. (5) \u2014Whether the leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners is necessary to enable the Terminal company to lay its tracks across the railway of the Windsor-Essex company upon the said gravel road?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ. (6) \u2014Whether the order proposed to be made by the said Board as aforesaid is one which, in the exercise of its discretion, the said Board has power to make?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nI think there should be no costs to either party.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Duff.\nDuff J.\u2014The late Chief Commissioner of the Board of Railway Commissioners has summarized the views expressed by him in his judgment in the following passage:\nThen the position which we have is this:\u2014The railway of one company has been constructed along a public highway without the necessary authority from the municipality or the Board; the required consent of the municipality or the municipalities has since been obtained, but not the requisite leave of the Board; with the authority of the Board it crosses, upon that highway, another railway; another company, having its location plan properly sanctioned by the Board and the leave of the Board to cross the highway on the line of that location, seeks to have the existing railway removed from the highway or to be allowed to cross it at the expense of the former, and to have the orders sanctioning the location plans of the first company and giving that company leave to cross the previously existing railway, set aside.\nWhile, as I have said, I think the Board has jurisdiction to require the removal of the rails from the highway at the point where the Essex Terminal Railway Company has leave to cross, I do not think that we are bound to do this. I think that we are entitled to exercise our discretion, in view of all the circumstances; that, in the fair exercise of that discretion, we may now authorize the maintenance and operation of the Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Rapid Railway Co. along the gravel road, and give leave to the Essex Terminal Railway Company to cross it and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's line, near the present railway crossing in such manner and with such protective appliances as our engineer shall recommend, but varying the condition as to the apportionment of the cost of maintenance and operation by dividing it equally between the two companies, instead of imposing two-thirds upon the Essex Terminal Railway Company. But, if the Essex Terminal Railway Company still finds it necessary in its own interests to have the point or points of crossing differently placed, that company should bear the expense of removing the line of the Windsor, Essex and Lake Shore Railway to the new point of crossing.\nIn such a case as this, I do not think that we are bound to recognize that an absolute right of priority in regard to such crossings is acquired by priority of sanction of location plans, or priority of leave to cross or run along highways. The two railways were being constructed almost simultaneously. The original by-law of the Township of Sandwich West failed to take effect only through one day's default and, possibly, through a slip in the method of attempted acceptance, but for which the railway would have been lawfully upon the highway when the Dominion Act was passed, and long before the Essex Terminal Railway Company obtained the Board's leave to cross the highway. The case appears to be one for the exercise of the Board's discretion.\nWith every word of this passage I agree.\nIt follows that questions two, four, five and six should all be answered in the affirmative; and, in this view, there would appear to be no necessity for expressing any opinion upon either of questions one or three.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cunningham & Lyon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Purdom & Purdom.\n[1] 7 Can.

La d\u00e9claration couvre vingt-quatre pages; les plaidoyers au fonds aussi vingt-quatre pages; et dix pages de d\u00e9fense en droit partielle. Puis viennent une r\u00e9ponse en droit partielle de la demanderesse et une autre au fond qui couvre vingt-quatre pages. Il n'est pas surprenant que les parties aient fait des efforts pour en r\u00e9duire le volume par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pr\u00e9liminaires. Par le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, la d\u00e9fense en droit \u00e0 toute l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, aussi bien que la r\u00e9ponse partielle de la demanderesse, et l'inscription sur la d\u00e9fense en droit partielle de la d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue en partie. Voil\u00e0 pourquoi les deux parties ont interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la cour du banc du roi, qui a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour inf\u00e9rieure. L'appel devant cette cour est seulement du jugement qui a maintenu la d\u00e9fense en droit partielle.\nSans entrer dans les d\u00e9tails nombreux de cette cause, qu'il nous suffise de dire que l'action intent\u00e9e par l'appellante est en d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance d'une franchise exclusive de construire et op\u00e9rer un aqueduc dans la ville de St. Jean conc\u00e9d\u00e9e par 40 Vict. eh. 68, des statuts de Qu\u00e9bec. Ce statut forme ce que l'on est convenue d'appeler la charte de la compagnie et a toute la force d'un contrat entre elle et la ville de St. Jean, avec le monopole du service de l'eau que la municipalit\u00e9 ne pouvait octroyer sans l'autorisation de la l\u00e9gislature. Par cette charte, la compagnie repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aujourd'hui par l'intim\u00e9e, en consid\u00e9ration de la concession de ce \"droit et privil\u00e8ge exclusif,\" s'est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir \u00e0 la ville de St. Jean et \u00e0 ses habitants \"une eau pure et saine,\" non-seulement pour les usages domestiques et leurs besoins en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais aussi pour la protection contre les incendies; et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par elle de le faire, la charte d\u00e9cr\u00e8te qu'elle sera d\u00e9chue et priv\u00e9e \"du privil\u00e8ge exclusif ci-dessus \u00e9tabli.\" L'appelante all\u00e8gue que la compagnie n'a pas rempli cette obligation impos\u00e9e par la charte, et comme preuve, elle \u00e9num\u00e8re plusieurs faits, conventions et arrangements intervenus pour arriver au r\u00e9sultat pr\u00e9vu par la charte, qu'elle a tous viol\u00e9s, dit l'appelante; puis elle conclut \u00e0 la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Le savant juge en chef Taschereau, parlant au nom de la cour, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la situation entre les parties en quelques mots que voici:\nLe tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance a fait reposer sa d\u00e9cision sur la distinction entre les obligations de Mme. Roy impos\u00e9es par la lai \u00e0 peine de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de ses droits, et celles dont le d\u00e9faut d'ex\u00e9cution ne devait avoir d'autres cons\u00e9quences que celles pr\u00e9vues pour les cas ordinaires d'inex\u00e9cution d'obligations. Nous croyons qu'il a eu raison.\nIl y aurait une autre distinction \u00e0 faire entre les devoirs et obligations impos\u00e9s par le statut et ceux qui r\u00e9sultent de conventions particuli\u00e8res. Il n'y a que la violation des premiers, et encore, comme je viens de le dire, seulement dans les cas o\u00f9 elle est prononc\u00e9e express\u00e9ment, que la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance peut avoir lieu.\nL'inex\u00e9cution des autres obligations, de toutes celles n\u00e9es des conventions et de celles impos\u00e9es par le statut o\u00f9 la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance n'est pas prononc\u00e9e, ne peuvent donner ouverture qu'au recours en dommages ordinaires.\nAvec toute la d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible, je ne puis accepter cette distinction, bien qu'elle ne soit pas importante pour d\u00e9cider le litige. Il me semble que s'il est un point bien \u00e9tabli dans notre jurisprudence, c'est que, dans certains cas, l'inex\u00e9cution des obligations stipul\u00e9es dans des conventions peut emporter la r\u00e9solution du contrat, ce qui dans l'esp\u00e8ce est la m\u00eame chose que la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par le statut, car dans les deux cas il faut que la r\u00e9vocation soit prononc\u00e9e en justice. L'article 1065 du code civil se lit comme suit:\nToute obligation rend le d\u00e9biteur passible de dommages en cas de contravention de sa part; dans les cas qui le permettent, le cr\u00e9ancier peut aussi demander l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation m\u00eame, et l'autorisation de la faire ex\u00e9cuter aux d\u00e9pens du d\u00e9biteur, ou la r\u00e9solution du contrat d'o\u00f9 na\u00eet l'obligation; sauf les exceptions contenues dans ce code et sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son recours pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans tous les cas. Puis l'article 1066:\nLe cr\u00e9ancier peut aussi, sans pr\u00e9judice des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, demander que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en contravention \u00e0 l'obligation soit d\u00e9truit, s'il y a lieu; et le tribunal peut ordonner que cela soit fait par ses officiers, ou autoriser la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire aux d\u00e9pens de l'autre.\nJe crois que ce principe fut appliqu\u00e9 dans une cause de Valiquette v. Archambault[3]. A la page 54, l'on trouve les consid\u00e9rants de ce jugement dont je d\u00e9tache le suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que bien que l'article 1184 du code Napol\u00e9on qui \u00e9nonce que la condition r\u00e9solutoire est toujours sous-entendue dans les contrats, pour le cas o\u00f9 l'une des parties ne satisfera point \u00e0 son engagement, n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite en termes expr\u00e8s dans notre propre code civil, nos codificateurs ont pourvu au m\u00eame cas et exprim\u00e9 le m\u00eame principe dans l'article 1065 de notre dit code civil, qui permet, m\u00eame en l'absence de la condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse, de demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat d'o\u00f9 na\u00eet l'obligation qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie. (Voir rapport des codificateurs, 7 DeLorimier, Bibl. du Code civil, pp. 626 et 627):\nConsid\u00e9rant que les dits auteurs de notre code n'ont d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 ce-principe et n'ont fait exception \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, applicable \u00e0 tous les contrats, que dans le cas de vente d'immeubles.\nCe jugement, il est vrai, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la cour de revision, mais sur un autre point: voir 8 id. 174. .\nDans une cause r\u00e9cemment d\u00e9cid\u00e9e et rapport\u00e9e dans le dernier num\u00e9ro des rapports judiciaires de la cour du banc du roi, Corporation of the Town of G rand'M\u00e8re v. L'Hydraulique de Grand'M\u00e8re[4], la cour d'appel, compos\u00e9e de Tascliereau J.C., Boss\u00e9, Blahchet, Lavergne et Cross JJ., a reconnu l'existence d'une action comme celle-ci. Il ne s'agissait pas de contravention \u00e0 des obligations impos\u00e9es par un statut, mais uniquement d'inex\u00e9cution des obligations stipul\u00e9es par les parties. Le juge Cross, parlant au nom de la cour, dit: In such circumstances, the action in revocation of the privilege was a form of recourse properly open to the appellant.\nLa r\u00e9vocation ne fut pas prononc\u00e9e vu le consentement des parties qu'un d\u00e9lai de neuf mois soit accord\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire de l'aqueduc pour compl\u00e9ter ses travaux. Le juge Cross n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que cet ordre de la cour n'est pas le meilleur rem\u00e8de. A la page 92 du rapport, il observe:\nIt is not to be overlooked that the supply of drinkable water is a matter of the most important necessity, that the appellant had alienated its rights respecting water supply and could do nothing to provide water to its people while this concession stood in the way. Under such circumstances, an action to coerce the respondent to fulfil its obligations in the many respects in which default had been made would have been an unsatisfactory recourse.\nLe principe de Particle 1065 du code civil n'est pas particulier \u00e0 la province de Qu\u00e9bec. On le trouve aussi dans l'article 1184 du code Napol\u00e9on. Dans la note 4 \u00e0 cet article, Gilbert sur Sirey nous donne l'historique de ce principe, aussi bien qu'une longue liste d'autorit\u00e9s.\nReste une difficult\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant nous. L'appelante n'a pas demand\u00e9 par son action la r\u00e9siliation ou la r\u00e9vocation des dits contrats et conventions. Elle va m\u00eame plus loin; elle se r\u00e9serve tout recours qu'elle pout avoir pour faire prononcer la r\u00e9siliation d'un de ces contrats, le march\u00e9 du 1er. juin, 1892. Elle demande seulement que tous les privil\u00e8ges qui appartiennent \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e en vertu de l'acte de Qu\u00e9bec, 40 Vict. ch. 68, soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s d\u00e9chus, nuls et annull\u00e9s, et cela suffit dans mon humble opinion. Il ne s'agit en effet que de la franchise exclusive conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par le statut.\nNous croyons que tout ce qui se rattache \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des obligations de la charte peut et doit faire la mati\u00e8re de l'enqu\u00eate. Citons un exemple, peut-\u00eatre le plus favorable aux pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9e, celui de la compagnie \"Singer,\" qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exlus par les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. Elle n'est pas mentionn\u00e9e dans la charte, pas plus que les autres habitants qui, \u00e0 l'origine de l'aqueduc, formaient la population de St. Jean, ou y sont venus depuis ou y viendront pendant les quarante-six ans de l'exercise de la franchise. Ils sont tous compris dans l'obligation de fournir l'eau aux habitants de la ville, et, si c'est pour des fins industrielles, comme dans le cas de la \"Singer,\" que la ville \u00e9tait anxieuse d'avoir dans ses limites, les parties peuvent faire des arrangements pour mieux remplir l'obligation de la charte. Et puis, pendant ce long espace de temps, la ville se d\u00e9veloppera, de nouvelles m\u00e9thodes d'op\u00e9rer un aqueduc, des am\u00e9liorations, en un mot, seront d\u00e9couvertes, peut-on raisonnablement refuser aux parties le pouvoir de les adopter, toujours afin de mieux atteindre le but de la charte[5]. Ce que la demanderesse a toujours demand\u00e9, ce fut le service d'un eau pure et saine pour les besoins de ses habitants, ce qu'elle a le droit d'avoir par la charte, et ce qu'elle n'a pu obtenir jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. Les conventions et les arrangements subs\u00e9quents et leur violation de la part de l'intim\u00e9e ne sont que des d\u00e9tails,. des exemples du refus ou d\u00e9faut de la part de l'intim\u00e9e de remplir l'obligation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale impos\u00e9e par la charte de fournir l'eau. Je ne puis concevoir que l'on puisse rendre justice \u00e0 la demanderesse sans lui permettre d'en faire la preuve. C'est tout ce qu'elle para\u00eet avoir en vue. Elle ne demande pas la confiscation ou la destruction de l'aqueduc de la d\u00e9fenderesse; il restera. toujours sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ce qu'elle demande c'est la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la franchise exclusive que lui conf\u00e8re non pas les dites conventions, mais le statut, 40 Vict.ch. 68, afin de lui permettre, ainsi qu'elle l'affirme dans sa d\u00e9claration, de construire elle-m\u00eame un aqueduc municipal. Les parties les ont consenties simplement pour donner plus d'efficacit\u00e9 et de pr\u00e9cision \u00e0 ses dispositions. La demanderesse all\u00e8gue que la d\u00e9fenderesse a abus\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re grossi\u00e8re pendant un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es de tous les pouvoirs qu'elle lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9s et cela nonobstant plusieurs plaintes et protestations. Nous croyons qu'il est dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que l'enqu\u00eate se fasse sur tous ces faits et conventions afin de mieux appr\u00e9cier la conduite des parties.\nL'appel doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre accord\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens devant cette cour et la cour d'appel, et la d\u00e9fense en droit partielle renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Taschereau in the Court of King's Bench of Quebec, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The determination of this appeal must depend on whether or not the relationship created between the appellant and respondent's corporate predecessor, created by virtue of chapter 65 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859, was of a contractual character, and so within the resolutive provision of article 1065 of the Civil Code of Quebec.\nThe method of incorporation provided by the said Act is that at least five persons shall set forth the purpose for which they desire incorporation; that is for the purpose of furnishing a supply of gas or water or both, for the village, town or city named, wherein it is proposed to operate, and upon the required declaration being filled up, with the details specified in the said Act, and acknowledged before the mayor or chief magistrate of the city, town or village named, he shall grant a certificate of these facts.\nThereupon the people so promoting petition the council of the said village, town or city to pass a bylaw, granting authority to them as a company, to lay down pipes for the conveyance of gas or water or both, under the streets, squares and other public places of such city, town or village.\nWhen all these formalities, of which the requisite details appear in the first three sections of the Act, have been complied with, and the by-law has been passed and registered as required, the petitioners and all others joining them, as stock-holders forming the company thereby established, shall be a body corporate with the style and title mentioned in such declaration.\nThe whole purpose of this statute is that any town or city may avail itself of the means thus furnished, of obtaining wholly or in part by means of private enterprise, a supply of gas or water or both for the corporate municipality and its inhabitants.\nIt becomes the business of the municipal council on the presentation of such a petition to make the best bargain it can on behalf of those it represents. Sometimes the bargain takes on an express form of contract beyond what appears in the by-law. In other cases as here the mere passing of the by-law and the documentary material prescribed by the statute and upon which the by-law was passed are combined with the legal implications arising therefrom alone relied on to determine the respective rights of the parties concerned. The question is thus raised here of what is implied in this proceeding and this franchise-granting by-law.\nIt is quite clear that on the one side there is granted that which the municipal council had full power to grant or to withhold.\nNo power could interfere with the exercise of the council's will. It might have imposed such conditions as it saw fit.\nIt might have refused the prayer of the petitioners absolutely without its reason for so refusing being open to question by anybody but the constituent body electing the council.\nWhat lies at the bottom of the proceeding if it is not that of a contractual character? The company undertakes that it will supply that which it is incorporated to supply, and that the duty which has by the grant and acceptance thereof been cast upon the company accepting such a grant shall be discharged. The obligation is only what the law implies, yet its nature is contractual for it is expressly founded upon the mutual consent of the parties and nothing else.\nIn effect the municipal council exchanges the uses of its streets and squares, and right to open the same, in return for the implied promise to give the needed supply of gas or water as the case may be.\nIs there not in this transaction the very essence of reciprocal obligation of a contractual character?\nOn the part of the village, town or city there is an obligation that for the agreed period, up to fifty years or less, as may be agreed upon, the franchise given shall be enjoyed.\nIf that be not so then the council could repeal its by-law at any moment it saw fit, as it is usually implied by law that the power to enact a by-law carries with it the right to repeal, unless in such case as this, that there is an implied obligation that once passed it shall stand unrepealed, so long as the conditions on which it was passed are observed. On the other hand there are implied obligations that the corporations thus created and enfranchised shall observe and discharge the functions for which it was created.\nI admit that there may be, by virtue of its creation, obligations resting upon a corporate creation without being of such a contractual character as seems necessary to bring them within the operation of article 1065.\nIt may also be that in English law, apart from special legislation, there is no effectual remedy either in such a case, or in such a case as this of a contractual nature, save by such means as will imply action or assent to action by the attorney-general.\nBut article 1065 of the Civil Code is a provision that seems to me to render the interference of the attorney-general unnecessary, if we find the relationship in question contractual.\nIt is with an eye to the application of this article 1065 C.C. that I have dwelt upon the nature of the legal relations arising out of such a petition and such a by-law thereupon and the acceptance of the concession thereby given the respondents' predecessor in title.\nWe must seek for the solution determining whether or not the relation in question is of a contractual character in the application of the general principles of law. There is no Quebec or Ontario decision on this statute as to the nature of the relationship created by the incorporation.\nProbably the question of the legal quality of the relationship arising between an incorporating power and the corporation it creates and the corporators has never been so exhaustively examined elsewhere as in the case of the Trustees of Dartmough College v. Woodward[6], in the Supreme Court of the United States.\nThere it was found that there was a contract existing as the result of incorporation.\nThe college had been incorporated in the days when what became later the State of New Hampshire belonged to the British Crown and the attempted interference of that state occurred long after that state had become subject to the constitution of the United States and was thereby prohibited from enacting any \"law impairing the obligation of contract.\"\nChief Justice Marshall in his judgment says, at page 643:\nThis is plainly a contract to which the donors, the trustees and the Crown (to whose rights and obligations New Hampshire succeeds) were the original parties.\nThe decision is not a binding authority upon us, but the opinion thus expressed is that of one whose authority is of the highest and his opinion in this regard has stood the strain for nearly ninety years.\nIt has been accepted generally and acted upon in the cases cited to us of other American authorities as a correct exposition of the law on the subject.\nIf, even without going so far as that opinion goes, we look at the substance of what necessarily takes place under the consolidated statute, ch. 65, and already referred to, we find much less difficulty than arose in that case in holding that the relationship created between the appellant and the company in question was of a contractual character.\nThen in 1874, during and pursuant to such relationship and statute, a bargain was made between the corporate company and the appellants for a service of supply of water.\nThis for reasons not quite clear and of no concern here was followed by 40 Vict. ch. 68, which substituted one Louis Molleur, the younger, as proprietor of all the property privileges and franchises of the company and charged him with all its obligations.\nSee section 1 of that Act which is as follows:\n1. Louis Molleur the younger, of the Town of St. John's, in the District of Iberville and Province of Quebec, is and shall be the sole proprietor in his own name of the waterworks of St. John's, in place and stead of the Waterworks Company of St. John's, and he is substituted to the said company as proprietor of all the property, and charged with all the obligations and responsibilities of the said company.\nThe only addition Molleur got to this company's franchise was that it became exclusive instead of subject to competition.\nInstead of being freed, as a result of this exclusive right, from the obligations of the company the more obvious I should say would be the legal implication of and for his continuing bound.\nThe obligation always existed to supply water.\nThat was the consideration for the franchise. When that supply ceased there arose the liability to have the contract I have found dissolved, and as a consequence the franchise declared forfeit. It was not every slip or accident that might give rise to such a result. It was as against the wilful and persistent disregard of the proper observation of its obligations to the power that created it that this right of rescission existed in law for the protection of the municipal corporation and those it represented during the existence of the company and the same remedy was the appropriate one that bound Molleur upon assuming the company's obligations.\nAn additional right was furnished by section 3, as against Molleur, who became substituted for the company, but apparently confined so far as that section operated, to a forfeiture only of the exclusive privilege created by this Act.\nI think this was a wise precaution, though perhaps not necessary. Its existence in no way limited the original rights of those concerned when and if the charter became forfeited, to have it so judicially declared under article 1065 C.C.\nIt is not the contracts or breaches of contracts the respondent or his predecessor may have undertaken, but the breaches of such contracts as all or either may have entered into by virtue of this franchise and pursuant to duties arising thereunder, or refusal to make and observe reasonable contracts, that might work a forfeiture of the franchise transferred to respondent's predecessors always subject, however, to forfeiture.\nEach and every one of such broken contracts are good ground of complaint under this original compact on which the respondents' rights rest. In violating any such contract the company or its successor or successors violated the obligations they were under and persistence therein caused it to fall within the meaning and range of this original power of forfeiture.\nEven if, as alleged, the appellant had given notice of an abandonment of any such special contract, if it should turn out that the abandonment arose from a persistent course of misconduct on Molleur's or respondents' part, setting the appellant and its legal rights and demands at defiance, such abandonment could not be set up as an excuse for such a course of conduct on his part or relieve him from the possible forfeiture this misconduct had wrought.\nThe appellant could not be expected to go on forever paying for nothing. The termination of payments and consequent rescission of that contract did not obliterate the rights to forfeit that had accrued by reason of such default.\nThe same is true in regard to the wilful violation of contracts it was his duty under the franchise to have entered into with any of the inhabitants whom the appellant represents.\nThe respondents question such right or duty of representation.\nAt a very early stage (1854) in the history of municipal institutions of such a type as is now common in Canada the right of a municipal corporation through its council to represent the people residing within the municipality in relation to public property and public rights and especially rights of the inhabitants acquired by and through the action of the corporation was challenged in the case of Town of Guelph v. The Canada Co.[7]. It was there decided that the question of the dedication to the public of a public square having been accepted by the public could be raised by a suit of the corporation claiming so to represent the public within the municipality.\nThe learned Chancellor Blake, who so held, supported his judgment by a reference to American authority rested on an English case. There can be no doubt that wherever the municipal legislation empowers the establishment of waterworks by the municipal council and also empowers such a means of doing it as chapter 65 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 1859, affords, that the public interests are properly represented by the municipal corporation having such a matter as water supply or other service confided to its charge, in all that may be necessary to be done for the protection of the property of the corporate body and generally speaking of the inhabitants concerned.\nIt does not follow that for purposes of recovering private damages it can do so.\nNor does it follow that the individual inhabitants can assert a right of action for damages suffered by reason of the failure of one contracting with the city to furnish hydrants, etc., to discharge his duty in that regard. See Cunningham v. Furniss[8].\nI do not desire to say more as to that subject as these pleadings shew an action is now pending at the suit of an inhabitant and I have neither investigated the subject nor formed an opinion upon the law as it stands in Quebec.\nI merely desire to point out some of the difficulties that may exist in recovering damages and thus render it more necessary to assert the right to rescission if it exist. The result in Johnston v. Consumers' Gas Co. of Toronto[9], and consequent need of Ontario legislation, as in 63 Vict. ch. 35, would be impossible in Quebec if my view of the relationship between the two corporations being of a contractual nature be correct, for the case falls then within article 1065 of the Civil Code.\nThe need and purpose of the further contract was merely to define specifically the mode agreed upon for the company discharging its main duty towards the municipality or the inhabitants respectively; that is to supply water.\nIn default of such specification having been agreed upon the extent of the obligation inherent in the original contract would be measured by what under all the circumstances would be found reasonable.\nThe condition of things might be such that the extent to which that would reach might be very limited indeed.\nFor example, it could not be supposed that the original obligation would extend beyond what the authorized corporate capital of the company reasonably applied could produce.\nIf, however, the company formed such a contract as it did, in 1874, then the measure so adopted should define the binding limits unless and until conditions changed.\nThere is set forth quite enough in relation to that contract alone as well as many other material allegations all of which the demurrer admits to entitle the plaintiff to the judgment prayed for, and I see no good purpose to be served in face of such admission by postponing for evidence to be taken. Doing so only adds to expense and unjustifiable delay.\nI think, on the whole, that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. agreed with Girouard\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bisaillon, Chasse & Brossard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Roy, Roy & St. Cyr.\n[1] Q.R. 16 K.B. 559.\n[2] 40 Can.

In no case will the patent issue before the expiration of two years of occupation of the land, or the fulfilment of the whole of the conditions, even though the land be paid for in full. Subject also, to current licenses to cut timber on the land, and the purchaser to pay for any real improvements now existing thereon, belonging to any other party. This sale is, moreover, subject to the laws and regulations concerning the public lands, wood and forests, mines and fisheries in this Province.\nF. A. Gendron, Agent.\nCaution.\u2014If the Commissioner of Crown Lands is satisfied that any purchaser of public lands, or any assignee claiming under him has been guilty of any fraud or imposition, or has violated or neglected to comply with any of the conditions of sale or if any sale has been made in error or mistake, he may cancel such sale, and resume the land therein mentioned, and dispose of it as if no sale thereof has been made. Extract from 20th sec, Act 32 Vict. ch. 11.\nOn the 23rd May, 1903, a patent was issued to the appellants for the south part of lot No. 18 of the Gore of the Township of Templeton. In this patent there is a proviso that the grant is subject to the laws and regulations concerning public lands, mines and fisheries in the province. On the 25th of May, 1905, the appellants received from the Crown Timber Agency at Hull the following;\nCrown Timber Agency.\nHull, Que., 25th May, 1905. No. 203.\nReceived from John and Alex. Green the sum of seventy-five dollars, being the amount of dues on the undermentioned wood goods cut during the season of 190.\nS. part lot 18, Gore Templeton, mining rights.\nL. T. Gendron, Agent.\nThis sum of $ 75.00 was duly remitted to the Minister of Lands, Mines and Fisheries, by the agent who in doing so stated that it was a balance due on the south half of lot 18 Gore of Templeton mining lot for John and Alex. Green.\nI cannot find in the case any acknowledgment of this letter until the 15th of November, 1905, and then only incidentally in replying to a letter from the agent dated 11th November, 1905, requesting a patent for the mines to be issued to John Green and referring to the lot as being in dispute between Messrs. Russell Blackburn and the said Mr. Green.\nIn this letter of 15th November, 1905, the Deputy Minister promises that the $75.00 deposited by the Greens in the department will be reimbursed to them and the patent issued to the Messrs. Blackburn Bros. It is alleged in these letters that Messrs. Blackburn had bought and paid for the mining rights in the lot 18 a year before Greens had made any application. The agent at Hull thereupon on the 17th November, 1905, writes John Green that the Messrs. Blackburn Bros. had bought the mining rights on the south half of lot 18 Gore of Templeton on the 16th July, 1904, and sends him a cheque for $75 being the amount given by Green for the same.\nIt appears in the case, by a letter from the agent to the department enclosing a cheque for $375, that the department were requested on the 16th July, 1904, to issue a patent to Blackburn.\nIt would appear from this letter that the cheque was for the south half of lot 18 Gore of Templeton and other lands in the same township, and as if the discovery had been made by one Edward Patry who had transferred to Russell Blackburn.\nIt would seem from the evidence that the transaction was not closed in 1904, and it was only closed on the 12th July, 1905. The evidence on this point is interesting:\nQ.\u2014You did not buy it from Patry\u2014Patry's permit was for lot 17? A.\u201417 and 18.\nQ.\u2014What part of 18? A,\u2014The north half.\nQ.\u2014So it was under Patry's permit that you actually intended to work? A.\u2014When we first started?\nQ.\u2014Yes. A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And was it not under that same permit that you were buying Patry's rights for $375 from Mr. Gendron? A.\u2014No; under Patry's license he had the whole of 17 and the north half of 18.\nQ.\u2014That was only a prospecting license Patry had? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Didn't you pay this $375 to secure the mining rights under the license for permission to explore which you had got transfers from Party to you? A.\u2014To secure part of the lots he had under his license.\nQ.\u2014That was what the $375 was for? A.\u2014Yes.\nCross-examined by Mr. Aylen:\nQ.\u2014I see a receipt here dated July, 1905, signed Jules Cote, did you pay that money then? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You got that from the secretary of the department\u2014that receipt. A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Is that his signature? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And what was that for? A.\u2014That was for the payment of the balance of lot 18 in the Gore of Templeton.\nQ.\u2014And afterwards did you get from the Hon. Mr. Provost. Minister of Mines and Fisheries, Exhibit No. 2\u2014mining concessions? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Was the $490 mentioned there paid on the 24th of February, or was it paid part on the 12th of July, 1905, and partly before, do you remember? It. says: \"Balance of purchase of mining rights?\" A.\u2014Yes, we had paid for twenty-five acres and this $490 was for the balance, and that was for lot 17, I think. That is a receipt for the balance we paid and this is what we got afterwards, a receipt for the whole thing.\nQ.\u2014But the balance of the money for lot 18 was paid on the 12th of July, 1905? A.\u2014Yes.\nIt would seem as if this Blackburn application remained ungranted at the time when the agent in Hull had as above stated transmitted on behalf of the appellants $75. It would seem moreover, as if neither of applicants had deposited enough of money to cover the price fixed by the department for the mining lands respectively sought after by each of these applicants; rightly or wrongly the appellants entertain a suspicion that they were not fairly dealt with and that in an irregular manner Blackburns were preferred over them. I cannot say for I have no right to pass upon the question at present whether the suspicion be well founded or not. It appears upon this evidence that if the Minister had desired he could notwithstanding anything that appears before us have upon receipt of the $75 pointed out to the Messrs. Green wherein their application failed or fell short by reason of the amount of money forwarded being less than could be received; and they might thereupon have made that good and he might also have discarded the Blackburn application founded upon a prospecting license that did not cover the south half of lot 18.\nNotwithstanding all that I do not see how Messrs. Green can herein maintain that any prior right in-law had been acquired by them by reason of the Minister preferring one irregular application over another. It was entirely within his province in such a case to prefer one of two irregular applications over the other.\nThe case of the selection of one party over the other as referred to above might if brought about by improper means have given rise to a case of a different character when the right of the party suffering could be asserted but only by means of an application or information to set aside the patent.\nIt is urged, however, that quite independently of the deposit of $75 the appellants had by virtue of the above location ticket or patent a prior right in law to acquire the mining rights and that such prior right could not be set aside without notice to the appellants.\nIt is said on the other hand, that in such a case if the Minister chose to disregard that preferential right the only remedy would be against the Crown by way of petition of right or possibly an application in some other way to have the patent issued to Blackburn rescinded as having been issued improvidently. It is urged that such would be the only remedy. I do not so understand the law.\nIf by statute there had been clearly created a mining right in the owner of the land it could be only set aside by an express enactment of the legislature, or by following the proceedings expressed in the law whereby forfeiture might be brought about of such preferential right, by notice to him, and the opportunity being given to avail himself of his privilege. No ex parte act of the Minister could invade the right created by statute and vested in another, and hence the appellants would if of the class given such a right have had a good defence. The appellants set up a claim of this kind as derived from and by virtue of the location ticket quoted above. The location ticket does not maintain such a pretension nor can I find that the statute by virtue of which the location ticket was issued justifies any such pretension existing in the holder of any location ticket.\nArt. 1269 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, is as follows:\nUpon the conditions and for the price regulated and established by the Lieutenant- Governor in Council, the Crown lands agent, if there is no contestation, is bound to grant a location ticket to any person who asks to purchase a lot of public lands for colonization purposes, if the lot asked for is for sale and not already granted.\nSuch grant is, however, subject to the approval of the Commissioner, and shall not prejudice the right of the latter to sell the lands under the Mining Act as well as firewood lots under existing regulations and sugary lands.\nBy sec. 14, ch. 22 of 60 Vict of the Province of Quebec, the above article was amended as follows:\nArt. 1269 of the Revised Statutes is amended by replacing of the words, after the words \"right of the latter,\" in the second line of the second part by the words: \"to sell the land as firewood lots under existing regulations and sugary lands, nor the right of the Commissioner of Colonization and Mines to sell the lots under the law respecting mines.\"\nThe article was further amended by ch. 14 of 63 Vict, by replacing the second clause thereof by the following:\nSales made by Crown lands agents if not disapproved by the Commissioner within four months thereafter take effect from the date' when they were made by such agents.\nSuch grant, however, shall not prejudice the right of the Commissioner to sell, under the regulations, the lands as firewood lots and as sugary lands, nor the right of the Commissioner of Colonization and Mines to sell the lots under, the laws respecting mines.\nThis came in force on the 23rd of March, 1900. It is under this last amendment that the location ticket in question issued. I cannot understand how under that or any of the previous statutory provisions above recited, there could ever since 1888 have existed a right in a locatee to the minerals or to any preferential right of purchase thereto.\nWe were referred to certain interpretation clauses that would go, when read in conjunction with art. 1441 in connection with art. 1440, to support this right, but I cannot find anything that could by any possibility give effect thereto in the manner claimed. The sections referred to evidently were intended to apply to the case of absolute dominion over the land and not to such limited rights as the locatee such as in question could claim. The only legislation had in the way of further amending art. 1269 was after this location ticket had been issued and in no way adds to the force of the foregoing so far as any right the appellants may have had by virtue of their location ticket.\nThen the question is raised as to how the appellant could have acquired any such rights in minerals as he sets up by virtue of his patent. The patent itself does not confer any such right and the only reference made to the subject at all in the patent is the last paragraph thereof which reads as follows:\nProvided, always, that this grant is subject to the laws and regulations concerning public lands, mines and fisheries in this province.\nWe have not been shewn any further enactment or regulation directly or expressly conferring any such right in a patentee. It is difficult to see how one having acquired a patent merely by virtue of complying with all the conditions of such a location ticket as the one here issued pursuant to any enactment such as art. 1269 in the Revised Statutes, 1888, or as it appeared in any of all its modifications down to the time when the appellants obtained the location ticket in question could claim any preferential mining right such as set up here. Such rights seem to have been expressly excluded from the operation of any location ticket under art. 1269.\nThen the appellants fall back upon arts. 1440 and 1441 Art. 1440 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec is as follows:\nThe mining rights belonging to the Crown which consist of the ownership of the property under the soil, under articles 1423 and 1424, may be acquired from the Commissioner by sale or lease or by license or permit of occupation by the proprietor of the soil, who has a preferential right to the purchase of such mining rights.\nAny miner may acquire mining rights if the proprietor of the soil neglect or refuse to work the said mines, after having put the proprietor in default by notice given under articles 1483 and 1484, by paying, upon the award of arbitrators as hereinafter provided, all the damages and losses that he may cause the latter in mining or attempting to mine under such soil.\nArts. 1423 and 1424 referred to in this art. 1440 read as follows:\n1423. It shall not be necessary, in any letters-patent for lands granted for agricultural purposes, to mention the reserve of mining rights, which reserve is always supposed to exist under the provisions of this section.\n1424. As respects the Crown, such mining rights, so tacitly reserved, shall be property separate from the soil covering such mines and minerals comprised in such rights, and shall constitute a property under the soil which shall also be public property, independent from that of the soil which is above it, unless the proprietor of the soil has acquired it from the Crown as a mining location or otherwise, in which case both the soil and the property under the soil form but one and the same private property.\n2. However, whenever a person who has become owner of the soil and of the property under the soil, under any title, before the 10th of June, 1884, sells, hypothecates, leases or affects the mining rights in. such property to- another person, under article 2099 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, such soil and the property under the soil again become two properties perfectly distinct and independent from each other, for all lawful purposes, as they were when in the possession of the Crown, so that the sale, judicial or otherwise, of one of these properties, does not in any way affect the other.\n3. It is, however, well understood that the rights acquired over such property, during the confusion in the ownership of the soil and of the property under the soil, are in no wise affected by the subsequent sale of mining rights and the division of the property in the soil and of that under the soil arising therefrom under this section; except only that the owner of the property under the soil shall be sued and made a party to the suit in the same manner as if he had purchased a part or portion of the soil.\nIn the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1888, we find the following:\n1425. Any person who previous to the 24th July, 1880, obtained by letters patent, for agricultural purposes but with reservation by the Government of the mining rights, any lot whatever, forming part of the public lands of the province, may, if he or his legal representative discover and wish to work a mine, purchase the mining rights so reserved by the Government, by paying in cash to the Commissioner, over and above the price already paid for said lot, a sufficient additional amount to make up the sum of two dollars per acre, if for gold or silver, and one dollar per acre, if for copper, iron, lead or other baser metal.\n1426. Every proprietor of land, sold for agricultural purposes, by letters patent, but without any reservation by the Government of the mining rights, or the legal representative of such proprietor, who discovers upon such land a gold or. silver mine, may work the same, without taking out a license for that purpose, by paying to the Commissioner, over and above the price already paid for such land, a sufficient additional amount to make up the sum of two dollars per acre.\nIt clearly appears from these two lastly mentioned articles that, in 1888, there probably were by virtue of prior law consolidated in these articles outstanding rights of persons who, previous to the 24th July, 1888, had obtained letters patent or, later and until the law was amended, might have obtained patents and yet had preferential rights, even where the reservation had been made by the Government of the mining rights in any lot patented for agricultural purposes. This option was given to such patentees by the payment of an amount additional to that they had paid to make up the sum of $2 per acre, if for gold or silver, or f 1 per acre if for copper, iron, lead or other baser metal.\nThe other class, art. 1426, does not cover the appellants' case.\nThen it is set up here by the appellant that by virtue of art. 1441 as it stood at the time of their purchase when read in connection with art. 1440 above set forth that the patentees had acquired a preferential right.\nArt. 1441 as it stood at the time in question by virtue of its last of many amendments up to that time being 1 Edw. VII. ch. 13, sec. 2, was as follows:\nArt. 1441. The mining rights belonging to the Crown in the lands of private individuals may also be acquired in the manner indicated in the foregoing article.\nWe are asked to read these two articles (1440 and 1441) together and it is ingeniously suggested that the words in art. 1440, \"who has a preferential right to the purchase of such mining rights\" were intended to confer and did confer down to the date of the appellant's patent a preferential right such as is indicated existed in some proprietors of the soil.\nI cannot read these words after considering the legislation I have set forth so fully as conferring any right upon the appellants. The words do not expressly confer any. They are an express recognition of the fact that some proprietors of the soil had acquired such preferential rights by virtue of some earlier legislation and that those who had acquired such rights by prior legislation had such control over the soil that the right could only be invaded by the express methods pointed out in the art. 1440 and also in later legislation.\nFull effect is given to these words relied upon by attributing to them the cases of the operation of statutes conferring upon some of the earlier of the patentees the right to the minerals upon certain conditions. Such persons as then stood such owners and such of them as still own the property granted with that privilege are the persons who are referred to in art. 1441 by the words \"who has a preferential right to the purchase of such mining rights.\" The appellants had not brought themselves within that class or of any of those classes who enjoyed, as appears above in regard to some of them, the statutory right above referred to. The appellants do not seem to me ever to have had any preferential right or other right to the minerals by virtue of being locatees or patentees of the land in question. If the appellant who had obtained a mining license had discovered at the proper time the mine in question and followed it up by the proper steps he might have secured the mine. He did not do so, possibly because erroneously supposing that, when he became with his brother a locatee or patentee of the land, he had no more to do than sit down and enjoy the mine by virtue of the mining license he had got before his patent. I do not find as well founded this suggestion in argument that the two joined together created any right in law to the minerals in question.\nThe appeal I think must be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J. agreed in the opinion stated by Idington J. Duff J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the title to the mining rights under the south half of lot 18, Templeton Gore. The appellants on the 2nd of January, 1901, acquired a location ticket in respect of this land and they received a patent of it on the 23rd May, 1903. Under the law as it stood on the first mentioned of these dates, 55 and 56 Vict. sec. 1441, the mining rights in question were the property of the Crown but subject to a preferential right vested in \"the proprietor of the soil\" to acquire them on compliance with certain prescribed statutory conditions. On the 23rd of May, 1905, the appellants made application through the Crown lands agent at Hull for the purchase of these mining rights paying (I will assume) at the same time the price prescribed by the statute. If when this application was made, the preferential right conferred upon \"the proprietor of the soil\" by the enactment mentioned was vested in the appellants it is clear, in my opinion, that this application and payment (on the assumption mentioned) constituted a valid exercise of their preferential right of purchase; and, thereupon, they acquired such an interest in the rights in question as would prevent the Crown from afterwards conveying a title to them except as subject to that interest. On the other hand, if the appellants had then no such preferential right, I am unable to discover anything in the transaction between appellants and the Crown officials which could affect the title of the Crown.\nThe holder of a location ticket had by statute conferred upon him a conditional right to acquire a title to the lands in respect of which it was issued, subject to certain reservations. Among other things there was reserved to the Crown the power of disposing of the lands \"under the mining law.\" Now it seems to me that, reading the provision in which this reservation is declared (R.S.Q. sec. 1269) along with sec. 1441, we must come to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend by the expression \"proprietor of the soil,\" used in the last mentioned section, to designate the holder of a location ticket. This conclusion is fortified by the consideration that, on the appellants' construction, the holder of a mere conditional right to acquire a title to the surface had vested in him by virtue of that conditional right alone, a preferential right to acquire an indefeasible title to the minerals Looking at the statute as a whole, I do not think that is what the legislature intended.\nThe appellants then, holding the land as locatees only at the time the enactment was passed, had at that moment no vested right in the mining rights in dispute\u2014indeed no vested privilege to acquire those rights\u2014but only a conditional right to acquire a title to the surface which, if the mining rights should not in the meantime be alienated, would confer upon them a preferential right to purchase the minerals; a mere expectation of this sort is not, I think, within the rule which requires statutes to be construed so as not to effect an existing status prejudicially in so far as they are reasonably capable of another construction. The decisions of the Judicial Committee in Reynolds v. The Attorney-General for Nova Scotia[1], and in Main v. Stark[2], illustrate the rule; and at the same time indicate the limits within which it will be applied. This case falls outside those limits. The minerals in dispute consequently came under the operation of the Act of 1901, and the appellants never had any preferential right in respect of them.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Arthur McConnell.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aylen & Duclos.\n[1] [1896] A.C.240.\n[2] 15 App. Cas, 384.\n"}

Issues were joined and the cause set down for hearing upon this demande; the trial being fixed for the 3rd of June, 1907.

The trial judge ordered judgment to be entered accordingly in favour of the plaintiff, with costs, and this judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the respondent (plaintiff) moved to quash the appeal on the grounds, (1) that the amount in controversy was only f 1,999, to which the retraxit had reduced the plaintiff's demande, and (2) that the case submitted to the jury and in the courts below and upon which the judgments therein had been rendered was one on a claim for $1,999 only, and, consequently, under the limitation provided by section 46(c) of \"The Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Rimouski, which maintained the intervention of the respondents and dismissed the appellant's action with costs.\nThe appellant acquired the lands in question in this cause from one Belzil, whose auteur, one Fortin, had purchased the property, in 1885, from King Brothers, then owners of the Seigniory of Matap\u00e9diac within which the lands are situated. After the sale to Fortin, the vendors, in the exercise of the stipulations in the deed of sale, had cut and removed the merchantable timber from the land. The respondents subsequently purchased the seigniory from King Brothers and, in 1905, sent their foreman, Lauzier, with \u00e0 gang of men, to the lot of land in question, and caused them to enter upon the same for the purpose of cutting and removing the stumps of the merchantable timber which had been previously cut, and of cutting and taking away certain other timber then growing upon the land. The present action was thereupon brought by the appellant against Lauzier for a declaration that the plaintiff was the sole owner of the land with the timber thereon, to enjoin Lauzier from cutting the timber, and for $120, as damages, for the value of the timber already cut by him, as alleged, in trespass upon the property. The defendant pleaded that the entry and cutting of the timber by him was by the express orders of the company, respondents, who were the owners of the timber, and they intervened in the action and took up the fait et cause of the defendant, claiming that they were owners of the timber so cut and of all other timber on the lands, and that they had the right to cut and remove it as the successors in title of King Brothers who had reserved the same in the deed to Fortin, subject to the exception of what might be required for the construction of farm buildings and fences thereon.\nThe \"clauses of the deed in question are quoted and the questions at issue on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Wainwright for the respondents.\nL. P. Pelletier K.C. for the appellant. The clause in the deed by which the timber is sought to be reserved to the vendors is incompatible with the essence of a contract of sale of lands for agriculture purposes and contrary to law: art. 378 C.C.; the whole contract must be construed together in the sense in which it. can produce the effect it was intended to have and against the vendors: arts. 1014, 1019 CO.\nUnder art. 378 C.C. the wood formed an integral part of the immovable itself so long as the trees remained attached to the ground by their roots. Fortin acquired this immovable as it was then constituted and, in order that the ownership of any part of it should have remained vested in King Bros., an express and unequivocal reservation was necessary; after all the other express reservations contained in the deed, it would certainly have been stipulated had it been contemplated by the parties, but there was none made. The deed contains merely a prohibition to cut and haul away the wood and such a prohibition can no more logically be construed into a reservation of the ownership of the wood in favour of King Bros. than a prohibition to alienate could be taken to mean a reservation of the ownership of the immovable. No special reservation of the ownership of the wood was made and this prohibition does not constitute one. This view is supported by the wording of the clause itself: \"all wood cut contrary to these presents will immediately become, as soon as cut, the property of the vendors.\" See 25 Demolombe, n. 27; 10 Duranton, n. 518; 1 Guillouard, \"Vente,\" nn. 198-203; 1 Trop-long, \"Vente,\" n. 260; 4 Aubry & Ran., p. 360, sec. 354, notes. Future growth could not have been contemplated in a sale of land for agricultural purposes; the plough and the mowing machine would prevent new growth.\nA reservation of the ownership of the timber would have been null as contrary to law and to public policy. This lot is situated in a seigniors of which King Bros. were then seigniors and the deed is their original grant as such seigniors, made nearly forty years after the abolition of seigniorial tenure. The special court held under the Seigniorial Act of 1854 decided\u2014and its decision is res judicata for all parties according to sub-section 9, section 16 of that Act[1]\u2014that seigniors had no right to reserve the merchantable timber on the lots they granted and that such clauses in their grants were null and void as contrary to public policy[2]. This was admitted to be the law before the abolition of seigniorial tenure and we have also the positive text of the statutes, 18 Vict. ch. 3, sec. 14, and 19 Vict. ch. 53, sec. 18.\nSince the abolition of seigniorial tenure not only are all grants by the seignior presumed to be made en franc-alleu roturier, in absolute and unrestricted ownership, but any stipulation to the contrary is declared null and void. See also arts. 1062, 1080 C.C.\nThe respondents have failed to prove their right to cut the timber on appellant's lot, and, the prohibition not being a reservation of the ownership of this timber, the intervention should be dismissed. If the prohibition is to be construed as a perpetual reservation, it should be declared null and void as contrary to law and public policy. If it means a reservation of the first growth of timber and if such a reservation be held valid, then it should be declared extinct, as the first growth has long since been removed. At all events the appellant is entitled to restrain all parties from cutting any timber on the lot which would leave him without a sufficient quantity for building, fencing and heating purposes because the respondents had gone and were going beyond this restriction.\nWe also cite Morel v. Lefrancois[3]; Bury v. Murray[4]; The United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet[5], and art. 970 C.C.\nLafleur K.C. and Wainwright for the respondents. The habendum in the deed is limited in such a manner as to negative an absolute conveyance in fee. Among other reservations the ownership of the timber is reserved to the vendors, there is a resolutive condition imposed for voluntary removal, and a penalty for involuntary destruction of it.\nThe surest method of determining the true meaning of an agreement is to follow the possession, or the interpretation which the parties themselves have given to the deed by the manner in which they have executed it. Dumoulin, Cout, de Paris, s. 46, n. 23; 6 Toullier, No. 320; 16 Laurent, No. 504. The appellant by his acquiescence and that of his auteurs is estopped from pleading that the clauses in question do not constitute an express reservation of the wood. See cases cited in Coutl\u00e9e's Supreme Court Digest, at pages 538 et seq.\nThe existence of a real right in wood or trees attached to the soil, distinct from the real right in the fonds or realty itself, is in accordance with the law of France, and, consequently, with that of the Province of Quebec. Perrin et Rendu, Dict, des soustruct, 11, 919 et seq., 6 Laurent 252. Trees or hedges, planted on the land of another, are susceptible of immovable possession separate from the land on which they are and hence can give rise to the possessory action; 2 Aubry & Rau. 185, 124; 1 Garsonnet, Proc. Civ. 574, n. 133; Rousseau et Laisnez, vo. Action possessions, n. 72.\nThe terms of article 414 CO. merely establish a presumption of law, which can be destroyed by simple presumptions to the contrary. Habert v. Habert [6]; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Chauveau, n. 331; Fuzier-Herman, Rep., vo. \"Accession,\" n. 72 et seq.; 6 Laurent, n. 246.\nThe interpretation appellant seeks to put on the clause in question is unreasonable, because, if it was not a reservation and he became the owner of all the wood, but able to use only that part for which he had personal need for the purposes mentioned, the absurd conclusion is that, with this exception, all the timber was to remain uncut and unused in perpetuity. This would also make the clause practically non-effective.\nThe expression \"tout bois coup\u00e9 en violation des pr\u00e9sentes deviendra la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des vendeurs\" was evidently to guard King Brothers against two possible dangers: (1) Fraudulently procuring the cutting oi the timber and claiming ownership upon the plea that it was no longer part of the realty, but a movable on his land; and (2) a claim for labour upon wood improperly cut. The deed, as a whole and in view of what precedes cannot have the meaning which appellant seeks to give it.\nThe issue that the clause is contrary to public policy is not pleaded and, after twenty years of acquiescence and many years of the exercise of their contractual rights in this respect by the vendors throughout the seigniory, it is now too late to raise the question, in an appellate court.\nIf the clause is a prohibition rather than a reservation, and even if a perpetual prohibition results there would be nothing contrary to public policy. 23 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, p. 455. There can be nothing here in any sense \"injurious to the public.\"\nWe deny that the reservation could only apply to the first cut of timber and that, consequently, the stumps remained the property of the vendee. No property in the wood was transferred, the property itself was reserved and not merely the right to cut. The vendors owned the standing trees and their branches as well as the trunk, and also the stumps. Cutting off the upper portion of the trunk did not destroy their right in the remaining stump, any more than the removal of the branches destroyed their right of property in the trunk itself. So long as any part of their property remained they were entitled to take it, according to their commercial requirements. The wood in the stumps was commercial wood in 1885 and is so today, and its Value relatively the same. If all the wood was not removed on the first or second cut, that constituted no abandonment of what remained. We also rely upon the decisions in Williams v. Ch\u00e2teauvert[7]; McCormick v. Simpson[8]; Cadrain v. Theberge[9]; and Breakey v. Bilodeau[10].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014On the 22nd of September, 1885, King Bros., now represented in these proceedings by the intervening party, the St. Lawrence Terminal Co., sold to one Fortin, from whom the appellant acquired, two pieces of property described in the deed of sale as lots 62 and 64, at the place called Cedar Hall in the Seigniory of Matap\u00e9diac, and the appellant and his auteurs have been in possession as proprietors since that date.\nThe purchase price was one dollar an acre, which was liable to be increased under certain circumstances to two dollars an acre. The sale was made subject to certain charges, obligations and reservations enumerated in the deed, such, for instance, as the reservation of land bordering on Lake Matap\u00e9diac; the property on both sides of certain streams and all water-powers, mines, minerals and quarries to be found on the property. The charges and obligations mentioned are connected with the maintenance of roads, fences and drains and the settlement of squatters' claims. The deed of sale contains, in addition, this clause, the construction of which has given rise to the present appeal:\nEt de plus.la pr\u00e9sente vente est faite \u00e0 la condition expresse que le dit acqu\u00e9reur n'aura pas le droit de couper, enlever ou charroyer aucun bois sur le terrain ci-dessus vendu autrement que pour, son propre usage pour faire des b\u00e2tisses sur les terrains, des cl\u00f4tures et son bois de chauffage; il est en cons\u00e9quence convenu que si l'acqu\u00e9reur coupait du bois en violation de la pr\u00e9sente clause, les vendeurs auront le droit de demander l\u00e0 r\u00e9siliation des pr\u00e9sentes et de reprendre possession des immeubles ci-dessus vendus sans rien payer \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur pour les am\u00e9liorations qu'il pourra avoir faites. Et tout bois coup\u00e9 en violation des pr\u00e9sentes deviendra, aussit\u00f4t coup\u00e9, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des vendeurs, car telle est la convention expresse des parties et sans laquelle les pr\u00e9sentes n'auraient pas eu lieu.\nIn the Superior Court, it was held that this provision constituted a reservation in favour of the vendor of the property in the standing timber, subject to a right in the vendee to take so much as was necessary for building purposes and for fences and firewood. On appeal the judgment of the Superior Court was confirmed, Blanchet and Lemieux JJ. dissenting. We are without the notes of the majority in appeal.\nI cannot agree with the conclusion reached below. Undoubtedly, by the sale, the property in the standing timber passed to the purchaser[11], unless a contrary intention can be gathered from the words of the clause above quoted; and, as I read it, no such intention is expressed. That clause merely contains a condition subject to which the sale is made. It is, what is well known under the Civil Code, a resolutive condition; this is a condition upon the realization of which the sale of the property may be rescinded[12]. The sale made subject to such a condition produces all its effects, that is to say, the property with all its accessories passes; but if the event subject to which the sale is made happens then the sale may be set aside.\nLa condition r\u00e9solutoire est celle \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de laquelle est subordonn\u00e9e la r\u00e9solution d'un droit; ainsi l'obligation sur condition r\u00e9solutoire * * * existe imm\u00e9diatement et produit' tout de suite ses effets. Beaudry-Lacantinerie \"Des Obligations,\" vol. 2, p. 13.\nIn the present instance, the event on the happening of which the sale may at the instance of the vendor be rescinded is the cutting or carrying away by the purchaser of standing timber for any purpose other than those mentioned in the condition and this is not complained of. The property was sold admittedly to a settler, who immediately entered into possession, for agricultural purposes and necessarily it must be presumed that both parties intended that the timber would be cut down and this appears clearly from that other clause in the deed which provides that if in the process of clearing any merchantable timber is destroyed (d\u00e9truit), then the purchase price is to. be increased to $2 an acre. That is the penalty to be imposed for wanton destruction; but from this it is not to be inferred that in clearing the land for the purposes for which it was acquired the settler was not to cut down any timber. The intention was only to prevent its wanton destruction. The whole deed has to be examined so as to gather the substance of the agreement the parties intended to make. Apt words were found to make clear the intention of the vendor to reserve the water powers, mines, minerals and quarries as well as the land bordering on the lake and rivers; and if it was intended to reserve the property in the standing timber the same expressions could have been used for the purpose.\nIn my opinion the words of this clause of the deed are so clear that, were it not for the opinion expressed by the learned trial judge, I would have said that it was susceptible of but one meaning. The property passes with the standing timber, but if the purchaser cuts this timber for purposes other than those specified then the property does not revert to the vendor, he merely reserves to himself the right, which he may or may not exercise, to ask for a r\u00e9siliation of the deed and to re-enter into the possession of the property. It is also provided that such timber as may be cut in violation of the terms of the deed is to become the property of the vendor. If the intention was to reserve the wood, why was it necessary to stipulate that the timber would become his when cut?\nI have not overlooked the reference to Williams v. Ch\u00e0teauvert[13], upon which the trial judge relies, but I cannot see what bearing that case could have on the question at issue here. If I have properly construed this contract and understood the agreement made between the parties, the defendant, Lauzier, was a trespasser upon the plaintiff's land and is liable for the value of the timber cut in trespass; and I would allow the appeal and maintain the plaintiff's action with costs on both issues. Vide McCormick v. Simpson[14].\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question in issue and to be determined on this appeal is as to the right of the company, respondents, the now proprietors of the ungranted part of the Seigniory of Lake Matap\u00e9diac, to cut the timber still remaining upon the farm of the appellant, which at one time formed part of that seigniory, whether in the form of stumps from which trees had already years ago been cut and taken away or of growing trees known as second growth.\nOn the 22hd December, 1885, Messrs. King Bros. of Quebec, the then owners of the seigniory, sold this lot to Joseph Fortin, appellant's auteur. The deed among other things provided as follows:\nAnd, moreover, the present sale is made on the express condition that the said purchaser should not have the right to cut, remove or cart away any wood on the land hereinabove sold, otherwise than for his own use, for the erection of buildings on the land, fences and as firewood; it is, in consequence, agreed that, if the purchaser cuts wood in violation of the present clause, the vendors shall have the right to demand the rescission of these presents and to take possession of the immovables hereinabove sold, without paying anything to the purchaser for the improvements which he may have made. And all wood cut in violation of these presents shall become, as soon as cut, the property of the, vendors, for such is the express agreement of the parties, without which these presents would not have been executed.\nFurther on in the deed there is this provision:\nThis sale is, moreover, made for the price and sum of one dollar per arpent in superficies, provided that the said purchaser does not destroy commercial wood in clearing the said lots of land, otherwise the price of sale of the said lots will be two dollars an arpent in superficies. It is agreed by these presents that the vendors, alone, shall determine whether or not the commercial wood has been destroyed either in part or wholly, on the said lots Nos. 62, 64, 73 and 74 thus sold.\nThe respondents' contentions, which were maintained by the Superior Court and by a majority of three to two in the Court of King's Bench, were that by the terms of this deed the property in all the wood growing or being on the land sold remained in King Bros., the grantors, and that the clause above quoted amounted to an express reservation of such wood. That this reservation was subject to the right of the grantee settler to use such of the wood as he might from time to time require for the special purposes specified, viz., the erection of buildings and fences on the land and for firewood, provided it had not previously been cut and removed by the grantor, and that, should the grantee settler seek to act as owner of the wood, the vendors might cancel the deed, take possession as their own of any wood improperly cut by the grantee settler without recompense for his labour or, in the alternative, might charge him an extra dollar an acre for the land. We are, unfortunately, without any notes of the reasons of the majority of the Court of King's Bench for confirming the judgment of the Superior Court and must conclude that they meant to adopt the construction put upon the deed by that court.\nI agree with the conclusions reached by the minority judges, Blanchet and Lemieux JJ., though I do not agree with all of their reasoning.\nI adopt the construction of the much debated clause in the contract submitted, as the true one, by the appellant.\nBy the terms of the deed the land and all the trees upon it would pass, of course, to the grantee, and, unless the prohibition to cut trees other than those required for the erection of buildings or fences or for firewood is to be held to amount to an absolute exception out of the grant of the trees, the property in the trees passed to the grantee.\nIn terms plain and clear the provision is a prohibition simply against the use of a part of the property granted in ways which the grantee would otherwise be justified in using it, but it does not profess to be an exception out of the grant and cannot, in my opinion, be construed to be such.\nI think, considering the circumstances surrounding the issuing of the deed and the internal evidence of the document itself which clearly contemplates and speaks of the grantee clearing the land, that the intention is clear to give the lands to the grantee as a settler or occupier to reclaim the same as a farm from the wilderness, while at the same time imposing certain specified limitations upon his user of the wood.\nAny wood required for buildings or fences or firewood is not within the prohibition as I construe it, even if commercial wood. These trees would necessarily be required by the grantee if he was \"to clear the land\" as contemplated, and I do not in any view of the case concede the right to have been retained by the proprietor of the seigniory even to cut and take away all of the commercial wood on the farm sold regardless of the requirements of the settler, with respect to such wood as was necessary for buildings, fences and firewood. It would be indeed a singular and strange construction of the clause which on the proprietor's own shewing contemplated and conceded the right of the purchaser to cut all the wood necessary for these purposes to say yes, but that right is subject to my prior one to denude the land if I please of all trees and wood, and leave the pioneer grantee nothing for the purposes essential to a settler, as contemplated by the deed itself. Such a construction might, it seems to me, operate to defeat the very objects the parties to the deed had in view as they appear from the internal evidence of the deed itself. The land was sold to him to be cleared as a farm. Provision was expressly made for wood for the pioneer's necessary purposes in building dwelling houses, barns and fences and in using firewood. These certainly are unquestionable rights which the partial prohibitory clause against cutting commercial wood must be read as subject to. In any construction open with respect to the clause it must be read as only a partial restriction and subject to the grantee's paramount right to cut and take the necessary wood required for the necessary purposes for which the farm was clearly sold to him.\nThe proprietor even on the assumption that he had the right to cut reserved in himself would, I conceive, exercise it at his peril and would not be justified in so exercising it as to denude the land of all wood and so deprive the settler of the special wood required by him for the purposes specified in the deed.\nNow if the prohibition is a partial one only, as I take it must be conceded, on what principle is it to be construed as an exception of the trees out of the deed? Surely if any such intention existed there were not wanting apt and appropriate words to express it.\nBut it is said such a construction necessarily flows from the use of the prohibitive words. I do not see why. I can see other meanings and other reasons much more reasonable and material than the one suggested by respondent.\nThe appellant suggests two, one in the fact that the purchase money was remaining unpaid as a charge upon the land and as the wood was then the more valuable part of it the prohibition was necessary as security to the grantor for the price for which the land was sold. The other was that King Bros., being themselves large lumbermen, wished to have in their own hands the control of the lumber and exclude rival lumber firms from competing with them on their own seigniory and so prohibited their grantees from selling to others. These are not unreasonable suggestions, and probably both had their influence in causing the insertion of the clause in question.\nThe grantor, on the assumption of the clause being valid, retained thus practically under his own control the commercial timber used by lumbermen. The grantee could not sell to others. His rights would be confined to cutting all such timber as was required for the purposes of the farm and to clear the farm, and if he desired to sell he must treat with his grantor alone. But whether these suggestions are adopted or not, the proper construction of the language used does not amount to an exception of the trees out of the grant. That it does not I would conclude from the absence of any words of exception and from a reasonable construction of the very words of the prohibition, and I find such a conclusion strongly supported by the words defining what is to follow a breach of the prohibition, namely,\nall wood cut contrary to these presents shall immediately become, as soon as cut, the property of the vendors.\nIf it was his property before as being excepted out of the grant such a declaration would be unnecessary and useless.\nFor these reasons I conclude that the clause does not reserve the property in the trees in the grantor, and that the prohibition even if valid generally, on which I am not called on to express any opinion, does not apply to stumps of trees which had already been cut and carried away as was stated many years ago by the grantor, and the cutting of which stumps by the company, respondents, gave rise to this action.\nThe exercise at this time of such a right involves necessarily a right of property in the trees and a right to have the stumps in the ground till such time as required by the grantor and practically denies to the grantee the right to do the very thing the deed on its face contemplated he would do, namely, clear up his land and make a farm out of a wilderness.\nOnce it is conceded that the prohibitory clause does not amount to an exception out of the grant of the property in the trees then to get at its real meaning as a prohibition upon the grantee's rights as such we must construe it with respect to the conditions existing at the time the deed was passed. In this view it certainly did not prevent the grantee entering upon the land he bought and cutting down the trees necessary for dwelling house, barns, fences or firewood. By parity of reasoning it would not operate to prevent him bon\u00e0 fide clearing up the land for farming purposes and in doing so necessarily clearing it of trees and stumps. Subject to this he was prohibited from cutting, but more especially from selling the timber or cutting the same for sale.\nIf, as I have held, the clause did not reserve to the grantor a property in the trees, this action is maintainable.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs here and in each of the courts below, reversing the judgments of those courts and awarding the plaintiff, appellant, damages as proved.\nIdington J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs.\nMaclennan J. agreed in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nDuff J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McGibbon, Casgrain,Mitchell & Surveyer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: MacMaster, Hickson & Campbell.\n[1] 18 Vict. ch. 3.\n[2] Quest.

(1906) ch. 140.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, confirming the report of the referee appointed to take the accounts and determine the amounts due to the creditors of the railway company, and to fix the amounts due and the priority of the claims.\nUpon an order of reference to the registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada to take the accounts and determine the claims of the creditors of the railway company, fix the amounts due to the respective creditors and determine the order of priority in which such claims, respectively, should rank upon the proceeds of the sale of the railway, the referee filed his report on the 4th of May, 1908. Notice of the filing of the report was duly given and there was no contestation thereof by any of the parties interested in the proceedings affecting the sale of the railway and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale. On the 10th of June, 1908, upon motion on behalf of the plaintiffs, the judge of the Exchequer Court made an order confirming the report, in the terms therein stated. The present appeal was taken on the 10th of July, 1908, by the North Eastern Banking Company, one of the creditors and claimants.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the motion.\nSpencer Harris contra.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the motion. The appellants had notice of the filing of the referee's report, but did not contest it within the time allowed by sections 19 and 20 of the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court, of 12th December, 1899. They also had notice of the motion to have the report confirmed, but did not appear for the purpose of opposing the order made, on that motion, by the judge of the Exchequer Court, which is now appealed from. They must, therefore, be held to have acquiesced in the report and also in the confirmatory order. The report became final and non-appealable on the lapse of the 14 days allowed for appealing, and the judge's order was unnecessary, the report having become, under the rules, the final judgment, upon the matters with which it dealt, by mere lapse of time, on the 28th of May, 1908. When the appeal was taken, on the 10th of July, 1908, the thirty days limited by section 81 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" for appealing to this court, had expired, and, therefore, this court can have no jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal.\nSpencer Harris contra. Acquiescence in the report cannot be implied from mere failure to contest it within the time prescribed by the rule nor by failure to oppose the confirmatory order. Rules of practice cannot take away the statutory right of appeal; the rule in question does not, by its terms, assume to do so. The report by the referee is not, of itself, the judgment of the court; it is not now absolute as under the former rules, and it is not executory until confirmed by a judge's order. The judge's order was the only final judgment and the inscription of the appeal, on the 10th of July, was within the time limited by the statute.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Exchequer Court and the respondents move to quash on the ground that the appeal was not taken within thirty days from the date of the judgment appealed from. See section 82, \"Exchequer Court Act.\" The dates of the different proceedings are important. The referee's report, made pursuant to the judge's order of 13th February, 1908, was filed on the 14th of May, 1908 (section 18). The judgment confirming the report was delivered on the 10th of June, 1908, and the appeal to this court was taken on the 10th of July, 1908.\nIt was argued by Mr. Casgrain that the report not having been appealed from within the fourteen days fixed by the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court was confirmed by lapse of time, and that a subsequent motion for judgment was unnecessary. We cannot accept this construction of the rules. The judgment from which an appeal is given by section 82 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" is the judgment on the report required by section 20 of the rules and orders and, from this judgment, the appellants appealed within the delay of thirty days.\nThe motion is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n"}

The registration of such a deed, in conformity with the provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada respecting the registration of real rights, is unnecessary and, if effected, cannot operate to secure to the vendee any right, privilege or priority of title in or to the timber as against a subsequent purchaser of the lands. Watson v. Perkins (18 L.C. Jur. 261) distinguished.\nThe judgment appealed from (Q.R. 16 K.B. 471) was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing that of Cannon J., in the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers[2], and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe action of the plaintiffs was accompanied by a seizure in revendication of 12,500 pine logs, cut by The Belgo Canadian Pulp & Paper Co., the defend- ants, whose fait et cause was taken up by the present respondent, their warrantor, as defendant in warranty. The plaintiffs' claim to the logs seized was based upon a deed of sale to them, in 1888, from a former proprietor of the lands in the Township of Radnor from which the logs had been taken, of the right, during twenty years from the 25th of January, 1887, of cutting all \"soft wood\" which was to be found thereon, with permission to make all necessary roads and erect all necessary buildings upon the said lands for the purpose of their operations in cutting and removing such timber. The deed to the plaintiffs was registered at length in the office of the registrar of deeds for the County of Champlain, within which the lands mentioned were situated, and, subsequently, by a series of conveyances the said lands were vested in the defendants. The learned trial judge declared the attachment in revendication valid, held that the plaintiffs were the owners of the logs seized and condemned the defendants to return them to the plaintiffs or pay them the value thereof. This judgment was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, so far as material to this report, are stated in the judgments now reported.\nT. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the appellants.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree entirely with the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that there is little to add to the admirable judgment of the late Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, who spoke for the majority of that court. I accept his reasons and adopt his conclusions. The case is reported at full length in the Quebec Official Reports[3]. In view of the very exhaustive and able presentation of appellants' case I venture, however, to say that the judgment in Watson v. Perkins[4], so much relied upon by Judges Trenholme and Cross, who dissented below, and pressed upon us at the argument here, is of very little assistance in this case. There the question at issue was the rights of the holder of a timber license with respect to timber cut in trespass on limits bought from the Crown, and, as Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 points out, those rights are settled by a special provision of the statute regulating the sale and management of Crown lands under which the limits were bought. Here the point to be determined is the rights acquired under a deed passed between two private individuals conveying the right to cut timber and the construction of which is governed by the general rules of law found in the Civil Code.\nBriefly the facts are:\nOn the 25th January, 1887, the appellants, through their agent, Forman, bought from one Reynar, in the words of the deed,\nthe right of cutting all soft wood {la coupe de tout bois mou) which is to be found (here follows a description of the lots on which the soft wood is to be cut) with the right to make all necessary roads and buildings for such purpose (to-wit, said cutting) on all the aforesaid lots; for the said Forman to have and cause the said cutting during the period of twenty years from the date of these presents.\nSubsequently Reynar sold the same lots to one Valli\u00e8res under whose title the respondent holds. The question at issue is: What is the character of the title given by Reynar to Forman? Did the purchaser, Forman, now represented by the appellant, acquire or take, under the terms of his deed I have just quoted, a title in the land, \"un droit dans la chose\" \"jus in re,\" or merely a license to cut not all the standing timber, but the trees of soft wood to be found on the lots mentioned, which when cut and removed became his property? In other words, can it be gathered from the words of the contract that the vendor intended to sell growing timber which might remain on the land, drawing nutriment therefrom for the benefit of the purchaser during twenty years, or did he acquire a right or license to cut a certain portion of the timber then standing, which right was to be exercised at any time during twenty years?\nThe principle of construction applicable here is, in my opinion, well expressed in Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, vo. \"Biens,\" No. 135:\nLe caract\u00e8re mobilier ou immobilier des biens faisant l'objet d'un contrat se d\u00e9termine par le point de vue auquel les ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les parties contractantes et par la destination qu'elles leur ont attribu\u00e9e.\nAs to the nature of the title I am, applying this principle, clearly, of opinion that the vendor intended merely to grant a license to cut the standing trees which would become the property of the vendee only after severance; that he never intended to convey and the purchaser never intended to acquire a title in the land.\nPothier in his \"Trait\u00e9 des Choses,\" No. 52, says:\nL'action qui na\u00eet de la vente des fruits pendants par les racines, ou d'un bois sur pied pour le couper, est une action mobili\u00e8re; car quoique ces choses fassent partie de la terre, et soient immeubles pendant qu'elles y sont coh\u00e9rentes,. n\u00e9anmoins les ayant achet\u00e9es pour les acqu\u00e9rir seulement apr\u00e8s que, par leur s\u00e9paration du sol, elles seraient devenue meubles, l'action que j'ai \"tendit ad quid mobile,\" et par cons\u00e9quent, est une action mobili\u00e8re. And in this opinion all the modern French commentators on the Code Napol\u00e9on, from which art. 378 of the Quebec Civil Code was taken, concur. I might add that the jurisprudence in France is to the same effect. It will be found collected in Fuzier-Hermann, vo. \"For\u00eats,\" No. 400; and in the same work, vo. \"Ventes,\" No. 41. See also Dalloz, Rec. P\u00ear., 78, 2, 261.\nThere is a case in appeal reported in Dalloz, Rec. P\u00ear., 97, 2, 101, relied upon here which would appear to give some support to the appellants, but this judgment has been much criticized (see reporters' note) as a departure from the accepted rule of law and has not been since followed by the Cour de Cassation, as will be found on reference to Dalloz, Rec. P\u00ear., 99, 1, 246, reported also in S. V., 1900, 1, 398. This case formally decides that the movable or immovable character of the thing sold is to be determined chiefly by the intention of the parties and the purposes to which the object of the sale is to be put.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, \"Des Biens,\" No. 49, says:\nLes parties contractantes consid\u00e8rent les objets incorpor\u00e9s au sol dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 ils se trouveront quand la mobilisation pr\u00e9vue sera devenue effective. Le contrat, dans la pens\u00e9e des parties, a pour objet non pas un immeuble, mais un meuble; on traite en vue et sous la condition d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui doit amener les choses \u00e0, l'\u00e9tat mobilier. Tel est le principe reconnu par la jurisprudence et consacr\u00e9 dans la formule; le caract\u00e8re mobilier ou immobilier se d\u00e9termine avant tout par le point de vue auquel les ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s les parties contractantes et par le but qu'elles leur ont assign\u00e9.\nHere clearly the property in the trees did not vest in the buyer before severance. It was not intended that the purchaser should acquire the trees to remain in the soil deriving therefrom the benefit of further vegetation. What he wanted for the purposes of his business and what he acquired was not the standing tree, but the right or license to cut the tree and convert it into logs or lumber. The fight to make new roads and to use existing ones, limited as it is by the deed to the cutting of the timber, helps us to gather the intention of the parties. The purchaser did not acquire the standing tree but the logs and timber into which the tree was to be converted and for this purpose exclusively he could make and use roads to give him access to the property. If the timber was left standing at the expiration of 20 years, the right to cut ceased, and if troubled in his possession in the interval the purchaser would have no right whatever to bring the \"action en r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\" See Fuzier-Hermann, vo. \"Ventes,\" 127, and vo. \"For\u00eats,\" 1357; 5 Laurent, No. 429.\n2 Marcad\u00e9, No. 346, at page 343, says:\nEnfin, dans le cas m\u00eame d'inh\u00e9rence parfaite et perp\u00e9tuelle au sol, les produits peuvent encore se trouver meubles dans un certain sens. Ainsi; quand les grains, fruits ou bois sont vendus s\u00e9par\u00e9ment du sol, c'est l\u00e0 une vente de meubles, et l'acheteur n'a qu'un droit mobilier. Ces objets, en effet, ne sont vendus que comme produits, comme choses distinctes du sol, et en tant que devant \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9es de lui; dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, ils sont immeubles, mais ils sont cependant vendus comme meubles; l'acheteur ach\u00e8te des choses encore immeubles, mais sous la condition et avec le droit de les mobiliser. (Cass\u00e2t. 19 vend\u00e9m. an 14, 25f\u00e9vr. 1812; 5 oct. 1813; 24 mai 1815; etc.)\nMr. Casgrain, in his factum here, raises an interesting question as to the rights of the purchaser of the cut against the subsequent purchaser of the land from his vendor and refers to an opinion expressed by Lyon-Caen in a note to be found at the foot of a judgment reported in Dalloz, 78, 2, 261, where it was held:\nPar suite, dans le cas de vente faite \u00e0 deux acqu\u00e9reurs successifs, au premier, de la coupe du bois, et au second, de la for\u00eat enti\u00e8re (sol et superficie) l'acqu\u00e9reur de la coupe ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de son droit contre l'acqu\u00e9reur de la for\u00eat, alors m\u00eame que son contrat aurait une date certaine ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de la second vente. To this judgment, there are two foot-notes, in one of which it is argued by Lyon-Caen that the second purchaser takes the property subject to the rights acquired by the first. The criticism of the judgment is thus expressed:\nAinsi l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proteste contre la solution formul\u00e9e dans les motifs de l'arr\u00eat rapport\u00e9; et nous estimons que le droit est ici d'accord avec l'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Sans doute l'article 1141 c. civ. ne r\u00e8gle dans ses termes que le conflit qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve entre deux acqu\u00e9reurs successifs d'un m\u00eame meuble; mais il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tendu au cas o\u00f9, par exception, la chose successivement vendue est meuble par rapport au premier acqu\u00e9reur et immeuble par rapport au second. En effet, d'apr\u00e8s l'enseignement des jurisconsultes les plus autoris\u00e9s, l'art. 1141 n'est qu'une cons\u00e9quence de la maxime: \"En fait de meubles, possession vaut titre,\" maxime \u00e9rig\u00e9e en disposition de loi par l'art. 2179 c. civ., et qui signifie que, relativement aux meubles, le fait de la possession constitue du possesseur un titre irr\u00e9fragable de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (Aubry et Rau, op. cit. t. 2, \u00a7 174, p. 55, et \u00a7 183, texte et note 2). Or, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, une fois l\u00e9galement constitu\u00e9e, est, de son essence, un droit r\u00e9el, absolu, opposable aux tiers. L'acqu\u00e9reur, une fois mis en possession r\u00e9elle et effective de la coupe, et qui en est devenu par cela m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire, ne saurait donc en \u00eatre \u00e9vinc\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte que, dans une vente pass\u00e9e post\u00e9rieurement avec un tiers, cette coupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un immeuble dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est point acquise par la seule possession.\nOn the other hand, in another note to the same judgment, the conclusion reached by the Cour de Cassation, to the effect that the purchaser of the right to cut (droit de coupe), would have no claim against the subsequent purchaser of the property, is approved of in the following words:\nDans l'intervalle de la vente \u00e0 l'exploitation, l'acqu\u00e9reur ne peut donc \u00eatre investi que d'un droit personnel en vertu duquel il peut contraindre le vendeur \u00e0 lui laisser exploiter la coupe. Si telle est la nature du droit que la vente de la coupe conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur il faut en conclure, avec l'arr\u00eat rapport\u00e9 que ce droit n'est pas opposable \u00e0 celui qui a post\u00e9rieurement acquis du m\u00eame vendeur la for\u00eat elle-m\u00eame, sol et superficie. C'est, en effet, un principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de notre droit que, sauf les rares exceptions r\u00e9sultants de dispositions formelles de la loi (c. civ. 1743, et 2091), celui qui n'est investi que d'un droit personnel, c'est-\u00e0-dire le cr\u00e9ancier, ne peut l'exercer que contre la personne oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 la prestation, c'est-\u00e0-dire contre le d\u00e9biteur et que sp\u00e9cialement les ayants cause \u00e0 titre particulier du vendeur d'un immeuble ne sont pas tenus des obligations personnelles\nqu'il a pu contracter relativement \u00e0 c\u00eat immeuble. V. conf. De-molombe, op. cit. t. 1er, nos. 183, et suiv.; Laurent, op. cit., t. 5, No.432.\nAt the very most, therefore, this reference given us by Mr. Casgrain shews that the text writers are not agreed in their interpretation of the law and, under such circumstances, we would not be justified in setting aside the apparently well settled jurisprudence of the French courts on this point.\nIt will not be necessary, in my view of this case, to consider the other interesting questions raised. I entirely concur in what Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 says as to the effect of the sale by Valli\u00e8res.\nDavies J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs* for the reasons stated by the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.- I incline so much to hold as correct the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in the court below that the right in question here, which is expressed in the document giving it as follows,\nthe right during twenty years from the twenty-fifth of January, eighteen hundred and eighty seven, of cutting of all wood (la coupe de tout lois mou) which is to be found,\nwas a mere personal obligation, that I might well be content merely to say that by reason of so failing to find clear error I would dismiss the appeal.\nI, however, have given a great deal of attention to the interesting questions arising before us and the very full argument had relative to the nature of the right in question, if not a, mere personal obligation. It was contended before us that the right to cut was in the nature of a superficies and therefore not within the requirements of the \"Registry Act\" and amendments thereof, rendering it imperative that there should be registration.\nI assume, for argument's sake, this latter part of the contention may be correct, but do not express any opinion on the point whether or not a right of superficies is within the \"Registry Act\" or amendments thereof.\nI do not, however, agree that this right (so limited as to time) to cut was at all, in the nature of a superficies.\nI read the right as expressed in the last few words as made relative to timber then to be found.\nThe origin, in the civil law, of the right of superficies, does not indicate that such a right as cutting existing wood was within the scope of its original operation. It indeed seemed rather confined to the case of buildings. Sohm puts it thus:\nSuperficies stands to houses in the same relation as emphyteusis to agricultural land. Superficies in Roman law is a perpetual lease of building land, subject to the payment of an annual rent (solarium). On the land thus leased the superficiary erects a house. He builds it with his own materials. By the rules of accession, therefore, the ownership of the house vests in the owner of the soil; superficies solo cedit. A superficiary, however, has a real right, for himself and his heirs, to live in the house and to exercise the rights of an owner therein for the specified term of years (say, ninety-nine years) or forever, as the case may be. Hence the legal position of the superficiary is the same as that of the emphyteusis.\nThere does not seem much resemblance in this bargain in question here to anything in the nature of an emphyteusis and yet that is what several authors have, as this one I cite, compared the right of superficies to. Granted that in some authors on French law there is a recognition of the extension of superficies to trees or the right to cut trees, it must conform in such cases to the fundamental elements upon which a right of superficies rests or by which it may be recognized.\nI have been unable to find, however, a single authority in the cases in Quebec upon which such like right to cut trees as here in question has been treated otherwise than as a personal obligation or a servitude.\nThe following are some of the Quebec authorities that have referred to the matter of such a right as a servitude: Croteau v. Quintal[5]; Archambeault v. Archambeault[6].\nIn Watson v. Perkins[7] a license to cut was referred to as a servitude and by one learned judge as a superficies. But the peculiarities of the government renewable license, such as in question there, is clearly distinguishable even if from one point of view it could be looked at as a superficies.\nThen the case of Cadrain v. Theberge[8] has no resemblance to this case even if beyond question rightly held to be a case of right of superficies.\nThe jurisprudence of Quebec would seem to indicate that such a right has there, when of a permanent nature, been uniformly looked on as a servitude.\nIf a servitude of any kind some one of the several amendments to the \"Registry Act\" must, I think, cover it Such is their scope and purpose.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Maclennan and Duff JJ. agreed in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated I by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Casgrain, Mitchell & Surveyer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Martel & Duplessis.\n[1] Q.R. 16 K.B. 471.\n[2] Q.R. 16 K.B. 471-473.\n[3] Q.R. 16 K.B. 471.\n[4] 18 L.C.

The action was to recover, from the appellants, damages occasioned to the Yule bridge, across the Richelieu River, at Chambly, Que., caused, as alleged, through the negligent and faulty construction of dams and other works in the bed of the stream by the appellants in order to secure more power for the purposes of their power house, situated in the vicinity of the bridge. At the trial, Loranger J. decided that the Province of Quebec was owner of the bridge, at the time of its destruction, during the spring freshets of 1904 and 1905, through ice from a reservoir created by the appellants in making the river improvements (and forming there in much greater quantities than there would have been in the natural condition of the stream), being carried with increased force against the structure of the bridge. The defendants, appellants, contended, among other things, that they had taken all necessary precautions which could have been foreseen against the happening of the accidents, by strengthening and raising the superstructure of the bridge, and that the causes which led to the disaster were owing to the natural climatic conditions which prevailed during an unusually rigourous winter season preceding the accidents complained of. The learned judge held that the action, as taken, would lie against the defendants, that their dams and works were the determining and only cause of the injuries to the bridge, and condemned them in the sum of $40,000 for the damages thus caused. The Court of King's Bench varied this judgment by ordering that the quantum of damages should be ascertained by a reference to experts and directed the mode in which those experts were to proceed in determining the amount of damages suffered. The appellants sought to have the judgment which decreed their liability set aside, and a cross-appeal was filed by the Attorney-General to have the decision of the trial judge restored.\nThe material circumstances of the case and the issues raised on the appeals are stated in the judgments now reported.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and G. H. Montgomery for the appellants.\nWilfred Mercier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice concurred in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014The substantial question argued before us and now to be determined on this appeal is the responsibility of the appellant companies for the destruction of the Yule bridge so called which spans the Richelieu river between the villages of Richelieu and Chambly-Canton and near where that river flows into the St. Lawrence.\nThere were many incidental points raised as to the ownership of the bridge by the Province of Quebec, and the right of the latter to recover damages for its destruction, but they were all practically disposed of in the respondents' favour during the argument excepting the question of damages, to which I will refer later.\nThe appeal was argued very fully at bar and very ably and I have had the advantage since then of reading the evidence called to our attention in the factums and at the oral argument. The result is that my impression formed during the argument has been confirmed and that I am in favour of dismissing the appeal and confirming the judgment of the court of appeal substantially for the reasons given by the late Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9.\nIt seems to me, however, that one important fact, and one which I confess has greatly influenced me in reaching my conclusion, has been overlooked in that judgment and for this reason I desire to add a few explanatory notes of the facts relating to the conditions of the river and its bed before the construction of the dam complained of and those which existed after such construction and the operations connected with its construction had been completed. The bridge, the destruction of which is the subject of this action, had six spans of 157 feet each and one short span. It was built in the year 1845. The dam and the works incident to it the existence of which was alleged to have been the cause of the destruction of the bridge were begun to be built in 1896 and completed in 1897.\nThe Central Vermont Railway bridge was built; higher up the river above the Yule bridge upon stone piers in 1874.\nIn 1898, a year after the construction of the dam, both bridges were raised in height by or at the instance and expense of the appellant company. The Yule bridge, 6 feet on the Richelieu side of the river and 4 feet on the Chambly side.\nMr. Macklin was the engineer who supervised and directed the construction of the dam and who remained in the employ of the Chambly Manufacturing Co., by whom the dam was originally built as such engineer until that company was merged in the appellant company, the Montreal Light and Power Co, He says\u2014explaining the raising of these bridges after the construction of the dam\u2014that there was an ice jam in 1898 which endangered the safety of the bridge and that\nthe ice piled up and that was when I recommended that the bridge should be raised, because of that.\nAfter explaining why on the score of expense he did not raise the bridge still higher he says:\nNobody knew what the conditions of the river were at that time after the dam was built. We had to learn all that and my suggestion to raise it six feet was based upon what knowledge I obtained at that time.\nSpeaking broadly the river alike where the dam was built and at the site of the Yule bridge was about 1,000 feet wide, and the distance between the overflow dam and the Yule bridge was about 1,800 feet. Between the Yule bridge and the Central Vermont bridge, distance of about 900 feet the river became some 300 feet narrower and continued gradually to narrow until about 2,000 feet further up from the railway bridge it reached its narrowest point for some miles about 500 feet wide.\nAbout 800 feet above this railway bridge there existed in the natural condition of the river a broad reef or ridge of rock rising high above the normal height of the river, though probably covered or almost so during the spring freshets and when the water of the river was at its greatest height. This reef or ridge of rock which began about twenty feet from the Chambly bank of the river, and was about 200 feet in width, ran about two-thirds of the way across the river.\nAs a part of the operations incidental to the construction of the dam and the formation of the huge still-water lake above it, the company deemed it desirable on Mr. Macklin's advice, in 1898 after the dam was constructed, to blast away the top of the reef or ledge to the depth of three or four feet so as to allow of the more easy flow of water there. It still, however, remained quite an appreciable height above the level of the bed of the stream, because when several years after the construction of the dam a part of the latter was carried away and the waters of the river in consequence resumed their natural level this ridge or reef though reduced in height three or four feet still stood out clearly visible above the natural height of the waters of the river.\nFrom this ridge or reef down towards the mouth of the river, below where the dam was constructed, the bed of the river inclined very much, a fall variously estimated in that short distance of 15 or 18 feet, thus forming what is known as \"rapids\" or swift flowing water. The water here at ordinary times, as Willett, Macklin and other witnesses prove, would be about a foot or 18 inches in depth at ordinary times rising during the spring freshets to a depth of from three to four feet. About one and a half miles above the reef the foot of the rapids of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se were reached and these rapids extended up the river for still another mile and a half.\nThe reef in question therefore lay between the St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se rapids and the lower rapids across which the dam and the two bridges had been built.\nThese lower rapids were of course all covered by the still-water lake formed by the construction of the dam which still-water lake or pond extended about one and a quarter miles or one and a half miles above the dam.\nThe ice which caused the trouble came down the river from the head of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se rapids which ex- tend over about 11\/2 miles and the foot of which is distant about 3 or 33\/4 miles from the dam. In years, therefore, when the rapids do not freeze over, and by common consent it is only very rarely and at long intervals that they do freeze, the only ice you have to take care of is that which forms from the foot of the rapids down.\nExperience has shewn that this ice was not dangerous or destructive in the natural condition of the river. Twice before the construction of the dam did these rapids freeze over within the memory of living witnesses, namely, in 1868 and 1872, without, however, injuring the Yule bridge. Again, twice since the construction of the dam was the cold severe enough to freeze these rapids and that was in 1904, when the bridge was partly carried away, and in 1905, when it was further damaged.\nMr. Smith, for the appellant, contended that the construction of the dam and the operations connected with it had nothing to do with the destruction of the bridge, which resulted from \"ice shoves\" entirely unconnected with the company's obstructions in and to the river and would have produced the same results inevitably had these works not been constructed.\nHe proved from eye witnesses that the ice in the rapids broke up and jammed at Papineau Point on the 27th March; that on the 28th the blockade at Papineau Point gave way and moved down stream until it was stopped by a small island lying in mid-stream; that on the 29th this blockade again gave way and carried the ice in a great heap down to Arbec's Point, where the river contracted to a width of about 500 feet, and that on the 31st this blockade which he contended was still above the back water of the dam gave way and, to quote from the appellants' own factum,\nsome of the ice came down as far as the railway bridge where it lodged against the timbers, but the greatest part of it jammed upon the reef opposite the lighting station, which, it will be remembered, is about 800 feet above the railway bridge. It will be noticed that no jam whatever took place at the place where the still-water pond runs out which would be almost half way between the lighting station (opposite thereof) and Arbec's.\nFurther on the factum says:\nOn the morning of April 1st the blockade at the reef opposite the lighting station gave way about 7.15 a.m. and came down against the railway bridge which it carried away. It then adopted a wedge formation and directed itself towards the Richelieu side where it carried away the second pier of the Yule bridge from the Richelieu shore.\nMr. Smith, alike in his factum and in his oral argument, threw over the suggestions and opinions of his expert, Mr. Wilson, that it was the changed condition of the river arising from the construction of the railway bridge which caused the damage to the Yule bridge. In my judgment he was well advised in doing so, as it was clearly proved to have been the ice itself and not the debris of the railway bridge which carried away the second pier of the Yule bridge and that this ice notwithstanding the comparatively narrow spans of the railway bridge rushed with irresistible force against and carried away the pier of the Yule bridge. Mr. Smith preferred to rest his case upon his main contention that the ice was formed to an abnormal thickness in the rapids which froze almost solid and on its breaking up in the spring was carried by an irresistible natural force arising from the several blockades damming back the water of the river, until it had force enough to carry everything before it. Now it will be seen that notwithstanding the fact that the still water of the dam went up from 1,200 to 1,500 feet at least beyond the ledge of rock at the lighting station and was many feet deep on that ledge, the top of which had been blasted away to the depth of three or four feet, still that the ledge reduced in size and covered with the still water had power to maintain the blockade there from about midday on 31st March till about seven o'clock on the 1st April.\nIt seemed to me very plain when these facts came out at the argument that if the natural conditions of the river had been retained the ledge of rock extending two-thirds across the river, and about 200 feet wide, would have offered an effective barrier to the further descent of the ice bridge and that the channel of the river which ran around the Richelieu end of the ledge and was there of a width of about 150 feet, would have presented a natural and sufficient outlet for the flood of water carrying down the ice and for at least a third or fourth part of the ice itself without such ice or water damaging either of the bridges.\nI pressed the point several times during the argument upon Mr. Smith, but his only answer was that the removal of the upper part of this reef or rock was not charged in the statement of claim as a specific fault on the part of the company.\nBut it appeared to me that all the operations connected with the construction of the dam and the formation of the still-water pond and the changes thereby made in the natural formation and conditions of the river were what was charged as the fault of the companies, appellants, and that these all and prominently amongst them the cutting down of this reef or rock were the issues which were thoroughly and exhaustively threshed out at the trial. Perhaps I cannot state Mr. Smith's position better with respect to this ledge or rock than he himself put it in his factum. He says:\nSo far from the works of the company having made it more difficult for the ice to get down, they made it easier inasmuch as they offered a large volume of water for its passage. Again, it will be remembered that the last blockade took place on the reef opposite the lighting station. This reef formerly stood right out of the water, but it had been considerably lowered by the company with the object of preventing jams. Had it therefore been in its original condition, the chances of a jam must have been infinitely greater.\nThe passage for which the works of the company made it easier for a \"larger volume of water\" to pass also made it easier for a larger mass of ice to rush down with the larger volume of water and so cause the damage complained of. When this reef \"stood right out of the water\" and before \"it had been considerably lowered by the company with the object of preventing jams,\" the average normal depth of water from this reef down under the two bridges to Willett's mills below the dam was about 18 inches to two feet, and during the spring freshets as much as three or four feet. This ice which came down in jams from time to time would naturally be effectually stopped in great part by this ledge or reef standing right up out of the water and extending for two-thirds of the distance across the river. The water would naturally swirl and eddy around the side of this rock and rush around its end down the channel it had made for itself, carrying with it portions of the ice, but not such enormous quantities as would render the condition of the bridge precarious.\nI am confirmed in this opinion which the facts would naturally suggest by the positive and clear testimony of Mr. Willett, the Rev. Father Lesage\n126.\nand other witnesses as to the actual natural conditions of the river before and at the time of the construction of the dam, and of that of Civil Engineer Macklin, who superintended and directed all the operations connected with the building of the dam, the necessary excavations and the damming back of the water.\nMr. Willett from his long and active life spent on the banks of the river at Chambly-Canton, his occupation as owning two or three mills there, and the position he held for some years as president, of the Chambly Manufacturing Co., by which the dam was built, seems to me to have been a man above most others qualified to give most valuable evidence towards the solution of the questions before the court. He seems from his evidence to be quite impartial and to desire to state only those things which he knew to be true. He spoke with reference to the severe winter of 1868, when all the rapids were frozen solid, conditions similar to those of 1904, and shewed that when the spring thaws came and the ice began to come down the river rapids while great quantities of ice came down and made ultimately a severe jam for a few hours away below, his mill and below where the present overflow dam is (that is below the rapid extending from the reef above the Yule bridge to Willett's mills below that bridge), there never was any damage done to the bridge nor does it seem at any time to have been in jeopardy. Amongst other statements of fact which he mentions, and after stating that professional opinions regarding the action of ice were not always borne out by his experience of facts he refers expressly to this reef or ridge as follows:\nQ.\u2014Now with regard to this bank of rock just above the Central Vermont Railway bridge, previous to the building of the dam, what has been the habit of the ice as to blocking and piling up on this rock? A.\u2014I cannot say that the ice ever piled up on it. The ice has taken out a channel along this rock and there was no piling up of the ice there. It naturally took level\u2014this rock formed a kind of eddy, and the ice used to take out in that section out as far as the channel on the opposite side, but there was a channel with the exception of when the river was taken all the way up, there was always a channel at the end of those rocks.\nQ.\u2014It is a bed of hard rock\u2014banc rouge? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Now this bed of banc rouge extends, how far across the river? A.\u2014About two-thirds of the way across, I think.\nQ.\u2014So that it constitutes a natural obstruction in the river to the extent of two-thirds? A.\u2014Yes, it did; they have taken it away, you know.\nI do not think the facts could be put any plainer. This rock formed a kind of eddy in the river and the ice used to \"take out\" in that section as far as the channel on the opposite side. There was no piling up of ice there. If, however, such a huge ice jam as Mr. Smith depicted had come down the river in its natural condition it would in all human probability have been largely disintegrated before reaching this rock or reef. At any rate the reef would under those natural conditions have opposed an effectual barrier to the rush of any huge pile or mass of ice below it. The natural channel around the edge of the reef would carry off from time to time part of the ice wall or mass that was stopped by the ledge and allow of the passage through of the accumulated water behind the ice jam. Such portion of the ice jam as was not so intermittently carried down the channel around the reef would be stranded on the reef and effectually prevented from doing injury to the bridge.\nI have dealt at more length with this phase of the case than perhaps I was justified in doing, but the more I read of the evidence and the more I pondered upon the problems presented to us for solution, the more convinced I became of the grave importance of this ledge of rock in their solution. In the natural condition of the river the reef did form an effectual barrier against any huge bergs of ice being carried down past it into the reaches of the river below.\nAs to the damages I would not have been disposed to send the case back for further evidence on the sole question of the amount of damages sustained had the Court of Appeal agreed on the point with the trial judge. Neither on the other hand am I disposed to alter their disposition of the case in referring it back to obtain more satisfactory and complete evidence of the actual damage sustained.\nI regret the further delay, but am in favour of confirming the judgment appealed from and dismissing the cross-appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored in its entirety.\nA book might be written giving reasons for such conclusions. I do not think I can do so usefully.\nThe judgments of the learned trial judge and of Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, so far as the main issues determining the responsibility for the damages are concerned, furnish the general reasoning I adopt in regard thereto.\nI am tempted to add just one or two observations.\nI venture to think that if any man of intelligence and an observant turn of mind spent a winter and spring on the bank of any of our rivers at a point Where there was a stretch of rapids and above and below that stretch others of still water, he would find abundant room to doubt many and modify others of the statements of opinion that appear in the evidence of these experts appellants ask us to accept as against the expert evidence given on respondent's side of the case.\nHe would, I imagine, find the rapids the last to be frozen over in winter and the first to be open in spring, and when witnesses express in emphatic language sweeping opinions that seem to discard the consideration of results of such daily experience, they do not add to the strength of their testimony.\nAgain the theory is set up by the defence that a dam facilitated, by increasing the body of water it created, the removal of the ice that had formed a jam. If this is correct, it was a serious mistake for the respondent's manager and men to have removed just before the flood the flash-boards and thus in effect to lessen that body of water and the space under the ice covering of the pond for the ice issuing out of the jam to disappear in.\nIt is further to be observed that it is stated the back water would extend 1,000 to 1,200 feet further up the river when the flash boards raised the dam their full height of three feet than when they were off.\nA very large area of the rapids would thus be submerged and the consequent formation of ice be much thicker than over the rapids in their natural state; if indeed in such latter case, there had been any formed over the whole of that area.\nThis area might be roughly estimated at 1,000 feet in length by the width of the river, from five hundred to eight hundred feet.\nIf this mass of ice did not itself help as a substantial addition to the usual field of ice in the dam as it existed before appellants' improvements to obstruct and hinder the clearing of the river, then all I can say is it did not operate as ice usually does. The removal of the flash-boards after this increased body of ice was formed and new needs had arisen for in- creased space in which it might disappear would of itself be crass negligence if there be anything at all in the appellant's theory.\nBat that is not all, for the flash-boards were removed before the flood, and if doing so did not lower the ice so that over that field of rapids it would touch the rocks that formed the rapids in that area, it would be owing only to the ice being tied at the river banks so as to hold up the entire field of ice, as Mr. Gauvin, a witness of respondent's, suggests might to a certain extent be the case.\nHe says it would to a certain extent sink in the centre part of the river. At all events, I am not persuaded that this whole process of raising the river by flash-boards, so that it would submerge the rapids and produce a vast mass of thick ice, and give it a chance by removal of the flash-boards to sink and stick on the rocks, was of that beneficient order of things some witnesses and defendants would lead us to believe.\nI doubt if the place for ice escaping from the jam to disappear in, was quite as open as it might have been to receive such disintegrated jams as had formed above.\nIndeed, I doubt if the theory put forward is even a respectable theory, much less a working or a workable one.\nI would have preferred some accurate observations as to the depths of the river, the thickness of the ice, the actual area of the rapids (of which I have made only a guess), the usual volume of the water flowing there, and a comparison in these several regards with what existed on the occasion in question, and the means of like comparisons further up stream, before I could accept what seems inconsistent with reason. I would also have liked amongst other things, a better idea than I can form of the conformation of the land on either side back from the river margin or bank. I admit some of the material to aid in arriving at conclusions on some of these points is before us, but not all.\nAgain there was another field of rapids and frozen ice (of possibly greater extent than that which the use of the flash-boards created), and which raised questions as to it. It was that lying between the point to which the old dam backed waters to and that which the new dam without the flash-boards backed the waters to. The same questions as arise from the use of flash-boards, so far as the mere raising of water submerging the rapids is concerned, arise as to this field of ice. The consequences of sudden change brought about by the removal of the flash-boards, lowering the ice do not arise as to this field. But answers to similar questions relative to it in regard to the results of accurate observations may well be sought for as above suggested. \"Very much is given in one exhibit for this year 1903-04, but no means so far as I can see is furnished for scientific comparison. Moreover, the changed conditions arising from ice cutting done that year are for purposes of comparison a disturbing factor though no doubt expected to have been beneficial.\nI merely mention these few matters as some of what might have been settled and put before the court by an intelligent and capable expert; and to illustrate wherein on one point or some points my understanding has not been enlightened. It rested on appellants to have cleared up such matters once a prim\u00e0 facie case had been made by plaintiff.\nI refuse to accept unless absolutely necessary the mere ipse dixit of any expert when presented for my acceptance merely as an act of faith, and without the aid of such reasons as his reasoning power, or means of, and result of the use of means of, observations may have developed.\nThe more capable an expert is, the more likely he is to make in a few words his meaning clearly appear to the common man to be founded on reason.\nI make these remarks because though there has been presented a mass of facts they are not so complete as to render them of great service and were not so used and presented by the men of whose eminence, wisdom, skill and learning we heard so much as to make of them a comprehensible defence that necessarily rebuts the case made out by the evidence for the plaintiff.\nMany other things put forward by some of those whose professional eminence, it is urged, is such as to enable us to discard entirely the opinions of men, who, for aught I know, may be quite as eminent, may or may not stand such tests as I have applied to these points I have referred to.\nAll I can say is that after much time and consideration given to the whole case I cannot find either in the expert evidence or the other valuable evidence of the appellants, that it meets the case which I think is made by the respondents.\nAs to the damages, I cannot see that the appellant should first take its chance of an assessment by the learned trial judge, fail to meet the reasonable case for assessments made there, and then seek, or be allowed to find, another opportunity of threshing the matter of damages out before a referee or referees.\nThat branch of the case should, if such a course were intended, have been left aside before or at the trial. Perhaps, speaking for myself, I would have preferred that a board of eminent experts should have investigated and tried the whole matter. Too late for that now, and besides there must be an end to any law suit.\nI cannot find that appellants suggested such a course or such as that they now seek for.\nAs to the title to the property, every one seems to have assumed up to the time of this action that the respondent had such possession that the title was, prim\u00e0 facie, such as to entitle the founding the action upon it.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Davies J.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Wilfred Mercier.\n[1] Q.R. 16 K.B. 410.\n[2] (2) Q.R. 29 S.C. 356.\n"}

By a contemporaneous agreement the company undertook to get out logs for D. who was to make advances for the purpose. The agreement for sale was carried out and two instalments of the purchase money paid. At the time these contracts were executed the Union Bank had advanced money to the company and shortly after the contract for sale was assigned to the bank as security for such and for future advances. The company having assigned in insolvency the bank brought action against D. for the last instalment of the purchase money to which he pleaded that he had paid in advance to the company and the bank more than the sum claimed. The trial judge held that the bank had no notice of the second agreement under which D. claimed to have advanced the money and gave judgment for the bank with a reference to ascertain the amount due. The full court set aside this judgment and ordered a reference to ascertain the amount due the bank and, if anything was found to be due, to ascertain the amount due to D. from the company. The bank sought to appeal from the latter decision.\nHeld, that the judgment of the full court was not a final judgment from which an appeal would lie under the Supreme Court Act to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia setting aside the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs and directing a reference to ascertain the amount due the plaintiffs and also that clue the defendant from the United Lumber Co.\nThe facts are stated sufficiently in the above head-note.\nMellish K.C. for the respondent, moves to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants sued for certain instalments of the price of some land sold by the United Lumber Company to respondent and claim to recover the same by virtue of an assignment made by the company as collateral security for debts due to the appellant.\nThe learned trial judge held the defendant liable and so adjudged with costs, but referred the question of the amount of liability to a referee.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that judgment was set aside and instead thereof the referee was directed to find and report the amount of the advances made by the appellants to the company before the 21st day of December, 1903, and still remaining unpaid and was further directed in the event of the referee finding any of the said advances are still unpaid to inquire and report the amount, if any, due and payable to the company under and by virtue of the agreements in writing between the said company and defendant dated the 10th December, 1903, and meantime the court reserved further directions and costs. It is from this judgment an appeal is sought here.\nIt is conceded that the report of the referee when made can have no other effect than to inform the court to which it may be made and before having the effect of a judgment settling the rights of the parties must be followed by an order of a judge or a judgment of the court.\nIt is nevertheless contended by the appellant that the court below had no right to set aside the judgment inasmuch as the learned judges gave in support of this judgment reasons therefor which it is alleged appear to have been in accord with the opinion of the learned trial judge in regard to the liability of the respondent. There are two or three answers to this.\nIn the first place the record itself does not shew on its face any concurrent declaration either way as to the liability.\nIn the next place the judgment of record as the result of the trial by no means clearly defines where the lines are to be drawn in taking the accounts.\nThe respondents contend that the assignment to the appellant was only for securing certain debts due the appellant and that those debts had been discharged, long before this action, by payments, and thus the right in appellant to sue terminated.\nIf these contentions are correct or either fairly arguable on the true construction of the collateral security there are important matters left by the trial judgment of record undisposed of for the referee to wrestle with according as he might happen to construe the judgment of reference and then if need be the collateral security.\nThe judgment directed as follows: It is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff bank do recover from the defendant the amount due to the plaintiff bank from\nthe said United Lumber Company, Limited, under the assignment from the said United Lumber Company, Limited, to the plaintiff bank, set out in the statement of claim.\nIt is further ordered, that it be and it is hereby referred to Mr. F. H. Bell, barrister, to hear the parties and their witnesses and to inquire and report the balance due to the plaintiff bank from the United Lumber Company, Limited, for moneys advanced by the plaintiff bank to the. said United Lumber Company, Limited, and secured by the said assignment.\nIt is further ordered, that judgment be entered for the plaintiff bank for the amount found by the said referee on his report being confirmed or varied and confirmed, together with its costs of action to be taxed.\nIf that judgment had stood uncorrected and the referee had gone on and ruled that it was not open upon this reference to the respondent, to give evidence in support of these contentions relative to the limited nature of the assignment and the discharge of the debts it (when so construed) secured, a miscarriage of justice or much confusion might have followed.\nThe effect of the judgment of record now appealed from setting aside and varying the trial judgment is a matter of procedure, and simply to substitute a clear and explicit judgment purely and simply of reference for a judgment that is by no means clear, but claimed to be one for costs with a reference therein virtually to find out whether it was right or wrong. Obviously all the court has done is to enable the parties to have every phase of their case presented properly for a final adjudication and upon that being arrived at and passed upon by the appellate court of Nova Scotia, the case will be ripe for an appeal here if either of the parties desire then to come here.\nWhatever final judgment is given upon the referee's findings will be appealable here if worth while. The motion is allowed and appeal quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. A. Henry.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. H. Fulton.\n"}

Day (Defendant), Respondent\n1908: October 13; 1908: November 10.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nConstruction of contract\u2014Findings of trial judge\u2014Appreciation of evidence\u2014Reversal on appeal. In a dispute as to the nature and effect of a contract, the trial judge, on his view as to the weight of evidence, found the facts in favour of the plaintiff and gave judgment accordingly. His decision was reversed by a majority of the court in banco, and the action was dismissed with costs.\nHeld, per Idington, Maclennak and Duff JJ., reversing the decision of the full court, that the findings of the trial judge, who had seen and heard the witnesses, should not have been reversed.\nThe Chief Justice and Davies J. considered that the trial judge had not made his findings as the result of conclusions arrived at by him having regard to the conduct and appearance of the witnesses in giving their evidence, and, on their view of the conflicting testimony, were of the opinion that the full court was right in reversing the judgment at the trial and that the appeal from their judgment ought to be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in banco, reversing the judgment of Sifton C.J., at the trial, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) alleged that the defendant, desiring his advice and assistance as an experienced land valuator and inspector, entered into an agreement with him by which he was to accompany the defendant in the examination and selection of certain large tracts of land, in the country adjacent to Wetaskiwin, Alberta, and that his remuneration for doing so should be the payment, in the nature of a commission, of an amount equal to one-third of the \"turn over\" upon the sale of the lands so selected jointly by them. The action was brought to recover 33 1-3 cents per acre in respect of 123,000 acres of land alleged to have been so examined, selected and sold, and, at the trial before Sifton C.J., the learned Chief Justice, speaking of the testimony adduced, said: \"It is rather an extraordinary case that men should so disagree in regard to a conversation as these men appear to. All of them, so far as their appearance goes and so far as anything that appears in evidence is concerned, are responsible, respectable and upright citizens. I, therefore, feel bound to accept the story of two as against one, there being nothing in their conduct or appearance to detract from the truthfulness of the story they told. Most extraordinary bargains are made and have been made, the last three or four years, in regard to real estate.\" In view of the evidence, the Chief Justice held that the quantity of land which could be affected was, practically, 29,000 acres, being a quarter of what had been selected, and based his verdict in favour of the plaintiff, for $9,666.66, at the rate of 33 1-3 cents per acre upon that amount of land. On appeal to the full court, this judgment was reversed and the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs, Harvey J. dissenting, and it was ordered that the plaintiff should have leave to amend his claim by claiming upon a quantum meruit and, thereupon, should be entitled to a new trial upon payment of costs. Ewart K.C. for the appellant.\nHenwood for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that the action, in this case, should have been dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this action should have been dismissed with costs, and to that extent would have modified the judgment of the Supreme. Court of Alberta.\nThe action was one brought on an alleged agreement that if the appellant, plaintiff, would select certain lands containing 200,000 acres more or less available for purchase by respondent, the latter would pay to the plaintiff 33 1-3 cents per acre in respect of each acre of land so selected, and that as plaintiff so selected 123,000 acres he became entitled to receive $41,000, which he claimed.\nThe evidence relied on to support such agreement was a statement alleged to have been made by Day to Hayes when Day first visited Wetaskiwin, at the hotel there, and in the presence of one Bull, who had accompanied Day on his visit. My opinion gathered from a careful examination of the evidence as to all this conversation was that it was well understood by the parties as being quite general and not intended to bind any one to any specific agreement. Hayes would not have broken his agreement if he had afterwards declined to have anything more to do with Day or his company, and Day would not have broken his had he chosen another guide. I am the more satisfied upon this point because Bull, who is relied upon as cor- roborating Hayes, expressly states that he did not regard or understand the parties as then coming to any definite bargain and that he supposed there would be something further done and in writing. I cannot for myself accept Hayes' remembrance of this conversation which had taken place some years before as correct, though I have not the slightest doubt some \"tall talk\" was indulged in at the time during the two hours' conversation alike by the would-be land purchaser and the land guide as to possible profits and otherwise. It must also be remembered that at the time of the conversation Day had not definitely selected any part of the lands which it was known were open for purchasers; at that time his idea was generally to purchase \"sections\" of the land. Afterwards and before Hayes went out with him he had the offer of sale from the Canadian Pacific Railway Land Co. of a specified number of townships and when he returned to Wetaskiwin and before they started out to see the lands the object was not selection of sections or of lands generally for sale or selection of one or more of the townships offered him for sale, but inspection of these particular townships, with a view of determining whether on the whole the offer he had to purchase them should be accepted or not.\nThere was no pretence that he could accept some of the townships and reject others.\nTo return to the conversation on the first occasion when it is said the agreement sued on was reached, Hayes says that Day asked him \"if he could select a tract of land for him and that he, Hayes, asked him how I would make out\u2014what commission I would get out of the deal. He said that I would make more money than I ever made in my life or had ever seen before; that he would easily make a dollar on the turnover which would be divided equally among the three of us.\"\nBull gave evidence which Chief Justice Sifton, who tried the case, accepted as corroborative of Hayes' statement of the agreement, which was emphatically denied by defendant. There was nothing the Chief Justice said in the conduct or appearance of the witnesses which influenced his judgment, but simply the fact of there being two against one. He admits that the profit claimed was an extraordinary one but says that \"most extraordinary bargains have been made the last three or four years in regard to real estate.\"\nWhile, however, accepting Hayes' version of the agreement as correct under the assumption that there was corroboration, the Chief Justice reduces the claim from $41,000 to $9,666.66 because, as he says, \"I feel, although the agreement was made in that way it was made affecting whatever lands were selected at that time and purchased by Mr. Day.\" Now as a fact no lands were selected at that time or purchased by Day. The purchase made by him was made months afterwards. The Chief Justice, moreover, reduces the number of acres on which Hayes was to receive his commission from 116,000, the quantity purchased by Day for the company he represented from the Canadian Pacific Railway Land Co., to one-quarter thereof, 29,000, that being the proportion of shares or interest Day had in the company by which the land was ultimately purchased.\nI am quite unable to agree to this method of construing the suggested agreement, and I cannot think that the measure of plaintiff's right was to be deter- mined by the proportion of shares in the company, large or small, that Day might have. If the agreement was accepted by the court as proved, Hayes was surely entitled to his $41,000 either against the company Day represented, if Hayes knew he was only an agent representing a company, or against Day personally if he did not know he was such agent and treated with him personally.\nI am satisfied beyond doubt that Hayes knew Day was only an agent acting for others and so dealt with him and that his remedy if any was against the company and not against Day personally.\nI cannot conceive it possible to spell out of the supposed agreement a personal liability on Day's part to pay a commission only on such proportion of the land selected as represented Day's interest in the shares or stock of the company purchaser, and in this way reduce the $41,000 claimed to $9,666.66. Such an agreement as that never, I am confident, entered into the minds of the parties.\nThen again I agree with the court below which reversed the judgment of Chief Justice Sifton that according to the plaintiff's own version of the agreement his remuneration was dependent upon a \"turn over\" of the lands at an advanced price, and that it was this turn over profit \"which was on his own shewing to be divided.\" It was not the average profit: which might be subsequently made by separate resales of the lands in farms or plots possibly extending over years which plaintiff had in his mind, but the \"turn over\" or secret profit which Day could make as between him and the company he represented. No such secret profit was as a fact attempted to be made by Day; he handed over the lands he had purchased to the company at the price he bought them. If this view as to the meaning of the \"turn over\" is correct it is needless to say that the courts would not lend their aid to the enforcement of any such fraudulent bargain.\nThere are many other fact and incidents, but I forbear enlarging further than to remark that the Canadian Pacific Railway Land Co., with which Day was in treaty for the purchase of these lands, had agreed to sell him a certain number of specified township lands west of Wetaskiwin at a certain price, and that it was to view these specified townships and determine whether or not he would purchase them that Day and his associate Harstone, accompanied or guided by plaintiff, went to see the lands. No question of selecting could arise; the lands as specified had to be accepted or rejected as a whole.\nNo evidence was given by Hayes of his having brought these lands to defendant's notice or knowledge, or of any selection having been made by him with respect to them or any of them, or of his having advised for or against the purchase of any township or done anything more than as a land guide shew the intending purchaser the location of the specified townships for the purchase of which the latter had been negotiating and which he subsequently purchased.\nHayes' evidence on the point, quite irrespective of the emphatic denials on the part of Day, is to my mind conclusive. After making the general statement in his examination in chief that during the day when not in camp he was out \"sizing up the country, drawing lines, etc.,\" he says in his cross-examination that on the visit to the lands he used to get out and find the township mounds and section posts and that Day and Harstone \"drove in around the lines,\" and \"drove over the land\" and that \"what he (Hayes) did in each case was to shew them where they were on on the township exactly and tell them where they were.\"\nHe never commits himself to a single statement of advice on his part as to selection or rejection of any lands or as to having brought any lands to their notice or done any one single thing evidencing what would be known as selecting blocks of land or advising as to the general neighbourhood where they would be found. He was simply a guide to take them to see the particular townships Mr. Griffin, the Canadian Pacific Railway land agent at Winnipeg, had offered them for sale.\nSummarizing my conclusions after a close examination of the evidence I am convinced that when the conversation between Hayes and Day took place at the hotel in Bull's presence, in which the alleged agreement was made, Hayes was informed that Day was there for the purpose of purchasing land as the agent and representative of the Empire Loan Co., and that his conversation with him was as such agent; that no such agreement as Hayes sets up was really made; that so far from corroborating Hayes, Bull, the third party present, says \"he did not regard what was said as the finality of the whole transaction, but thought there would be something further as to a bargain and the reduction of the bargain to writing between them;\" that if such agreement is accepted as having been made it must be held to have been so made either with the Land Co. Hayes knew Day then represented, or with Day personally and not as the agent; if the former, the Land Co., and not Day personally would be liable upon it, and if the latter, the \"turn over\" mentioned in it and of which Hayes and Bull were each to have had an equal share with Day related to a secret and corrupt overcharge which Day was supposed to make as against his principals in purchasing and turning over the lands to them, which corrupt bargain is disproved and which, of course, the courts would not lend their aid to enforce even if proved; that there is not any justification for cutting down the claim if accepted as genuine and recoverable, from $41,000 to 19,666.66; that the gist and basis of the whole action was the giving by the plaintiff to the defendant for the benefit of himself or the company he represented of the skill, experience and knowledge of the plaintiff in the selection by the defendant of a large quantity of land in what was then the North-West Territories, and as the Chief Justice says was made \"affecting whatever lands were selected at that time and purchased by Day;\" that as a fact no lands whatever were selected at that time and purchased by Day; that, months afterwards, Day having an offer to buy certain specified townships procured Hayes' services as a land guide to shew him where they were, and that no such skill, experience or knowledge ever were asked of or utilized by the defendant or given or offered by the plaintiff to the defendant, but that on the contrary such services as the plaintiff rendered the defendant were those simply of a land guide to identify and lead defendant to these township lands, for doing which he was amply paid at the time.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014We have presented to us several judicial ways of looking at this curious case, but upon the whole that of the learned trial judge seems to me the most satisfactory.\nIn adopting this view I may add that I think the respondent never needed nor supposed a special Canadian Pacific Railway Co. introduction needed, to get a man merely to find and shew him the corner posts of the prairie townships, but that he did feel he needed the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. introduction to the appellant, to acquire from him, thereby freed from restraint, all the information an old experienced agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. for years engaged in selling lands, could give and that he thought, when he got his introduction and as a result engaged appellant, he was buying the peculiar skill and knowledge appellant's long experience must have given him and which qualified him to be of the greatest value as a guide in relation to the selection of lands to be speculated in.\nWhen appraised on such a basis I am not prepared to say that, even in case the claim had been rested on a quantum meruit, as the majority of the court below admit it could have been, the basis of the price for such service, as suggested by the respondent and assented to by the appellant, and accepted by the learned trial judge, should be disturbed.\nIt is quite possible the surmise of Mr. Justice Stuart may be correct, but with respect I submit it is mere surmise and not proven.\nAs to the point of uncertainty I think the learned trial judge had the material before him to apply the principle of the maxim certum est quod certum reddi potest.\nI would allow the appeal with costs. MACLENNAN and DUFF JJ. concurred with Idington J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n"}

A provision of the by-law was that \"the cars shall follow each other at intervals of not more than five minutes, except from eight o'clock at night to midnight, during which space of time they shall follow each other at intervals of not more than ten minutes. The council may, by resolution, alter the time fixed for the circulation of the cars in the different sections.\" For neglect or contravention of any condition or obligation imposed by the by-law, a penalty of $40 was imposed to be paid by the company for each day on which such default occurred, recoverable before the Recorder's Court, \"like other fines and penalties.\" An amendment to the by-law, by a subsequent by-law, provided that \"the present disposition shall be applicable only in such portion of the city where such increased circulation is required by the demands of the public.\" Held, that default to conform to the conditions and obligations so imposed on the company was an offence against the provisions of the by-law, and that, under the statute, 29 & 30 Vict. ch.57, sec. 50 (Can.), the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide in the matter of such offence was in the Recorder's Court of the city of Quebec.\nJudgment appealed from (Q.R. 17 K.B. 256), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of McCorkill J.[2], in the Superior Court, quashing a writ of prohibition, issued on the petition of the appellants, with costs.\nOn complaint, by the City of Quebec, that the company had illegally neglected to operate their tramcars at certain stated intervals necessary for the convenience of the general public, upon certain streets in the city, in violation of the city by-laws then in force, the company was summoned before the Recorder's Court for the City of Quebec and, upon conviction of the offence as charged against the by-laws, it was condemned to pay the penalty of $40 provided under the by-laws in question. The company, in pleading to the complaint, denied the jurisdiction of the Recorder's Court to hear and determine the matter in issue on the ground that the obligation, if any, of the company to operate and circulate its cars at certain fixed intervals was contractual and the breach of any such obligation was not a matter which came within the jurisdiction of that tribunal, but was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court. Upon conviction, the company sued out a writ of prohibition, alleging that the Recorder's Court had no jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of the penalty claimed; that the penalty sought to be recovered was for the alleged breach of a contract resulting from the by-laws and a deed of agreement entered into between the city and the company, based on the by-laws; that, for any such breach, the company was not liable to a penalty but for damages only in a suit properly instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction; that the frequency of the service required had not been legally determined prior to the complaint; that the by-laws in question did not impose any penalty in respect of the matters complained of; that the city had no authority to enact by-laws imposing penalties for the breach set out in the complaint or to give the Recorder's Court authority to entertain such a complaint, and that the by-laws in question were inconsistent, void, vague and ineffectual for want of certainty.\nAt the trial, the writ of prohibition was quashed with costs, and this decision was affirmed by the judgment appealed from, Boss\u00e9 and Cimon JJ. dissenting.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nC. E. Dorion K.C. and Corriveau K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the view of this case taken by Sir Louis Davies. The appeal is dismissed with costs. Girouard J.\u2014 I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nDavies J.\u2014The two questions arising in this case are, first, as to the extent of the jurisdiction given to the Recorder's Court by the legislature, and next, as to the nature of the breach by the appellants of the obligation imposed upon them by the by-law of the city permitting, on specified conditions, the use by the appellant company of the streets of the city for the construction and operation of a street railway.\nIt had been made by a statute a necessary pre-requisite to the granting of such permission that the city council should first determine by resolution all the conditions on which it should be given, and that, when the city and the company agreed upon these conditions they should be embodied in a by-law of the council to come into force only after the passing of a notarial contract between the parties based on and in conformity with the by-law.\nSuch a by-law was passed by the city council of Quebec granting the necessary permission to use the streets of that city to the appellant company subject to the conditions and obligations therein stated, and a notarial contract was duly passed between the city and the company in conformity with those provisions and conditions.\nOne of the provisions of this by-law, art. 37, stipulates as follows:\nThe cars shall follow each other at intervals of not more than five minutes, except from eight o'clock at night to midnight, during which space of time they shall follow each other at intervals of not more than ten minutes. The council may, by resolution, alter the time fixed for the circulation of the cars in the different sections. Amendment, 23rd November, 1900, by-law No. 370:\nThe present disposition shall be applicable only in such portion of the city where such increased circulation is required by the demands of the public.\nIt was strongly pressed upon us that this amendment practically repealed the whole original article and required a new by-law to be passed specifying the parts of the streets where \"such increased circulation is required.\"\nI have, after some difficulty, owing to the vague language used, accepted the construction placed upon the amendment by the courts below, namely, that it applied only to the last sentence of art. 37, and was not intended to change and did not change the first part which was called, in the amendment, the \"present disposition,\" but meant that the council, if and when it altered such disposition, should only apply that existing or \"present disposition\" to such portion of the city as the increased circulation should shew required its application or retention. No alteration under the amendment was ever made.\nAs to the recorder's jurisdiction, the language of the statute, 29 & 30 Vict. ch. 57, sec. 50 (Can.), gives him \"exclusive jurisdiction\" to hear and decide in the matter of any offence committed against the provisions of the city charter or its amendment\nor the by-laws now in force or which shall hereafter be in force in the said city.\nThe question arises in limine: Was the neglect to comply with the by-law requiring the cars to be run within stated times an offence against its provisions? I think it was. It was a neglect to comply with a positive requirement of the by-law which became an obligation of the company when the by-law came in force on the passing of the notarial contract between the city and the company. Art. 60 of the by-law says:\nIf the company neglects to conform to or contravenes any of the conditions or obligations imposed upon it by the present by-law, it shall thereby incur and be liable to a penalty not to exceed $40 for each and every day that it fails to conform to or that it contravenes any of the said conditions or obligations, and the said penalty shall be recoverable before the Recorder\u2019s Court of this city like other fines and penalties.\nI am unable to see why a failure to comply with a specific obligation imposed by this by-law upon the company to run its cars at prescribed times is not an offence against the by-law and is not recoverable in the court specially designated by the legislature as the one having exclusive jurisdiction over offences against the city by-laws. Mr. Stuart's argument was that this was merely a breach of a contractual obligation arising out of the contract which the legislature enacted should be entered into by the company accepting the by-law and agreeing to build and operate the street railway pursuant to it. But it seems to me that the test must be found in the answer to the question, whether the breach complained of is of an obligation which it was within the power of the city council to impose upon the company, either by virtue of the general powers of government conferred upon the city or of the specified powers given to it to make a by-law which should be the basis of any contract entered into for the operation of a street railway on its streets. If the by-law comes within that test, and has a prescribed penalty for breach, as in the case before us, then the jurisdiction of the Recorder's Court is broad enough to embrace it.\nThe courts below seem to base their judgments upon the general powers given by the legislature to the city to make by-laws\nfor the good order, peace, security, comfort, improvement, cleanliness, internal economy and local government of the said city.\nNo language could well be broader than this, but, in addition, and, I assume ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, the legislature gave special powers also to make by-laws on enumerated subjects. The judgment of the court of first instance and that appealed from both proceeded upon the ground that the regulation for violation of which the action was brought was within the police powers of the city, and so was not ultra vires.\nWithout determining whether or not this is a proper ground upon which to base judgment, I prefer to rest mine upon the ground that, altogether outside of the powers conferred on the city by its charter, the legislature has, by 57 Vict. ch. 58, expressly conferred upon it special powers to grant conditional permission to street railway companies to make use of the streets for the purpose of laying their rails and, in section 20, enacted as follows:\nThe city council shall first determine, by resolution, all the conditions on which it intends to grant such permission; and when the city, and the said company shall agree upon all the said conditions, a by-law shall be made and passed by the said city council, comprising all the said conditions of the said permission, the said by-law to come into force only after the passing of a notarial contract between the parties based on the said by-law, and in conformity therewith.\nPursuant to these powers the by-law in question, containing the article 37, above quoted, was passed and accepted and agreed to by the appellant company and a notarial contract passed between the city and the company as provided by section 20. Here we have all the pre-requisites necessary to give the Recorder's Court jurisdiction to hear any complaint as to the violation by the company of article 37 of the by-law.\nWhether, in addition to this penalty, a civil suit might be brought for special damages incurred by the city as a result of a violation of the contractual obligation of the company as embodied in the notarial contract was not before us in any way, and I say nothing about it.\nIt is enough for me to say that, in my judgment, the Recorder's Court had jurisdiction to try the offence complained of and impose the penalty prescribed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The only question raised, which is that of the jurisdiction of the recorder of Quebec, seems answered by the clear and comprehensive language of the statute conferring upon him jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter of any offence against the by-laws of the city; and of the statute enabling the city to pass such by-laws as deemed meet on almost any subject the city government required and, then, by the statute specially enabling it to provide for the running properly of an electric car service.\nIt would not seem necessary, once the general penal power that appears in the statute is given to add to each of such by-laws as the city might pass the sanction of a penalty, or to provide, in each new enactment rendering it necessary or empowering the city to pass by-laws relative to some new subject matter brought within the range of the matters the city council may have to deal with, an express power to add such sanction to such by-laws relating to the new subject matter.\nIt is not an unheard of thing to attempt, by means of sanctions such as these, to secure the performance of duties to be discharged by corporations created to furnish a service, it may be of light or of water or even of running cars.\nAll these franchises are contractual or quasi-contractual in character, and I fail to see why we should draw a line which the legislature has not.\nThe only serious question here is whether or not the amendment of the by-law really repealed the section proceeded upon.\nIt certainly does not seem to have been the intention to do so, and I do not think we can impute to the curious language used such an effect. That being the case, I am happy to find it unnecessary to determine further what this amendment does mean.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Phil\u00e9as Corriveau.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 256.\n[2] Q.R. 32 S.C. 489.\n"}

Cook K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice agreed with Davies J.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur generally in the judgment prepared in this appeal by Duff J., but desire to add a few words, especially upon the second ground upon which the appeal is based, namely, that the \"Euphemia\" was in fault in not having reversed her engines sooner than she did. I am not satisfied that under the facts that ground was not open to the appellants on this appeal.\nVery many of the difficulties in understanding the relative courses and distances of the two steamers for the few moments immediately preceding the collision and their relative bearings at the moment of the collision arose out of the statements of several of the witnesses that the \"Euphemia's\" bow collided with the starboard quarter of the \"Tordenskjold\" when the latter's bow was pointing almost directly up the river channel westwardly and the former's bow was pointing south across the river so that as was argued by counsel for the \"Tordenskjold\" the blow was almost, if not quite, at right angles. This assumed fact, which the statement of several of the witnesses justified, is not, I think, proved by the evidence as a whole. I have no doubt the witnesses were speaking of a time immediately following the impact or blow, and not of the relative courses of the ships at the moment of the impact and before its effect was produced.\nThe \"Tordenskjold\" was an iron steamer of 2,295 registered net tonnage, heavily laden with coal, drawing 20 or 21 feet fore and aft and running at full speed with a flowing tide of three knots. The \"Euphemia\" of 2,034 tons laden with grain was running at full speed down the river against the tide. The two vessels were approaching each other at the rate of two thousand feet per minute or 18 knots an hour. The impact of two such bodies must have been very great as indeed the photograph put in evidence of the breach made in the \"Tordenskjold's\" starboard quarter abundantly evidenced.\nWas the blow struck a right angled one or nearly so? I think the photographs of the \"Tordenskjold's\" side where she was struck and of the injured bow of the \"Euphemia\" taken after the collision, and the evidence of the captain of the \"Tordenskjold,\" who states that he was standing at the time on the starboard side of the bridge of his own ship, shew that the blow must have been at a considerable angle, but not at a right angle. The captain says (p. 100): \"The 'Euphemia' struck us in the anchor from thirty degrees to forty-five degrees. His stem and starboard bow struck us.\" I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt therefore that the \"Euphemia's\" stem and starboard bow struck the starboard bow of the other steamer at an angle considerably less than a right angle, and that as the \"Tordenskjold\" was the heavier ship and was going at a rate nearly double as fast as the \"Euphemia,\" the immediate result of the blow would be not only to stop the \"Euphemia,\" whose stem would probably be caught for a time at least in the enormous hole she made in the other ship's quarter, but to carry her bow in the direction the \"Tordenskjold\" was going with the tide, so that as the ship's recoiled from each other after the blow the bow of the \"Euphemia\" would be pointing in the direction the witnesses stated.\nThe manoeuvre of the \"Tordenskjold,\" which first caused danger to the ships was no doubt the porting of her helm as the ships were approaching each other. If she had not ported and shewn her red light they would doubtless have passed starboard to starboard, green light to green light. Her signal being answered and responded to by the \"Euphemia\" as soon as she saw the other's red light, it is more than probable the collision would have been altogether avoided even then had not the \"Tordenskjold\" for some inexplicable reason starboarded her helm and so crossed the \"Euphemia's\" bows as the latter was shearing off to starboard under a hard-a-port helm in obedience to the call of the \"Tordenskjold.\" This last man\u0153uvre of the \"Tordenskjold\" in starboarding was attempted when the steamer had reached a position slightly on the port bow of the \"Euphemia\" and was fatal. It seems to me that it had the effect of making it impossible for the \"Euphemia\" to avoid a collision even had she reversed immediately the three lights of the other steamer came into line instead of blowing the single blast as she then did. It is true she reversed full speed astern the moment the other's green light opened. The single blast and the order to reverse followed fast one upon the other, but I do not think that if the order full speed astern had preceded instead of followed the single blast of the whistle the collision could then have been avoided.\nMr. Meredith adopted and pressed upon us the finding of Captain Tooker, the assessor of the late Mr. Justice Burbidge, that the \"Euphemia\" was in fault in porting her helm at the moment the \"Tordenskjold\" shewed her red light and in not accompanying that action with a single blast of her whistle, and that she should instead, before she saw the red light and as soon as she saw the \"Tordenskjold's\" three lights at position T 4, in chart No. 1, have gone full speed astern giving the usual signal, three blasts. Burbidge J. thought the reference to plan No. 1 a mistake, and that the assessor meant plan No. 2. If he did, then with every respect I must concur with Mr. Justice Burbidge and dissent from the conclusion of the assessor on that point. A careful reading of the evidence convinces me that if the two ships had kept on their changed courses after porting their helms and shewing each other their red lights there was room for them to have passed and they would have done so safely had not the \"Tordenskjold\" made the fatal manoeuvre of starboarding and so thrust herself ahead of the \"Euphemia.\" If, on the other hand, the assessor meant the positions of the two vessels as shewn at position T 4, of plan No. 1, as expressed in his answer, I repeat what I have already said that it was then too late for the \"Euphemia,\" by reversing, to avert the collision.\nIt is true that the \"Tordenskjold\" did in her preliminary act charge the \"Euphemia\" \"with not stopping and reversing when risk of collision was imminent.\" But such fault so charged was not followed up at the trial, and, indeed, was hardly consistent with the case then put forward by the appellants. In fact the real contention put forward by the \"Tordenskjold\" at the trial was that the two vessels were proceeding on their respective courses, green to green, at such relative distances as would have enabled them to pass each other in perfect safety and that the \"Euphemia\" suddenly and without any warning changed her course to starboard and ran into the \"Tordenskjold\" almost, if not quite, at right angles, the latter ship having continued steadily and evenly on her westward course. There was no special examination of the witnesses produced by the \"Euphemia\" or other evidence given with a view of proving fault or delay on the part of the \"Euphemia\" in not having reversed sooner than she did. It is true there was evidence as to when she did reverse. But that was not the point put forward to be tried and determined nor, as my brother Duff has shewn, was the evidence given specially directed either on main or cross examination to such a point or issue as one which it was contended affected the liability of the \"Euphernia.\" Although mentioned in the preliminary act it does not appear to have been practically made an issue until suggested by Captain Tooker, the assessor, on appeal. But as the facts relating to the time of reversing her engines by the \"Euphemia\" did appear, incidentally at any rate, in the evidence and was charged as a fault in the preliminary act and pleadings of the \"Tordenskjold,\" I have thought it desir able to deal with it on the merits instead of relying upon the legal point that the objection could not now be taken on appeal.\nI fully agree with all my brother Duff has said with respect to the alleged failure of the \"Euphemia\" to blow a single blast of her whistle when she ported, and with his conclusion that this point is not open on this appeal, and if it was, that the evidence would not under our statute justify a holding that the fault, even if proved, contributed to the collision.\nI think it important that the attention of the proper authorities should be drawn to the admittedly deplorable ignorance of the pilots of these ships alike with respect to the compass and its different points as to the regulations for preventing dangers from collisions of ships, commonly called the \"Rules of the Road.\" There was hardly any pretence of knowledge with regard to either. They were, it is true, elderly men, and one of them stated that when he obtained his branch or license many years ago he was not examined at all with respect to the compass. It was not the practice he said in those days. But it is evident that with the existing traffic of the River St. Lawrence by large and valuable steamers it is imperative that those licensed as pilots should possess in addition to their other qualifications a knowledge of the regulations by which they are bound and of the compass without which it seems impossible for them properly to discharge their duties or give intelligible evidence in cases of collision between ships such as we have now before us. The learned trial judge (Routhier J.), who saw the witnesses and heard their evidence, expresses himself on this want of knowledge of the pilots thus: \"Finally I must say that the two pilots who have been heard in this case lack knowledge and they lack it in a large measure. They do not know the compass nor the rules of navigation nor much of the map of the river.\" We desire to emphasize his opinion.\nI would also like again to repeat my regrets that our statute does not permit of our having on appeal to this court experts to advise us on nautical points in like manner as the courts of Vice-Admiralty and Exchequer and the Privy Council have. In the present case we feel that such expert advice might have been of great benefit. This court stands in the anomalous position of being obliged to decide difficult nautical points on which the appeal may turn without the advice of nautical experts while the courts from which appeals are taken to us and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to which appeals from this court lie have the benefit of such advice as and when they desire.\nIdington and Maclennan JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nDuff J.\u2014These appeals relate to a collision which occurred in the St. Lawrence River at a place below the St. Antoine and above the Ste. Croix range lights between the SS. \"Euphemia,\" going down, and the SS. \"Tordenskjold,\" going up the river. Both sides concede that a short time (less than three minutes) before the mishap occurred, the ships were proceeding starboard to starboard upon courses which, had they been kept, would have taken them past one another in perfect safety.\nIt was found by the learned trial judge (Routhier J.) with the concurrence of his assessor (Captain Koehig)\u2014and these findings have been affirmed by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court (Burbidge J.) with the concurrence of his assessor (Captain Tooker, R.N.)\u2014that when at a distance of not more than a half and not less than a quarter of a mile from the \"Euphemia\" the \"Tordenskjold,\" being then on the course I have mentioned, suddenly turned to starboard, first exhibiting to the \"Euphemia\" her three lights and then shutting out her green light; that seeing the \"Tordenskjold\" thus changing her course the \"Eupheraia\" answered the movement by porting her helm; but when the \"Tordenskjold's\" red light was a little on the \"Euphemia's\" port bow the \"Tordenskjold\" again changed her course, this time shewing first her three lights and then shutting out her red light; that the \"Euphemia\" then reversed her engines at full speed, but, it being then too late to avert a collision, the \"Tordenskjold,\" passing the \"Euphemia's\" bows, received on her starboard side the blow of the latter's stem.\nThe learned trial judge on the advice of his assessor, has held on this state of facts that the \"Tordenskjold\" was in fault in this; that the ships being so close together, and upon parallel courses by which they could pass with safety, the \"Tordenskjold\" should not have directed her course across the \"Euphemia's\" bows; but that, having indicated an intention of thus directing her course by exhibiting her red light alone to the \"Euphemia,\" she should have kept that course. The opinion of the trial judge and his assessor that the \"Tordenskjold\" was in fault in both these respects had the concurrence of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court and of the assessor who advised him. The trial judge further held (and upon this point also his view was shared by his assessor and by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court) that the \"Euphemia\" was not in fault. It is in respect of this holding only that the judgment of the Exchequer Court is impugned on these appeals.\nThe appeals are rested on two grounds, first, that when the \"Tordenskjold\" shut out her green light after exhibiting her red the \"Eupheniia\" should have seen the risk involved in proceeding further ahead and should have reversed; and secondly, that assuming she was justified in porting her helm, she was in fault in not giving the prescribed signal to indicate that she was about to direct her course to starboard.\nI think neither of these grounds is available in this court.\nAs to the first, I cannot find, in the evidence given at the trial, or in that taken before the Commission of Inquiry which preceded the trial, anything which indicates that it occurred to the trial judge or to his assessor or the Commissioners or to the counsel for the appellants that, at the time the \"Euphemia\"\u2014 according to the account given by those on board of her\u2014ported her helm (when the \"Tordenskjold\" was about one-half a mile distant) there was not sufficient room to enable the ships to pass port to port. The respondents in their preliminary act and in their pleadings stated the salient facts substantially as their witnesses stated them at the trial; and notwithstanding the appellants had thus the most ample notice of the respondents' account of their man\u0153uvres which preceded the collision, there is not one word of cross-examination conveying a suggestion that (if each ship should have held her course to starboard) this man\u0153uvre would have involved any apparent or foreseeable risk of collision. The contention seems to have been suggested for the first time in the Exchequer Court where the nautical assessor expressed the view that the only safe course for the \"Euphemia,\" when she saw that the \"Tordenskjold\" had shut out her green light, was to reverse her engines.\nThe principle upon which a Court of Appeal ought to act when a view of the facts of a case is presented before it which has not been suggested before, is stated by Lord Herschell in The \"Tasmania\"[2], at p. 225, thus:\nMy Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial, and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most jealously scrutinized. The conduct of a cause at the trial is governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to, the points then suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to them.\nIt appears to me that under these circumstances a court of appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness box.\nIn The \"Tasmania\"2 the particular point referred to\u2014which the House of Lords refused to entertain \u2014had not been made in the pleadings. Here it is true there is in the pleadings a general charge that the \"Euphemia\" was in fault for not reversing her engines. In point of fact it was clearly proved that before the collision she did reverse her engines; and the allegation in the pleadings would suggest to nobody reading the pleading as a whole a hint of the contention upon which the \"Tordenskjold\" now actually relies.\nIs it then manifest that if this controversy had arisen at the trial no facts bearing on it, other than those which the record discloses, could have been brought to light? I cannot think that can be the case. There are many things I should like to be informed about before passing upon such a question. More exact information about the width of the channel, about the speed of the vessels, about the time and distance in which they could turn, would seem to be almost essential to enable one to form confident opinion concerning it. The opinion of the nautical assessor who assisted the judge of the Exchequer Court is entitled of course upon any question of nautical man\u0153uvering to the highest consideration. But we have not the advantage of knowing the views upon all important questions of fact which formed the basis of his opinion; and without those views I am not entitled to assume that a fuller investigation specifically addressed to those questions might not present a very different case respecting them.\nFor the same reason I do not think we are entitled to entertain the contention which forms the second of the above-mentioned grounds of appeal. The decision of the Court of Appeal in The \"Anselm\"[3], cited by Mr. Meredith, satisfies me that, assuming a failure on the part of the \"Euphemia\" to sound her whistle, such a failure would have constituted a breach of article 28; but before the \"Euphemia\" can be convicted of fault in this regard two questions must be determined; first, whether in fact there was on her part a breach of the rule, and secondly, whether, assuming a breach established, it contributed to occasion the collision. Whether, in respect of this latter question, the onus would lie on the \"Euphemia\" or on the \"Tor-denskjold\" need not concern us. Assuming that, a breach being proved, the burden is cast upon the \"Euphemia\" is it clear that we have before us all the evidence which would have been produced had these questions formed a subject of contest at the trial? As to the first of them there is not in the voluminous examinations and cross-examinations which fill the record, a single word directed expressly to the point whether the \"Euphemia's\" whistle was or was not sounded when her helm was ported. There are, it is true, expressions throughout the case, many of them, which obliquely suggest and (if used when such a point was before the minds of those employing them) might, I think, be taken to imply with sufficient certainty that the signal was not given; and there are plenty of indications leading to the conclusion that neither pilot had a clear notion of the directions of article 28. But, on the other hand, if such a breach could have been proved, unless indeed there was some explanation which does not appear, it seems incredible that it should not have been charged in the preliminary act or in the pleadings; and that at the trial the point should have been by both sides so successfully avoided.\nWhatever view may be taken, however, on this point I am satisfied that the second question involved in this ground of appeal could not be decided adversely to the respondents upon the evidence as it now stands without the gravest risk of doing injustice. In the light thrown upon the methods of these pilots by the evidence in this case, I should have no doubt that the exhibition of the \"Euphemia's\" red light to the \"Tordenskjold\" in answer to the exhibition of the \"Tordenskjold's\" to the \"Euphemia,\" would be regarded by the pilot on the \"Tordenskjold,\" even in the absence of a signal, as a definite indication of the \"Euphemia's\" intention to pass to starboard; the question when that occurred, that is to say at what point the red light of the \"Euphemia\" must have been seen by the \"Tordenskjold\" is a question which, if it was to be the determining point of the litigation, should have been investigated at the trial. It is quite true there is some evidence, indeed a good deal of evidence, bearing upon it. But it is clear that neither the court nor counsel specifically addressed themselves to the point; and it is not, I think, open to doubt that, had they done so, the circumstances affecting it would have been much more fully disclosed.\nIn this court we suffer from the disadvantage of lacking skilled advice; that is a circumstance which emphasizes, I think, the importance of having all questions of fact\u2014and more especially questions of seamenship\u2014in such a case as this, distinctly raised before the court which tries it with the assistance which is not afforded us.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, MacPherson, Hague & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondents: W. & A.

Armour K.C. and R. S. Cassels for the appellant.\nTheodore A. Hunt for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMaclennan J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, affirming a judgment of the trial judge, who dismissed the action with costs.\nThe plaintiff had been the owner of 170 vacant lots of land situate within the defendant's municipality, except so much thereof as was taken by the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. for their roadway, and, on the 25th November, 1892, his title was duly registered under \"The Real Property Act\" of Manitoba.\nThe plaintiff had allowed the taxes imposed by the defendant in respect of these lands, to fall in arrear and remain unpaid for a number of years, the last payment made by him having been of those for the year 1893.\nIn the year 1897 the defendant caused the lands to be sold for the arrears of taxes, and as authorized by the law of the province, became the purchasers thereof.\nThe validity of this sale and purchase is not impeached or questioned in the pleadings, and was expressly admitted at the trial. But the defendant did not, by the mere sale, become the indefeasible owner of the land. To have that effect, it had to be followed by a certificate of title obtained from the district registrar of titles.\nThe defendant did not take the necessary steps to obtain a certificate of title until the 22nd October, 1900, when the prescribed notice bearing that date was prepared and was served upon the plaintiff on the 3rd of November following. This notice intimated to the plaintiff that, as the law permitted, he might redeem the land within six months from the day of service, or at any time before the issue of a certificate of title to the applicant, by payment to the district registrar of the arrears of taxes, together with a bonus of twenty per cent., but that in the event of nonpayment a certificate of title under \"The Real Property Act'? would be issued to the applicant.\nThe plaintiff did not, either within the six months named in the notice, or afterwards, pay the taxes in arrear, or any part thereof, although the defendant delayed in applying for a certificate of title until the 7th of April, 1902.\nOn the last mentioned day payment not having been made a certificate issued to the defendant, and no attempt had been made to impeach its regularity or validity.\nIt is true that the plaintiff says that he treated a demand for taxes for the year 1901, made by the defendant, as an abandonment of the notice of application which had been served on him in 1900. One can hardly listen seriously to this suggestion, coming from a barrister, who had been distinctly notified that until certificate obtained he might still redeem, when in fact the land was still his own, at his option, and, therefore, continued liable to taxation against him, at all events provisionally.\nBy section 387 of the defendant's charter taxes may be sued for as a debt. The taxes due prior to the sale were satisfied by the sale, unless the plaintiff chose to redeem within the time limited, and if the sale became absolute by certificate of title, the subsequent taxes were merely provisional, on the defendant's own land and could not be recovered from the plaintiff. There is, therefore, in my opinion, no question of the validity of the certificate of title.\nBy section 71 of \"The Real Property Act\" it is declared as follows:\nEvery certificate of title, hereafter or heretofore issued, shall as long as the same remains in force, and uncancelled, be conclusive evidence at law and in equity, as against His Majesty and all other persons whomsoever, that the person named in such certificate is entitled to the land described therein, for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the right of any person to shew (certain things including fraud not material in this case).\nThe effect therefore of the certificate obtained by the defendant was to extinguish the plaintiff's title, both at law and in equity. From that time he had no right, legal or equitable, to the land any more than any other of His Majesty's subjects, and unless the defendant has dealt with the plaintiff, in relation to this land, in some way, which under the like circumstances, would give a right either legal or equitable to any other person, he cannot succeed in this appeal.\nThe defendant's title then being such as I have indicated, by virtue of the sale and the certificate, has anything happened, or has the defendant done anything, since obtaining it, to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action?\nOne thing relied on is this: that after the date of the certificate, the 7th of April, 1902, the defendant's assessment commissioner served the plaintiff with a notice of assessment of the lands dated 3rd of May, 1902. I think that fact is of no importance. Section 325 of the city charter, section 10 of the \"Assessment Act,\" requires that as early as practicable in each year the assessment commissioner shall report to the council the completion of the assessment rolls.\nAnd the learned trial judge has pointed out that the plaintiff was the proper person in whose name to assess the lands up to the time that the certificate of title was issued to the defendant.\nThe assessment proceedings were commenced, and properly commenced, before the issue of the certificate, and were continued afterwards by the officer, without any special directions from the council.\nUnder these circumstances I think the assessment of the plaintiff for the year 1902 necessarily became and was quite nugatory, and could confer no right of redemption on the plaintiff.\nThe only serious question in the appeal in my opinion is the resolution of the finance committee of the 11th December, 1903, and its adoption by the defendant's council on the 14th of the same month, in the presence of the solicitor for the plaintiff.\nThe resolution is as follows:\nThat all lot3 formerly owned by W. N. Ponton acquired by the city at tax sale be conveyed to the said Ponton on payment of all costs, interest and taxes to date.\nAnd it was signed by the mayor and city clerk.\nNothing was done by the plaintiff' or his solicitors in the way of accepting or availing himself of this resolution for more than four months, and on the 4th of April following a member of the council gave notice of a motion to rescind the resolution at its next meeting, and the council advertised the lands to be sold by public sale on the 20th of April.\nThis roused the plaintiff's solicitors to action and, on the 16th April, a clerk of the plaintiff's solicitors made a tender to the treasurer of the defendant of a sum of money accompanied by a letter offering to accept the resolution of the 14th December, but the tender was refused, and on the 18th of April the resolution of the 14th of December was rescinded.\nThe present action was commenced two days afterwards on the 20th of April.\nIt is upon this resolution of council, the offer to accept it, and the tender made to the treasurer, that the principal reliance of the plaintiff is placed, both in pleading and in argument.\nIt is said that the resolution and acceptance constitute a contract between the defendant and the plaintiff; and that the resolution is an offer which was accepted by the plaintiff by his solicitors' letter to the city treasurer, of the 16th of April, accompanied by the tender of the taxes, interest and costs.\nThe evidence of the assistant treasurer is that the sum tendered was considerably less than what was then due for taxes, interest and costs; but however that may be, I am clearly of opinion that the resolution, even though accepted, was not a contract or engagement which bound the defendant. The Statute of Frauds was pleaded, if that was necessary, and a contract in writing was necessary to bind the defendant.\nSection 472 of the city charter is express that the powers of the council shall be exercised by by-law when not otherwise authorized or provided for, and I have looked in vain for any authorization or provision in the charter enabling it to sell land by mere resolution. A by-law authorizing a sale and a contract under seal were essential, in my opinion, to bind the defendant, and for want of these essentials, the alleged contract was inoperative. I refer to Waterous Engine Works Co. v. Town of Palmerston (1), and District of North Vancouver v. Tracey (2).\nFor these reasons, and the reasons of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, I think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper, Galt, Tupper, Minty & McTavish.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Theodore A.

Angers (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1908: November 4; 1908: December 15.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Girouard, Idington, Maclennan and Duff JJ.\non appeal from the court of king's bench, appeal side, province of quebec,\nCompany\u2014Sale of shares\u2014Resolutive condition\u2014Hypothecary security\u2014Construction of contract\u2014Rescission.\nBy the judgment appealed from(Q.R. 18 K.B. 63), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court (Q.R. 30 S.C. 56), it was held that the acceptance of a proposal to purchase shares in a joint stock company for a price payable half in bonds and half in the stock of a new company to be formed to take over the business of the first mentioned company, on condition that the shares so sold should be deposited in trust as security for the payment of the bonds and that, so soon as all the shares of that company were so deposited and its real estate transferred to the new company, a mortgage on the real estate should be executed to secure payment of the bonds, was a sale subject to a resolutive condition to become complete and effective only in the event of the new company acquiring the property of the first company and executing the mortgage, and that, on breach of the condition respecting the security to be given for payment of the bonds, the sale became ineffective and should be rescinded.\nOn an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment appealed from was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of Archibald J. in the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], maintaining the respondent's action with costs. In December, 1904, the respondent was offered bonds and preferred stock of a projected joint stock company in exchange for fifty shares of stock held by him in the Dominion Cotton Mills Company. It was stipulated in the offer that the fifty shares would be held in trust by the Royal Trust Company as security for the payment of the bonds. The person who made the offer and his associates undertook that, so soon as all the shares of that company were so deposited in trust and its real estate transferred to the new company, a mortgage would be executed and registered by the new company against such real estate to secure the payment of the bonds to be so given in exchange, so that they should be secured, not only by the assets of the new company, but also by such real estate. In case of acceptance of the offer the respondent was asked to deposit the stock as proposed \"in order to receive in exchange therefor the securities above mentioned so soon as the transaction can be given effect.\"\nThe respondent accepted the offer, agreed to make the exchange at any time within three months, and transferred his fifty shares to the Royal Trust Company. The appellants are the company which it was proposed to incorporate, as mentioned in the offer.\nAt the time of the institution of the action the shares of the Dominion Cotton Mills Company had not all been deposited and its real estate had not been transferred to the appellants.\nOn the 27th January, 1905, the Royal Trust Company wrote and sent to the respondent and other shareholders of the Dominion Cotton Mills Co. a letter in which it was stated that the buyers had turned over to the Royal Trust Company the shares of the Dominion Cotton Mills Company stock which had been deposited, so that such shares would thereafter be held for the appellants, and that the appellants would continue the offer of exchange made on the 29th December, 1904. The respondent acquiesced in this substitution of the appellants for the persons by whom the offer was made, but it was understood that the fifty shares remained subject to the trust stated in the offer.\nIn January, 1905, the appellants enacted a by-law to provide for the issue of debentures, a proportion of which debentures were to be applied in exchange for the shares of the Dominion Cotton Co., which had been agreed to be exchanged. Bonds were accordingly issued and tendered to the shareholders of the old company, but those tendered to the respondent were refused by him, and the respondent brought the action for an order that the mortgage bonds and preferred stock should be delivered to him, within fifteen days; that, in default of such delivery, the sale of the fifty shares of stock should be set aside and the defendants condemned to re-transfer the shares to him, and that, in the event of the defendants neither delivering the bonds and preferred stock, nor retransferring the fifty shares, they should be condemned to pay him $ 5,000, the par value of said fifty shares, with interest from the 11th day of January, 1905.\nAt the trial the plaintiff's action was maintained, with costs, and that judgment was affirmed by the judgment from which the present appeal was asserted.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and George H. Montgomery for the appellants.\nB\u00e9ique K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice and Girouard J. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014Let us try to understand what those concerned were about and I do not think we will find much difficulty in finding the law suitable for their case.\nI cannot read the proposal and the acceptance in question as a whole, as they ought to be read, if we wish to understand the questions raised, without coming to the conclusion that what the respondent intended to obtain was fifty cents on the dollar for his stock in the Dominion Cotton Mills Company by means of exchanging it for bonds of the appellants to the amount of $1,250, charged upon the property of the Dominion Cotton Mills Company, and preferred stock of the appellant company for the like amount.\nNor can I doubt, unless I impute a dishonest instead of an honest purpose to the appellants, that their intention coincided with that of the respondent and that he should have realized his expectations within a reasonable time, now long since expired.\nThe appellants got a delivery of the respondent's shares on the faith of such common intention and understanding, and I see no reason why, as a result thereof and of the appellants' failure to implement the bargain, they should not abide by such a judgment as that appealed from, which seems to fit the case.\nThe phrase \"so soon as,\" of which much has been made, does not mean \"never,\" or imply some years short of forever, as the appellants' contention might lead to if maintained.\nIt does not matter that by a long involved train of reasoning it may become, to the legal mind, clear that if the law is honestly observed and remains unchanged the security the respondent has may, in effect, be as good as what he sought.\nIt is not what he bargained for. It is not as simple and easily understood as that. It is, hence, by no means as marketable.\nThe respondent may be ill-advised in claiming a return of his stock instead of trusting to the financial skill and benignity of the promoters of the appellants. Yet I cannot see how he has, by anything he did, adopted the latter course.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion of Idington J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: B\u00e9ique, Turgeon & B\u00e9ique.\n[1] Q.R. 18 K.B. 63.\n[2] Q.R. 30 S.C. 56.\n"}

Nous avons les notes des juges des deux cours, tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9es et contenant un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 complet des faits de la cause et des questions de droit qui furent soulev\u00e9es devant eux. Tous les juges admettent que le 10 juin, 1817, il \u00e2 \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 un acte entre Joseph L\u00e9-pine et John Boyd \u00e9tablissant une servitude entre deux lots de ville contigus sur la rue d'Auteuil, en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, savoir une servitude de passage sur le lot maintenant connu sous le no. 2686 comme fonds servant au profit du lot 2685 comme fonds dominant. L'acte qui contient cette servitude a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 devant notaire; mais la minute en est disparue et il n'existe, para\u00eet-il, aucune copie. Dans presque tous les actes de mutation qui suivent, et ils sont nombreux, r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est faite \u00e0 cet acte de la mani\u00e8re la plus formelle, mais d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les termes suivants, que je reproduis; d'abord l'acte de vente du dit L\u00e9pine et de son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 John Phillips du lot 2685 \u00e0 la date du 8 novembre, 1830:\nAvec en outre tous les droits g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques que les dits vendeurs peuvent avoir et pr\u00e9tendre, leur r\u00e9sultant de l'acte d'accord et conventions fait entre eux et le dit sieur John Boyd, pass\u00e9 devant Mtre. B\u00e9langer, notaire, en date du dix juin, mil huit cent dix-sept, et auquel le dit acqu\u00e9reur sera tenu de se conformer strictement.\nPuis l'acte de vente de Charles Smith, junior, qui a acquis le lot 2686, \u00e0 la date du 21 janvier, 1840:\nAnd also subject to all and singular the charges, clauses and conditions mentioned and expressed in a certain deed made between the said Joseph L\u00e9pine and John Boyd, passed before Jean B\u00e9langer and colleague, notaries, the tenth of June, one thousand eight hundred and seventeen, respecting the common passage existing between the said lot of ground hereby sold and the one remaining to the said John Phillips, to which deed the said Ann Sprowles, her heirs and assigns, shall conform in every respect.\nEnfin l'acte de vente du m\u00eame lot du 10 mars, 1842, par Mme. Sprowles \u00e0 Wm. Booth:\nsubject also by the said purchaser to the observance of all conditions and obligations of a certain deed of agreement entered into between the said Joseph L\u00e9pine and John Boyd, passed before Mtre. J. B\u00e9langer and colleague, notaries, at Quebec on the tenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and seventeen, and which related to the common wall and passage between the property hereby sold and that of the said John Phillips adjoining thereto.\nLe savant juge qui a rendu le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que ces reconnaissances \u00e9taient trop vagues et ne rencontraient pas les exigences des articles 545, 549, 550, 551 et 1213 du code civil de Qu\u00e9bec. En supposant que ce dernier article s'applique, la doctrine contraire semble pr\u00e9valoir; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Dr. C. t. 5, n. 1095, p. 3; Gilbert sur Sirey, C.C. art. 695, n. 2; il n'exige pas que toutes les particularit\u00e9s d'une servitude soient par \u00e9crit; il suffit que la substance du titre primordial soit donn\u00e9e, ce qui pourra \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, d'autres documents, la possession imm\u00e9moriale et la preuve orale. Presque toutes les reconnaissances de la servitude portent que c'est un droit de passage sur un des lots au profit de l'autre, situ\u00e9s sur la rue d'Auteuil; voil\u00e0 la substance: le doute n'est pas possible l\u00e0-dessus: par cons\u00e9quent la nature et la situation de la servitude sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es dans ces reconnaissances. Reste l'\u00e9tendue qui ne l'est pas: mais ne l'est-elle pas, et particuli\u00e8rement la situation, au plan et au compromis sign\u00e9s par Julia Healy et H. J. Noad, propri\u00e9taires respectifs des deux lots \u00e0 la date du 29 novembre, 1852, le propri\u00e9taire du lot servant pr\u00e9tendant que l'ayant achet\u00e9 au sh\u00e9rif il \u00e9tait libre de la servitude, le propri\u00e9taire du lot dominant soutenant au contraire qu'\u00e9tant une servitude apparente par la porte de sortie de la cour de Phillips au passage et \u00e0 la rue d'Auteuil et vice vers\u00e0, visible sur le plan et les lieux, elle n'\u00e9tait pas purg\u00e9e par le d\u00e9cret. C'est le seul point qui fut soumis \u00e0 M. Black, un eminent conseil de la reine, qui devint plus tard juge \u00e0 l'amiraut\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. M. Black d\u00e9cida en. faveur de la servitude et le principe qu'il a adopt\u00e9 a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 par notre Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, art. 780 et 781.\nCette opinion de M. Black n'est d'aucune importance dans cette cause et il importe peu de savoir si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e aux parties au d\u00e9sir du compromis, bien que sa production par le demandeur fasse pr\u00e9sumer qu'elle le fut. Quand bien m\u00eame cette opinion n'existerait pas, le r\u00e9sultat serait le m\u00eame. Nous trouverons toujours dans l'acte de compromis et le plan qui y est trac\u00e9 le reconnaissance compl\u00e8te de l'existence de la servitude. On lit dans le compromis: The proprietor, Mrs. Healey, of the lot on the south side, viz., Phillips's lot, now pretends and claims the right of passage and asserts that this right of passage, being a servitude visible, it was not incumbent upon her to oppose by an opposition \u00e0 fin de charge in order to preserve her right; whereas Mr. Noad, the present owner, pretends that the lot of ground purchased by him has been purged of the said servitude by the sale thereof to him by the sheriff, in virtue of the process issued in that behalf, and that the said servitude is not a servitude visible, as it exists in the user of it.\nThe foregoing case we submit for your consideration and request your opinion on the following subjects: 1st, whether the said servitude is one known as a servitude visible; 2ndly, whether such servitude has been lost to the proprietor hereof by failing to fyle an opposition to conserve such servitude; and 3rdly, whether the lot purchased at sheriff's, sale without notice of such servitude is purged of and freed from the said right of passage by such sale.\nVoici le plan du passage trac\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame document:\nQuant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tendue il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle soit d\u00e9crite par le nombre de pieds de largeur et de profondeur ou hauteur.\nLe passage aura l'\u00e9tendue dont il est capable tel que d\u00e9limit\u00e9 au plan.\nLa cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 que tous ces documents \u00e9tablissaient la servitude en question conform\u00e9ment au code, qui seul fut invoqu\u00e9 par les parties, et nous croyons qu'elle a eu raison. La savante analyse que M. le juge Cimon a faite de la cause me dispense de plus de commentaires sur ce premier point. J'ajouterai quelques remarques sur le droit qui nous r\u00e9git en cette mati\u00e8re qui formeront le deuxi\u00e8me point de la cause, car je crois que cette cause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s le droit ant\u00e9rieur au code, \u00e0 l'exception des lois d'enregistrement.\nNotre code reproduit avec quelques variations la coutume de Paris aux articles 186, 215 et 216, semblables aux articles 225, 227 et 228 de la coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans. Il faut bien remarquer qu'aux dates de la passation de tous les actes en question c'\u00e9tait la coutume de Paris qui d\u00e9terminait les droits des parties et le code ne peut recevoir d'application qu'en autant qu'il exprime l'ancien droit. Or, il existe une grande diff\u00e9rence entre l'article 216 de la coutume et l'article 551 du code. La coutume n'exige pas ici que la destination du p\u00e8re de famille soit par \u00e9crit, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'\u00e9crit soit produit, mais seulement qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 par \u00e9crit; voil\u00e0 tout et si l'\u00e9crit \u00e9tait perdu la preuve pouvait s'en faire, comme dans les cas ordinaires. Ici nous avons la preuve \u00e9crite \u00e9manant de plusieurs auteurs de l'appelante que l'\u00e9crit a exist\u00e9. Ce qui nous int\u00e9resse le plus, c'est que la coutume n'exige pas, comme le code, que \"la nature, l'\u00e9tendue et la situation\" soient sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es. L'article 216 dit:\nDestination du p\u00e8re de famille vaut titre, quand elle est ou a est\u00e9 par \u00e9crit et non autrement.\nLe droit romain contient plusieurs lois sur la destination du p\u00e8re de famille que les auteurs ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res. Pothier, \"Pandectes de Justinien,\" t. 4, p. 267, n. XXII., et Toullier, t. 3, n. 612, sont d'opinion que ces lois exigent que la servitude soit \"nomm\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9e,\" tandis que Gilbert sur Sirey et Dard, code civil, art. 694, indiquent les lois romaines comme \u00e9tant la source de cet article du code Napol\u00e9on qui dispense de toute mention de la servitude si elle est apparente. Voici le texte:\nSi le propri\u00e9taire de deux h\u00e9ritages entre lesquels il existe un signe apparent de servitude, dispense de l\u2019un des h\u00e9ritages sans que le contrat contienne aucune convention relative \u00e0 la servitude, elle continue d'exister activement ou passivement en faveur du fonds ali\u00e9n\u00e9 ou sur le fonds ali\u00e9n\u00e9;\net Toullier, t. 3, n. 612, ajoute:\nSoit que les signes de servitude existassent avant la r\u00e9union des deux h\u00e9ritages dans la main du m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire, soit qu'il les e\u00fbt \u00e9tablis depuis cette r\u00e9union.\nOr voici comment Pothier commente l'article 228 de la coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, semblable \u00e0 l'article 216 de la coutume de Paris, et l'on verra de suite que l'article 694 n'a fait que sanctionner la doctrine de Pothier:\nLorsque deux h\u00e9ritages, (dit-il), appartiennent au m\u00eame ma\u00eetre, le service que l'un tire de l'autre, comme lorsqu'une maison a une vue ou un \u00eago\u00fbt sur l'autre, n'est pas servitude, \"quia res sua nemini servit\": L. 26, ff. de servit., pr. rust., c'est destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Si par la suite ces deux maisons viennent \u00e0 appartenir \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents ma\u00eetres, soit par l'ali\u00e9nation que le propri\u00e9taire fera de l'une de ses maisons, ou par le partage qui se fera entre les h\u00e9ritiers, le service que l'une des maisons tire de l'autre, qui \u00e9tait destination du p\u00e8re de famille, lorsqu'elles appartenaient au m\u00eame ma\u00eetre, devient un droit de servitude que le propri\u00e9taire de cette maison a sur la maison voisine de qui la sienne tire ce service, sans qu'il soit besoin que par l'ali\u00e9nation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de l'une de ses maisons, ou par le partage, cette servitude a\u00eet \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9e. La raison est que la maison qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9e est cens\u00e9e l'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en l'\u00e9tat qu'elle se trouvait; et pareillement que lorsqu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es, elles sont cens\u00e9es l'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 telles et en l'\u00e9tat qu'elles se trouvaient; et par cons\u00e9quent l'une comme ayant la vue, l'\u00eagout, etc., sur l'autre, et l'autre comme souffrant cette vue, cet \u00e9gout, etc.; ce qui suffit pour \u00e9tablir la servitude. C'est ce que signifie notre coutume par ces termes, destination de p\u00e8re de famille vaut titre.\nPothier ajoute que quand la coutume parle d'\u00e9crit cela doit s'entendre de la preuve litt\u00e9rale que la servitude existait d\u00e8s le temps que les deux maisons appartenaient au m\u00eame ma\u00eetre, \"ce qui,\" ajoute-t-il,\npeut s'\u00e9tablir par le march\u00e9 par \u00e9crit qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour la construction, par les quittances des ouvriers, ou par quelque acte qui contiendrait une description de ces maisons dans laquelle la fen\u00eatre ou l'\u00e9gout seraient \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\nLa preuve qu'a faite l'intim\u00e9 est bien plus forte. Il a produit l'acte de vente du 3 juillet, 1839, pass\u00e9 devant Mtre. Panet, notaire, par lequel John Phillips, l'acqu\u00e9reur de L\u00e9pine et devenu aussi depuis propri\u00e9taire de l'autre lot, a vendu le lot 2686 \u00e0 Charles Smith, Jr., sujet \u00e0 la clause suivante:\nSubject also to all and singular the charges, clauses and conditions mentioned and expressed in a certain deed made between the said Joseph L\u00e9pine and John Boyd, passed before J. B\u00e9langer and colleague, notaries public, the 10th of June, 1817, respecting the common passage existing between the said lot of ground now ceded and the one remaining, to the said John Phillips, to which the said Charles Smith, junior, his heirs and assigns shall conform in every respect.\nCette reconnaissance \u00e9tablit hors de tout doute que le passage existait lorsque Phillips \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des deux lots et le plan et le compromis plus haut mentionnes \u00e9tablissent la situation et l'\u00e9tendue de ce passage. L'intim\u00e9 se trouve donc dans le cas pourvu par les interpr\u00eates les plus exigeants (lu droit romain. Or le droit romain, c'est le droit commun de la province de Qu\u00e9bec en l'absence de dispositions sp\u00e9ciales.\nEnfin, s'il nous est permis de suivre l'opinion de Pothier sur les coutumes d'Orl\u00e9ans et de Paris, il ne serait pas m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire que la servitude a\u00eet \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9e par le propri\u00e9taire des deux h\u00e9ritages. Il ne faut pas croire que cette opinion est isol\u00e9e. Elle formait la r\u00e8gle de droit adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des commentateurs de la coutume, qui faisait autorit\u00e9 avait le code Napol\u00e9on, et par cons\u00e9quent, avant notre code. Dard., art. 694, r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 Merlin, \"Servitude,\" par. 19, nos. 2 and 3. C'est aussi le sentiment de LeOamus d'Houlouvre, \"Coutume du Boulonnais,\" t. 1er., p. 342; Rousseau de la Combe, \"Jurisprudence,\" vo. \"Servitude,\" sec. II., n. 2, p. 206. Puis je trouve au r\u00e9pertoire de Guyot, \"Servitude\" (\u00e9d. 1783), vol. 58, p. 288 et suivantes, une longe \u00e9tude sur le sujet, o\u00f9 la doctrine et la jurisprudence sont savamment examin\u00e9es et discut\u00e9es. En commen\u00e7ant, \u00e0 la page 289, l'auteur observe que\nlorsque la servitude est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par son esp\u00e8ce particuli\u00e8re, il n'y a pas de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 la confirmer.\nA la page 291, il cite une opinion de Goupy en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 DesGodets o\u00f9 ce commentateur observe:\nIl en est de m\u00eame du droit de passage. Si le propri\u00e9taire en question avait vendu une des deux maisons, avec charge d'un passage de porte coch\u00e8re dans le corps du logis sur la rue, c'est-\u00e0-dire si c'est au milieu ou sur les c\u00f4t\u00e9s; je ne pense pas que ce vendeur, faute d'une plus exacte d\u00e9signation, f\u00fbt priv\u00e9 du droit de passage.\nEnfin on apprend au r\u00e9pertoire de Guyot qu'Auzanet et deLamoignon sont du m\u00eame avis si la servitude est apparente, et qu'un arr\u00eat du 29 mars, 1760, a jug\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens. Puis l'auteur reproduit l'opinion de Pothier sur l'article 228 de la coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, cit\u00e9e plus haut, et la fait suivre de l'approbation suivante:\nMais si ces servitudes existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 lorsque les deux maisons \u00e9taient dans ses mains (sinon comme servitudes, au moins comme destination de p\u00e8re de famille), il suffit pour les conserver, soit par lui-m\u00eame, soit par l'acqu\u00e9reur quand il a vendu l'une des deux maisons, soit par ses h\u00e9ritiers ou ses l\u00e9gataires lorsqu'ils en font le partage, qu'il y a\u00eet une preuve par \u00e9crit de l'existence de ces arrangements de famille, pour qu'ils forment de v\u00e9ritables servitudes, quand bien m\u00eame il n'en serait rien dit dans le contrat, le testament ou le partage qui a mis les deux maisons dans des mains diff\u00e9rentes.\nA plus forte raison n'est-il pas n\u00e9cessaire que la servitude soit sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re prescrite par l'article 215 de la coutume de Paris.\nIl semble bien constant qu'il n'y a pas de diff\u00e9rence substantielle entre l'ancien droit et Particle 694 du code Napol\u00e9on. Les codificateurs canadiens n'ont pas reproduit cet article; ils n'en parlent m\u00eame pas et ils ont omis de nous donner la raison de leur silence. Cependant cet article n'a fait que reproduire l'ancien droit qui doit l'emporter sur le code, vu que les transactions dont il s'agit ont eu lieu avant le code; et m\u00eame si elles avaient eu lieu depuis, ce serait la loi qui gouvernerait en l'absence de dispositions au code. (C.C. art. 2613). Il me semble que l'article 2078 de ce code consacre le m\u00eame principe lorsqu'il y a d\u00e9laissement sur une action hypoth\u00e9caire. Cet article dit:\n2078. Les servitudes et droits r\u00e9els que le tiers d\u00e9tenteur avait sur l'immeuble au temps de l'acquisition qu'il en a faite, ou qu'il a \u00e9teints durant sa possession, renaissent apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9laissement.\nVoir Laurent, t. 8, n. 302. C'est aussi la r\u00e8gle qui est consacr\u00e9e par l'article 560.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9 nous sommes d'avis qu'il y a preuve du droit de passage r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, d'abord par les reconnaissances de l'acte primordial de la servitude de 1817, compl\u00e9t\u00e9es par le dit plan et le dit compromis entre Noad et Healey en 1852: servitude qui est devenue \u00e9teinte par la confusion qui a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 du fait que Phillips est devenu propri\u00e9taire des deux lots (C.C. art. 561); mais qui, \u00e9tant apparente, revit d\u00e8s le moment que le dit Phillips l'a vendu \u00e0 un tiers; c'est la disposition de l'ancien droit qui ne fut pas invoqu\u00e9e nonobstant nos observations lors de la plaidoirie orale devant nous, mais que nous ne pouvons ignorer.\nPuis enfin on ne peut raisonablement nier, comme la cour d'appel Fa d\u00e9cid\u00e9, et pour des raisons que j'approuve, que la clause de servitude contenue dans l'acte de vente du 3 juillet, 1839, par Phillips \u00e0 Charles Smith, Jr., suppl\u00e9ment\u00e9e par les autres preuves que nous avons signal\u00e9es, ne fasse preuve compl\u00e8te de l'existence de la servitude en question d'apr\u00e8s le code, et j'ajouterai avec encore plus de raison d'apr\u00e8s l'ancien droit ant\u00e9rieur au code.\nJe n'ai rien dit d'une ou deux objections qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de la part de l'appelant; savoir l'une le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement du compromis et du plan; enregistrement qui n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire aux termes de l'article 2116a du code civil, puisque la servitude est apparente; et l'autre que l'usage fait du passage en question n'\u00e9tait que de simple tol\u00e9rance et de bon voisinage; pr\u00e9tension que l'existence d'un titre \u00e0 la servitude repousse \u00e9videmment. Il en est de m\u00eame du plaidoyer de prescription par non-usage de trente ans qui n'est pas \u00e9tabli. Il est en preuve au contraire que la servitude de ce passage a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9e depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial. Sans titre, cette possession serait insuffisante; mais elle peut servir \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9ter et m\u00eame le compl\u00e9ter. Pigeau, \"Proc\u00e9dure Civile,\" t. 1er, p. 226 (\u00e9d. 1787), dit:\nC'est une maxime que in antiquis enunciativa probant; par exemple, dans la coutume de Paris et nombre d'autres, il n'y a pas de servitudes sans titre; supposez cependant que ma maison ait un droit de passage par la maison voisine, que je ne repr\u00e9sente pas le titre qui me les donne, mais qu'il y ait dans les titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ma maison, une \u00e9nonciation de ce droit, cette enunciation, jointe \u00e2 une possession de trente ann\u00e9es, fait pr\u00e9sumer contre le propri\u00e9taire de cette maison voisine, qu'il y a eu un titre. C'est d'ailleurs ce que la doctrine et la jurisprudence enseignent, par exemple un arr\u00eat de cette cour dans la cause de La Commune de Berthier v. Denis[3], o\u00f9 un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s sont cit\u00e9es.\nPour toutes ces raisons l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nDavies, Idington and Maclennan JJ. agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dorion & Marchand.\n[1] Q.R. 18 K.B. 24.\n[2] Q.R. 32 S.C. 289.\n[3] 27 Can.

The informant and the Commissioners agreed to a special case being stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on the construction of the Act and that court, after hearing counsel for both parties, ordered that \"the Board of License Commissioners for the City of Saint John be, and they are hereby, advised that the said Board of License Commissioners can issue eleven tavern licenses for Prince Ward in the said City of Saint John and no more (38 N.B. Rep. 508). On appeal by the Commissioners to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, that the proceedings did not originate in a superior court, and are not within the exceptions mentioned in sec. 37 of the Supreme Court Act; that they were extra cur sum curi\u0153; and that the order of the court below was not a final judgment within the meaning of sec. 36; the appeal, therefore, did not lie and should be quashed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] on a stated case. The appellants as License Commissioners for the City of St. John, N.B., were charged with the duty of issuing licenses for the sale of liquor in the city under the provisions of the Liquor License Act, C.S.N.B. 1903, ch. 22. An information was laid against them in the police court of the city by the respondent charging them with violation of the Act by granting more licenses than were authoribed in Prince Ward. The prosecution on the information was stayed, the informant and the Commissioners agreeing to state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court of the province on the question raised thereby. The stated case set out various facts affecting the matter and concluded as follows:\n\"The opinion of this honourable court is desired and is respectfully asked to the following question, namely:\n\"How many tavern licenses are the said commissioners authorized by law to issue in Prince Ward, in said City of St. John, the population of said ward being four thousand seven hundred and sixty, as herein stated?\"\nThe case was argued before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and the formal order taken out after judgment was pronounced was that the court, having taken time to consider, doth now order that the Board of License Commissioners for the City of Saint John be, and they are hereby advised that the said Board of License Commissioners can issue eleven tavern licenses for Prince Ward, in the said City of Saint John, and no more.\nThe Commissioners appealed from this order to the Supreme Court of Canada. Skinner K.C. and Earle K.C. for the appellants.\nHazen K.C, Attorney-General of New Brunswick, for the respondent.\nThe objection to the jurisdiction taken by respondent in his factum was not urged at the outset, but was raised by the court and then discussed by counsel.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent, in his factum, takes exception to the jurisdiction of this court. This objection should have been raised by a motion to quash the appeal presented on the first day of the present session of the court (rule 4), and although not insisted upon now the objection cannot be overlooked, as this appeal should never have been taken. The proceedings originated by way of information laid against the defendants, now appellants, in the police court at St. John, and came to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick \"extra cursum curice\" by consent of the parties on a special case stated by Mr. Justice McLeod for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of that court on the construction of a New Brunswick statute (the Liquor License Act, ch. 22, Consolidated Statutes, 1903). The defendants by the said information were charged before the police magistrate of the City of St. John with having issued more tavern licenses for the year 1907 in Prince Ward, in that city, than are allowed by the License Act; and it was by the parties thought desirable that the magistrate, before disposing of the complaint, should be instructed as to the meaning of the Act by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick; and, by these proceedings, we are asked to revise the instruction or advice given by that court. I do not know that, under ordinary circumstances, it would be necessary to do more than to state these facts to justify the dismissal of the appeal. It is apparently necessary, however, for me to say, for the benefit of the parties in this case, that an appeal lies here from the final judgment of the highest court of final resort of the province when the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court (sec. 36) and in the class of cases provided for by section 37 of the Act of which this is not one; and it is difficult to conceive how it could be argued, not successfully, but with any shew of reason, that the instruction or advice given to the magistrate on this special case can be called a final judgment; or that the police magistrate can be described as a superior court (section 36) or a court of first instance possessing concurrent jurisdiction with a superior court (section 37). The Supreme Court en banc advises that, under the statute, the Board of License Commissioners of the City of St. John can issue eleven tavern licenses for Prince Ward and no more. What the effect of that advice may be on the magistrate we are not in a position to say, nor should we be concerned to know. We have been urged to consider and decide the question submitted, or, to state the position more accurately, we are asked to say that we agree with or dissent from the advice given to the magistrate by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on the ground that a question affecting the public is involved. Our jurisdiction cannot rest on such a foundation, and if there was any doubt as to our jurisdiction, which there is not, we could not entertain this appeal: Gully v. Ferdais[2]. By consent of the parties no costs will be granted, although, personally, I would have been of opinion to give effective sanction to rule 4 by condemning the respondent to pay a portion of the costs here.\nGirouard J.\u2014We have no jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the proceedings did not originate in a superior court as required by section 36 of the Supreme Court Act. Secondly, the appeal is not from a final judgment within the meaning of that term in the same section.\nDavies, Idington and Duff JJ. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: C. N. Skinner.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. Douglas Hazen.\n[1] 38 N.B. Rep. 508.\n[2] 30 Can. S.C.R. 330.\n"}

The respondent was the owner of a building, in the City of Montreal, which had been seriously damaged by a fire, and, after attempting to make repairs, had sold it to a contractor, named Dagenais, who was also a defendant in the action. Dagenais had agreed to remove the materials in the ruined building and, while the operation of demolition was in progress, the cornice, which had been insecurely attached by ropes, and a portion of the walls, fell upon the deceased, who was then engaged in the removal of a fence which had been placed round an enclosure upon the sidewalk of the street below, and he died in consequence of the injuries thus received. The negligence charged against the bank was that the necessary precautions for the safety of persons in the vicinity of the ruined building, and required by the city by-laws, had not been taken either by the bank or by Dagenais, who was alleged to have been a contractor employed for the purpose of the demolition of the ruin.\nUpon a verdict by the jury at the trial, judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff for $5,500, against the bank and Dagenais. On an appeal, the Court of King's Bench, by the judgment now appealed from, set aside the judgment of the trial court, in so far as it affected the bank, on the ground that the accident was wholly due to the fault of the purchaser of the building and that he was not an agent or employee of the bank for whose acts it could be held responsible.\nH. J. Elliott K.C. and Beulac for the appellant.\nJ, E. Martin K.C. and Duff for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice agreed that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Girouard J.\u2014Je n'ai aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 confirmer le jugement de la cour d'appel qui me parai\u00eet inattaquable. Je pourrais purement et simplement me contenter d'adopter les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge-en-chef Taschereau; mais, comme la cause est importante, il est peut\u00eatre bon de r\u00e9sumer en quelques mots le point en litige.\nDeux r\u00e8glements de la ville de Montr\u00e9al d\u00e9terminent la mani\u00e8re de faire des d\u00e9molitions de b\u00e2tisses; l'un (No. 260) lorsque ces b\u00e2tisses sont dangereuses et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9es par l'inspecteur; et l'autre (No. 107) lorsqu'il s'agit d'une d\u00e9molition ordinaire dans le but de reconstruire. Il est admis que la b\u00e2tisse en question n'\u00e9tait pas dangereuse et que sa d\u00e9molition n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e par l'inspecteur comme telle. Il s'agit donc d'une construction nouvelle. Un incendie ayant d\u00e9truit le premier \u00e9tage et endommag\u00e9 le deuxi\u00e8me, il fut d'abord question de r\u00e9parer ces dommages et un entrepreneur fut choisi pour l'execution des travaux n\u00e9cessaires. Cet entrepreneur donna avis de son intention, aux d\u00e9sirs des r\u00e8glements. Mais on s'apper\u00e7ut bient\u00f4t qu'il valait mieux d\u00e9molir toute la b\u00e2tisse et en construire une nouvelle plus moderne. A cet effet l'intim\u00e9e vendit tout l'\u00e9difice \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Dagenais, entrepreneur bien connu de Montr\u00e9al. Elle ne garda, bien entendu, aucun contr\u00f4le sur l'entrepreneur, qui, aux termes de l'article 415 du code civil, devint propri\u00e9taire de la dite b\u00e2tisse. Il proc\u00e9da \u00e0 la d\u00e9molition et pendant qu'on \u00e9tait \u00e0 enlever la corniche au haut de l'\u00e9difice, le c\u00e2ble qui la retenait se cassa et la corniche alla tomber sur la t\u00eate d'un ouvrier occup\u00e9 dans le moment \u00e0 \u00e9lever une cl\u00f4ture sur le trottoir. La cour d'appel a decid\u00e9 que l'entrepreneur, propri\u00e9taire de la b\u00e2tisse, \u00e9tait seul responsable et nous croyons qu'elle a eu raison. L'article 1054 du code civil est formel. Le propri\u00e9taire n'est responsable que de la faute de ceux dont il a le contr\u00f4le. On a cit\u00e9 certains arr\u00eats des cours de France o\u00f9 des distinctions sont faites dans le cas o\u00f9 les r\u00e8glements municipaux imposent au propri\u00e9taire certaines pr\u00e9cautions pour \u00e9viter les accidents. On cite aussi l'article 479, par. 4, du code p\u00e9nal; mais nous n'avons aucune semblable disposition soit dans le code civil, soit dans nos lois criminelles. Tout ce que nous avons ce sont les r\u00e8glements municipaux; et le r\u00e8glement No. 107, qui gouverne cette mattiere, est formel. Le devoir d'enlever une cl\u00f4ture et de prendre d'autres mesures de pr\u00e9caution pour \u00e9viter les accidents en cas de d\u00e9molitions et constructions est impos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrepreneur et non pas au propri\u00e9taire. Voir section 2. La section 9 dit \u00e9galement que c'est l'entrepreneur qui est responsable des dommages. Voir Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1869, partie, 2, p. 153.\nJe suis donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the result of the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree this appeal should be dismissed, but cannot say I agree in the reasons given by my brother Girouard J. in notes I have had a chance of perusing.\nIt seems safe to say that there was a sale of material which, so long as undisturbed at the part we are concerned with, was no menace to any one. When the buyer paid his cash instalment of price he was master and no one could or did control him. I hesitate, with great respect, to adopt the opinions of those who go further and place the case as if identical with that of a contractor doing the same work.\nThe difficulty I have is that, when a sale is made, I cannot see how any conditions can be attached to it requiring in the buyer any sort of qualification as to his capacity or equipment for removal of that which he buys, whether a house or other material such as piles of lumber or stone. In the case of the contractor the capacity may well have to be looked to by him letting the work.\nI do not find in the by-laws of Montreal that provision for the case of removal of buildings which was assumed in argument to exist and which public safety needs.\nNor do I see how the stipulations properly made for the buyer assuming all risks could alter the legal quality of what was being contracted for or the consequences thereof.\nThese stipulations were merely the result of abundant caution.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I agree in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Girouard.\nDuff J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Goldstein & Beullac.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Heneker & Duff.\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 232.\n"}

Reference to this lane or passage was made in a deed of sale executed by the owner, in 1865, and the cadastral plan of the municipality, made in 1879, for registration purposes, shewed it as a public road. In 1881, in connection with the registration of charges on the land, the owner made a statutory declaration and gave a notice to the registrar of deeds, as required by the \"Cadastral Act,\" describing the strip of land in question as \"a road 20 feet wide.\" It was also shewn that, during more that thirty years prior to the action, the strip of land had been used as a lane or passage by the general public.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (Q.R. 17 K.B. 60), Idington J. dissenting, that these circumstances constituted complete, clear and unequivocal evidence of the intention of the owners of the beach lot to dedicate the strip of land in question for the purposes of a public highway, that no formal acceptance of such dedication by the corporation of the municipality was necessary to render such dedication effective in favour of the general public, and that, even if there had originally been any limitation reserved as to the use thereof by a special class of persons only, it had become a public highway by reason of long user as such. Although no right of ownership can be affected by cadastral plans, they must, in view of their publicity, be considered as having some probative effect in respect to persons having interests in the lands described therein.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nBy her action, the plaintiff claimed the right to a declaration that a strip of land between St. Lawrence Street, in the Town of L\u00e9vis, and the River St. Lawrence, was by destination and dedication intended for and, by long user, had become a public highway, and asked to have an obstruction removed, and for damages.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court, rendered by Mr. Justice Lemieux, declared the land in question to be a public highway, ordered the defendants to remove the fence which had been placed across it, and that the defendants in warranty, who had taken up the fait et cause of the principal defendant, should indemnify him against the damages, interest and costs which were awarded to the plaintiff.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue upon this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported. G. G. Stuart K.C. for the appellants.\nC. E. Dorion K.C. and Eus\u00e8be Belleau K.C for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014By the action out of which this appeal arises the plaintiff (now respondent) asks for a declaration that a small strip of land leading from St. Lawrence Street, in the Town of L\u00e9vis, towards the River St. Lawrence, is a public highway. The appellant, who sold the property to the defendant, V\u00e9zina, intervened as his warrantor and, taking up the instance in the cause, denied that the strip of land in question was a public road or had ever been used as such. The trial judge held in favour of the plaintiff and, on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, his judgment was affirmed, Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 dissenting.\nThe question at issue is a very narrow one and in my opinion depends largely for its solution upon the terms of a grant of the foreshore over which the road passes made by the Crown to Wm. Rhodes, father of the appellant, by Letters Patent, in 1854.\nAt that time the beach was open to the public. Certain censitaires referred to in the grant, and some of whom are represented by the plaintiff, owned property to the south of the highway now known as St. Lawrence Street, which separated their lands from the River St. Lawrence, at this point both tidal and navigable. It appears by the conditions of the grant that these censitaires, under the impression no doubt that they had, as riparian owners, a claim on the foreshore, sold some beach lots to Rhodes. Further there is evidence that during the high tides of the spring and fall the river crossed the highway and flowed onto the lands to the south. It might possibly be contended on the facts that the censitaires were then riparian owners and entitled as such to a right of access to the river. Lyon v. Fishmongers Co.[2]. However this may be it can at least be said of them, adopting the language of Lord Cairns in Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[3], at page 252, that they had two highways, the one highway being a road or a street, and the other, immediately beyond and abutting upon the road or the street, being a highway by water. It is further proved as a fact that the general public had free access to and from the river from the highway which ran along the shore and in daily contact with the ebb and flow of the tide.\nBriefly stated these were the conditions existing when the grant was made and in the light of these conditions we must construe the grant in which are provisions not usually found in such instruments and evidently inserted for the purpose of meeting the exceptional circumstances, as the effect of the grant must be, if the beach lot was laid out, as contemplated, in building lots, to cut off the right of access and destroy the highway by water.\nThe lot granted by letters patent contains a superficies of 96,198 feet in what is now the Town of L\u00e9vis, immediately opposite the City of Quebec, and proved, as established in this record, a most valuable concession. The money consideration for the grant was \u00a3656 19s. 4d., of which one-quarter was payable in cash and the balance in four equal annual instalments. There are other obligations imposed on the grantee with respect to the building of wharves which all persons are to be permitted to use for the moorage of vessels and to which free access is to be given both from the river and the highway; and finally there is a clause which is for our present purpose the most important and reads as follows:\nProvided always and these our letters patent are granted upon the express condition that our said grantee, his heirs and assigns do and shall renounce and give up all and every claim against and shall hold harmless all and every the censitaires holding lands in the immediate rear of the beach lot hereby granted, for or by reason of any sale or transfer of property by them or any of them heretofore made to our said grantee or of right of property in the said beach lot or any part thereof; and further that, in case the said beach lot shall at any time hereafter be laid out for building lots, a sufficient number of cross-streets shall be left open so as to afford easy communication between the public highroad in rear of the said beach lot and low water mark in front thereof, and that such streets shall be made in the manner and of the dimensions that shall be prescribed by municipal regulation then lawfully established.\nWhat is the meaning of the latter part of this clause? Is it not, under the circumstances to which I have referred, equivalent to a reservation of so much of the beach lot as might be necessary to give, by means of a public highway, easy communication from the public street to the river in case the beach lot is thereafter laid out for building purposes? This appears to me to be very clear. In the first part of the proviso it is made an express condition of the grant that Rhodes renounces and gives up all claims against the censitaires which he may have by reason of the sale made by them to him under the erroneous impression no doubt that the property in the foreshore passed to them under their deeds of concession from the seigneur; then\u2014the private interests of the censitaires being protected\u2014the interests of the general public are safeguarded in the second part. The Crown, as owner of the foreshore, had undoubtedly the right to cut it up and dispose of it as it deemed best; but clearly in so doing it owed a duty to the general public, irrespective of the special rights of the riparian owners to protect them in the enjoyment of the common law right of acc\u00e8s et sortie to the river which they then had and of which they must necessarily be deprived in the contingency then foreseen that the beach might be laid out for building lots. It is not to be assumed that the Crown would be more solicitous for the private interests of certain individuals than for the common law rights of the general public, and there can be no doubt in my mind, reading the whole grant, that it was as clearly the intention of the Crown to protect the right of acc\u00e8s et sortie to the river as it was to effect a settlement of the disputes then existing between Rhodes and the censitaires. That Rhodes so construed his title appears by fair inference from several deeds to which he was a party and by his acquiescence in the use made of the strip of land now in question by the general public during many years. Apparently, at some time previous to 1865, it was decided to lay out the property conveyed by the Crown to Rhodes, or at least that portion of it lying to the east, in building lots, as contemplated by the grant, and in that connection a plan is said to have been made by one O'Brien, land surveyor. This plan was not produced at the trial, although diligent search was made for it by both parties, and there is no direct evidence that it was prepared under the instructions of Mr. Rhodes, but both courts below have come to the conclusion, as warranted by the evidence, that such a plan was made and existed in 1865. In that year, Rhodes, and others who had acquired an interest in the property with him, sold a portion of it to one Simpson, now represented by the respondent, and in the deed of sale the property is described in these words:\nA certain lot or parcel of ground situate and being at the place called Rhodes's Cove, heretofore McCaw's Cove, in the town of L\u00e9vis, containing fifty-nine feet in front and, gradually increasing in width from front to rear until at its extreme depth it measures seventy-six feet by fifty feet in depth, the whole more or less, English measure, bounded in front towards the south-east by the public highway or cove road, in rear toward the north-west by a reserved road or street on one side to the south-west by lot number three sold to the said William Simpson and on the other side to the north-east by a lane or passage of the width of twenty feet between the property above described and that of Benjamin Huot dit Saint Laurent together with the right of way over the said passage in common with the neighbouring proprietors as the said lots are laid down and distinguished under the numbers one and two on the plan of a large extent of property drawn up and prepared by G. P. O'Brien of Quebec, land surveyor, and deposited in the office of Noel Hill Bowen, one of the subscribing notaries.\nThis plan here referred to, known in the record as the O'Brien plan, was evidently from the use made of it in this deed of sale prepared for the purpose of laying out the beach in building lots and if not made under the instructions of Rhodes and his associates is so fully adopted by them and made part of this transaction that they and their successors in title should not be allowed to repudiate it or treat it otherwise than as conclusively binding upon them for all the purposes of the deed. The property sold is described by metes and bounds, it is true, but also by reference to the numbers on the plan which is said to have been deposited of record in the office of one of the subscribing notaries. It would be impossible to identify the plan and the deed more closely. It further appears by the terms used to describe the boundaries of the lot sold that the strip of land now in question is called by the vendors a lane or passage (lane is included in the word road under the Municipal Law of Quebec, art.19, par. 27), and this lane is said to connect the public highroad on the southeast with a reserved road or street on the northwest. The public highroad referred to being the road to the rear of the beach lot and between which and low water mark easy communication must, in the terms of the grant, be given so that this lane is the means of access reserved from the public highway to the river and the only means of access which is proved to exist. It is quite true that the beach lot does not appear to have been actually divided into and sold for building purposes except to a limited extent, but the condition of the grant is that a street is to be left open to afford easy communication between the highroad and low water mark not, as argued here, when the beach lot is divided up and sold, but when it is laid out in building lots.\nNext in the order of time we have the cadastral plan prepared in 1879 by the public officials of the province for registration purposes and on this plan the strip of land is indicated as a public road. I concede that no right of ownership is affected by any error in the cadastral plan; but it is impossible to imagine that this plan which the law requires to be kept in a public office for inspection and correction by parties interested is not to be considered as of some probative effect. It was open to examination and no doubt would and might have been altered if it erroneously represented the conditions then existing.\nFurther, on the 5th of August, 1881, Rhodes made a declaration in writing, as required by the \"Cadastral Act,\" in connection with the renewal of the registration of a ground rent due to him on one of the lots sold to St. Laurent, which forms part of the beach lot, and in that declaration this strip is again described as \"a road 20 feet wide.\"\nWe have, therefore, as the foundation of the theory of dedication: 1st. The grant which in effect provides in certain contingencies which have been held by both courts to have arisen for easy communication from the highroad to the water; 2ndly. The O'Brien plan adopted by Rhodes which purports to lay out the beach in building lots, with this lane or passage marked on it; 3rdly. The deed to Simpson, in September, 1865, with the lane or passage again referred to; 4thly. The cadastral plan on which the strip of land appears as a highway; 5thly. The notice to the registrar in which Rhodes describes the strip of land as a road.\nIn these circumstances, if complete, clear, unequivocal evidence of an intention to dedicate the strip of land is required, have we not got in such a case as this where the land came to the grantee originally burdened with the obligation to give easy communication over it between the public highroad in the rear and low water mark in the front?\nThere is also the uncontroverted evidence of usage by the public, during more than thirty years, of this lane or passage; and if originally it had been reserved for the use of the proprietors and tenants of Rhodes, has it not, by reason of this long usage, become a public highway?\nSee Ancien Denisart, vo. \"chemin,\" no. 11:\nUn chemin particulier devient chemin public par la seule possession du public.\nIdem, par. 3, No. 1:\nLes simples sentiers dont nous parlons dans le paragraphe suivant doivent aussi \u00eatre mis au rang des chemins publics, quand le public est en possession de s'en servir depuis longtemps. It has been argued that Rhodes may have intended by the deed to Simpson to create only a servitude of passage, but that contention fails entirely. Such a servitude, i.e., a real servitude is a charge imposed on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor. Where is the servient and dominant estate here? There is no reference to a particular dominant land.\nPlaniol, vol. 1, p. 590:\nPour qu'il y a\u00eet v\u00e9ritablement servitude, il ne suffit pas qu'un propri\u00e9taire soit g\u00ean\u00e9 dans l'exercise de son droit; il faut qu'il y a\u00eet un fonde dominant. C'est l\u00e0 le point qui doit toujours \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9, si l'on veut \u00e9viter cette confusion.\nMr. Justice Boss\u00e9 relies upon the fact that the dedication was not accepted by the corporation, but this is not necessary; the dedication was not to the corporation, but to the public. There could be a valid acceptance by the public user of the way and, under the Municipal Code of Quebec, a road in use for ten years and divided off on each side from the remaining land, as this was, becomes municipal by mere lapse of time. Art. 749 CM.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGirouard J. agreed with the Chief Justice.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in dismissing this appeal and confirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014In 1854 a patent was issued granting the late Mr. Rhodes what was called therein lot No. 2 defined by metes and. bounds and forming part of the foreshore lying adjacent to a highway, now known as St. Lawrence Street, which, on its side next the foreshore thus granted, skirted the same at high water mark.\nThe frontage of this grant extended 446 feet along this street and ran back therefrom several hundred feet to the low water line of the river.\nTo comply with one of the conditions of the grant, a wharf was built of about thirty-five feet in width running at right angles to the said street some two hundred and fifty feet from the street across the beach and towards the said low water line.\nIt is alleged that next to that wharf three small lots, having frontage of 75 feet altogether on the said street and fifty feet in depth, were laid out and sold, in 1865 or previous thereto. Another lot some distance to the eastward and of thirty-three feet front on the same street had been sold earlier and is No. 7 on later cadastral plan. It is deeper than these others. Next to that on its easterly side was another piece now called No. 6 on that plan.\nThat seems all that had been done up to the 5th September, 1865, or eleven years after the grant, when a deed was made by Rhodes to one Simpson, under whom respondent claims, of a lot, known now as No. 12 on the cadastral plan, having a frontage on the St. Lawrence Street of fifty-nine feet and a depth of fifty feet and widening out so as to be wider in the rear than in front.\nThe configuration of these lots when regard is had to their varying sizes and shapes and depths, indicates they were not the result of any plotting of the ground as a whole or even of any considerable extent of it, but the result of bits having been carved out as occasion required. The reference in the deed last mentioned to lots one and two as appearing on such a plan by one O'Brien is not at all inconsistent with this view. A plan may have been projected but discarded when lots would not sell.\nIf it had been adhered to I think we would have had the fact demonstrated by careful comparison of the contents of all the other deeds and records in any way attributable to Mr. Rhodes instead of being asked to make a few guesses, and indeed guesses inconsistent with the very terms of this one deed.\nIn the absence of evidence of original numbers of lots on either side of it, I, with great respect, fail to see how, as the majority judgment of the court below has it, this land was without a number.\nA space of twenty feet fronting on St. Lawrence Street was thus left between the said lot No. 7 and this Simpson lot.\nThe heirs of Rhodes shortly before this suit sold this space.\nRespondent claims this space had been dedicated as a highway and that she, one of the public, entitled as such to use such highway, had been specially injured beyond the rest of the public by the building erected thereon by the purchaser.\nThe appellants as warrantors of title of the said space have defended to protect their purchaser.\nShe puts her claim relative to the dedication of this space as street in a two-fold way. She says Rhodes was bound by the conditions of this grant to furnish a cross-street, and although conceding he was not bound to locate it in this exact spot yet as he left a space for a passage way it must be attributed to him that he intended such passage way as part fulfilment of the obligation resting upon him and, hence, to be used as a public highway, and that in any event he intended to and did dedicate this space as a public highway and again that by reason of the condition imposed upon him we can the more readily infer such intention.\nI think, whether we consider the question raised to be one of dedication or of the discharge of a duty cast upon the grantee by virtue of the terms of the patent granting him a certain area of foreshore it must be determined by what we find to have been the intention of the grantee.\nThe condition in question amongst numerous other provisos and conditions contained in the patent is the following:\nProvided always, and these our letters patent are granted upon the express condition, that our said grantee, his heirs and assigns do and shall renounce, quit and give up all and every claim against and shall hold harmless all and every the censitaires holding land in the immediate rear of the teach lot hereby granted, for or by reason of any sale or transfer of property by them or any of them heretofore made to our said grantee or of right of property in the said beach lot or any part thereof, and further that in case the said beach lot shall at any time hereafter be laid out for building lots, a sufficient number of cross-streets shall be left open so as to afford easy communication between the public highroad in rear of the said beach lot and low water mark in front thereof, and that such streets shall be made in the manner and of the dimensions that shall be prescribed by municipal regulations then lawfully established.\nLet us consider the peculiar terms of this condition. No one arguing seemed able to explain the purpose of the first part. Possibly the intended cross-streets had some relation to the rights referred to and never had any relation to the rights of the general public. Passing that and assuming that the convenience or possible right of the general public was within the scope of the purpose of this provision for cross-streets when was it to become operative? It is plainly written that it was only in case the said beach lot shall at any time hereafter be laid out for building lots that the cross-streets were to be provided. No such thing has happened. The trifling grants made for building lots are, as a whole, but a mere fractional part of the beach lot which, taking this literally, means the whole lot.\nRead, however, not literally, but in a broader way as merely anticipating some substantial approximation of the whole being laid out in building lots, necessitating and entitling the public to demand the cross-streets in order that they would not be inconvenienced, can any one, looking at what happened, conceive of such a provision as this alley afforded, as meant, to meet such a case as that?\nPlainly the scope and purpose of the whole grant was formed upon a vision of immediate or early realization of something that has not even yet come to pass.\nThe bright outlook of 1854 probably became overcast and the hoped for, expansive, busy harbour turned out a dream.\nIt seems to me absurd to attribute to any sane man the intention of laying out, as in conformity with what was expected and provided for, a cross-street formed in such a zigzag fashion as this alleged cross-street.\nCan any one imagine such a thing deliberately presented either to the municipal council or the officers of the Crown for approval had the events calling therefor arisen?\nBut if the shape of the thing is not of itself enough to prove the absurdity let us see what was stipulated for in the condition. These cross-streets were to have been made in the manner and of the dimensions that shall be prescribed by municipal regulations then lawfully established.\n23 Vict. ch. 61, sec. 40, sub-secs. 10 and 11, are as follows:\n10. No front road, opened after the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, shall be less than thirty-six feet French measure, in width, between the lines of the fences on each side thereof;\n11. No by-road and no road leading to a banal mill opened after the day last aforesaid, shall be less than twenty-six feet French measure, in width, between the lines of the fences on each side thereof.\nThese sections continued to be law until the Municipal Code of the Province of Quebec, which slightly modified them in terms used in the sections 768 to 770 thereof which do not, however, touch the case in hand.\nThe law was so continued by that code till the law, as amended by 53 Vict. ch. 47, required roads in cities, towns and villages to be sixty-six feet wide. Of course special legislation or leave given, as once was provided for by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, are to be excepted, but these are not in question here.\nI am, with respect, quite unable to understand how anything done, as all that was done, which is relied upon here for dedication of a street can be held such or at all in execution of the condition of the deed in face of the express statutory requirements shewing it would be contrary to this law and thus to the above cited proviso of the grant.\nIt is, however, seriously urged that the terms of the said deed to Simpson imply an intention to dedicate.\nBut for the adoption of the argument I should have thought such an inference to be absolutely inconceivable. I quote the following from the description in said deed: Bounded in front, towards the south-east by the public highway or cove road, in rear towards the north-west by a reserved road or street on one side to the south-west by lot number three sold to the said William Simpson and on the other side to the north-east by a lane or passage of the width of twenty feet between the property above described and that of Benjamin Huot dit Saint Laurent together with the right of way over the passage in common with the neighbouring proprietors as the said lots are laid down and distinguished under the numbers one and two on the plan of a large extent of property drawn up and prepared by G. P. O'Brien.\nThe cove road is now St. Laurent Street. The reserved \"road or street\" in the rear is thirty-six feet in width, being the then usual width of streets. Clearly it was intended as the words and width imply to have this reserved road become a permanent street. But when the description comes to the north-east side and refers to this land in question the words used are changed to read \"by a lane or passage of the width of twenty feet.\" Clearly something different from the other road or street is meant and the width is what did not conform to statutory municipal widths as the other might fairly claim to have done. And, moreover, when we read further and find that there is specially assigned to the grantee a right of way thereon in common with the neighbouring proprietors of the said lots its use when thus restricted is quite inconsistent with the notion of absolute abandonment to the whole public. If this latter had been intended it would have been so much easier to have used the same language as in the preceding description of the rear boundary. Besides, how can we suppose such difference of widths intended for these respective streets?\nThe desire to exclude all the public therefrom but those desiring and requiring communication with the limited number of the neighbours or any of them or they with others beyond their respective premises, is quite conceivable and that such a narrow passage ought not to be thrown open to general use hindering its ready use by those few evidently intended to benefit by it is also so.\nFor reasons one may suspect this right not being open we are asked to imply something else.\nIn many ways the expected development fell short. We may guess many things as to these plans for development, but this guess of including the alleged street now in question as part of a public highway seems the most hopeless of many that are open to one reading the evidence and plan which probably presents but a fraction of what Mr. O'Brien had begun.\nBy reason of the obvious failure of the scheme as a whole, and of demands for building lots there, the general convenience of the public never had been disturbed for want of cross-streets. If this outlet had been occupied, and all the lands Rhodes alienated had been built upon, it would have withdrawn only about a third of the frontage from public use. But to this day lot 7 is unoccupied and probably nothing was built on in 1865. The wharf was and is no doubt travelled over. The one half of the entire frontage granted Rhodes has never been laid out into lots or occupied. Hence it never occurred to anybody to ask for a cross-street or to the council to adopt this as a cross-street, much less to Rhodes, in 1865, to dedicate such a street as alleged by such curious methods as alleged.\nThe next thing claimed to be important in support of the respondents' contention is that in the renewal of registration of a ground rent to comply with new enactments he on the 5th August, 1881, referred to the said lot No. 7 as bounded to the south-west by a road of \"20 feet wide.\" This is not inconsistent with the road being of the private character originally indicated, though if followed up and coupled with other things it might start a new basis for an express case of dedication or be held as an adoption in that sense of previous public use as quite justifiable and in accord with his intention to dedicate.\nThe fact is, however, even this equivocal description arose from a palpable error in following some one else's error, for which Mr. Rhodes was not responsible, and a few days later his renewal of his registration of his rights resulting from the letters patent is made in such a way as to shew he claimed this very land and other parts as being one lot, \"8a,\" as they appear on the cadastral plan.\nBesides all this, from 1873 down we have evidence that this lot thus named \"8a\" was assessed and taxes thereon paid by Mr. Rhodes and his heirs or representatives, almost, if not altogether, continuously.\nThis is quite inconsistent with a settled purpose to dedicate and with the accidental use of the word road as an indication that he had already dedicated.\nIn 1879, or thereabout, the Intercolonial Railway was built through and along this beach and altered, no doubt, the original purposes and plans of Rhodes and others, respecting these properties. Yet no new building lots seem to have been demanded or need for the cross-streets arisen.\nThe contractor for this railway, which was built by the Crown, left an opening in the trestle work carrying that railway along the beach.\nNobody pretends this was done at the request of Mr. Rhodes. It was doubtless done at the request of his grantees or their assigns. Their doing so was quite in accord with an extension of the rights reserved to them as shewn by the deed to Simpson.\nHow it created any right in the general public or is evidence in itself of dedication I am unable to understand.\nLastly, we are asked to find that such general use of this alleged road was for a long, continuous period made by the public with the knowledge of Mr. Rhodes as to furnish proof of dedication.\nI should be sorry to deprive any man of his property by giving the effect claimed to such meagre evidence of general and continuous user by the general public as we have here. Nor as I understand would any one else but for the supposed dedication being held conformable to the above-quoted proviso in the grant despite the obvious conflict therewith already referred to.\nIndeed, to hold this evidence as sufficient for such a purpose would be a menace to the rights of many good-natured people whose property has been for years crossed without consideration of such an effect as possible.\nThe proprietor did not live where this alleged crossing took place. No one testifies he ever was aware of it.\nIt is conceded this foreshore was used as such spaces, when ungranted and unoccupied, always are used by the public or at all events those of the public having access thereto.\nDoubtless this use was expected to continue and continued after the grant as freely as before on ail parts thereof unoccupied by grantees of Rhodes.\nUntil the building of the Intercolonial Railway the public had, as well as over this, free access, as open as ever, over the remaining unalienated frontage and the wharf to reach the river.\nThe municipal council, in or about the year 1868, widened and improved St. Lawrence Street, and in doing so erected a sea-wall, so to speak, to prevent the street from being inundated.\nAt the point where this alleged 20 feet wide street, which it is claimed was becoming dedicated by virtue of this user, joined this St. Lawrence Street the wall so erected was about six feet high above the land in question and one desiring to step from St. Lawrence Street on to this new street had that difficulty to overcome, or jump down into a hole.\nNay, more, it was so dangerous that a barrier was erected, consisting, it is said, of two oars nailed up at this entrance, to prevent passers-by falling into the cavity.\nThose, therefore, desiring to use and thereby accept for the public this proffered dedication had to jump over or go round this barrier. They did the latter by means of crossing the end of lots 7 or 12. In course of time the rubbish thrown there or drifted by the tide there partly filled up the hole and made it easier of access, and hence we have varying estimates of its depth.\nIt seems a pretty strong thing to impute upon and only upon such evidence an intention on the part of the proprietor to dedicate.\nBut what of the acceptance necessary to complete dedication?\nThe council usually represents the public in relation to such acceptance. They did not do so here.\nAgain, when the user in time has by a continuous assertion of such right taken on a definite form so that apparently a public way has been created, those concerned are not usually slow to ask their municipal council to improve what seems to have grown by common consent to be a public road.\nNobody ever thought of such a thing in relation to this alleged road. Why? It needed certainly something done to facilitate travel if that travel had really existed which ought to evidence either acceptance of a dedication by long use or abandonment of property thereby. Is it not obvious that either the travel did not exist to justify such a conclusion or that every one knew it was a mere piece of private property over which only some persons could, as of right, pass, and that all the travel done by others beyond these was of the trifling character that would not warrant either the council to assume it or any one to ask them to assume it and fill up the space so as to make it bear some resemblance to a public way.\nAll this time the tide is going in and out over this alleged highway and nobody caring until some person recently in connection with some work on the Intercolonial Railway saw fit to fill it up level with the street and render it travellable.\nInasmuch as no point was made and argued of the peculiar nature of the title Mr. Rhodes got as grantee of the foreshore (see the case of Lord Fitzhardinge v. Purcell[4]), I have not rested my conclusion upon such considerations, but I may be permitted to doubt if there ever could have been a dedication in the ordinary sense of this land for a public highway, and if there ever could be invoked by the respondent (even if not impliedly restricted to a user in common with the specified neighbours) any such rights as she asserts except by and through the intervention of the Attorney-General by way of insisting upon the due observance of the proviso above quoted from the grant.\nHad the need for \"easy communication,\" which is the gist of the proviso, arisen and such a proceeding been taken by the Attorney-General, how could Rhodes have answered it by alleging or tendering this zigzag space only twenty feet wide at the place in question as an \"easy means of communication.\"\nSuch are the several, and as I find insufficient, grounds of the claim when each is taken in detail.\nAnd if taken as a whole I fail to see how they can found in law such a claim as set up by the respondent.\nI therefore conclude the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in all the courts below.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice.\nDuff J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Belleau, Belleau & Belleau\n[1] Q.R. 17 K.B. 60.\n[2] 1 App. Cas. 662.\n[3] L.R. 7 H.L. 243.\n[4] (1908) 2 Ch. 139.\n"}

When F.'s work was done he obtained an order from T. on the owner in the following terms: \"Please pay F. the sum of $705, and charge to my account on building, Lucknow Street.\" F. took the order to the owner who agreed to pay if the architect certified that the work had been performed. F. and T. saw the owner and architect together shortly after and on being informed by the latter that the account was proper and there were funds to pay it the owner told F. that it would be all right and retained the order when F. went away. F. filed no mechanic's lien, but other sub-contractors did the next day, and T. assigned in insolvency. In an action by F. against the owner:\nHeld Davies J. dissenting, that there was a novation of the debt due from the owner to T.; that it was not merely an agreement by the owner to answer to F. for T\u2019s debt nor was the order to be treated as a bill of exchange and accepted as such.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial and dismissing the action.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nMellish K.C. for the appellant.\nF. H. Bell, for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nAccepting as he did implicitly the appellant's version of the facts, in which finding I agree, the inferences to be drawn therefrom permit of holding what took place to be a novation.\nIt would have puzzled the appellant to have maintained an action against Thompson after leaving his order with the respondent and accepting in its stead his undertaking to pay the amount.\nIf Zwicker instead of Thompson had become insolvent shortly after what transpired, it would have been most unjust to have held Thompson liable.\nWhat was intended by all the parties was that Zwicker should assume the debt and Thompson be no longer liable. Their language and their acts make this abundantly clear.\nThere was never any purpose or intention of appellant or the others that he should look to Zwicker as a surety to answer the debt, default or miscarriage of another; nor did any one expect him to treat the order as a bill of exchange and accept it in the sense of accepting such a bill.\nHe was to receive and accept it as a voucher for the purposes of the future adjustment of accounts between himself and Thompson, and so accepted and retained it.\nThe order might well be held also as an equitable assignment of part of the debt due or accruing due from respondent to Thompson and as having been assigned by appellant to and accepted by respondent as the consideration for his promise to pay the appellant the amount it represented.\nThe retention by respondent of the order is consistent with either of these conclusions and apparently inconsistent with any other except speculations receiving but little support in the evidence.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014It is quite clear, I think, that unless the conversations between plaintiff and defendant can be so construed as to amount to a \"novation\" the action cannot be maintained. As I differ from my colleagues on the point I have gone again most carefully over the evidence and am more fully confirmed in the impression made on my mind by the oral argument that there never was any such clear and unequivocal promise made by the defendant as is necessary to found a novation upon. I cannot see when or how Thompson, the contractor, was released from his liability to Farquhar, his sub-contractor, nor am I able to understand on what evidence it can be held that Thompson released the defendant.\nSo far from the promise made by Zwicker to the plaintiff being a clear, absolute and unequivocal one to pay the money it seems to me to have been clearly a conditional one dependent upon the money being found to be due to Thompson, the contractor. The order drawn upon Zwicker by his contractor Farquhar reads: \"Pay Farquhar Bros. $705 and charge to my account on building Lucknow St.\" The statement of plaintiff which the trial judge accepted and relied upon was that defendant after consulting with his architect told him \"it was all right.\" Now, I can only understand that statement as at the utmost amounting to a promise to pay the money in terms of the order, namely, out of the moneys coming to Thompson. As a fact, it appeared that there was not any money then actually due and payable by Zwicker to his contractor owing to the condition in which the work then was, and the architect on being asked the question how much money was due on the contract at the time Thompson and Farquhar applied to him for a certificate, answered: \"Presuming the contract had to be completed which it was not there would be I think somewhere between $ 200 and $ 300 due, that is on the whole contract.\" The day following the giving of the alleged promise Thompson's sub-contractors filed mechanics' liens for the several amounts due them. Thompson assigned, and consequently the fund out of which the order requested defendant to pay plaintiff and which all parties clearly must have understood the promise such as it was to relate to, never existed.\nApart from the question of novation the action is clearly one which cannot be maintained because the promise was merely one to pay another man's debt and there was no consideration for it and it was not in writing. An attempt was made to shew some consideration by reference to a few words of conversation relating to the filing by plaintiff of a mechanic's lien and a postponement by him of doing so, but as all such conversation was subsequent to the alleged promise it was clear it could not be treated as the consideration for the promise, and even if so treated the absence of writing would be fatal. If authority was needed on this branch of the case I should think Liversidge v. Broadbent (1) conclusive.\n(1) 4 H. & 1N 603. On the whole, I would confirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia agreeing, as I do substantially, with the reasons of Mr. Justice Meagher and would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. H. Fulton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. H. Bell.\n"}

Irving (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1908: November 12; 1908: December 15.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Davies, Idington, Maclennan, and Duff JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Supreme Court Act\u2014Duty or fee\u2014Interest in land\u2014Future rights.\nUnder a by-law of the defendant company every person desiring to enter the park was required to pay a fee for admission. An action was brought for a declaration as to the right of the company to exact payment of such fee from the lessee of land in the park.\nHeld, that the matter did not relate to the taking of a \u201ccustomary or other duty or fee\u201d nor to \u201ca like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights\u201d under sub-sec. (d) of sec. 48 R.S.C. [1906] nor was \u201cthe title to real estate or some interest therein\u201d in question under sub-sec. (a). There was, therefore, no appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in such action (16 Ont. L.R. 386).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff is lessee of certain land in Grimsby Park under a lease from the company and brought this action to have it declared that he is entitled to access to the premises demised without payment of the fee for admission exacted, under a by-law of the company, from all persons desiring to enter the park. The trial judge and Court of Appeal held that the company could not compel him to pay such admission fee and the company sought to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to that effect.\nShepley K.C., for the appellant on the question of jurisdiction being raised by the court, referred to Chamberland v. Fortier[2]; Rouleau v. Pouliot[3]; and Larivi\u00e9re v. School Commissioners of Three Rivers[4], contending that the matter in question related to \u201ca customary or other duty or fee\u201d and was appealable under sec. 48, sub-sec. (d) of R.S.C., [1906]. He claimed, also, that the appeal would lie under sub-sec. (a) as title to an interest in land was in question.\nThe court reserved judgment on the question of jurisdiction and the merits of the appeal were argued.\nKilmer K.C., appeared for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The appellant company, incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act, own and control a tract of land called \u201cGrimsby Park,\u201d which they had sub-divided into lots according to a registered plan and upon which plan streets and avenues are laid out.The respondent, plaintiff, is the assignee of the lessee for 999 years of one of these lots and has his summer residence upon it. The lease was dated in 1885.\nThe park is surrounded by a fence, and access to it can only be had from outside through certain gates.\nThe company, claiming to act under a statute amending their charter enacted before the lease under which the plaintiff claims was granted, passed, in 1902, a by-law exacting the admission fee now in dispute which was in the nature of a toll at the gate or entrance to the park, and claimed that the plaintiff and his family were liable to pay such fee or toll.\nAt the close of the trial brought to test the claim,\nit was agreed on both sides that the whole question to be determined in this action is whether the plaintiff is entitled to an entrance at the place originally indicated in the plan or at the new entrance of Grand Avenue, or at some other place,\nand, as I understand it, entitled to such entrance without payment of fees.\nThe question arises whether or not, in such a case, we have any jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nTwo sub-sections of the section 48 of our \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d R.S.C., 1906, ch. 139, defining the appeal to this court in cases from the Province of Ontario, were relied upon: First, where\n(a) the title to real estate or some interest therein is in question:\u2014\nSecondly, where\n(d) the matter in question relates to the taking of an annual or other rent, customary or other duty or fee, or a like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights.\nWe were all of opinion at the argument that the right of appeal could not be maintained under sub- section (d). The fee in this case demanded as an admission fee was, obviously, not of a \u201cgeneral or public nature affecting public rights\u201d within the meaning of those words in the Act. It was, on the contrary, simply an entrance fee to a private park, and stands on the same ground as fees charged for entrance to music halls and theatres or to athletic or sporting grounds or courses. Compare Larivi\u00e9re v. School Commissioners of Three Rivers[5], at p. 726.\nThe more serious question was whether it could be held as coming within the cases where the title to real estate or some interest therein was in question.\nBut, in this appeal, there was no question directly involving the title of either the plaintiff or defendant to the respective lands they claimed to own or of their interest in those lands.\nThe sole question was whether the defendant company was entitled, under the statute, to pass a by-law charging their lessees entrance or admission fees to their leased premises within the defendants\u2019 park.\nDid the statute permit them to pass a by-law exacting such a fee and, on proper construction of the by-law they had passed, did it extend to the plaintiff?\nSuch questions, which are the substantial ones on this appeal, may involve indirectly a determination of the plaintiff\u2019s rights of access as a lessee to the lands leased to him. They could not, in my opinion, be fairly said to present a case where \u201cthe title to real estate or some interest therein was in question.\u201d\nHis right of access to his lands was not denied any more than his title. It was the right of the company, under the statute and by-law, to impose the burden of a fee upon that right of access. I would quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction but, under the circumstances, no motion to quash having been made, without costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants seek, by virtue of alleged legislative authority given them, to prevent the respondent reaching a house he has in the appellants\u2019 park, unless he or those going there pay an entrance fee to help to support the keeping up of the park in which the respondent has, in common with others, some privileges.\nThe question is raised whether or not, when the Court of Appeal for Ontario has held the appellants\u2019 contention unfounded, an appeal will lie to this court.\nThe title of the respondent to the house is unquestioned.\nIt was held in this court, so long ago as the case of Wineberg v. Hampson[6], that the merely raising of a question of a right of servitude would not give it jurisdiction.\nIt was observed in coming to that decision that, in the earlier case of Wheeler v. Black[7], such a case had been heard, because no attention had been called to the question of jurisdiction.\nThis case raises a claim on the part of the respondent of free entry over another\u2019s land to reach his own and seems, therefore, to fall within the rule thus laid down so far as the right to appeal might be rested on sub-section (a) of section 48, which deals with title to real estate or interest therein.\nIt is true that the words \u201cinterest therein\u201d did not appear in the same connection, in relation to appeals from Quebec definitely settled by the said decision, as in this section, but I do not think, as used in this section, they cover or were intended to cover cases of servitude or easement.\nThen, can the jurisdiction to entertain this appeal be rested on the ground that future rights will be bound?\nThe jurisdiction to entertain cases of servitude arising in Quebec was later (when the \u201cSupreme Court Act\u201d had been amended), recognized as falling within the amended words\nand other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\nSo long as the Act remained unamended and, in this regard read \u201con such like matters,\u201d etc., instead of, as now, \u201cand other matters,\u201d etc., the prevailing rule was to reject appeals based on mere right or denial of right of servitude.\nSince that small but important amendment was made, questions arising in Quebec and turning upon a right of servitude, have been held appealable as simply concerning \u201cmatters or things where rights in future might be bound.\u201d\nBut, can we, in Ontario cases, turn to and rest the right upon section 48, sub-section (d) of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d where the language is so different? I do not think, having regard to the ruling in Wineberg v. Hampson[8], that section (d) helps the appellants.\nWe find therein the expression \u201cor a like demand\u201d which refers us to the preceding part of the sub-section as the key to what is intended. The sub-section reads as follows:\u2014\n48 (d).\u2014The matter in question relates to the taking of an annual or other rent, customary or other duty or fee, or a like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights. Can we say this case raises a question of an annual or other rent? Or, can we assert it to be a claim of customary or other duty or fee?\nIt does not seem to fall, when we have regard to its origin, within any of these, and still less when we try to see if it is\nof a like demand of a general or public nature affecting future rights.\nThe cases of local assessments, annuities and future financial results incidentally flowing from, but not directly the result of, a judgment seem to deny this. See, amongst others, the following: O\u2019Dell v. Gregory[9]; McKay v. Township of Hinchinbrooke[10]; Waters v. Manigault[11]; Macdonald v. Galivan[12]; Banque du Peuple v. Trottier[13]; Raphael v. Maclaren[14].\nThe words used are identical with those which define in R.S.O. [1897] ch. 48, sec. 1, the right to appeal to the Privy Council\u2014certainly never meant to support such an appeal as this.\nOur jurisdiction must be clear and, being statutory, must be made by the words of the statute to appear clear.\nThere is less reason to put a strained meaning on its words to give a jurisdiction in order to determine something fancied to be of great importance, when we find such ample provision as in sub-section (e) for appeal here by way of leave, either here or in the Ontario Court of Appeal.\nIt seems the appeal must be quashed, but without costs, as the objection was not taken earlier. MACLENNAN J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Macdonald, Shepley, Middleton & Donald.\nSolicitors for the respondent: DuVernet, Raymond, Jones, Ross & Ardagh.\n[1] 16 Ont.

They also asked that an agreement under which the makers were to become liable for $3,000 be declared null. The two actions were tried together and judgment given for the plaintiff in the action on the note while the action in warranty was dismissed. On appeal from the latter judgment:\nHeld, that the amount in dispute was $2,000, the value of the note sued on; that the costs of the action in warranty could not be added and without them the sum of \u00a3500 was not in controversy even if interest and costs in the main action were added; the appeal, therefore, did not lie.\nHeld, also, that the agreement which the plaintiffs in warranty sought to avoid was only a collateral matter to the issues raised on the appeal and could not be considered in determining the amount in dispute.\nInterest after the commencement of the action, unless specially claimed as damages, cannot be added to the amount claimed in the declaration in determining the amount in controversy for the purposes of giving jurisdiction upon an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMOTION for approval of security and to affirm the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal. The motion was by way of appeal from the decision of the registrar in chambers denying the right of appeal.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nIn refusing the application in chambers the registrar stated the reasons for his decision, as follows:\n\"The Registrar.\u2014This is an application to me as a judge in chambers to allow the security upon an appeal to the Supreme Court from a judgment of the Court of Review. A similar application to a judge of the court appealed from was refused and I understand from the counsel it includes a motion to affirm the jurisdiction of the court under rule one. The proceedings commenced by a writ issued on the 3rd of August, 1907, by the Bank of Hochelaga against the present plaintiffs and defendant who were made defendants in that action. A promissory note for $2,000 was made by the present plaintiffs in favour of the present defendant and by him discounted with said bank. Upon the action being instituted by the Bank of Hochelaga, the present plaintiffs, on the 17th of August following, issued a writ against the present defendant in an action en garantie; and subsequently the two actions were joined by an order of the court. In the present action, the plaintiff's declaration is as follows:\n\"Les demandeurs en garantie d\u00e9clarent:\u2014 \"1\u00b0 Qu'ils ont re\u00e7u signification ces jours derniers d'une action de la part de la Banque d'Hochelaga, corps politique et incorpor\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, demandant le recouvrement d'une somme de $2,000, montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour un billet promissoire sign\u00e9 par les demandeurs en garantie, en date du 24 avril, 1907, \u00e0 l'ordre de Godfroy Langlois, \u00e0 deux mois de date, avec $2.54 frais de prot\u00eat, ainsi qu'il appert \u00e0 une copie de la d\u00e9claration du bref portant le No. 3271 des dossiers de la dite cour sup\u00e9rieure;\n\"2\u00b0 Que le dit billet qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti et livr\u00e9 par les demandeurs en garantie au pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9fendeur en garantie par erreur et sans consid\u00e9ration aucune d'une mani\u00e8re ill\u00e9gale, le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie ayant re\u00e7u le billet en paiement partiel pour c\u00e9der des droits dans une certaine compagnie appel\u00e9e The Quebec & Ontario Cobalt Mining Co., alors qu'il n'avait aucun droit valable et l\u00e9gal et qu'il a ainsi rien c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux demandeurs en garantie;\n\"3\u00b0 Que le dit d\u00e9fendeur en garantie n'a aucun droit au paiement du dit billet, qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas justifiable de n\u00e9gocier le dit billet ni d'en obtenir le recouvrement;\n\"4\u00b0 Que de d\u00e9fendeur en garantie est tenu de rembourser le montant du dit billet et de rembourser et garantir les demandeurs en garantie au cas, o\u00f9 ces derniers seraient condamn\u00e9s et forc\u00e9s d'acquitter le dit billet envers la demanderesse principale;\n\"Pourquoi les demandeurs en garantie concluent \u00e0 ce que l'action soit maintenue et \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie soit tenu d'intervenir dans l'action intent\u00e9e contre les dits demandeurs en garantie pour la demanderesse principale; \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie soit tenu d'acquitter et d'indemniser les demandeurs en garantie de toute condamnation qui pourrait \u00eatre port\u00e9e contre eux par suite de la dite action en principal, int\u00e9r\u00eat et frais, tant en demandant qu'en d\u00e9fendant, accrus et \u00e0 accro\u00eetre, et en particulier \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie soit condamn\u00e9 aux d\u00e9pens de la pr\u00e9sente action; et de plus \u00e0 ce que le billet susdit soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, obtenu irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et sans consid\u00e9ration; \u00e0 ce que les conventions qui ont pu intervenir entre les parties au sujet du dit billet y faisant partie soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es ill\u00e9gales et faites sans consid\u00e9ration.\n\"To this the defendant filed the following defence:\n\"Pour d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration des demandeurs en garantie, le d\u00e9fendeur en garantie dit:\n\"1\u00b0 Il admet l'all\u00e9gation 1\u00e8re de la d\u00e9claration des demandeurs en garantie;\n\"2\u00b0 Il nie l'all\u00e9gation 2e de la dite d\u00e9claration;\n\"3\u00b0 Il nie l'all\u00e9gation 3e de la dite d\u00e9claration;\n\"4\u00b0 Il nie Pall\u00e9gation 4e de la dite d\u00e9claration; du reste l'action en garantie ne compete pas aux demandeurs en garantie.\n\"Pourquoi le. d\u00e9fendeur en garantie conclut au renvoi de la dite action des demandeurs en garantie avec d\u00e9pens.\n\"The judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Martineau sets out the facts which were adduced in the evidence, and from his judgment it would appear that the note in question was given pursuant to an agreement for the transfer by the defendant to the plaintiffs of certain rights in a mining company for the sum of $ 3,000, and the dispute between the parties was as to the nature of the rights so transferred. It was alleged that these rights were set out in a document which had been in the possession of the plaintiff Labrosse. Labrosse denied having the writing and desired at the trial to give parol evidence of its contents. This was objected to by the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff had not sufficiently accounted for its non-production, and the objection was maintained by the court.\n\"After hearing evidence the trial judge upheld the agreement and consequently dismissed the action en garantie, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review.\n\"It is from the latter judgment that the plaintiffs now desire to appeal.\n\"The question then is: Does an appeal lie to the Supreme Court in this case under section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which reads as follows:\n\"40. In the Province of Quebec an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the Superior Court in Review where that court confirms the judgment of the court of first instance, and its judgment is not appealable to the Court of King's Bench, but is appealable to His Majesty in Council?\n\"An appeal to His Majesty in Council under article 69 of the Code of Civil Procedure is given by sub-section 3, 'in all cases wherein the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of five hundred pounds sterling.' In the present action the plaintiffs claim that the amount in dispute is $3,000 payable by them to the defendant under said agreement, and in the alternative claim that by adding interest and costs to the $2,000 judgment obtained against them by the Banque d'Hochelaga, the amount in dispute exceeds five hundred pounds sterling.\n\"As to the first contention I am of the opinion that looking at the pleadings the amount of the dispute is the note for $2,000 upon which judgment was obtained by the Banque d'Hochelaga against the parties to this action. No distinct issue is raised on the record as to the validity of the agreement; in fact it is not referred to in the pleadings; and even if the plaintiffs are correct in alleging that the result of the present judgment is to preclude them from setting up in any other action the invalidity or illegality of the agreement, this is a matter collateral to the present issue and an incident resulting therefrom which cannot be taken into consideration in determining the amount in dispute. A statement of the law on this point contained in the decision of Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[1], it appears to me, applies. There the court said:\n\" 'It is settled law that neither the probative force of a judgment nor its collateral effects nor any contingent loss that a party may suffer by reason of a judgment are to be taken into consideration when our jurisdiction depends upon the pecuniary amount or upon any of the subjects mentioned in section 29 (now 46) of the 'Supreme Court Act.'\n\"I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs did not establish that the interest and costs added to the $2,000 note brings their claim up to five hundred pounds sterling.\n\"The costs in the action of the Bank of Hochelaga against them would have been trifling had they not set up a special defence that the bank was simply a pr\u00eate-nom for the present defendant. The amount in dispute in the present action cannot be more than the amount of the judgment obtained by the Bank of Hochelaga and there cannot be added thereto any costs of the present action for the purpose of bringing the amount in dispute up to five hundred pounds sterling.\n\"On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, as was the judge below, that this case is not appealable to the Supreme Court.\"\nOn renewal of the application, before the court, by way of appeal from the registrar's decision.\nJ. A. Ritchie, supported the motion.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a motion by way of appeal from a judgment of the registrar in chambers refusing, on the ground that the sum involved was below the appealable amount, to allow the appellant to give security (sec., 75 \"Supreme Court Act\") and also declining to affirm the jurisdiction of this court, under Rule 1.\nThe facts, so far as we can gather them from the material before us, are briefly these.\nLanglois sold to Labrosse and another his rights in a mining company called \"The Quebec and Ontario Cobalt Mining. Company,\" and, in connection with that sale, received their promissory note for $2,000, which he apparently discounted with the Hochelaga Bank. The note not being paid at maturity, the bank brought action against the makers and payee and, during the pendency of that suit, Labrosse et al. sued their co-defendant, Langlois, in warranty and, by their conclusions, prayed that he, having obtained the note without consideration, be condemned to guarantee them in debt, interest and costs against any judgment that might intervene in the suit of the bank. On the application of the parties, the two suits were joined and tried together and, in the result, judgment was rendered in favour of the bank against all the defendants and the action in warranty by Labrosse et al. was dismissed with costs. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review. The amount of the condemnation in the main action, according to the figures set out by the appellant in his petition, is for capital $2,002.50; interest from July, 1907; and costs to the bank, $182.79, and of Labrosse et al. $146.55. To these sums the appellant adds the costs of the action in warranty in the Superior Court and the Court of Review, which bring the amount up to $2,970.59. It nowhere appears and we have no means of ascertaining how much costs were incurred or how much interest had accrued at the date of the institution of the action in warranty, August 27th, 1907.\nBy section 40 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" and article 68, section 3, of the Quebec Code of Procedure, as it read before the recent amendments, there is an appeal here if the matter in dispute exceeds the sum of \u00a3 500 sterling, and the question to be decided now is: In ascertaining the appealable amount, are interest and costs to be included in the computation?\nThis question has not, so far as I have been able to ascertain, been previously considered by this court, except as to interest in Dufresne v. Guevremont[2], and Bresnan v. Bisnaw[3].\nWhatever may be said as to the costs in the main action and the interest on the note sued for in the action in warranty, it is quite certain that the costs in the action in warranty in the Superior Court and the Court of Review cannot be added to the amount of the note in estimating the principal sum. Bank of New South Wales v. Owston[4]; and Quebec Fire Assurance Go. v. Anderson[5]. In Doorga Doss Chowdry v. Ramanauth Chowdry[6], Lord Chelmsford said:\nThe costs of a suit are no part of the subject matter in dispute and cannot be used for the purpose you seek; if they were allowed to be added to the principal sum claimed, it would be in the power of every litigant, by swelling the costs, to bring any suit up to the appealable value.\nAgain, in Great Western Ry. Co. of Canada v. Braid[7], it was held that costs incurred by a losing party cannot be taken into account. To the same effect, Fuzier-Hermann, vo. \"Appel en mati\u00e8re civile,\" nos. 268 et seq.\nWith respect to the interest accrued on the note from maturity there seems to be some uncertainty as to whether it should be added. Apparently the Privy Council, in Voyer v. Richer, referred to but not reported in 2 Legal News, at page 313, held on the application for leave that interest should be added to the principal in computing the amount demanded; but the Court of Appeal in Quebec, on the ground that it was a statutory court, as this court is, and could not exercise the discretionary power which the Privy Council has to allow appeals, refused to follow this judgment in Stanton v. Home Insurance Co.[8].\nIn France, the question seems to have been definitely settled. Rosseau-Laisney, Dictionnaire de Procedure Civile, vo. \"Appel,\" nos. 80, 81 and 82: Les int\u00e9r\u00eats accrus depuis l'introduction de l'instance ne doivent pas \u00eatre compris dans l'\u00e9valuation de la demande pour d\u00e9terminer si le jugement est en premier ou en dernier ressort.\nFuzier-Hermann, vo. \"Appel (mat. civ.),\" nos. 435, 436, makes a distinction as to interest accrued before and since the institution of the action, and the conclusion is that the latter cannot be taken into account because it is only consequential and incidental to the sum claimed by the declaration and cannot be considered as forming part of the principal demand.\nIn the Supreme Court of the United States, it has been held that interest cannot be added to give jurisdiction unless claimed as damages. Udall v. The \"Ohio\"[9] and Western Telegraph Co. v. Rogers[10].\nThe interest accrued on the note before the institution of the action in warranty and the costs incurred in the main action, so far as we can ascertain from the figures supplied by the appellant, if added to the face value of the note and costs of protest would not bring the appellant's claim within the appealable amount, five hundred pounds sterling.\nAs to the costs in the action in warranty, and interest, we hold that they are not to be added to the principal sum in estimating the appealable value, except that portion of the costs in the main action and of the interest on the note which are covered by the conclusions of the action in warranty and form part of the demand in that action.\nBy their conclusions in the action in warranty the appellants ask that the agreement in connection with which the note sued on was given should be declared null and void, but no distinct issue was raised on the record as to the validity of this agreement and the money value of Labrosse's interest, stated here to be $3,000, is not set out in the pleadings and I agree with the registrar that, on the pleadings, this is a matter collateral to the present issue and an incident resulting therefrom which cannot be taken into consideration in estimating the amount in dispute. The words \"matter in dispute\" have reference to the matter which is directly in dispute in the particular cause (here, the action in warranty), in which the judgment sought to be reviewed had been rendered; and do not permit this court, for the purpose of determining such sum or value, to estimate its collateral effects. Elgin v. Marshall [11]. This point is put in Fuzier-Hermann, vo. \"Appel (mat. civ.) \"no. 421:\nC'est dans la demande principale et non dans les accessoires de la demande, qu'il faut chercher le d\u00e9termination de taux du ressort. D\u00e8s lors il convient de d\u00e9gager la demande de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne sont pas le principal et qui, cons\u00e9quemment, ne doivent pas servir \u00e0 la supputation du ressort.\nVide Toussignant v. County of Nicolet[12].\nIn New Jersey Zinc Co. v. Trotter[13], and in Starin v. The \"Jessie Williamson, Jr.\"[14], it was held that reference can only be had to the matter actually in dispute in the particular cause in which the judgment is rendered for the purpose of estimating the value on which the jurisdiction of the court depends and the collateral effect of the judgment is not to be taken into account.\nThe motion is dismissed with costs taxed at $ 50.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 32 Can.

JUSTICE GIROUARD IN CHAMBERS.\nCriminal law\u2014Indictable offence\u2014Summary trial\u2014Jurisdiction of magistrate\u2014Offence committed in another county.\nIf a person is brought before a justice of the peace charged with an offence committed within the Province, but out of the limits of the jurisdiction of such justice the latter, in his discretion, may either order the accused to be taken before some justice having jurisdiction in the place where the offence was committed (Cr. Code [1892] sec. 557; Cr. C. [1906] sec. 665) or may proceed as if it had been committed within his own jurisdiction.\nS. was brought before the stipendiary magistrate of the City of Halifax charged with having committed burglary in Sydney, C.B.\nHeld, that the stipendiary magistrate could, with the consent of the accused, try him summarily under Cr. C. [1892] sec. 785 as amended in1900. (Cr. C. [1906] sec. 777).\nAPPEAL from a decision of Mr. Justice Girouard in Chambers refusing an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe applicant, Seeley, is confined in the penitentiary at Dorchester, N.B., on conviction by a stipendiary magistrate for Halifax, N.S., of having committed burglary at Sydney, Cape Breton. He was at the same time convicted of burglary in Halifax and sentenced to the penitentiary therefor, such sentence to run from the termination of that imposed for the first-mentioned offence.\nSeeley applied to a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a writ of habeas corpus, which application was referred to the full court and the writ was finally refused[1]. He then applied to Mr. Justice Girouard, who, following In re White[2], refused to interfere with the decision of the provincial court. He then appealed to the Supreme Court from such refusal.\nO'Hearn, for the appellant.\nJ. J. Power K.C., for the Crown.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from an order made by Mr. Justice Girouard in Chambers refusing a writ of habeas corpus[3].\nIt may be convenient to state now briefly the mode in which the courts in England have administered the law in relation to the writ of habeas corpus. Lord Herschel, in Cox v. Hakes[4], at page 527, says:\nIt was always open to an applicant for it, if defeated in one court, at once to renew his application to another. No court was bound by the view taken by any other, or felt itself obliged to follow the law laid down by it. Each court exercised its independent judgment upon the case, and determined for. itself whether the return to the writ established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the law. A person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty. And if he could succeed in convincing any of the tribunals competent to issue the writ that he was entitled to be discharged, his right to his liberty could not afterwards be called in question. There was no power in any court to review or control the proceedings of the tribunal which discharged him. I need not dwell upon the security which was thus afforded against any unlawful imprisonment. It is sufficient to say that no person could be detained in custody if any one of the tribunals having power to issue the writ of habeas corpus was of opinion that the custody was unlawful. In this statement of the law as applicable to Canada we desire to express our full concurrence.\nThe facts of this case summarily stated are:\nThe prisoner was convicted at Halifax on the 23rd December, 1903, by George H. Fielding, stipendiary magistrate in and for the City of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, of the offence of burglary, alleged to have been committed at the City of Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton, also in Nova Scotia. It is submitted in support of the application that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to convict on the short ground that the offence was not committed within his territorial jurisdiction, the limits of which are made by virtue of the provisions of the Nova Scotia statutes co-terminus with the area of the City of Halifax.\nThere is no doubt that the powers of a justice of the peace are all derived from statute and being purely statutory must be construed strictly. It must also be conceded, I think, that a magistrate must exercise his powers within the local limits of his jurisdiction. In England, the Criminal Acts (Indictable Offences Act, 1848, and Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1867) empower a justice of the peace to issue a warrant upon information in writing on oath against any person charged with having committed an indictable offence within his jurisdiction, or against any person residing or being or suspected to reside or be within the limits of his jurisdiction and who is suspected to be guilty of having committed any offence elsewhere (11 & 12 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 1); and in the case of a man apprehended in one county for an offence committed in another it is provided that the magistrate shall examine such witnesses and receive such evidence in proof of the charge as shall be produced before him within his jurisdiction, and if, in his opinion, the evidence shall be sufficient proof of the charge he shall commit the accused to the gaol, or house of correction, for the county, borough or place where the offence is alleged to have been committed, or admit to bail; and if the evidence is not deemed sufficient to put the accused upon his trial, the justice binds over the witnesses and sends the accused back to the county where the offence is alleged to have been committed to be dealt with by a justice there (11 & 12 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 22), so that in the result the offence is finally dealt with and the offender tried within the district in which the alleged offence was committed, in accordance with the common law rule. This proceeding is plain, intelligible and consistent with the general principle that the authority of a justice of the peace or of a magistrate is limited to the county or district for which he is appointed.\nWe must, however, consider this application in connection with sections 554 and 557 of the Criminal Code (Canada, 1892), which \"re-enact in part only those provisions of the Imp\u00e9rial Act to which I have just referred. Section 554 gives a magistrate jurisdiction to issue his warrant and compel for the purpose of preliminary inquiry the attendance of an accused charged with an indictable offence who resides or is found or apprehended or is in custody in the justice's county. Section 557 provides that the magistrate holding the preliminary inquiry where the accused is charged with an offence committed out of the limits of the jurisdiction of such magistrate may, after hearing both sides, order the accused, at any stage of the inquiry, to be taken before a justice having jurisdiction in the place where the offence was committed. Whereas the \"Imperial Act,\" as already pointed out, is imperative, our section is permissive[5], and makes no special provision for the commitment or trial, as the English Act does, of a prisoner charged with an offence committed in another county in the same province. Must we not therefore assume that in such a case, provided the offence is triable in the province, the prisoner is to be dealt with as if the offence had been committed within the territorial limits of the magistrate's jurisdiction, unless, in the exercise of his discretion, he chooses to send him before a justice of the county where the offence was committed. I am confirmed in this opinion by the terms of section 554:\nEvery justice may issue a warrant or summons, as hereinafter mentioned, to compel the attendance of an accused person before him, for the purpose of preliminary inquiry in \u00abany of the following cases:\u2014\n(a) If such person is accused of having committed in any place whatever an indictable offence triable in the province in which such judge resides, or is, or is suspected to be, within the limits over which such justice has jurisdiction, or resides or is suspected to reside within such limits;\n(b) If such person, wherever he may be, is accused of having committed an indictable offence within such limits;\n(c) If such person is alleged to have anywhere unlawfully received property which was unlawfully obtained within such limits;\n(d) If such person has in his possession, within such limits, any stolen property.\nThe words preliminary inquiry in the first paragraph, which specially confer jurisdiction in the cases enumerated in sections (a), (b), (c), (d), must carry the same meaning throughout the whole section. It would be contrary to the general rules of construction to give a different meaning to these words in different portions of the same section[6], and there is no doubt that construed with special reference to sections. (b), (c) and (d), they must be held to confer on the magistrate power to inquire and commit for trial in the cases provided for in these sections, that is to say, where the accused is charged with an offence committed in the justice's county or with unlawfully receiving. I can see no reason why these words should receive a more limited meaning when used in connection with sub-section (a) where the accused is charged in the justice's county with an indictable offence committed elsewhere in the province. Article 785 of the Code, as amended by the statute of 1900,[7], gives the magistrate jurisdiction to try summarily with his consent any person charged before him with having committed any offence for which he may be tried at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace and undoubtedly the offence of burglary is triable at sessions[8]. There are certain offences enumerated in the latter section with respect to which a magistrate can hold a preliminary inquiry only. What is the meaning of the word charged as used here? The charge is contained in the information sworn to and lodged with the magistrate and upon which he issues his warrant, as well as in the depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry, if an inquiry is held; but if the prisoner waives the inquiry and consents to be tried summarily, then the magistrate makes the charge for the purpose of that proceeding on the sworn complaint and information then before him and, when read to the prisoner for the purpose of enabling him to make his option, he is charged within the meaning of this section and the magistrate has jurisdiction to deal with him. Some stress was laid upon the point that to be clothed with jurisdiction under section 785 the magistrate must be acting within the local limits of his jurisdiction. I have endeavoured to point out that section 554 does not distinguish and that with respect to an offender found within the county charged with an offence committed beyond, but within the province, the jurisdiction of the magistrate is as complete as if the offence had been committed within his territory. The legislation is somewhat elliptical, but our duty is to give effect to what is apparently the intention of the Act if we can do so on a proper construction of the words used. If the Canadian Parliament had intended to adopt the procedure followed in England, it would have been easy to use the language of the \"Imperial Act,\" and as this was not done I conclude that the intention was to establish the principle that mere presence in the county will subject even a passing stranger to the jurisdiction of the magistrate if charged with an indictable offence wherever committed within the limits of the province, and I can see no reason why on the principle of effectiveness and considerations of convenience we should not give effect to what apparently was the intention of the legislature. I construe sections 554, 557 and 785, taken together, to mean that when an offence is committed within the limits of a province any presence, however transitory, of the accused in any part of that province will justify the exercise of as full and complete jurisdiction as if the offence was committed where the offender is apprehended, leaving to the magistrate a discretionary power to send the prisoner for further inquiry or for trial before the justice having jurisdiction over the locus where the offence was committed. It has been suggested that difficulty may arise out of the clashing of jurisdiction; but we can only concur in the opinion expressed by Lord Watson in the Orr-Ewing Case (1), that wherever a real conflict of jurisdiction does arise between two independant tribunals, the better course for each to pursue is to exercise its own jurisdiction so far as it can and not to issue judgments proclaiming the incompetency of its rival.\nApplication dismissed.\n[1] 13 Can.

Fog signals were given in reply and when the incoming vessel the \"Rosalind\" was estimated to be about half a mile off the \"Senlac\" gave a single short blast and directed her course to starboard. The \u2018Rosalind\" replied to this signal and stopped her engines. Within a few seconds the \"Senlac\" was seen about a ship's length away on the port bow and almost at the same moment the latter gave two short blasts on her whistle and swung to port threatening to cross the \"Rosalind's\" bow. The \"Rosalind's\" engines were immediately put \"full speed astern\" but too late to avoid a collision in which the \"Senlac\" was seriously damaged. At the trial of an action by the latter reliance was placed on the failure of the \"Rosalind\" to respond to her signals but the first signal admitted to have been heard on the \"Rosalind\" was the one short blast when the \"Senlac\" went to starboard. The result of the trial was that both vessels were found in fault and on appeal by the \"Rosalind\":\nHeld, that the \"Senlac\" was in fault in continuing on her course when the vessels were quite near together instead of stopping and reversing and was alone to blame for the collision, and that the failure to hear her signals was not negligence on the part of the \"Rosalind\" and did not contribute in any material degree to the accident. APPEAL from a decision \"of the local judge for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada dividing the damages resulting from a collision equally between the parties.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nMellish K.C., for the appellant.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C., for the respondents.\nMellish K.C., for the appellant. The only negligence charged against the appellant is that of failure to keep a proper look-out which would have enabled her to hear the earlier signals from the \"Senlac.\" But there is no finding that they were heard and no rule of law making failure to hear them negligence. Marsden on Collisions, p. 34; The Campania[1], at p. 292; The Koning Willem I.[2] ; The Lepanto[3].\nThe \"Senlac\" by going to starboard instead of stopping and reversing brought the ships into danger of collision, and is alone to blame, the \"Rosalind\" having done all that was possible to avert the disaster. See Marsden on Collisions, p. 416.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C., for the respondents. From the findings and evidence it is clear that signals were-given on the \"Senlac\" which should have been heard on board the \"Rosalind,\" and whether heard or not the latter was guilty of negligence. Moore on Facts, vol. 1, p. 287; The Saginaw[4], at p. 711; The Rondane[5].\nEven if the \"Rosalind\" had a right to cross the channel her speed was excessive. See The Magna Charta[6]; The Ebor[7]. As to the necessity for the \"Senlac\" to stop after hearing the \"Rosalind's\" whistle see The Chinkiang[8].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am inclined to think that there was some negligence in that the rate of speed at which the \"Rosalind\" passed Chiboucto Head (6 knots), and Meagher's Beach Lighthouse, and the Middle Ground buoy (about four knots), was, under the circumstances, excessive and I am also of opinion that the proper sound signals were not given by those on board the \"Rosalind.\" But to succeed in this case it was necessary to go further and shew that this negligence materially contributed to the collision, and, in this respect, the evidence fails. On the contrary, I think, the evidence shews that, with ordinary care, the \"Senlac\" would have avoided the collision. I agree with the nautical assessor that, while the lack of care in the frequency and duration of the signals may have given rise to confusion or misunderstanding, they cannot be said to have contributed in a material degree to the collision. The captain of the \"Senlac\" (McKinnon) interpreted these signals as ordinary fog-blasts, so that he was not deceived by them.\nAs to the rate of speed, it is, in my opinion, proved that when the vessels came in sight of one another, at about 300 feet .distant, the engines of the \"Rosalind\" had been stopped and were then immediately put full speed astern, whereas the speed of the \"Senlac\" was then about six knots and, instead of stopping and reversing and thus probably avoiding a collision, she kept on her course across the bows of the \"Rosalind\" and made the collision inevitable. If, instead of thus proceeding recklessly on her way, the \"Senlac\" had stopped, reversed and gone full speed astern when the \"Rosalind\" was first sighted, there is every probability, as found by the nautical assessor, that the collision would have been avoided or, at most, if the vessels had come into contact, no material damage would have been caused to either.\nIn view of the very carefully prepared judgments of my brothers Davies and Duff, I do not think it necessary to discuss the facts at greater length.\nDavies J.\u2014This is a case of collision which occurred near the Middle Ground buoy in Halifax Harbour, on the afternoon of 1st July, 1907, between the screw steamer \"Senlac,\" of 1,010 tons, outward bound on a coasting voyage, and the screw steamer \"Rosalind,\" of 2,517 tons, bound inward from New York. It is admitted that the weather, during the day and at the time of the collision, was very foggy, with a light south-west wind.\nThe learned judge of the Nova Scotia Admiralty District had no difficulty in finding that the \"Senlac's\" breaches of the regulations for preventing collisions in Canadian waters had occasioned the collision, but he also found that the earlier fog-blasts given by the \"Senlac,\" on her way out, and which the \"Rosalind\" contended had not been heard by her, should have been heard, and\nthat, if they were not heard, it was due to the negligence of the \"Rosalind\" and that the negligence contributed to the disaster.\nHe, therefore, found both vessels at fault and decreed accordingly. It was from this finding and the decree against her that the \"Rosalind\" appealed.\nThe \"Senlac\" did not appeal or question the finding as against her.\nThe question for us, therefore, is whether or not the decree can, under the evidence, as against the \"Rosalind'' be sustained.\nIt does not appear to me that it can.\nThe \"Senlac\" was, beyond any doubt, in fault, not only in proceeding in a fog at such an excessive speed down the narrow channel as six miles an hour, but in failing to stop her engines and reverse when she sighted the \"Rosalind\" and the danger of collision was imminent.\nThe nautical assessor says, in his report,\nin view of the fact that she sighted the \"Rosalind\" at a distance not too great to have stopped her way by going full speed astern she was at fault in continuing her course across the \"Rosalind's\" bow.\nShe was also on her wrong side of the narrow channel forming the entrance to the harbour. It would almost appear as if she had done everything possible to occasion the collision.\nThe immediate and direct cause of the collision, however, was the man\u0153uvre adopted by the \"Senlac\" immediately she saw the \"Rosalind,\" and, as her captain says, \"in consequence of seeing her,\" of starboarding her helm and attempting to cross the \"Rosalind's\" bows.\nHad he ported her helm instead of starboarding, or stopped and reversed her engines instead of continuing on at his six mile speed, the probabilities are strong that the collision would have been avoided.\nThe trial judge finds that the \"Rosalind\" was not proceeding up the harbour as cautiously as she might have been, \"and that negligence\" was the cause of her not hearing the earlier fog-blasts of the \"Senlac.\"\nA close perusal of the evidence, part of which was taken by commission and was not given before the learned judge, has failed to satisfy me that the finding of negligence in not hearing the earlier fog-blasts of the \"Senlac\" could be sustained. The decided cases referred to before us, alike in England and the United States, collected in Marsden on Collisions at Sea (ed. 1904), at page 34, shew that the courts are unwilling to infer negligence from the mere fact that a fog-signal which is proved to have been sounded in the vicinity was not heard. It has been held by Sir James Hannen, in \"The Zadok\"[9], at p. 118, that\nproof that a fog-horn was blown yet was not heard at the distance it might be expected to be heard cannot be accepted as proof that there was negligence on the part of those who did not hear it.\nIn the case of The \"Campania\"[10], at p. 292, Gorrell Barnes J. says:\nBut the fact that the sound of the fog-horn does not appear to have reached the ears of those on board the \"Campania\" is not sufficient to override the positive evidence of the witnesses from the barque that it was being properly sounded. The Elder. Brethren advise me that, as a matter of experience, sound signals in a fog are not always to be heard as they might be expected to be, and especially by persons on steamers approaching at considerable speed and sounding their own fog-whistles, and that this makes it all the more necessary that the speed of vessels in a fog should be moderate.\nIn the Channel Pilot (9 ed.), art. 18, cited by Bucknell J. in The \"Koning Willem I.\"[11], at p. 121, it is stated that:\nApart from the wind, large areas of silence have been found in different directions and at different distances from the origin of sound, even in clear weather. I am assuming, of course, cases where there is credible evidence on both sides. It may well be that the evidence from both ships may be true. Now, in the case before us, there is credible evidence on both sides. The fog-horn of the \"Senlac\" was, undoubtedly, blown several times as she was proceeding down the harbour and was heard by others than those aboard of her. On the other hand, the evidence of many witnesses on the \"Rosalind,\" including the captain, the third officer, the man at the wheel, the \"Hell Gate\" pilot from New York, who was on the bridge, and the first mate, who was at the bow on the look-out, all concur that they were keeping a vigilant look-out and they did not hear any of these earlier fog blasts of the \"Senlac.\"\nThe finding of the learned judge of negligence because they did not hear is very general. He does not say how far the ships were apart when the fog-signals should have been heard, or whether all those sounded or only some of them should have been heard, or what their apparent bearing from the \"Rosalind\" would have been had they been heard, nor does it appear that, if heard, the danger apparent of a possible collision would have been such as to call for other man\u0153uvres being adopted by the \"Rosalind\" than those which were adopted. Perhaps, however, any more specific finding could not, under the circumstances, have been made. I will not, however, press the point further, because I am of opinion that, under our statute, R.S.C. ch. 113, sec. 916, copied from the Imperial Statute 17 & 18 Vict. ch. 104, sec. 298, which governs this case, where the collision took place in Canadian waters, in order to hold the \"Rosalind\" liable, the collision must appear to the court to have been occasioned by the non-observance on her part of some regulation she was bound to observe. The Cuba v. McMillan[12]. It was incumbent on the \"Senlac\" to prove that the negligence complained of and found, which I assume to have been not keeping a proper look-out so as to have heard the \"Senlac's\" earlier fog-signals, in part contributed to the collision. Nowhere is there any evidence from which we could draw such a conclusion. The collision was directly caused by the \"Senlac\" wrongfully starboarding her helm, without attempting to stop or reverse, when the \"Rosalind\" was first seen by her in the fog, and so throwing herself right across the latter's bows. This man\u0153uvre was taken \"in consequence of seeing her,\" as the \"Senlac's\" captain states. It was quite inexcusable and everything was done by the \"Rosalind\" to avoid its consequences that reasonably could be done.\nSuch being the case, I am quite unable to see how the \"Rosalind\" can be held in fault under our Canadian statute as in part contributing to the collision, even if she, at any earlier time, negligently failed to hear the fog signals.\nAs to the contention of Mr. Ritchie, that the \"Rosalind\" was in fault in crossing from Meagher's Beach to pick up the light on the Middle Ground of the channel, it is sufficient to say that I quite agree with the finding of the assessor that\nthe \"Rosalind,\" having passed Meagher's Beach, was navigated with due caution and was justified in her endeavour to make the Middle Ground buoy.\nIn doing so she did not break the rule requiring her to keep the eastern side of the channel. She did keep to such eastern side of the channel in the sense that the Middle Ground light was about the centre of the channel and her course was to the eastward of that light. She was not obliged, in such a fog, to hug the eastern shore line.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment holding the \"Rosalind\" liable reversed.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Duff J.\nMaclennan J.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by my brother Davies.\nDuff J.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises is the result of a collision which took place in Halifax Harbour near the Middle Ground buoy, on the 1st of July, 1907, between the \"Senlac,\" a wooden ship of 1,010 tons, going out of the harbour, and the \"Rosalind,\" a steel ship of 2,517 tons going in. The collision occurred in daylight, in a thick fog. The \"Senlac\" was seriously damaged and beached in a sinking condition, the \"Rosalind\" being uninjured.\nThe action was tried by the local judge in admiralty, in Nova Scotia (assisted by an assessor), who found both ships to blame. The \"Rosalind\" appeals.\nThe account given by the captain and pilot of the \"Senlac\" shews that, after leaving the wharf in Halifax, the \"Senlac\" proceeded down the harbour under full steam, making, however (for reasons which need not be discussed), only about six knots an hour. For some time before the collision occurred they heard distinctly the fog blasts of the \"Rosalind\" and recognized them as the signals of an incoming steamer; but, notwithstanding this, the \"Senlac\" did not moderate her speed. As the vessels approached one another there seems to have been no misapprehension on board the \"Senlac\" respecting the direction in which the \"Rosalind\" was moving. The captain says:\nQ.\u2014After you made that observation, did you hear his fog-blasts again? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014How far away did you judge they were from you? A.\u2014It was, I judged, about a mile and a quarter away. Over a mile.\nQ.\u2014What did you do when you heard them close to the course of your vessel? A.\u2014I did not do anything just then.\nQ.\u2014Did you hear another one soon after? A.\u2014Yes; soon after. About a minute or two after.\nQ.\u2014How far did you judge that was away? A.\u2014I judged it was a little nearer. I did not do anything then. Then I heard a third one. I judged that it was from half to three-quarters of a mile away. I then gave one short blast of the whistle and directed my course to starboard.\nAnd the pilot:\nWe blew the regulation blasts until we got pretty well towards their ship. The captain said he appeared to be getting closer, then he blew one short blast indicating a course to starboard.\nThere is no dispute that this blast was given by the \"Senlac\" and heard by the \"Rosalind;\" and it is admitted that a blast from the \"Rosalind\" followed it. What occurred immediately afterwards is the subject of direct contradiction. Those on board the \"Senlac\" say that, within a very short time\u2014estimated at about a minute\u2014the \"Rosalind\" came in sight and, almost simultaneously, blew two short blasts, which they took to be a helm signal indicating a course to port; and that the \"Senlac\" (answering with the same signal), accordingly starboarded her helm. The captain and crew of the Rosalind,\" on the other hand, deny that this signal was given by her, and state that she gave no further signals except a short blast as the vessels came together; There is also a dispute respecting the relative positions of the two vessels when they came in sight. The \"Rosalind\" people say that the \"Senlac,\" when first seen, was coming head on, masts in line bearing about a point on the port bow and distant between 200 and 300 feet. The captain of the \"Senlac,\" on the other hand, says the vessels were on parallel courses, the \"Rosalind\" on his starboard bow. The assessor, in a report furnished by him to the learned trial judge, accepts, substantially, the account given by the \"Rosalind\" of the relative positions of the ships, and on this point (which, however, in the view I take of the case, is not of much importance), I agree with him. The other question\u2014whether the \"Senlac\" was misled into taking a course to port by the blasts of the \"Rosalind\"\u2014is a more difficult question; and, in this case, we have not the assistance of any definite finding. The evidence of those aboard the \"Senlac\" is supported by that of some persons on shore at a place of about half a mile from the place of collision; there is a great deal of force in Mr. Mellish's contention that these witnesses would not be expected to distinguish with accuracy between a double blast from one of the steamers and two single blasts delivered successively from the \"Senlac\" and the \"Rosalind\" with only a momentary interval between them. Two such blasts were delivered, and they were admittedly very shortly followed by two short blasts from the \"Senlac.\" In these circumstances I do not attach much corroborative weight to this evidence.\nWhether the signal indicating a course to port was or was not heard on board the \"Senlac\" I do not think the evidence justifies the conclusion that this man\u0153uvre of the \"Senlac,\" which in the view of the assessor was the immediate cause of the collision, was the result of that signal. The captain of the \"Senlac\" does not say that it was, and the absence of a distinct affirmation by him to that effect is rather strikingly significant. His account, indeed, of the relative position of the ships when the \"Rosalind\" hove in sight\u2014that the \"Rosalind\" was on his starboard bow\u2014would indicate that the man\u0153uvre was the result of his own observation of her position, and this accords entirely with his statement, made more than once at the trial, that he starboarded in consequence of \"seeing the 'Rosalind.' \"Balancing the probabilities as best one can, I think the \"Senlac\" fails to make out that the \"Rosalind\" was responsible for this maneuver.\nApart from the contention I have just been considering the principal fault charged against the \"Rosalind\" is that she failed to observe article 16 of the regulations, which is in these words:\nEvery vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorm, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nThe particular disobedience charged is that she did not take the course prescribed by the regulations on hearing the fog signals of the \"Senlac.\" The evidence of those on board the \"Rosalind\" is that (with the exception of the signal given by the \"Senlac\" shortly before the collision, with the object, as her captain says, of indicating a course to starboard, and subsequent signals), these signals were not heard by them. The learned trial judge does not distinctly find whether they were or were not heard. The view expressed by him is that if they were not heard it must have been because the attention of those on board the \"Rosalind\" was not sufficiently on the alert for such signals; and, on that view, he found the \"Rosalind\" in fault. The facts in evidence upon which this opinion is based are simply these: the whistle of the \"Senlac\"\u2014a powerful whistle, which in ordinary circumstances could be heard at a distance of two miles or more\u2014was unquestionably sounded (at intervals not greater than three minutes), for the twenty minutes preceding the collision; these signals were distinctly heard in Halifax up to the time of the collision, a distance of nearly two miles from the place where the collision occurred; the whistles of both steamers were heard, as already mentioned, at a place about half a mile away, immediately before the collision; the signals of the \"Rosalind\" were (except during a short interval), heard on board the \"Senlac\" for a considerable time previous to the collision, and as to that interval the evidence does not enable us to judge with any confidence whether it was due to an omission on the part of the \"Rosalind\" to sound her whistle or to the noises on the \"Senlac\" (such, for example, as the sound of her own whistle), or, as suggested by Mr. Mellish, to exceptional atmospheric conditions. The captain of the \"Rosalind,\" the look-out, and several other witnesses, two of whom were examined on commission, positively state that the \"Senlac's\" signals were not heard. The learned trial judge has, as I have said, not expressly refused to accept the statements of these witnesses; and, in the absence of such a finding, there really does not appear to be any good ground upon which this court can refuse to hold that these signals were not heard. Then there is really no direct evidence of lack of proper attention on the part of the officers and crew of the \"Rosalind;\" and I am not by any means free from doubt upon the question whether the facts I have mentioned are sufficient, in themselves, to support the inference the learned trial judge has drawn from them. Eminent and experienced judges have frequently, on the advice of experienced assessors, in the trial of admiralty actions, refused to accept credible testimony that a signal was not heard as sufficient evidence to shew that it was not given in the face of positive evidence that it was given; and it may be accepted that the vagaries and uncertainties of sounds in certain atmospheric conditions make it, as a rule, unsafe to infer that a signal was not given on one ship at sea because it was not heard upon another. On the other hand, it is, I think, impossible to lay down as a rule that in no circumstances would the fact that a signal proved to have been given on one ship was not heard by another be evidence of culpable inattention on the latter; and, in the circumstances here, I am unable to say that I am satisfied that the learned trial judge was wrong in finding, with the concurrence of the nautical assessor, that the signals given by the \"Senlac\" would have been heard by those on board the \"Rosalind\" if they had been on the alert for such signals.\nA failure in the attending to the possibility of fog signals would, in the circumstances, clearly amount to a neglect of the direction contained in article 16, to act with \"careful regard to existing circumstances and conditions;\" but it does not follow that the \"Rosalind\" was in fault within the meaning of the statutory enactment applicable to this case. The language of the statute (which is that of the earlier English Act, 17 & 18 Vict. ch. 104) is as follows:\nIf in any case of collision it appears to the court * * * that such collision was occasioned by the non-observance of any of the rules prescribed by this Act, the vessel * * * shall be deemed to be in fault unless it can be shewn, to the satisfaction of the court, that the circumstances of the case rendered a departure from the said rules necessary (R.S.C. ch. 113, sec. 916).\nIn The Ship \"Cuba\" v. McMillan[13], this court held, following the decisions upon the English Act referred to, that where non-observance of the regulations per se is relied upon as constituting fault within this enactment, it is necessary to consider whether the non-observance did or did not in fact contribute to the collision. King J., who delivered the judgment of the court, uses these words, at page 661:\nApart from statutory definitions of blame or negligence, there seems no difference between the rules of law and of admiralty as to what amounts to negligence causing collision. Per Lord Blackburn, in Cayzer v. Carron Co.[14]; The Khedive[15]. As applied to the case before us, the principle is that a non-observance of a statutory rule by the \"Elliott\" is not to be considered as in fact occasioning the collision, provided that the \"Cuba\" could, with reasonable care exerted up to the time of the collision, have avoided it. The Bernina[16].\nThe rule was also applied by the court of appeal in H M .S. \"Sans Pareil\"[17].\nWe need not, I think, concern ourselves with the question whether, if the \"Rosalind\" had heard the \"Senlac's\" signals and committed no breach of article 16, the ships would or would not have been brought into danger of collision. Assuming they would not, the \"Rosalind\" is, I think, still entitled to succeed on the principle stated in the passage I have quoted; because I think the evidence shews that she being where she was when the \"Senlac\" gave the first signal, admittedly heard on board the \"Rosalind,\" the \"Senlac\" could, by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the collision. The evidence is conclusive that the \"Rosalind,\" on hearing the signal mentioned, stopped her engines and, when the \"Senlac\" came in sight, reversed them; and there can be no doubt that had the \"Senlac\" done the like, the collision could not have happened. Apart from any rule, knowing that she was in the vicinity of the \"Rosalind\"\u2014an incoming ship\u2014the slightest regard for the safety of the two ships demanded that the \"Senlac\" should at least take the precaution of stopping her engines until the position of the \"Rosalind\" should be accurately known. It is the opinion of the assessor that, when the \"Rosalind\" came in sight, the \"Senlac\" (though still under full steam ahead), had time by reversing her engines (as the \"Rosalind\" did), if not to avert the collision, at least so to lessen the force of the impact as to escape substantial injury.\nBut it is not, I think, necessary that the \"Rosalind\" should rely upon this view. The most ordinary attention to the obvious risks of the situation would have led the \"Senlac,\" at the time she gave the starboard signal, to take such measures as might be necessary to avoid a collision; and this could easily have been done by simply stopping her engines. The truth seems to be that, at the moment the ships were in a position involving risk of collision, but no actual peril if both ships should be navigated with the caution which such a situation required; but that, while the \"Rosalind\" was navigated with care, the \"Senlac\" was navigated with a reckless disregard of the safety of both ships. It was this recklessness that was the proximate cause of the collision. The appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. H.

No one witnessed the accident, and there was no evidence to shew how it actually occurred, but it was suggested that the deceased got his foot caught between the rail and the guard rail; that the space between these should have been filled with packing; that it was not so filled, and that, if it had been, the accident would not have occurred.\nChrysler K.C., for the appellant.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C., for the respondent.\nChrysler K.C., for the appellant. The findings of the learned trial judge are entirely against the weight of evidence.\nThe provisions of section 262 of the \"Railway Act, 1888,\" relating to packing, are not in the Government Railway Act,\" but the suppliant put in, as an exhibit, the rules for the guidance of Intercolonial trackmen, rule 82 of which reads: \"The foreman must see that all spaces less than five inches between rails, frogs, crossings, switches, guard rails, et cetera, are filled and kept filled in with wood packing, or other suitable: material; such packing not to reach higher than the underside of rail head.\"\nIt is submitted: (1) That the evidence does not shew how the accident happened or what was its cause. (2) That no negligence is shewn on the part of any of the railway servants. (3) That the weight of the evidence shews that so far as the regulations as to packing have any bearing on the case they were duly complied with.\nThe occupation of a brakesman is necessarily hazardous. The deceased was well acquainted with the Sayabec district, in which he had worked for years. He had been actually working at the very place where the accident occurred for several days previously, assisting with the loading operations which were going on at the time when it happened. There was nothing unusual in the conditions there on that day, and it is impossible to acquit him of imprudence and carelessness without which the accident could not have occurred.\nThe learned trial judge has decided this case, so far as the law is concerned, by reference to the case of The King v. Armstrong[2], which was tried at the same time, and we crave leave to refer to so much of the factum in that appeal as deals with the law of the case[3], and the argument at bar, as given in the Supreme Court report at pages 232 et seq.\nThere is, however, the further legal objection to the present suit that the cause of action arose in the lifetime of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, that an action would only lie against Her Majesty, and that the same abated on her death. See Viscount Canterbury v. The Queen[4], in which it was sought to make the late Queen liable upon a petition of right for a wrong done by a servant of William IV., and it was objected, first, that the Queen was not the personal representative of the late King, and, secondly, that if she was, the case was within the rule actio personalis moritur cum persona. There was no decision on the point, though it was referred to by Lord Lyndhurst, who, in terms clearly indicating his opinion that it was a fatal objection to the suit, said:\nAnother objection has been urged against the claim of the petitioner. If the case were one between subject and subject this objection would be fatal, and it is admitted on the part of the petitioner that he can only expect success if he had a right to redress in an action against a private individual. Now, the cause of action arose in the time of the late King, and it is clear that had this been a case between subject and subject, an action could not be supported on the principle that actio personalis moritur cum persona. It is contended that a diff\u00e9rent rule prevails where the Sovereign is a party, but some authority, should be adduced for such distinction. It is true, indeed, that the King never dies\u2014the demise is immediately followed by the succession, there is no interval, the Sovereign always exists, the person only is changed. But if there be a change of person, why is the personal responsibility arising from the negligence of servants, (if indeed such responsibility exists), to be charged on the successor, ceasing as it does altogether in the case of a private individual? In the case of a subject the liability does not continue in respect of the estate; it devolves on neither the heirs nor the personal representative; it is extinct: I should find it difficult, therefore, in the case of the Crown, to say with any confidence that the liability continued, and was transferred to the successor, unless some distinct authority were shewn in support of such a doctrine. Several cases were referred to for this purpose in the argument at the bar, but they were cases of grant, covenant, debt, or relating to the right of property, in which, from the analogy to the case of a subject, the Crown might be liable in respect to succession, and do not, I think, sufficiently establish the principle for which they were cited. Auguste Lemieux K.C., for the respondent. The respondent relies upon the reasons for judgment stated by the learned trial judge, and also contends that the right of action conferred by articles 1054 and 1056 of the Civil Code is not representative, but a direct and independent right accruing to the persons therein mentioned for the recovery of damages from the party responsible for the injury. The deceased had no control over this right of action, which came into existence only on account of his death, and no agreement as to the indemnity entered into by him can limit or affect the remedy given to his widow and child by art. 1056, C.C. We refer, on this point, to Miller v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[5].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I would confirm the judgment with costs. As to the facts connected with the accident, I accept, although with some hesitation, the conclusion reached by the trial judge that the death of DeChamplain, husband of the respondent, was caused by the negligence complained of.\nIn his factum, at page 6, under the head of \"the law of the case,\" the Attorney-General says:\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court has given judgment in this case so far as the law is concerned by reference to the case of Marguerite Henrietta Jane Armstrong v. The King, which was tried at the same time. The judgment in the latter case is now under appeal to this honourable court, and the Attorney-General craves leave to refer to so much of his factum in that appeal as commencing at page 8 deals with the law of the case.\nAt the page referred to I find the points of law raised by the defence to that suit thus summarized:\n(a) The action is in tort and no such action will lie against the Crown. (b) The right of action, if any, given by the statute (The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, 50 & 51 Vict. eh. 16, sec. 16(c)), is a personal one, and the action will only lie at the suit of the personal representatives of the deceased H. C. Goddard.\n(c) The deceased, by his contract of employment, released and discharged the appellant from any claims of the nature of the present claim.\n(d) The negligence alleged to have been the cause of the accident was that of a fellow servant of the deceased.\nAll these questions were decided by this court against the appellant in the Armstrong Case[6] on the ground that the law had been settled in a long series of cases; and, on the application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council from that judgment, Lord MacNaghton said as a ground for refusing the application, referring to the decisions of this court:\nThis seems to have been the law for eighteen years.\n(See report of argument in Privy Council, p. 17.)[7]. In these circumstances, we are of opinion that the judgment in the Armstrong Case6 is conclusively binding on this court.\nThe appellant, however, urges the further legal objection that the cause of action arose in the lifetime of Her Majesty Queen Victoria; that an action would only lie against Her Majesty; and that the same abated on her death. In view of all the circumstances connected with the institution and subsequent conduct of these proceedings it is doubtful whether such a defence should be raised; but if we must deal with it we are of opinion that the principle actio personalis moritur cum person\u00e0 has no application here. This is an action for money reparation to the widow and children of a party injured who was killed as a result of the injuries and the Crown is\u2014within the limitations prescribed in section 16 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\"\u2014liable in any case in which a subject would, under like circumstances, be liable. The Queen v. Fillion[8]. There is no doubt under the old French law, which is now the Quebec law, the principles of which are applicable here, that if this was a case between subject and subject the wrongdoer's representative would be liable, in which we follow the rule of the canon rather than of the old Roman law. Pothier, No. 675, par. 7 (Bugnet ed.); Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, vo. \"Responsabilit\u00e9 civile,\" Nos. 1824 et seq. Nos. 1869 and 1870; Beaudry-Lacantinerie\u2014Obligations, vol. 3, 2nd part, No. 1884, No. 2886; Sourdat, No. 53, 53 bis & 58.\nFurther the law of reparation applicable to cases like the present is expressed in article 1056 of the Quebec Code, which gives in express terms an independent direct right of action to the plaintiffs against the person who commits the offence or quasi-offence or his representatives. Why should we make an exception to this general rule in a case where the Sovereign is a party? If under the law the liability continues in the case of a subject in respect of his estate and devolves upon his heirs or personal representatives, why in a case against the Crown should the liability not continue and be transferred to the successor? The King never dies, the demise is immediately followed by the succession; there is no interval, the Sovereign always exists; the person only is changed, as Lord Lyndhurst said, in Viscount Ganterbury v. The Queen[9]. The doubt expressed by His Lordship could not exist here because it is based entirely on the assumption that there would be, in the circumstances of the case, no liability if a subject was defendant and, as I have attempted to shew, here the subject would undoubtedly be liable.\nSince the judgment in Armstrong v. The King[10], it must be considered as settled law that the \"Exchequer Court Act\" not only creates a remedy, but imposes a liability upon the Crown in such a case as the present and that such liability is to be determined by the laws of the province where the cause of action arose.

[1906] c. 139, s. 46.\nIn the Province of Quebec, the actio Pauliana, though brought to set aside a contract for sale of an immovable, is a personal action and does not relate to a title to lands so as to give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, reversing the judgment of the Court of Review in favour of the plaintiff, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Arthabaska.\nThe appellants, creditors of an insolvent for a claim of $53.50, brought the suit, actio Pauliana, on behalf of themselves and all other creditors of the insolvent, to set aside a sale of land by the insolvent to the defendant, as having been made in fraud of creditors and asking that the land in question should be attached as their common pledge and sold for their common benefit. At the time of the sale complained of, the land had not been granted by the Crown, but was held under location and the letters patent of grant were subsequently issued in the name of the transferee.\nA motion was made, on behalf of the respondent, to quash the appeal, for want of jurisdiction, on the grounds that the action was, in its nature, merely personal and for an amount insufficient to give jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada to hear the appeal, and that there was no controversy involved affecting title to or any interest in real estate.\nOn the part of the appellants, it was contended that the effect of the proceedings, if the action were maintained, would be to set aside the title to the land which the defendant held under the letters patent of grant in virtue of the alleged fraudulent transfer by the debtor to him, and that, therefore, a title or interest in the land was in controversy, and an appeal would lie.\nJ. A. Ritchie, supported the motion.\nG. G. Stuart K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action Pauliana and the respondent moves to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. I would grant the motion on the ground that the amount of the plaintiff's claim is not within the appealable limit and no question of title to land, in the sense in which that term is used in section 46 of the Act, is involved in this appeal. It is quite true that the plaintiff in such an action brought under the Quebec Code represents not only himself, but all the other creditors of the fraudulent debtor prejudicially affected by the sale (art. 1036 C.C.), but it does not appear, and there is some evidence to the contrary, that the total amount of Leclerc's indebtedness Avould exceed f 500; and the value of the property is certainly not of the appealable amount. Labette v. Meunier[1], and Leclaire v. Cot\u00e9[2]. In a very learned essay on the nature of the action Pauliana, in \"La revue trimestrielle de droit civil,\u201d vol. 5, p. 85 (1906), a distinguished French writer, Mr. Jean Acher, says:\nLa controverse sur la nature de l'action paulienne a rapport aux plus anciens et aux plus ardus probl\u00e8mes du droit civil;\nand even the most superficial examination of the jurisprudence in France and of the text books of those who write with most authority, such as Laurent, Demolombe and Aubry & Rau, brings home the conviction that M. Acher does not overstate the difficulties with which this question is surrounded. There are two judgments of the \"cour de cassation,\" S. V. 1844, 1, 122, and S. V. 1885, 1, 77, in which diametrically opposite conclusions are reached. In the first the \"action paulienne\" is held to be an \"action mixte\" and in the second it is said to be \"une action personnelle.\" There are also judgments of the court of appeal in France in which it was decided that it was an \"action r\u00e9elle\"; and in the courts of the Province of Quebec we have the same diversity of opinion. Beaulieu v. L\u00e9vesque[3], and Leduc v. Tourigny[4]. In Beaulieu v. L\u00e9vesque3 it was held by Casault C.J., Oaron J., and Andrews J., a very strong-court, that the action Pauliana is a real action because what is sought by the conclusions is the annulling of a title to an immovable,; and consequently such an action, affecting title to land, is of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court and would be appealable here. See Mignault, vol. 5, p. 306. In Leduc v. Tourigny4, it was held by the Court of King's Bench, Dorion C.J. presiding, that the action Pauliana is a personal action and that the amount claimed in the action was solely to be considered in determining the question of jurisdiction, in which case no appeal would lie.\nAs to the doctrine in France compare Demolombe. vol. 25, No. 248, and Laurent, vol. 16, No. 483, et seq. In presence of such a conflict of authorities one might well be tempted to say with Johannes Faber: \"Super hoc teneas quidquid volueris non est magnus effectus.\"\nI have gone over the cases decided in this court and have not been able to find one in which the question now in issue has been considered.\nIn the conclusion that I have reached I adopt the opinion of Planiol as to the nature of the action: Vol. 2, No. 327:\nL'action paulienne (Planiol says) a pour but de procurer aux cr\u00e9anciers la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice que leur a caus\u00e9 le fraude commise contre eux par le d\u00e9biteur. Tel est le but pratique de l'action.\nAnd at No. 328 he says:\nIl n'y a d'action r\u00e9elle que celle qui garantit les droits r\u00e9els, tels que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, les servitudes, les hypoth\u00e8ques; et ici il n'y a rien de semblable. L'action paulienne est une action personnelle qui na\u00eet d'un fait illicite. Elle tend \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice subi par le cr\u00e9ancier. Elle rentre donc dans la famille des actions d\u00e9lictuelles. La nullit\u00e9 qui en est la cons\u00e9quence n'est qu'un moyen de donner au cr\u00e9ancier la r\u00e9paration \u00e0 laquelle il a droit sous la forme la plus directe et la plus simple.\nSee Dalloz, \"codes annot\u00e9s,\" art. 1167 C.N., no. 10 and at no. 367. Also note by Esmein to Sirey, 1875, 2, 146. Vide S. V. 1904, 1, 136.\nThe Quebec Code differs from the French Code in this respect; by art. 1036 the defendant creditor is compelled to restore the thing received or the value thereof for the benefit of the creditors of the insolvent debtor according to their respective rights, and not exclusively, as in France, for the benefit of the plaintiff in the action. Comp. Vigi\u00ea, vol. II, no. 1250. Vol. 5, Revue Trimestrielle, at p. 111. Nothing, however, turns on this difference in this case because as before stated the total amount of the alleged fraudulent debtor's indebtedness does not exceed $500.\nI do not deny that in the final result the title of the defendant to the property with respect to which he is alleged to have acquired a fraudulent title may be affected; but I may safely say that the settled jurisprudence of this court is that in dealing with the question of jurisdiction reference can only be had to the matter actually in dispute in the particular case and the collateral effect of the. judgment is not to be taken into account.\nMotion granted with costs fixed at $25.\nGirouard and Davies JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014The test of the jurisdiction of this court in any such case as this ought to be whether or not \"the matter in controversy\" falls within the range of subject matters that give a right to appeal.\nSection 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" provides that\nno appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any action suit cause matter or other judicial proceeding unless the matter in controversy * * * relates to any fee, etc. * * * or to any title to lands, tenements, etc., * * * where rights in future might be bound.\nThis question has been passed upon time and again and it has been decided that no adjudication gives rise to the jurisdiction when relative merely to any assessment or other basis for or imposition of taxation, although in the ultimate result the enforcing thereof might affect and even change the ownership and thus the title; or to a proc\u00e8s-verbal of council though it would affect the ownership of land either alleged to be a right of way, or needed for a highway, and to be expropriated for such a purpose; or the right to enforce a mortgage, or affecting the amount of such charge on lands or relieving lands from such charge; or the validity of a by-law on the mere ground that its being held valid would affect lands or the title thereto; or removing a guardian or tutor entrusted with lands; or to restrain the execution of an award or direction of engineer under the Ditches and Watercourses Act; or order in a decided bornage case defining how the line should be established; or in a suit where right of way had been adjudged, but dispute had arisen over whether settlement had or had not been made that averted need of execution; or the price of real estate sold with warranty even though a plea of fear of future troubles from a prior hypothec; or a lease within this sub-section by reason of the title to land coming in question.\nIn this case no one disputes the title. Everything relative thereto is admitted.\nTherefore there is no title to land as such in controversy.\nThe only question is whether or not there has been a fraud upon creditors.\nIf there has not there can be no disturbance of the title. If there has the present holder of the title must either pay the creditors or submit to the lands being made answerable therefor.\nThe case seems to me clearly to fall within the principle upon which the numerous cases I have referred to proceeded.\nIndeed, the case of Flatt v. Ferland[5] seems in point though no one appears to have had the courage to raise the question and claim such a ground of jurisdiction as claimed here. The suit was just as this to set aside a sale as fraudulent against creditors whose united claims were less than $2,000, and hence the court refused to entertain the appeal.\nThe defendant in that case had offered to consent to set aside the attacked sale to him on receiving a stated sum of money.\nI fail to see how that could make any difference when his offer was rejected and the issue tried. The Canada Carriage Co. v. Lea[6], examined closely, implies the same thing; for if the title to land had been held to have been involved the .statute gave an appeal as of right.\nThe future consequences of the decision on the controversy count for nothing.\nSee Dubois v. Village of Ste. Rose[7], which turned upon the question of future rights.\nTalbot v. Guilmartin[8], which is analogous to that in principle.\nThe authorities referred to and others are all collected in the R.S.C. 1907, ch. 139, p. 2328 of vol. 3.\nI find, however, reason to doubt the classification of the cases in that list, and therefore refer to the following out of the list which furnish one or more authorities for each of the respective points I refer to above as decided: McKay v. Township of Hinchin brooke[9]; The Bank of Toronto v. Le Cur\u00e9 et les Marguilliers de L'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de la Paroisse de la Nativit\u00e9 de la Sainte Vierge[10]; Toussignant v.

Tew[17]; Canadian Mutual Loan & Investment Co. v. Lee[18]; Carrier v. Sirois[19]; Fr\u00eachette v. Simmoneau[20].\nI think the appeal should be quashed with costs.\nMaclennan and Duff JJ. concurred in the opinion stated by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis P.

Nor was his action barred by loss of the defective certificate by no fault of his nor of the seller.\nJudgment appealed from (13 B.C. Rep. 351) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed. The circumstances of the case are stated in the judgments now reported.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and Livingston, for the appellant. The judgment appealed from is wrong in following respects: (1) in holding that there was a transfer of the stock in question in due and proper form; (2) in failing to hold that it was the duty of the seller of the shares to give the purchaser such a transfer as would vest in him a present, absolute and unconditional right to have the shares registered, as between himself and the company; (3) in failing to hold, inasmuch as the transfer of the shares purported to be made by James Boecher, who died three years before the transfer was negotiated, that under the articles of association of the company the only person who could make title or transfer the shares was the executor or administrator of the said Boecher, that the transfer by the indorsement of Mrs. Boecher was incapable of passing any title to the shares, and that neither the plaintiff nor the defendants were or had been in a position at any time to compel the company to register the transfer; and (4) that, as between the company and any person seeking a transfer, the bylaw of the company provided that in the case of the death of a member the executors or administrators of the deceased shall be the only person recognized by the company as having any title to his shares. The company, therefore, was not bound to register except title was made by the executors or administrators, and, therefore, as the company was not bound to register the consideration as between the plaintiff and defendants failed and the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\nThe plaintiff was unaware when he accepted the certificate of stock in question that the indorsement thereon was not in the proper handwriting of the transferor, James Boecher, and did not become aware of this fact until he presented it for transfer to the managing director of the company. He was, therefore, unable to reject the certificate on this ground prior to payment therefor. By article 25 of the company the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the shares until the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect thereof, and the effect of the word \"deemed\" in this article was to make the said Boecher the only person who could be recognized as holder of the shares. Nunes v. Carter[2]; Campbell v. Barrie[3], at p. 292. By article 29, the executors or administrators of Boecher were, at the time the said shares were purchased by the plaintiff, the only persons recognized or whom the company could recognize as having any title to the shares, and thus the only persons who could make title to the shares, and as the shares did not purport to be transferred by Boecher's executors or administrators and as the notice called for by article 31, which is to be deemed to be a transfer, had not been given, the company correctly considered that no transfer of the shares to the plaintiff had been made, and the plaintiff was never in a position to compel them to register the document received by him from the defendants, purporting to be a transfer of the shares to him. The defendants became liable to him for the loss occasioned by reason of their having given him no title to the shares. Cook on Corporations (4 ed.), p. 651; Wil- kinson v. Lloyd[4]; Stray v. Russell[5], is distinguished, at p. 284, from Wilkinson v. Lloyd[6] as being under the rules of the Stock Exchange by which on a certain day the seller's broker hands over the transfers and certificates, and the other broker pays and is bound to pay.\nThe company had a right to delay making the transfer so as to make inquiries and avoid liability.Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Paris v. Walker[7], at p. 41; Ireland v. Hart[8], at p. 528; Cook on Corporations (4 ed.), p. 651; East Wheal Martha Mining Co.[9], pp. 119-121; Bermingham v. Sheridan[10]; Buckley, Company Law (8 ed.), p. 41. The company would be liable if the indorsement was irregular. In re Bahia and San Francisco Railway Co.[11]. If the plaintiff had persuaded the company to register the irregular transfer the company would have had an action of indemnity against him. Sheffield Corporation v. Barclay[12]. The company exercised their right of delay and notified the defendants of the irregularity, and it was the duty of the defendants to furnish the evidence required or otherwise make the transfer regular. Re East Wheal Martha Mining Co.[13], pp. 119-121. This they failed to do and the plaintiff then became entitled to a return of his money. Ireland v. Hart[14].\nEwart K.C., for the respondents. James Boecher was at one time the owner of the shares. The day before his death, his wife at his request signed his name to a blank transfer of them, in the presence of his sons, one of whom attested the signature. James Boecher left a will by which he bequeathed all that he had, including the shares, to his wife. Three years afterwards the shares were sold to the defendants, who accepted the transfer, believing it to be in perfect order; and they then clearly became entitled, as against the wife and everybody else, to be registered as holders of the shares. The defendants, while thus holding the certificate and transfer, sold the shares to one Amess. The plaintiff says that Amess, in purchasing the shares, was acting as his agent. But that is not true. The defendants, admittedly, believed, and had good reason to believe, that Amess was purchasing for himself, and selling over again to the plaintiff, The defendants and Amess live in Vancouver. The plaintiff lives in Ottawa; and, in order to close the transfer, Amess and the defendants drew upon the plaintiff in Ottawa, attaching the certificate and transfer to the draft. This was on the 29th November, 1905. The plaintiff accepted the documents and paid the draft. At this stage the plaintiff could elect whether to rest satisfied with the documents which he had received or to send them to the company for registration. He could not retain the documents indefinitely, and then raise as against the defendants some unsubstantial, or even substantial objection to them, or to their form. He did nothing until between the 7th and 10th of December, when he presented the documents to the president of the company. He did nothing further till the 6th January, meanwhile keeping a sharp lookout upon the share market, and saying nothing to the defendants from whom he had obtained, as he then thought, a great bargain. He had bought at 35c. a share and wrote to Amess (15th Nov.): \"I can place them here at 50; and I will share the rake-off with you when I get back.\" On the 6th January he sent the documents to the president at Vancouver to be put in proper form; and in connection with that action makes, in his evidence, two misstatements: (1) He says that he sent the documents to the company \"for transfer to myself.\" In reality he sent them for correction to the president, who had volunteered to get them put in form for him; (2) he says that the reason for delaying to send the documents was \"to give the president time to reach\" Vancouver. That is not true. He reached Vancouver on the 20th or 21st November.\nBoecher, living and in possession of his faculties, authorized and witnessed his wife's signature to the transfer in question in this action. The signature so made was the signature of Boecher: The King v. Inhabitants of Longnor[15].\nAmess went outside any authority given him, and therefore cannot be considered plaintiff's agent at time of purchase: Wright on Principal and Agent, 72; Watson v. Swann[16].\nThe defendants were not required to do more on sale of shares than deliver share certificate and transfers in common form, and abstain from interfering with registration of transfer: Stray v. Russell[17]; London Founders Association v. Clarke[18]; Hooper v. Herts[19]; Skinner v. City of London Marine Insurance Corporation[20]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff.\nThe obligation of the seller, Waghorn, was to deliver the shares into the possession of the buyer, Castleman. Can it be said that, in the circumstances, he fulfilled that obligation? All that he gave was a certificate of shares on which was indorsed a transfer in blank. The indorsation, which was not signed by Boecher, the registered owner of the shares, but by his wife for him, may have been regular if the wife was authorized to sign, but it does not appear that there ever was a transfer to Waghorn that would vest in him the property in the shares, which, so far as I can gather from the record, remained in the estate of the deceased Boecher and could not be dealt with except by the executors. The action was brought en temps utile, and respondent has not been prejudiced in any way by the loss of the original certificate or by the delay in forwarding to the office of the company for registration the alleged transfer.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It seems to me this appeal should be allowed with costs on the broad ground that the appellant bargained for that which he never got and which respondent, the vendor, had never in his power to give.\nThe mistake was mutual. The supposed title to the stock rested on a signature which might as well, by reason of its legal inefficacy, have been pure forgery (though I assume it was not), and this defect of title was not discovered by appellant till after the money had been paid by him.\nI do not think the loss of the certificate with this supposed valid indorsement had the effect of depriving the appellant of his right to recover his money.\nThe case is not encumbered with any Stock Exchange rules as to dealing in stock, nor yet with the difficulties presented in Wilkinson v. Lloyd[21], in 1845, as to getting a transfer admitted for register.\nThe shares for $400 of stock to which there may have been a title formed such a mere fraction of the bargain that it seems to me the bargain as a whole failed.\nIndeed the appellants have properly made no contest over that.\nMACLENNAN J.\u2014I would allow the appeal, and agree with the reasons given by Mr. Justice Idington.\nDUFF J.\u2014This action arises out of a sale of shares in the Diamond Vale Coal Company, a company incorporated under the \"British Columbia Companies Act,\" which in all respects material to the questions now to be determined, is a reproduction of the \"Companies Act, 1862.\"\nThe company's articles of association provide that the company shall not recognize, in respect of any share, any trust, any equitable interest, or any right other than the absolute title of the registered holder; that any member may, subject to the restrictions provided by the articles, transfer his share by a transfer in writing signed by the transferor; and that the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register as the holder. There are further articles which are to the effect that, when a share is to be transferred, the transfer accompanied by the certificate of the share to be transferred shall be left at the office of the company with such evidence, if any, as the directors may require to prove the title of the intending transferor; that in the case of the death of a member who is the sole holder of a share the executors or adminstrators of the deceased holder shall be the only persons recognized as having a title to his shares. The articles so far as appears from the extracts placed before us do not impose any restrictions upon the right of a holder of shares to transfer them; but we are informed on the argument that there is in the articles as filed the common provision conferring upon the directors the right to object (upon reasonable grounds) to any proposed transferee; and doubtless the restriction created by this provision, is that referred to in the article (the substance of which is given above), declaring the right of members to transfer their shares.\nUnder an executory sale of shares in such a company the vendor undertakes to execute a valid transfer of shares which he has the right to transfer or to procure the execution of a valid transfer by somebody else who has the right to transfer them. He does not undertake, I think, to procure the entry of the vendee's name in the register. On that point I respectfully concur with the observations of Lord Blackburn (then Blackburn J.) in Maxted v. Paine[22], at pp. 150 and 151, and with the decision of the Court of Session in Stevenson v. Wilson[23].\nOn the contrary it is, I think, as stated by Lord Blackburn in the passage referred to, the duty of the vendee to procure the registration of himself or some other person as holder of the shares sold and thus to relieve the vendor from any burdens which may arise from the fact that the shares are registered in his name.\nWhere the sale is not executory but made by the delivery (in exchange for cash) of a share certificate with a transfer purporting to be executed in blank by the holder named in the certificate (who is not the vendor) the obligation of the vendor cannot be stated in precisely the same terms. In such a case the vendor must, I think, be taken to affirm that the jus disponendi of the shares represented by the certificate is vested in him. He does not represent that he is the legal owner of the shares; for the legal ownership of shares in a company governed by articles such as we have to consider in this case is vested in the person registered as the owner. But the delivery of a share certificate accompanied by a transfer executed in blank by the registered holder may pass to the person receiving such documents \"a title legal and equitable which will enable the holder to vest himself with the shares\" (Colonial Bank v. Cady[24], at p. 277), subject only to any right the company may have to object to register such person as a shareholder; and when a vendor of shares offers such documents for cash he must, I think, be taken by offering them to affirm that such a title (subject to the restriction mentioned) is vested in him by virtue of the certificate and the transfer he thus offers.\nIn the case before us it seems to be quite clear that no such right was vested in the respondents. The evidence shews that the name of the registered holder (James Boecher) had been written by his wife at the bottom of a blank form of transfer indorsed on the share certificate. This was done by Boecher's direction, but the facts in evidence do not warrant any inference that any transaction took place between the husband and the wife which would have the effect of passing to her in his lifetime any interest in the shares. At the utmost his act can only be said to have conferred upon his wife a revocable authority to deal with them which was in fact revoked by his death a short time afterwards. The document so executed thereupon became wholly ineffective for any purpose whatever. Neither the respondents nor the appellant could acquire anything under it; the subsequent delivery of the certificate with the purported transfer indorsed being, in point of law, equivalent to the manual delivery of the certificate alone.\nIt follows that upon the discovery of the facts the appellant had a right to rescind the bargain with the respondents and recover. Back the purchase money as upon a failure of the consideration for which it was paid. He paid for a certificate of shares accompanied by a valid transfer. He received manual delivery of a certificate only. Between the thing paid for and the thing received there was such a diversity of substance as to constitute a failure of consideration.\nIt has been suggested that the respondents had acquired an equitable interest to which the appellant succeeded and that, therefore, the failure of consideration was partial only. I do not think the evidence makes it appear clearly that Mrs. Boecher was at the time of the sale of the certificate to the respondents the sole beneficial owner of the shares\u2014although it may be a nice question whether, since she was under her husband's will the sole residuary legatee, having regard to the fact that the will had been proved (in China) a little over a year previous to that occurrence, it should not be presumed that the debts had been paid in the ordinary course of administration. It would follow (if we were entitled to act on this presumption) that the executor was a bare trustee of these shares for Mrs. Boecher at the time of the sale to the respondents. This will not having, however, been proved in British Columbia the presumption would be of questionable validity; and assuming that at the time of the delivery of the certificate to the respondents Mrs. Boecher had the right to dispose of the shares as the beneficial owner, still I think the difficulty is not met. If I am right in the view I have just expressed touching the character of the representation made by the vendor on the delivery of the documents, then it is quite clear that the appellant did not get what the respondents represented they were giving him. A transfer entitling the purchaser to the registration either of himself or of some nominee of his as owner of the shares purchased is one thing; a right of action, based upon an estoppel against the beneficial owner to compel a trustee to execute such a transfer is in substance a wholly different thing. It was observed in Chanter v. Leese[25], that it is not a sufficient answer to a claim to recover money paid upon consideration which is alleged to have failed to shew that the plaintiff has received something of value:\nWe see, therefore, (said the court) that the consideration is entire, and the payment agreed to be made by the defendants is entire, and we see also a failure of the consideration, which being entire, by failing partially, fails entirely; and it follows that no action can be maintained for the money.\nMr. Ewart's principal contention\u2014the only contention perhaps offering any hope of success\u2014was that assuming the appellant to have had a right to rescind the contract for the reasons mentioned he must in the circumstances of this case be held to have lost it and consequently he must rely upon the appropriate remedy (if any) under the contract. The principle of law is plain. A purchaser who seeks to recover back the purchase money paid under a contract of sale upon an allegation that the consideration has failed must be in a position to rescind the sale. Losing that right he is, of course, confined to his remedy under the contract.\nI think, however, the contention fails on the facts. It is based on two distinct grounds: first, that after discovering the facts the appellant's conduct amounted to an election not to exercise his right to rescind; and second, that when he attempted to exercise that right such changes had taken place that the parties could not be replaced in statu quo.\nAs to the first of these grounds it is said that the appellant having learned of the defect in the transfer not only waited an unreasonable time before making the facts known to the respondents, but that he assumed dominion over the shares by applying to have himself registered as the purchaser. In the circumstances I do not think the delay was unreasonable; nor do I think the action of the appellant in applying for registration affords a solid ground for imputing to him an election to affirm the contract. The head office of the company was in Vancouver; the appellant received the certificate with the transfer in Ottawa about 7th December, 1905; meeting one Smith, the president of the company, in Ottawa, about the same time, he shewed him the transfer stating that he wished it registered. Smith told him the signature appended to the transfer was not in the handwriting of Boecher, but that it was in the handwriting of his widow, who he said (as he erroneously believed) was Boecher's executrix. Smith also told the appellant that if he would send the document to the company's office at Vancouver after his return there, he had no doubt the registration could be completed without any difficulty. Both the appellant and Smith believed, no doubt, that the defect in the transfer was wholly due to inadvertence and could be remedied without the least difficulty. On the 6th of January, the appellant (having, as he says, learned that Smith had reached Vancouver) forwarded the documents to the company's office for their registration.\nUp to this stage there seems to be no ground for attributing to the appellant any unreasonable delay. Neither does one find any basis for imputing to him an election to waive his right to rescind the contract. The appellant could not, I think, be held bound to accept the judgment of Smith on the question of handwriting; rather it would seem to have been his duty to put any such question to the test by forwarding the documents with an application for registration to the office of the company. His action in so doing was therefore not incompatible with a determination to stand upon his rights as against the respondents. A more serious question arises upon the second contention. The facts on which it is based are these. Smith having received the documents at Vancouver sent for John Boecher (who was a son of James Boecher and had attached his signature to the transfer as a witness); gave the documents to him; and he disappeared with them. Failing to recover the documents the company issued a duplicate certificate which the appellant offered to return to the respondents who refused it, offering, however, to return the purchase price on delivery to them of the original share certificate.\nIt is argued that this loss of the share certificate effected such a change in the conditions as to deprive the appellant of his right to rescind.\nWe can only conjecture why Smith handed the documents to Boecher evidence of the interview between them having been at the trial successfully objected to on behalf of the respondents. But assuming it to have been an act which if it had been done by the appellant would have resulted in a loss of his right of rescission, still I do not think that is the effect of Smith's act, because I do not think, in a fair view of the circumstances, that any responsibility for it can be attributed to the appellant. I cannot accept Mr. Ewart's suggestion that Smith was acting as the appellant's agent. I think the opposite view expressed during the hearing by the learned trial judge is that which best accords with the facts in evidence.\nIn the absence of any such agency what is the effect on the appellant's right of this loss of the share certificate? If the document had been stolen or destroyed either accidently or through the default of the company while at the company's office must the appellant for that reason alone lose his rights? I think it is very clear that he would not; and the question before us is indistinguishable from that which such a case would raise. The contract was a contract for the sale of shares. As I have already said in my view one of its terms required the vendee to apply to have himself registered as the owner of the shares, involving the step of putting the documents which were lost in the hands of the company in order that the registration might be effected. The very thing that is to say that the appellant did which led to the loss of the documents was a thing required by the contract. The contract being affected with a vice entitling the vendee to rescind it, on what principle can it be said that, so long as the documents were dealt with as the contract required, the loss of them, from no default of the purchaser, should in any way affect the purchaser's rights? It is to be noted that here the shares themselves were the subjects of the sale; that the lost documents were evidentiary documents only; and the case is consequently not exactly the same as that in which a chattel is lost or injured in the hands of a purchaser who, by reason of a breach of condition, has a right to return it. Even in such a case, however, there is very high authority that the right to rescind the sale is not defeated by the loss of the chattel alone; so long, on the contrary, as the right to return remains in force the risk of loss when it arises without the purchaser's default lies with the vendor. That is the view expressed by Lord Bramwell (then Bramwell B.) in Head v. Tattersall[26], at pp. 12 and 13, and acted upon in Chapman v. Withers[27]. I think, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Livingston, Garrett & King.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Russell & Russell.\n[1] 13 B.C Rep. 351.\n[2] L.R. 1 P.C. 342.\n[3] 31 U.C.Q.B. 279.\n[4] 7 Q.B. 27.\n[5] 28 L.J.Q.B. 279.\n[6] 7 Q.B. 27.\n[7] 11 App. Cas. 20.\n[8] (1902) 1 Ch. 522.\n[9] 33 Beav. 119.\n[10] 33 Beav. 660.\n[11] L.R. 3 Q.B. 584.\n[12] L.R. 3 Q.B. 584.\n[13] 33 Beav. 9.\n[14] (1902) 1 Ch. 522.\n[15] 4 B. & Ad. 647; 1 Nev. & M. 576.\n[16] 11 C.B.

The defence was non-presentment.

There was no evidence that this was done, but the bank which held the cheque sent out a telegram stating that the drawer had no account. At the close of the plaintiff's evidence the trial judge withdrew the case from the jury for want of sufficient evidence, and his order was affirmed by the judgment appealed from.

A wire cable used on a derrick coming in contact with high voltage wires of the Montreal Light, Heat and Power Co., the employee received an electric shock and was being assisted by the foreman of the contractors. The appellant's husband rushed to their assistance and, in trying to extricate the employee, both were killed by electricity passing through the cable.

Subsequently the person with whom the appellant was negotiating was introduced by the prospective purchaser's banker to the agent of the mortgagees, and a sale was brought about for $50,000, the respondent paying the agent a commmission. An action by the appellant for a commission for having procured the purchaser was dismissed by Irving J. at the trial and his judgment was affirmed by the judgment appealed from, Morrison J. dissenting, and it was held that as the appellant had been engaged to find a purchaser at a certain price and having failed to do so he was not entitled to a commission on the sale subsequently made to the person originally introduced by him at a lower price. It was held by Hunter C.J. that when, prim\u00e2 facie, the agreement is to pay a commission on a named price it is for the agent to shew in the clearest way that the intention of the parties was to pay a commission on any sum at which a sale might be effected.

After assuming the contract, the respondent raised a question as to the manner in which payments for the works were to be made to him, on progressive estimates, and this formed the subject of correspondence between Brewder & McNaughton and the appellant, that firm having already given the Ottawa Branch of the bank a power of attorney to draw these moneys from the Government. The respondent wished to be furnished with an undertaking by the bank to pay to him in Montreal the moneys it received under the power of attorney, and the bank's manager, at Ottawa, wrote a letter to Brewder & McNaughton stating that \"as each payment is made to the bank by the Government it will, with your consent, be forwarded to William Hood & Son in payment of their work.\" This arrangement having been assented to by Brewder & McNaughton, the bank wrote to the respondent in regard to drawing the moneys in Montreal, referred to the correspondence with Brewder & McNaughton and enclosed a copy of their letter assenting to the arrangement above mentioned. The moneys received by the bank from the Government were credited to the firm of Brewder & McNaughton and, upon their instructions, certain of the payments were forwarded to the respondent, none being so forwarded except those so authorized. Subsequently, Brewder & McNaughton notified the bank to make no more payments to the respondent and, on their order, some payments were made to another person. In August, 1901, Brewder & McNaughton became insolvent, the Government cancelled their contract and the last payment received from the Government by the bank was placed to their credit. On refusal by the bank to recognize the respondent's demands for payments made from time to time, he brought action against the bank for $3,300 alleged to be due to him out of $3,500 alleged to be in possession of the bank, and for an account of all moneys received by the bank from the Government. The defence to this action was, in substance, that the only agreement the bank made was with Brewder & McNaughton, that this contract was entered into in Ontario and was governed by the law of that province under which there existed no privity of contract between it and the respondent. The respondent's action was maintained at the trial and affirmed, on an appeal, by the Court of Review.\nAfter hearing counsel on behalf of the parties on the present appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, delivered judgment allowing the appeal and reversing the judgment appealed from with costs.\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard and Maclennan JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, but delivered no notes of reasons for judgment.\nIdington J. delivered notes of his reasons in which he discussed the evidence adduced and concluded that it did not shew that the bank had become a party to any contract with the respondent by which it was bound to account to him for the moneys received from the Government.\nDuff J. agreed with Idington J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nShepley K.C. and G.

At the trial the jury answered the questions submitted to them favourably to the plaintiff and assessed damages at $1,000, for which amount judgment was, some time subsequently, entered for the plaintiff. This judgment was affirmed by the judgment from which the appeal was sought. On 24th November, 1908, Maclaren J., in chambers, approved the security offered upon the proposed appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada[2], taking the view that interest from date of judgment on the verdict at the rate of five per cent. per annum, allowed by section 116 of the \"Judicature Act,\" R.S.O. 1897, ch. 51, amounting to $43.50, should be added to the amount of the judgment and that, consequently, an appeal would lie. G. F. Henderson K.C., in supporting the motion, referred to City of Ottawa v. Hunter[3]; Foster v. Emory[4]; Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont[5]; Bresnan v. Bisnaw[6], and cases there cited; Master's S.C. Prac., (3 ed.), p. 48, and cases there cited; London County Council v. Schewzik[7], at page 700; Beale, Cardinal Rules of Legal Interpretation (2 ed.), p. 32.\nChrysler K.C. contra, urged that the judgment on the verdict had been entered long before the decision of the Court of Appeal[8], and contended that the amount of $1,043.50 was the true amount in controversy on the present appeal. He also applied for a stay of execution to enable the company to apply for special leave to appeal, in case such leave was thought necessary.\nThe court granted the motion and quashed the appeal with costs, holding that the amount in controversy was, by the judgment appealed from, that at which damages had been assessed by the verdict of the jury and as interest had not been included in nor made part of such judgment it could not be added in order to bring the controversy involved within the amount limited by the \"Supreme Court Act\" in respect to appeals from the Province of Ontario.\nThe application for stay of execution was refused.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nNote.\u2014On a subsequent application to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, special leave to appeal was refused[9].\n[1] 17 Ont.

The trial judge held that the holder of the policy had a right to have it extended under the first of the above provisions without an application therefor and compliance with the other conditions, as the insurers were bound to apply the moneys in hand to his credit, and that the policy, therefore, was in force when the insured died. This the Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the application, payment, etc., applied to all the benefits to be given to the holder under these conditions, that the policy had lapsed when the insured died and there was no right of action.\nThe question on the second policy was whether or not the premiums after the first two years were payable in advance. The policy was dated 31st March, 1903, and provided that \u201cin consideration of the application * * and of the sum of $17.95, being the premium for one year\u2019s term insurance, to be paid in advance to the company, * * * on the delivery of this policy and the further sum of $33.90 payable annually for an additional term of nineteen years, the first of such additional payments to be made on the 20th day of March, A.D. 1904, insured the life, etc.\u201d The premiums were paid up to the year 1905. The insured died in November, 1906. If the premium was due in advance, in 1906, the policy had lapsed for non\u2011payment. The trial judge held that this provision of the policy, not being clear and explicit, should be construed most favourably to the insured and so as to avoid a forfeiture, and, so reading it, his conclusion was that only the first two years\u2019 premiums were payable in advance and that, therefore, the policy was in force when the insured died. The Court of Appeal reversed this holding also, deciding that every year\u2019s premium was payable on the 20th of March, and that there was no policy, therefore, in existence, in November, 1906, when the insured died.\nThe action was dismissed as to both policies.\nAfter hearing counsel for both parties, the Supreme Court of Canada reserved judgment and, on a subsequent day, dismissed the appeal with costs. Girouard, Maclennan and Duff JJ. adopted the reasoning of Meredith J., in the Court of Appeal, and Davies J, was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.
