K advanced $50,000 to the company pursuant to para. 7 of the agreement and B deposited certain life insurance policies with the Royal Bank pursuant to para. 6, under which B agreed to \"give such security as may be required by the Royal Bank \u2026 to enable the said company to borrow from said bank from time to time as may be required such sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate at any time $50,000.\" In addition to this security the bank required written guarantees and postponements of claims from both B and K. These were signed and given to the bank, each guarantee being limited to $50,000. The bank later increased the company's line of credit to $80,000, and B and K each signed separate forms of guarantee in favour of the bank for that amount.\nK subsequently withdrew from the company; the amount standing to his credit ($29,850) was transferred to the credit of B and all shares held by K and his wife were transferred to B. The consideration passing from B to K was agreed at $29,850 and a mortgage to K to secure payment of this amount was signed by B and his wife. B continued to carry on the business until his death. He and his estate paid to the bank a total of approximately $60,000, being the balance of the company's indebtedness.\nThe plaintiffs, executrices of B's will, asked that the mortgage from B to K be set aside in toto and alternatively that it be set aside as against B's wife, and claimed $29,517.10 by way of contribution being one-half of the amount claimed to have been paid to the bank pursuant to B's guarantee. The trial judge dismissed the claim as to the mortgage but allowed the claim for contribution. K appealed to the Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. The appeal was allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe claim to set aside the mortgage failed on the facts as to which there were concurrent findings in the Courts below, that there was good consideration, that there was no misrepresentation made to B's wife and that no undue influence was exercised.\nThe claim for contribution also failed. Co-sureties were free to agree as to the proportions in which as between themselves they should contribute or that one of them should pay the whole amount. Such an agreement would not affect the right of the creditor to whom they were bound to claim against any one or more of them as he saw fit, but it would be binding as between the sureties. The agreement in question obligated B to pay the first $50,000 of the liability of the company to the bank for which he and K were both sureties. Nor were the appellants entitled to contribution as to the $9,034.21 paid by B and his estate in excess of the $50,000. From the date of K's withdrawal from the company, as between B and K, the whole benefit resulting from the suretyship was B's. The rule that the one who gets the whole benefit must bear the whole burden was equally applicable in equity as at common law, and was applicable to and decisive against the appellants' claim for contribution in regard to the sum of $9,034.21.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowing an appeal and dismissing a cross-appeal from a judgment of Bastin J. Appeal dismissed.\nA. S. Dewar, Q.C., and R. R. Brock, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nC. J. Keith, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowing an appeal and dismissing a cross-appeal from a judgment of Bastin J. In the result the action of the plaintiffs was dismissed in toto.\nFor some time prior to the year 1956 the late George Benjamin Gordon Bater, hereinafter referred to as \"Bater\" had been employed by others in the business of livestock commission buying. In that year he decided to go into business for himself. The respondent, who had been in the horse business for many years, had substantial financial resources. On October 1, 1956, Bater, as party of the first part and Kare as party of the second part entered into an agreement under the terms of which they were to associate themselves together in a company to be incorporated 'under the name of G. B. Bater Agencies Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \"the company\", to carry on the business of livestock commission buying at the Union Stock Yards in St. Boniface, Manitoba. This agreement provided that the authorized capital of the company should be $50,000 divided into 1,000 Class \"A\" common shares of $1 each, 1,000 Class \"B\" common shares of $1 each and 480 redeemable preference shares of $100 each and that Bater should subscribe for 600 Class \"A\" common shares and Kare for 600 Class \"B\" common shares. This was done in due course and apparently no other shares were issued. The agreement provided that the holders of \"B\" shares should be entitled to receive dividends equal to one-third of the amount of the dividends declared on \"A\" shares, that the directors of the company should be Bater, Mrs. Bater, Kare and Mrs. Kare, that Bater should be president, Mrs. Bater vice-president and Kare secretary-treasurer.\nParagraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement read as follows:\n6. The Party of the First Part shall give such security as may be required by the Royal Bank of Canada, Stock Yards Branch, St. Boniface, Manitoba, to enable the said company to borrow from said bank from time to time as may be required such sum or sums not exceeding in the aggregate at any time $50,000.\n7. The Party of the Second Part shall whenever requested by the Party of the First Part or by said company to do so, shall advance from time to time to said company such sum or sums as may be required not exceeding at any time $50,000 in the aggregate, the advances to be made to said company without interest and in consideration of this agreement being entered into.\nWhen the company had been organized Kare advanced $50,000 to it pursuant to paragraph 7 and Bater deposited certain life insurance policies with the Royal Bank pursuant to paragraph 6 but in addition to this security the bank required written guarantees and postponements of claims from both Bater and Kare. These were signed and given to the bank, each guarantee being limited to $50,000.\nIn October 1958, the bank increased the company's line of credit to $80,000 and Bater and Kare each signed separate forms of guarantee, identically worded, in favour of the bank for that amount. These documents contained the following paragraph:\n(4) The undersigned or any of them may, by notice in writing delivered to the Manager of the branch or agency of the Bank receiving this instrument, determine their or his liability under this guarantee in respect of liabilities thereafter incurred or arising but not in respect of any liabilities theretofore incurred or arising even though not then matured, provided, however, that notwithstanding receipt of any such notice the Bank may fulfil any requirements of the customer based on agreements express or implied made prior to the receipt of such notice and any resulting liabilities shall be covered by this guarantee; and provided further that in the event of the determination of this guarantee as to one or more of the undersigned it shall remain a continuing guarantee as to the other or others of the undersigned.\nUp to this time the business had prospered and it continued to do so until in December 1959 an American customer defaulted in its account with the company to the extent of about $50,000.\nIn the summer of 1960 the respondent withdrew from the company. At this time the amount standing to his credit in the books of the company was $29,850. This amount was transferred from the credit of Kare to that of Bater. All the shares held by Kare and Mrs. Kare were transferred to Bater. The Kares ceased to be directors of the company and Bater became its sole signing officer. A letter, dated September 27, 1960, from the firm of solicitors who acted for Bater reported to him \"upon the completion of your settlement with Isaac Kare\".\nThe consideration passing from Bater to Kare was agreed at $29,850 and a mortgage to Kare to secure payment of this amount was signed by Bater and Mrs. Bater. The mortgage was for $37,400; the additional amount was that of a first mortgage which Kare agreed to pay off out of the moneys paid to him under his mortgage. The mortgaged property was the home of Mr. and Mrs. Bater and was owned jointly by them. The mortgage was dated August 30, 1960; it was repayable $100 weekly until the first Monday in August 1967, when the balance became due; it bore interest at 7 per cent.\nFollowing this settlement the respondent had no further connection with the company but the bank retained his guarantee and he gave no notice determining his liability thereunder. Bater continued to carry on the business of the company until his death on January 15, 1962. During this period he made payments on account of the mortgage totalling $1,250. No suggestion was made during Bater's lifetime that the mortgage was not valid.\nBetween the date of Kare's withdrawal from the company and the date of Bater's death the amount of the company's indebtedness to the bank varied widely. As of September 1, 1958, it appears to have been $50,179.31. Thereafter the indebtedness at the end of each month was sometimes more than $50,000 and sometimes less than that amount.\nOn December 30, 1960, Bater cashed a pension policy and paid to the bank on account of the company's indebtedness $15,976.78. After Bater's death his executors paid $43,560.79 the balance of the company's indebtedness to the bank, making a total paid under Bater's guarantee to the bank of $59,437.57. In the statement of claim it was alleged that the amount so paid was $59,034.21; this figure does not appear to have been questioned and was accepted by the learned trial judge. The bank did not at any time call upon Kare under his guarantee.\nOn March 19, 1962, probate of Bater's will was granted to the appellants. On July 11, 1962, the statement of claim in this action was issued asking that the mortgage from Bater to Kare be set aside in toto and alternatively that it be set aside as against Mrs. Bater, and claiming $29,517.10 by way of contribution being one-half of the amount claimed to have been paid to the bank pursuant to Bater's guarantee.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the claim as to the mortgage but allowed the claim for contribution. Kare appealed to the Court of Appeal and the present appellants cross-appealed. The appeal was allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. The appellants now appeal to this Court.\nThe claim to set aside the mortgage fails on the facts as to which there are concurrent findings in the Courts below, that there was good consideration, that there was no misrepresentation made to Mrs. Bater and that no undue influence was exercised. All of these findings are supported by the evidence. On this branch of the matter I am in substantial agreement with the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge and those of the Court of Appeal.\nTurning to the claim for contribution, the general rule is well settled; it is stated as follows in de Colyar on Guarantees, 3rd ed., 1897, at p. 338:\nIt often happens that where there are more sureties than one for the same principal debtor, the creditor makes one surety pay the whole debt, or more than his just share or proportion of such debt. Whenever this occurs, the surety who has thus been made to pay has a right to recover from his co-sureties their respective shares of the sum which he has paid to the common creditor.\nThat this is the general rule was not questioned in the Courts below or before us; the question is whether the special circumstances of this case have rendered the rule inapplicable; in my opinion, they have done so.\nThere can be no doubt that co-sureties are free to agree as to the proportions in which as between themselves they shall contribute or that one of them shall pay the whole amount. Such an agreement, of course, would not affect the right of the creditor to whom they are bound to claim against any one or more of them as he saw fit, but it would be binding as between the sureties.\nFor the reasons given in the Court of Appeal I agree that, on its true construction, the agreement of October 1, 1956, and particularly paragraph 6 thereof, obligated Bater to pay the first $50,000 of the liability of the company to the bank for which he and Kare were both sureties.\nIt remains to consider the final argument of Mr. Dewar that, at all events, the appellants are entitled to contribution as to the $9,034.21 paid by Bater and his estate in excess of the $50,000.\nIn my opinion, this argument is not entitled to prevail. In this case the benefit derived from Bater and Kare continuing as sureties for the company's running account with the bank after Kare had made his settlement with Bater and withdrawn from the company was in the first instance that of the company but Bater alone was then interested in the company and alone stood to gain from its continued operations. From the date of Kare's withdrawal, as between Bater and Kare, the whole benefit resulting from the suretyship was Bater's. The principle here applicable is accurately stated in the notes to Lampleigh v. Brathwait in Smith's Leading Cases, 13th ed., vol. 1, p. 163, as follows:\nThe right to contribution exists even though the co-sureties became bound by separate instruments and without the knowledge the one of the other; in such a case the right of contribution, although it may have originated in equity upon the principle equality is equity (see per Parke, B., in Davies v. Humphreys, 6 M. & W. 168) nevertheless is more properly put at law upon the principle that \"where two persons are under an obligation to the same performance, though by different instruments, if both share the benefit which forms the consideration, they must divide the burden; if one only gets the benefit he must bear the whole\".\nThe rule that the one who gets the whole benefit must bear the whole burden is equally applicable in equity; indeed it has been said that the maxim qui sentit commodum sentire debet et onus is but one aspect of the comprehensive rule \"equality is equity\". (See Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed., p. 484.) In my opinion, on the facts of this case, the maxim referred to is applicable to and decisive against the appellants' claim for contribution in regard to the sum of $9,034.21.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Thompson, Dilts, Jones, Hall, Dewar & Ritchie, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Keith & Westbury, Winnipeg.\n",

The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 212\nDate: 1964-01-28\nHenry Koury (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty the Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1963: November 19, 20; 1964: January 28.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Conviction for fraud\u2014Acquittal on charge of conspiracy\u2014Whether inconsistency\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 592, 597.\nThe appellant and three others were charged on an indictment containing, inter alia, a count of fraud and a count of conspiracy to commit the fraud. He was convicted with the others on the count of fraud and, while he was acquitted on the count of conspiracy, the three others were convicted on that count. The appellant\u2019s defence was that he withdrew from the association at a certain time and took no part in the actual fraud except as a friendly bystander without criminal intent. The case put against him by the Crown was that he was an aider and abettor. The Court of Appeal maintained the convictions. The appellant alone appealed to this Court by leave on the ground that his conviction for fraud should be set aside as inconsistent with his acquittal for conspiracy.\nHeld (Cartwright, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.: The judge\u2019s charge was correct in both fact and law and he was under no compulsion to direct that if the jury acquitted the appellant on the conspiracy count he could not be convicted with the others on a count of committing that very offence.\nThe two offences dealt with in these two counts were distinct and separate offences. There was no inconsistency requiring the quashing of the conviction for fraud because of the acquittal for conspiracy. The appellant was convicted for fraud on ample evidence and pursuant to a correct instruction that it was necessary for the Crown to show a common intent or design among all four accused in doing whatever the jury found they did. Aiding and abetting pursuant to a common intent and design is not necessarily the same thing as the conspiracy charge in this case and it was not.\nOn the evidence the error, if any, was in the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy and not in the conviction on the substantive offence. The appellant was properly convicted and his acquittal on the charge of conspiracy did not vitiate this conviction or give rise to any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. This Court was not compelled to defer to this acquittal for the purpose of quashing the conviction for fraud, and was entitled to look at the facts behind the record of the acquittal. There was no error in the conduct of this trial, the appellant was properly convicted on the count of fraud and there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nIt was doubtful as to whether there was in this case any question of law which would give this Court jurisdiction under s. 597 of the Criminal Code. But it was not necessary to decide this.\nPer Cartwright, Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting: The trial judge ought to have told the jury that if they acquitted the accused on either of these two counts they should acquit him on both. It was impossible to see how the jury could consistently acquit the appellant on the count of conspiracy and convict him on the count of fraud. In the circumstances of this case if, as was the theory of the Crown, the appellant aided the others in carrying out their dishonest purposes he would have been guilty of conspiring with them and this was negatived by the verdict of not guilty on the count of conspiracy which stands unimpeached. The appellant could only be convicted on the count of fraud if the jury were satisfied that he was acting in concert with the others. The appellant was said to be guilty of acting together with three others, which was of course conspiracy, while at the same time he was said to be not guilty of conspiring with the three others. His conviction on the count of fraud was inconsistent with his acquittal on the count of conspiracy and could not stand.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: The verdict of the jury on the conspiracy count constituted a finding that three of the accused agreed to a plan to defraud but that the appellant, who was familiar with the details of the plan, joined the others and played a vital role in putting the plan into effect without having agreed to do so. The verdict on the fraud count was inconsistent with the finding on the conspiracy count. Before a conspiracy can be complete, there must be evidence both of common design and of an agreement to carry that design into effect. If the appellant had been a party to the conspiracy to defraud, then his acts of participation in the perpetration of the fraud would have been an essential part of the conduct which caused the common unlawful design to pass from the stage of intention into that of action. As he was found not guilty of that conspiracy, his acts could not have that quality and could not justify a finding of guilty on the fraud count. The evidence against the appellant, if believed, was only consistent with mutual consent between himself and the others in the execution of their common unlawful design and the finding that there was no such mutual consent carried with it the corollary that the appellant could not have participated jointly with the others in the manner alleged in the fraud count. It was strongly suggested that the jury treated the acts of the appellant as being the acts of an aider and abettor rather than being the innocent acts of courtesy which the appellant swore they were. This suggestion could not be accepted. The two verdicts were irreconcilable on their face and this Court could not inquire as to the underlying causes which may have contributed to this inconsistency.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmining the appellant\u2019s conviction for fraud. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright, Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting.\nG.A. Martin, Q.C., and E.P. Hartt, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.A. Hoolihan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal by Henry Koury from his conviction after a trial before Gale J. and jury upon a charge that Roy Robertson, Henry Koury (the present appellant), Andre Begin and D. Charles Stuart, in the month of March 1960, did obtain certain moneys therein set out by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. At the trial, these four accused were charged in an indictment containing, inter alia, the following counts:\n1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin, and D. Charles Stuart in or about the month of March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, did unlawfully by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n* * *\n5. The said jurors further present that the said Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin and D. Charles Stuart, in or about the months of January, February and March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, and elsewhere, did unlawfully conspire and agree together and with one another to commit the indictable offence of fraud, to wit: by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars contrary to the Criminal Code.\nAll four of the accused were convicted on count number 1. The three accused Robertson, Begin and Stuart were convicted on count number 5 but Koury was acquitted on that count. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by all four accused, the appeals were dismissed. Koury now appeals to this Court. Leave for such appeal was granted under the provisions of s. 597(1) (b) of the Criminal Code upon the following grounds:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the conviction of Koury on Count One was not inconsistent with his acquittal on Count Five?\n2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in failing to hold that the conviction of Koury on Count One was bad in law?\n3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that there was no evidence by virtue of which the conviction of Koury on Count One could be sustained consistently with the acquittal of Koury on Count Five?\nGround 2 does not state a question of law for the consideration of this Court and the sole issue in this appeal is whether the conviction of Koury with his three co-accused on count 1 should be set aside as inconsistent with his acquittal on count 5.\nThe appellant submits that since he was acquitted on the charge of conspiracy to commit the indictable offence, he could not be convicted with others on a count of com- mitting that very offence. He also repeats in this Court his submission made for the first time in the Court of Appeal that the judge\u2019s charge should have contained a direction to that effect. In my opinion, the judge\u2019s charge was correct in both fact and law and he was under no compulsion to give this direction, which was not even asked for.\nIn spite of the complexity of detail and the lengthy trial, the issue, as far as this person is concerned, can be stated in a few words. The appellant says that at a certain time he withdrew from his association with his co-accused, whatever that association may have amounted to at that time, and that he took no further part in the scheme. But the evidence shows that notwithstanding this protestation, he went on, together with the other three co\u2011accused, to take part in the stripping of the valuable assets of this company in return for worthless assets or promises. On this evidence the jury properly convicted the appellant of fraud and had that count stood alone, it could not have been set aside on appeal. We have, therefore, this assumed position of error. This man participated in the commission of the fraud but he did not conspire to commit the fraud.\nThe trial judge correctly instructed the jury on counts 1 and 5 and he put to the jury the accused\u2019s defence that he withdrew from the association at a certain point of time and that he took no part in the actual fraud except as a friendly bystander without criminal intent. In acquitting the accused of conspiracy, the jury must have found that he withdrew from the association before the conspiracy had been entered into, for the judge made it very clear in his charge that the offence of conspiracy was complete once the agreement was made.\nOn count 1 (the substantive offence) the judge made it equally clear that the Crown had to show a conscious participation in a common design and conscious and deliberate assistance between the aider and abettor and the other persons. The case put against Koury on count 1 was that he was an aider and abettor.\nThe two offences dealt within these two counts are distinct and separate offences (The Queen v. Kravenia[1]). There is no inconsistency that requires the quashing of the conviction of Koury on count 1 because of his acquittal on count 5. As to the conviction on count 1, there was ample evidence to support it. The recent case in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England, Regina v. Scaramanga[2], has no application here. This accused was convicted on count 1 pursuant to a correct instruction that it was necessary for the Crown to show a common intent or design among all four accused in doing whatever the jury found they did. Aiding and abetting pursuant to a common intent and design is not necessarily the same thing as the conspiracy charged in count 5 and it is not the same thing in this case. On this ground alone I would dismiss the appeal.\nThere are, however, broader implications in the argument submitted in this case. The argument is that once it is shown on the face of the record that there is an inconsistency then the quashing of the conviction must follow automatically citing Regina v. Sweetland[3]. That theory of inconsistent verdicts grew up at common law. I can well understand its application before the constitution of a Court of Criminal Appeal when the only mode of review, apart from the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, was the Writ of Error, which brought before the reviewing tribunal only the indictment, the plea and the verdict. With a vitiating inconsistency appearing on the face of this limited record, all that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench could do was to quash the conviction.\nBut a case does not now come before a provincial Court of Appeal on this limited record. We have, in addition, the Judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the whole of the evidence on which it is based. We can also see in a limited way from the objections made to the charge, how defence counsel wishes to have his defence put to the jury. A Court of Appeal has had no difficulty in dealing with inconsistent convictions for theft, receiving and obtaining by fraud relating to the same property; Kelly v. The King[4]. In the same way in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[5], when the accused were charged with conspiracy to steal and stealing, and conspiracy to defraud and fraud in connection with the same property and were convicted by the jury on all four counts, this Court decided, in affirming the Manitoba Court of Appeal, that the offence disclosed was fraud and conspiracy to defraud and not theft. To the extent indicated in these cases, the Court of Appeal then can sort out the inconsistency.\nThe appellant, however, argues that this case is different and that even if the Court may look at the complete proceedings the verdicts are inconsistent. Four accused are jointly charged with doing the act and the same four are jointly charged with conspiracy to do that very act. The appellant says that in this situation it must be all or nothing and that he cannot be found guilty of doing the act with others because the jury has found that he did not conspire to do this act with them.\nIn my view, this argument adopts a wrong interpretation of the judgment in Regina v. Sweetland, where Goddard L.C.J. said at p. 66:\nThis Court is not laying down in this case, and has no intention of allowing this case to be quoted as an authority for saying, that, whenever a verdict of Not Guilty is returned on a count for conspiracy to commit offences and Guilty on other counts in the same indictment charging those specific offences, or contrariwise when a verdict of Guilty is returned on the count of conspiracy and Not Guilty on the counts charging specific offences, the verdict is necessarily inconsistent. Each case must depend on its particular circumstances, and it is very dangerous in circumstances of this sort to lay down general rules which could be quoted when the facts might be entirely different.\nTo give effect to this submission would be to ignore the common sense of the trial. Courts of Appeal do not now operate under 19th century procedural limitations. On the evidence that we can now examine, the error, if any, is in the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy and not in the conviction on the substantive offence. We can say with assurance that on this record, which includes the whole of the evidence, the judge\u2019s charge and the objections of defence counsel to the charge, that this man was properly convicted and that his acquittal on conspiracy does not vitiate this conviction or give rise to any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. We are not compelled to defer to this acquittal for the purpose of quashing the conviction on fraud. We are not engaged in a process of logic chopping and we are entitled to look at the facts behind the record of the acquittal.\nIt has been stated that there was error on the part of the trial judge in not instructing the jury that they could not acquit on conspiracy and at the same time bring in a verdict of guilty on the substantive offence. This seems to me to ignore the theory put forward by the defence at the trial and which the trial judge submitted to the jury. This was that the appellant withdrew from association with his co-accused at a certain time before there was any conspiracy and that he should be acquitted on this count. Further, the defence submitted that the jury should find that he did not participate in the commission of the fraud because he was merely there as a friendly bystander without any criminal intent. The two defences had to be put together. There would have been error if the judge had not instructed the jury along these lines. The jury rejected one of these defences but gave effect to the other, which merely means that they were saying that at a certain time this man did withdraw from his association. I think that they were wrong in so finding in view of the subsequent conduct of the accused but this makes no difference. I do not think that the trial judge could have put it to the jury that it was all or nothing.\nIt was never put to the trial judge that he should consider the possibility of inconsistent verdicts and instruct the jury accordingly. Indeed, when the jury came back with these verdicts which are now said to be inconsistent, he was not asked to instruct the jury to deal with the supposed inconsistency. There was no error in the conduct of this trial and I am prepared to decide (a) that the appellant was properly convicted on count 1; (b) that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThe principle stated in Regina v. Sweetland, supra, that there is no general rule that whenever there is an acquittal on a count of conspiracy to commit certain offences and a conviction on other counts in the same indictment charging those specific offences, the verdict is necessarily inconsistent, was never challenged in argument by the appellant. In view of that principle, I have some doubt as to whether there is any question of law which would give this Court jurisdiction under s. 597 of the Criminal Code.\nThe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to have allowed the appellant\u2019s appeal, had it thought fit so to do, is defined in s. 592 of the Criminal Code. It could have done so if it were of the opinion that:\n(i) The verdict of the jury on count one was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. (ii) The judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law.\n(iii) There was a miscarriage of justice.\nThere has been no submission that there was a wrong decision on a question of law by the trial Court, other than the suggestion, not made at the trial, that the jury ought to have been instructed in the charge regarding the possibility of inconsistency of verdicts, which submission I do not accept. The case before the Court of Appeal must have been based upon the proposition that the verdict of the jury on count one was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence in the light of the appellant\u2019s acquittal on count five.\nDoes the refusal of the Court of Appeal to allow the appellant\u2019s appeal on those grounds raise an issue of law?\nThis is not a case within those authorities cited by the appellant in which one person has been found guilty of conspiracy and all the other alleged conspirators have been acquitted, or in which one person has been found guilty of being accessory to a murder when all of the alleged murderers have been acquitted. In this case the law is that the verdict of guilty of the specific offence is not necessarily inconsistent with an acquittal on a charge of conspiracy to commit that offence. Whether or not the verdict of guilty was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence would appear to involve a decision, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, on a question of mixed law and fact.\nI do not, however, wish to express any final opinion on this isue, particularly as it was not raised by the respondent and consequently was not argued before us.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant before Gale J. and a jury at the Toronto assizes.\nThe trial commenced on March 19, 1962, and ended on May 16, 1962. The appellant was indicted jointly with three other persons, Robertson, Begin and Stuart. The indictment contained eight counts in each of which the four accused were jointly charged.\nCounts 1 and 5 with which we are chiefly concerned read as follows:\n1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin and D. Charles Stuart in or about the month of March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, did unlawfully by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n5. The said jurors further present that the said Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin, and D. Charles Stuart in or about the months of January, February, and March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto, in the County of York, and elsewhere, did unlawfully conspire and agree together and with one another to commit the indictable offence of fraud, to wit: by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars contrary to the Criminal Code.\nIt will be observed that the indictable offence which it is alleged in count 5 that the four accused conspired to commit is the substantive offence which it is charged in count 1 that they did commit.\nCount 2 charged the four accused with having defrauded Guaranty Trust Company of Canada of $50,000 in trust money. This is the same $50,000 as that referred to in count 1. Count 2 was framed to cover the possibility of this money at the time it was taken being regarded as the property of the Trust Company rather than of Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited.\nCounts 3 and 4 were alternative to counts 1 and 2, they charged theft (rather than fraud) in regard to the same property as was described in counts 1 and 2.\nCounts 6, 7 and 8 charged the four accused with conspiring to commit the substantive offences charged in counts 2, 3 and 4.\nThe jury found all four of the accused guilty on count 1, adding a recommendation for leniency as to Koury and Begin; they found Robertson, Begin and Stuart guilty on count 5, adding a recommendation for leniency as to Begin; they found the appellant not guilty on count 5; they found Stuart alone guilty on count 2; on all the remaining counts \u2018they found all the accused not guilty.\nAll of the accused appealed against their convictions to the Court of Appeal. All of the appeals were dismissed. Koury alone has appealed to this Court.\nThe questions of law upon which leave to appeal to this Court was given are as follows:\n1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the conviction of Koury on count one was not inconsistent with his acquittal on count five?\n2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in failing to hold that the conviction of Koury on count one was bad in law?\n3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that there was no evidence by virtue of which the conviction of Koury on count one could be sustained consistently with the acquittal of Koury on count five?\nIt is not necessary to state the facts at any great length. Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cStadacona\u201d, was a mining company. Early in 1960 it no longer had a producing property and was losing money. Prior to March 10, 1960, Robertson owned, or controlled through other companies, 625,000 shares of Stadacona; this was said to be a sufficient number of shares to give him working control of that company. He was its president.\nOn the morning of March 10, 1960, Stadacona owned assets of $368,196 consisting of the following:\nMining equipment valued at $35,000;\nNegotiable securities valued at $40,000;\nAccounts receivable in the form of call loans owed to it almost entirely by the accused Robertson and his companies; $175,000;\nCash deposited in a new bank account at the Guaranty Trust Company, Toronto on March 10, 1960, $118,196.\nBy the end of that day Stadacona had parted with all of the above-mentioned assets except $68,196. The main step by which this was brought about was the making of a call loan by Stadacona to a company called Norado Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cNorado\u201d, which was said to be without assets. On March 7, 1960, Koury, who had previously controlled Norado, had turned over the control of that company to Stuart.\nAs a result of the transactions carried out on March 10 (Robertson received in money, equipment, securities and by the extinguishment of his indebtedness to Stadacona $250,000. For this he transferred his 625,000 shares to Norado; these were said to be worth less than $75,000; Norado which had no other assets paid for these shares with the money loaned to it, without security, by Stadacona. The transaction was put through by new directors of both companies, who had little business experience, and were selected by Stuart. Shortly afterwards Stuart caused Norado to pay out to him the $50,000 remaining in its bank account in the Guaranty Trust Company in exchange for some mining claims stated to be of little value. As Stuart alone was convicted on count 2 and all the accused were acquitted on count 6 the jury must have taken the view that this last-mentioned transaction was that of Stuart and that the other three accused were not involved in it.\nIn the negotiations between Robertson and Stuart leading up to the main transaction above referred to Begin acted as Robertson\u2019s lawyer and Koury acted as Stuart\u2019s lawyer. Koury from time to time consulted Mr. Stirrett a solicitor in Toronto. It was the theory of Koury\u2019s defence that as soon as Stirrett advised him that the proposed transaction, and particularly the making of the call loan of $300,000, was an improper one he dissociated himself from it and that anything he did thereafter was done as a mere matter of courtesy. The theory of the Crown, on the other hand, was that Koury took an active part in the completion of the transaction and particularly that he co-operated in arranging the necessary meetings, indicated the manner in which the call loan to Norado should be authorized and assisted in carrying out the delivery of the share certificates from Robertson to Stuart.\nThe charge of the learned trial judge was, of necessity, a lengthy one. He made it clear to the jury that in his view it was open to them to convict or to acquit Koury on count 1 and also on count 5. He did not tell them that if they acquitted him on either of these counts they should acquit him on both. With respect, in my opinion, he ought to have done so. After reading the opening address to the jury of counsel for the Crown, the charge of the learned trial judge and the relevant evidence which counsel for the appellant and for the respondent called to our attention, I find it impossible to see how the jury could consistently acquit the appellant on count 5 and convict him on count 1.\nThere is no evidence that Koury sought for himself or obtained any part of the assets of which Stadacona was defrauded. The theory of the Crown was that knowing the dishonest purposes of Robertson and Stuart he aided them in carrying them out. If he did this, in the circumstances of this case, he would have been guilty of conspiring with them and that he did so conspire has been negatived by the verdict of not guilty on count 5 which stands unimpeached.\nIt is well settled, and indeed I did not understand it to be questioned in argument, that where an accused is convicted on one charge and acquitted on another and the verdicts are inconsistent the conviction cannot stand. Whether or not two verdicts are inconsistent depends upon the particular circumstances of the case in which the question arises.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered orally by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario at the conclusion of the argument which had taken up four days. The question with which we are concerned was dealt with as follows:\nAs to the accused Koury, it was argued on his behalf,...secondly, that the conviction on count 1 was inconsistent with the acquittal on count 5... As to the second contention, Mr. Martin referred to and relied particularly and mainly upon the case of Regina v. Sweetland, 42 C.A.R. p. 62. It was made abundantly plain in that case that the decision was reached on the particular facts and that the Court was not laying down any principle of law. We are of the opinion that the facts in the case at bar are different from those in the Sweetland case, 42 Cr. App. R. 62. In our opinion the proper principles were stated in Rex v. Lenton (1947) O.R. 155 at p. 161 and R. v. Kupferberg 13 Cr. App. R. 166 at p. 168.\nIn R. v. Kupferberg[6], the conviction of the appellant was at a trial subsequent to the one at which he had been acquitted of conspiracy. The argument of the defence was based on a plea of autrefois acquit. There appears to have been no direct reference to the rule that inconsistent verdicts cannot stand or to an argument based on res judicata such, for example, as was dealt with in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya[7]. The passage in the judgment in Kupferberg\u2019s case on which counsel for the respondent relies is at p. 168 and reads as follows:\nCounsel further contended that the appellant was entitled successfully to plead autrefois acquit at the second trial, because at the first trial he had been acquitted of certain charges of conspiracy which were framed under the same Regulation as that which formed the basis of the charges made against him at the second trial. That also appears to the Court to be an erroneous contention. A charge of conspiracy is not the same as one of aiding and abetting. It is true that in many cases aiding and abetting is done by the mutual consent of the criminals, but it is not essential that it should be. For a plea of autrefois acquit to be maintainable, the offence of which the accused has been acquitted and that with which he is charged must be the same in the sense that each must have the same essential ingredients. The facts which constitute the one must be sufficient to justify a conviction for the other. To prove conspiracy against the appellant, it is necessary that an agreement, express or implied, should be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, but it is quite unnecessary to prove such agreement where the charge is one of aiding and abetting. In the latter case, it is only necessary to show that the appellant appreciated what was going on and did something to further it.\nIt seems clear that if the Court in Kupferberg\u2019s case had considered that the aiding and abetting by the accused was done with the mutual consent of those who had been indicted with him on the conspiracy count his appeal would have been allowed.\nIn the case at bar there is no room for the suggestion that Koury gave any unsolicited aid or did anything to further the perpetration of the fraud otherwise than with the consent of and in co-operation with the other accused. Whenever he indicated a desire to withdraw either Stuart or Begin or both of them pressed him to continue his assistance.\nIn Lenton\u2019s case[8], the accused and one Hicks were charged with conspiring to commit the indictable offence of forcibly seizing or confining one Neilson and also with the substantive offence of unlawfully seizing and confining him. Both the accused and Hicks were acquitted on the conspiracy count and convicted of the substantive offence. The part played by the accused was confined to the sending of telegrams. He first learned of the matter after Neilson had been seized and confined. Following the receipt of a telegram from one Schmaltz reading:\nArrived Jackfish met nine scabs aboard train they return with J. Osipindo union men steamer Kenora has 26 scabs aboard they hollered \u2018from boat they were locked aboard two days we hold company man F. Neilson Steamer Kenora gone out to anchor advice immediately what to do urgent two steamers in bay boys are under pressure to sail contact police.\nthe accused sent a telegram to Hicks reading:\nHold official stop have two pickets inform citizens of our case stop request them wire Minister of Justice to take action stop hold the fort we are taking case to R.C.M.P. and will swear out warrant stop excellent work.\nThe only passage in the reasons touching the question with which we are concerned reads as follows:\nAs to the first point, it was quite open to the jury to find that although appellant and his alleged co-conspirators arrived at no common agreement to commit the indictable offences as charged, yet appellant, within the meaning of s. 69 of the Code, and independently of any conspiracy counselled or procured the confining of Neilson. Upon the evidence there is no inconsistency in these findings. Even accepting appellant\u2019s own evidence as to the contents of the telegram of 6.55 a.m., it was quite open to the jury to believe that appellant was counselling or procuring Hicks to detain Neilson in the complete absence of any conspiracy between them to bring about such detention.\nThe Court amended the conviction to read guilty of unlawfully confining Neilson instead of guilty of unlawfully and forcibly seizing and confining Neilson.\nIt seems obvious that the accused could not have been a party to a conspiracy to bring about Neilson\u2019s detention since that had been brought about before the accused was brought into the matter at all. I cannot find that this judgment enunciates any principle helpful in the decision of the case at bar.\nIn R. v. Sweetland[9], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 66:\nThis Court is not laying down in this case, and has no intention of allowing this case to be quoted as an authority for saying, that, whenever a verdict of Not Guilty is returned on a count for conspiracy to commit offences and Guilty on other counts in the same indictment charging those specific offences, or contrariwise when a verdict of Guilty is returned on the count of conspiracy and Not Guilty on the counts charging specific offences, the verdict is necessarily inconsistent. Each case must depend on its particular circumstances, and it is very dangerous in circumstances of this sort to lay down general rules which could be quoted when the facts might be entirely different.\nAt p. 68 the Lord Chief Justice said:\nIt may be that this matter would have been cleared up if the Recorder had told the jury to consider their verdict further. As he did not do so, we think that Mr. Clarke is justified in saying that in this particular case there does appear to be on the face of it an inconsistency in the verdict. Persons are said to be guilty of acting together, which is of course, conspiracy, in obtaining cheques by false pretences while at the same time they are said to be not guilty of conspiring to obtain them by false pretences.\nIn the case at bar Koury could only be convicted on count 1 if the jury were satisfied that he was acting in concert with the other accused. There is no suggestion in the evidence that he committed some independent act of fraud on Stadacona and had there been such evidence he could not have been convicted of that independent act on a count charging him jointly with the other three accused who were convicted. The authorities on this point are collected in the recent judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, delivered by Lord Parker of Waddington, in R. v. Scaramanga[10]. The effect of the judgment is summarized in the following paragraph at p. 220:\nIn our judgment, except where provided by statute, when two persons are jointly charged with one offence, judgment cannot stand against both of them on a finding that an offence has been committed by each independently.\nThe circumstances of the case at bar appear to me to fall directly within the last sentence quoted above from the judgment of Lord Goddard at p. 68 of Sweetland\u2019s case. Adapting his words to the facts of the case before us, Koury is said to be guilty of acting together with Robertson, Begin and Stuart, which is of course conspiracy, in defrauding Stadacona while at the same time he is said to be not guilty of conspiring with Robertson, Begin and Stuart to defraud Stadacona. In my opinion the conviction of Koury on count 1 is inconsistent with his acquittal on count 5 and cannot stand.\nWhen these two inconsistent verdicts were rendered it would have been proper for the learned trial judge to have given the jury a further direction, pointing out the inconsistency, and to have sent them back to reconsider their verdicts as to Koury on counts 1 and 5. Had this course been followed no one can say what the result would have been.\nI would allow the appeal, direct that the verdict finding the appellant guilty on count 1 of the indictment be quashed and that a verdict of acquittal be entered.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts giving rise to this appeal have been fully set forth in the reasons of other members of the Court and I will endeavour not to repeat more of what they have said than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of making my views clear.\nHaving regard to the charge of the learned trial judge and to those parts of the evidence to which our attention was directed by both counsel, I am of opinion that the verdict of the jury on count 5 of this indictment constitutes a finding that three of the accused agreed to a plan for defrauding the Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited but that the fourth (the appellant) who was familiar with the details of the plan, joined the others and played a vital role in putting the plan into effect without having agreed to do so. The verdict on count 1, which means that the appellant\u2019s acts of co-operation in the perpetration of the fraud were acts done in furtherance of a common unlawful intent to defraud, is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the finding on the conspiracy count.\nThere can be no doubt that a clear distinction exists between the crime of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence and the crime of committing that offence, and it is also clear to me that a man who has been tried and acquitted of conspiracy to commit an offence could later, when tried alone, be properly convicted of having aided and abetted in the commission of the same offence, providing that the acts of those participating in its commission were not so inter-dependent as to be consistent only with their having been the product of pre\u2011arrangement between the participants. (See Rex v. Kupferberg[11]; Preston v. The King[12]).\nIt is to be observed also that where two people are tried together on two counts\u2014one of conspiracy and the other of committing the substantive offence\u2014there is not necessarily any inconsistency in a verdict which acquitted them both of conspiracy and found one only to be guilty of the substantive offence. In such a case the verdict is consistent with the crime having been committed by one alone and with there having been no conspiracy. (See the recent case of Anandagoda v. The Queen[13]).\nThe most frequently quoted definition of conspiracy is that to be found in the reasons for judgment of Willes J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen[14], where he said:\nA conspiracy consists, not merely in the intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself and the act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced if lawful, punishable if for a criminal object, or for the use of criminal means.\nThis definition has frequently been cited in support of the proposition that before the conspiracy can be complete there must be evidence both of common design and of an agreement to carry that design into effect. It is, however, well to remember what was said by Lord Alverston in Rex v. Tibbets[15], where he commented on the Mulcahy definition in the following terms:\nIt is plain that the very learned Judge was there speaking of a case in which the criminal intention has not been carried into effect, and he says that in such a case the very promise to do\u2014such a promise as would be binding for a lawful purpose\u2014is an act which negatives the suggestion that the matter rests in intention only. He never said that when the unlawful purpose had been carried out no indictment for conspiracy can be maintained unless a concerted action has been preceded by such a contract between the conspirators as if the purpose had been lawful, would have given ground for a lawsuit. His definition is not of conspiracy, but of a kind of conduct which is sufficient to make the concerted action pass from the stage of intention into that of action.\nIf the appellant had been a party to the conspiracy to defraud for which his co-accused were convicted, then his acts of participation in the perpetration of the fraud itself would, as I see it, have been a part, and an essential part, of the conduct which caused the common unlawful design of the conspirators to pass from the stage of intention into that of action. As he has been found not guilty of that conspiracy, his acts cannot have that quality and if they were not acts done in furtherance of the common unlawful intent and design to which his fellow defrauders had been found to have agreed, then they cannot, in my view, justify a finding of guilty on the first count of the indictment.\nIf the appellant had withdrawn from the conspiracy and rejoined it in time to assist in knowingly carrying out its illegal object, then his participation would, in my opinion, have made him a co-conspirator and the finding that he had no part in the conspiracy could therefore in my view, only be justified on the basis of his active participation having been innocent and devoid of fraudulent intent.\nThe evidence against the appellant, if believed, was, in my opinion, only consistent with mutual consent between himself and his fellow accused in the execution of their common unlawful design and, as I have indicated, the finding that there was no such mutual consent carries with it the corollary that the appellant cannot have participated jointly with his co\u2011accused in the manner alleged in count 1.\nIt was strongly suggested by counsel for the respondent that the verdict should be construed as an acceptance by the jury of the accused\u2019s story that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before the fraud was actually perpetrated, but that they treated the acts which he thereafter performed in furtherance of the common unlawful design as being the acts of an aider and abettor rather than being the innocent acts of courtesy which the appellant swore that they were. It appears to me, as I have indicated, that the verdicts on counts 1 and 5 are irreconcilable on the face of it and I do not feel competent to inquire as to the underlying causes which may have contributed to this inconsistency.\nIn the case of Rex v. Cooper and Compton[16], the jury had returned a verdict finding the appellants guilty on a count charging conspiracy but not guilty on several other counts charging the commission of the substantive offences involved in the conspiracy. Having regard to the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal found the verdicts to be unreasonable and in the course of his reasons for judgment Humphreys J. said:\nThe learned Judge then said to counsel for the defence: \u201cAs I understand the verdict... what they have found is that there was a conspiracy existing between these two men to steal in the course of their duties, but that they are agreed, so far as the particular instances before the court are concerned, that conspiracy was not in fact carried out\u201d, and counsel for the defence said that that was the way he understood the verdict.\nThat is the way in which the verdict has been construed in this court, and it may be that it is correct, but this court takes the view, and always has taken the view, that we are not prepared to speculate on what a jury meant by a verdict which they have returned. We can only deal with the actual language used by the jury in returning the verdict. In the course of the argument a number of theories have been put forward on what the jury may have thought. We do not join in that speculation. All we can say is that the jury have said in terms: \u201cWe are not satisfied with the case for the prosecution on counts 2 to 9. We are satisfied with the case for the prosecution on count 1\u201d, and they returned verdicts accordingly.\nThese observations, in my opinion, apply to the consideration of the jury\u2019s verdict in the present case.\nFor these reasons as well as those stated in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright, I would allow this appeal and direct that the matter be disposed of in the manner proposed by him.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT, RITCHIE and HALL JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

His numerous injuries, all to the upper part of the body, were the result of pressure having been applied on his left side while his right side was pressed against a stationary object, presumably the curb of the sidewalk. Marks made by a big tire were found on his right wrist and part of the sleeve of his shirt. One of the defendant's autobuses had passed the scene of the accident at about that time and the tread of its right back wheel matched the marks on the wrist and sleeve of the victim. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident. The plaintiff alleged that her husband died as a result of his having been crushed by the wheel of an autobus owned and operated on behalf of the defendant.\nThe trial judge held that the plaintiff had not made the proof necessary to bring into play the presumption of s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142, and that, in any event, the presumption has been rebutted. The majority in the Court of Appeal held that the presumption did not apply, and the dissenting judge held that it applied and that the defendant had failed to rebut it. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Curiam; The evidence clearly demonstrated that there has been a contact between the victim and the tire of the defendant's autobus. The presumption of fault established under s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act was raised. The only defence was that the defendant's vehicle had not struck the victim and that its driver had driven in a careful and prudent manner. The presumption was not rebutted. The damages were not excessive.\nPer Cartwright J.: Upon the balance of probabilities the chances of the marks on the victim's wrist and shirt having been made by any other vehicle were negligible. The most probable inference to be drawn from the known facts was that the same vehicle inflicted all the injuries. The defendant did not discharge the onus cast upon it by s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Deslauriers J. dismissing the action. Appeal allowed.\nPierre Durand, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nRobert Bouchard, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench2 confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed claims in damages by appellants personally and by the appellant Dame Enni Partanen, as tutrix, on behalf of her five minor children. These claims arose out of the death of one Joseph Niggemann, the hus- band of the appellant Enni Partanen, which occurred on the evening of February 5, 1955, allegedly as a result of his having been crushed by the wheel of an autobus owned by and operated on behalf of the respondent.\nThere were no eye-witnesses of the accident. The facts\u2014as to which there is now no real dispute\u2014were found by the learned trial judge to be as follows:\nLe 5 f\u00e9vrier 1955, un peu apr\u00e8s 9.30 heures du soir, Roger Clavel, conduisait vers l'est, sur l'avenue Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce, un autobus de la Commission de Transport de Montr\u00e9al. En d\u00e9passant l'intersection de l'avenue Oxford, il aper\u00e7ut du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord, un homme gisant sans mouvement. Il arr\u00eata son v\u00e9hicule imm\u00e9diatement et en descendit suivi de deux passagers: Louis Emile Vigneault et Ginette D\u00e9saulniers, pour lui porter secours.\nL'homme \u00e9tait \u00e9tendu \u00e0 plat ventre, de biais, moiti\u00e9 dans la rue, moiti\u00e9 sur le trottoir. Sa t\u00eate \u00e9tait face contre le pav\u00e9 de la rue, dans la direction ouest, ses jambes \u00e9taient sur le trottoir en direction est. Sa main droite \u00e9tait \u00e9tendue dans le prolongement de sa t\u00eate. Son chapeau \u00e9tait un peu en avant de sa t\u00eate. On le retourna. Il \u00e9tait mort.\nL'endroit o\u00f9 reposait le cadavre \u00e9tait l'asphalte de la rue, puis une d\u00e9clivit\u00e9 s'\u00e9levant abruptement de la rue vers le trottoir \u00e0 une hauteur d'environ 18 pouces. Cette pente et le trottoir \u00e9taient glac\u00e9s, sales et raboteux.\nL'homme mort fut identifi\u00e9 comme Joseph Niggemann, 50 ans, demeurant \u00e0 4200 Oxford, Montr\u00e9al. Il \u00e9tait l'\u00e9poux de la demanderesse, Dame Enni Partan\u00e8n, poursuivant en son nom et en qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 ses cinq enfants mineurs, et le p\u00e8re de l'autre demandeur: ROBERT NIGGEMANN.\nL'autopsie a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 plusieurs blessures et ecchymoses allong\u00e9es et \u00e9troites sur le flanc gauche et l'h\u00e9mithorax gauche, la face ant\u00e9rieure et lat\u00e9rale gauche, des fractures \u00e0 neuf c\u00f4tes du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche et \u00e0 sept du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit, une fracture de la clavicule droite, un embrochement des poumons, la rupture du c\u0153ur et des poumons, une h\u00e9morragie abondante. On a relev\u00e9 des blessures au menton et \u00e0 la tempe du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit faites par choc sur une surface dure ou par frottement.\nLe Docteur Jean-Marie Roussel, m\u00e9decin-l\u00e9giste, qui a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette autopsie, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les blessures ci-dessus d\u00e9crites \u00e9taient dues, non \u00e0 un \u00e9crasement, mais \u00e0 une pression exerc\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche du d\u00e9funt, alors qu'il avait le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit appuy\u00e9 contre une surface dure, telle qu'une cha\u00eene de trottoir.\nLe Docteur Roussel, en faisant ses expertises, a constat\u00e9 que le d\u00e9funt portait sur la peau du poignet droit une empreinte d'un gros pneu. Cette empreinte se prolongeait sur l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la manche droite de la chemise du d\u00e9funt, produite comme pi\u00e8ce P-5. Il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que cette empreinte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e par le passage d'un v\u00e9hicule lourd. Le d\u00e9tective Marc Maurice, de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, faisant enqu\u00eate, retra\u00e7a sur l'autobus 1195 de la Commission de Transport de Montr\u00e9al, un pneu sur la roue droite arri\u00e8re dudit v\u00e9hicule, pouvant avoir fait ces empreintes. Cet autobus avait circul\u00e9 avenue Notre-Dame de Gr\u00e2ce, pr\u00e8s de l'avenue Oxford, vers le temps o\u00f9 Joseph Niggemann y fut trouv\u00e9 mort.\nAs I have said, there is no serious dispute as to these facts as found by the learned trial judge. The principles of law to be applied are also well established; Rousseau v. Bennett3. The questions in issue are as to the inferences to be drawn from the established facts and in particular\u2014\n1. Whether the death of Niggemann was caused by his having been struck by the wheel of an autobus owned and operated on behalf of respondent, thus giving rise to the presumption of fault established under s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142 and\n2. If it was, whether respondent has rebutted such presumption.\nAs to the first of these questions the learned trial judge held that the appellants had not made the proof necessary to bring the presumption into play and that even if it did apply, such presumption had been rebutted. Rinfret and Owen JJ. in the Court below held that on the evidence the presumption of fault under s. 53 of the Motor Vehicles Act did not apply. Bissonnette J. dissenting, held that it did, and that respondents had failed to rebut such presumption. I am in respectful agreement with him on both points.\nWhether the victim's death was due to his having been crushed by the rear wheel of autobus no. 1195 owned by and operated on behalf of respondent, depends primarily upon the evidence given by Dr. Roussel and by Detective Maurice. As to this, I adopt the following statement of Bissonnette J.:\nIl est prouv\u00e9 sans aucune contradiction que l'examen de Niggemann indiquait une empreinte sur son poignet droit, que celle-ci se prolongeait sur sa chemise et que les sculptures antid\u00e9rapantes qu'on y relevait \u00e9taient nettement identiques \u00e0 celles que comportait la semelle du pneu. Je souligne imm\u00e9diatement qu'il serait, hors de toute vraisemblance, que ces empreintes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le pneu d'un autre v\u00e9hicule qui se serait trouv\u00e9 au m\u00eame endroit deux ou trois minutes plus t\u00f4t. Et la raison qui confirme cette assertion, c'est que ce pneu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 non seulement rechap\u00e9 mais qu'\u00e0 cette fin, on avait employ\u00e9 un moule particulier import\u00e9 de Lidi, Californie. Cette preuve \u00e9mane d'un contrema\u00eetre de l'intim\u00e9e et elle est par elle-m\u00eame concluante sur ce point. Refuser de trouver l\u00e0 une pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9pondant aux exigences jurisprudentielles, ce serait \u00e9lever les simples pr\u00e9somptions de l'homme au degr\u00e9 d'une preuve m\u00e9taphysique et math\u00e9matique.\nLa preuve incontest\u00e9e d'un rapport direct, \u00e9troit et uniquement concluante dans un sens \u00e9tablit que se produisit entre le d\u00e9funt et l'autobus un contact et que l'intensit\u00e9 de celui-ci n'a pu avoir un effet autre que de provoquer la mort. En effet, selon le t\u00e9moignage du Dr Roussel, de par la nature des blessures qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9es, la seule d\u00e9duction m\u00e9dicale possible, c'est de retenir que coinc\u00e9 entre l'autobus et la lev\u00e9e de glace, Niggemann a subi une telle pression que celle-ci fut cause d'une h\u00e9morragie abondante de la poitrine, de la perforation des poumons et de la rupture du c\u0153ur. La force de cette pression lat\u00e9rale fut telle qu'elle entra\u00eena la mort, m\u00eame si la victime ne passa pas sous la roue du lourd v\u00e9hicule. Or, il est impossible de concevoir qu'il p\u00fbt exister un rapport de cause \u00e0 effet avec un autre v\u00e9hicule. En raison de la relation parfaite qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e entre les empreintes sur le corps et la chemise du d\u00e9funt et celle relev\u00e9e sur la roue, empreinte, dans ce dernier cas, qui \u00e9tait le prolongement des autres, un peu comme la r\u00e9union de deux pi\u00e8ces dans un casse-t\u00eate qui ne peuvent s'ajuster autrement, il devient absolument invraisemblable de poser m\u00eame l'hypoth\u00e8se que les empreintes pourraient r\u00e9sulter d'un contact avec un autre v\u00e9hicule. De m\u00eame qu'il est d'un illogisme \u00e9vident de pr\u00e9tendre que le d\u00e9funt aurait pu \u00eatre renvers\u00e9 par une autre voiture; bref, tant qu'il ne sera pas possible de repousser ou d'expliquer l'empreinte sur la roue, marque qui est la continuation de celle apparaissant sur le poignet droit, on demeure en face d'un fait qui, physiquement, m\u00e9taphysiquement conduit \u00e0 une conclusion irr\u00e9futable, irr\u00e9sistible. Et alors il ne s'agit pas d'une simple pr\u00e9somption susceptible, en raison de sa force, de faire accepter un rapport causal mais de la preuve d'un fait mat\u00e9riel qui, parce qu'il rendait invraisemblable toute autre d\u00e9duction, devait suffire \u00e0 convaincre le tribunal que l'autobus \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 en contact avec le corps de la victime.\nAu reste, m\u00eame si, dans ce fait mat\u00e9riel, on y veut voir qu'une simple pr\u00e9somption de l'homme, celle-ci a des caract\u00e8res tels d'intensit\u00e9, de puissance et de logique qu'elle repousse m\u00eame toute th\u00e9orie de possibilit\u00e9s, de conjectures.\nRespondent's defence was that its vehicle had not struck Niggemann. The only evidence tendered on behalf of respondent to rebut the presumption of fault, was that of the driver Boucher, who testified that he had driven his autobus in a careful and prudent manner. In agreement with Bissonnette J. and for the reasons which he has given, in my opinion the respondent failed to rebut the presumption of fault under s. 53.\nThere remains the question as to the quantum of damages. At the time of his death the victim was fifty years of age. He was sole proprietor of a modest business enterprise, his net annual revenue having been in the vicinity of $5,000 per annum. After his death this small business was sold for a low price. He left surviving him six children of whom five were minors at the time this action was instituted, their ages ranging from six to nineteen years. In his dissenting reasons Bissonnette J. fixed the damages sustained at the sum of $35,500, apportioned as follows:\nDame Enni Partanen personally \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $ 18,000\nRobert Niggemann personally \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 500\nBarbara aged 19 years \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,500\nPeter Alfred aged 12 years \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 3,000\nThomas Otto aged 11 years \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 3,000\nCarola Enni aged 8 years \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 4,500\nIrma Rita aged 6 years \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 5,000\n$ 35,500\nIn my opinion these amounts are not excessive and I am prepared to accept them.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, maintain the appellants' action, and condemn the respondent to pay to the appellant Dame Enni Partanen personally, the sum of $18,000, to the appellant Robert Niggemann the sum of $500, and to the appellant Dame Enni Partanen \u00e8s qualit\u00e9, the sum of $17,000, all with interest from September 3, 1957, the date of the judgment in the Superior Court. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Abbott and there is little that I wish to add.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that the marks left on the wrist and shirt of the deceased were probably made by the tire of the respondent's bus, but that it was for the appellants to prove that no other vehicle used similar tires. The passage in his reasons dealing with this point is as follows:\nQue les empreintes laiss\u00e9es sur le poignet et la chemise de Joseph Niggemann aient \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es par la roue de l'autobus de la d\u00e9fenderesse la Commission de Transport de Montr\u00e9al, cela est possible et m\u00eame probable. Mais la preuve qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite n'est pas concluante. Il n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant de dire \u00e0 la Commission de Transport de Montr\u00e9al: \u00abVous aviez, au moment, de l'accident, un pneu pouvant faire les marques trouv\u00e9es, donc c'est votre pneu qui a fait ces marques\u00bb. Ladite d\u00e9fenderesse n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de d\u00e9montrer que des pneus semblables ont pu \u00eatre employ\u00e9s sur d'autres v\u00e9hicules circulant dans les rues de Montr\u00e9al. Il appartenait aux demandeurs de d\u00e9montrer qu'aucun autre v\u00e9hicule que celui impliqu\u00e9 n'utilisait ces pneus et que seule la d\u00e9fenderesse en faisait usage. Par la preuve faite, les demandeurs n'ont pas exclu la possibilit\u00e9 que les dites empreintes peuvent provenir d'un autre v\u00e9hicule usageant le m\u00eame genre de pneus. Il est en preuve que des camions livrant l'huile de chauffage circulent parfois sur la rue o\u00f9 le cadavre a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9.\nIl n'est nullement impossible qu'un de ces camions ait pass\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de l'intersection de l'avenue Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce et de l'avenue Oxford, le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1955, portant un pneu capable de laisser l'empreinte trouv\u00e9e sur la manche de chemise de Joseph Niggemann.\nWith respect, I think that the learned Judge erred. Civil cases are decided upon the balance of probabilities. In view particularly of the evidence of the witness Maurice as to the comparison of the marks on the wrist and shirt with the tread of the tire on bus number 1195 and that of the witness Urquhart as to the tire having been recapped by the use of a mould imported from California the chances of the marks having been made by any other vehicle were negligible.\nThe view of the learned trial Judge on this point was not shared by any of the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench4.\nThe view of Bissonnette J. has been set out in the reasons of my brother Abbott.\nRinfret J. dealt with the point as follows:\nL'on reste avec la seule probabilit\u00e9 que la roue en question aurait \u00e9cras\u00e9 le poignet droit de la victime.\nCette probabilit\u00e9 est, \u00e0 mon avis, suffisante pour qu'entre en jeu la pr\u00e9somption de l'article 53, mais uniquement pour la perte ou le dommage occasionn\u00e9 par tel \u00e9crasement.\nOwen J. said:\nAs far as the autobus is concerned the only definite proof is that it ran over the victim's right hand.\nRinfret J. and Owen J. both were of opinion that although it was shewn that the bus ran over the deceased's wrist it was not established that the bus caused the injuries to his chest which were the immediate cause of death.\nWith the greatest respect I am of opinion that by far the most probable inference to be drawn from the known facts is that the same vehicle inflicted all the injuries.\nThe two other possible inferences which Owen J. regarded as equally probable with the inference that the victim was killed by the bus are stated by him as follows:\nThe victim could have had a heart attack or some other seizure which caused him to drop dead, partly on the roadway, before any motor vehicle ran over him. An equally plausible inference, in view of the multiple injuries to both sides of the chest without any fracture of the spine, would be that the victim was run over and killed by one or more other motor vehicles before he was run over by the autobus.\nIn order to draw either of these inferences it would be necessary to find that Boucher, the driver of the bus, who was bringing it to a stop at a well lighted spot failed to see the lifeless body lying in front of him. The suggested inferences are not impossible; but, remembering always that the question is whether the appellants established their case on the balance of probabilities, it appears to me that the conclusion reached by Bissonnette J. is the right one.\nOnce the finding of fact that the death of the deceased was caused by the bus has been made, the reasons of Bissonnette J. satisfy me that the respondent did not discharge the onus cast upon it by s. 53(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act.\nI have already stated my agreement with the reasons given by my brother Abbott, and I would dispose of the appeal as he proposes.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Birtz, Pouliot, Mercure & LeBel, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Letourneau, Quintan, Forest, Raymond & Bouchard, Montreal.\n1 [1962] Que.

Dommerich & Company Incorporated (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: October 10, 11; 1964: January 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAssignment\u2014Manufacturer entering into factoring agreement\u2014Assignment of accounts receivable\u2014Debt from assignor to debtor resulting from independent transaction\u2014Whether debtor may exercise right of set-off against assignee which it would have had against assignor.\nA, a manufacturer of television sets, purchased materials from R, a manufacturer of electrical equipment, and made payment direct to that company. R subsequently entered into a \u201cfactoring agreement\u201d with D, the substance of which was that R would assign its accounts receivable to D and D would notify the customers and make the collections for a stated charge to R. R notified A of its factoring arrangement and assigned A\u2019s account to D. Thereafter the invoices to A, prepared by R and sent by D, were stamped with notices of assignment of the accounts to D.\nR went into bankruptcy; at the date of the bankruptcy it owed A a considerable amount of money for certain equipment with which it had been supplied by A. In an action brought by D in respect of A\u2019s purchases from R, A sought to set off in complete extinction of the claim the same amount owing by R to it. Judgment at trial was given in favour of D; an appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. A then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The debtor had as against the assignee the same right of set-off as he would have had against the assignor at the time at which he received notice of the assignment; it was for the assignee to make inquiries and, in the absence of fraud, the debtor was not under a duty to volunteer information. The circumstances fell short of establishing knowledge on the part of A that R would request or accept payment from D without disclosing to it that R was indebted to A in amounts which the latter was entitled to set off against its liability to R. A had no express notice that R was concealing the existence of this right of set-off from D or that the latter was not making such inquiries from R as were necessary to protect its interest. The course of dealing was not such as should necessarily have led A to realize that D was being deceived by R. In the absence of such knowledge A was not under a duty to volunteer information to D.\nMangles v. Dixon and others (1852), 3 H.L. Cas. 702, referred to.\nPer Curiam: The Court of Appeal was in error in finding that the factoring agreement constituted an equitable assignment of future choses in action. It was an agreement to transfer book accounts each month on payments being made in accordance with the agreement and there was no transfer of any account either at law or in equity until R assigned the various accounts specifically at the end of each month. A received notice of assignment of each account for the first time when the invoice stamped with notice of assignment was received by it. The result was that on receipt of the invoice stamped with the assignment, A was not entitled after this date to set off against that invoice an indebtedness of R which arose subsequent to the date of notice of the assignment of that account but the converse also held true. A was entitled to assert with respect to any particular assignment that on the date when notice of that assignment was given, on a proper accounting between A and R, there was nothing owing to R.\nNo duty was imposed on A to speak and to warn of a potential right of set-off because it knew the course of dealing between D and R. A did not mislead D and was under no obligation to disclose its own dealings and to volunteer information. The onus was on D, as assignee, to satisfy itself as to the equities which might exist when it took the assignments month by month.\nIf this factoring agreement was to be treated as a present and immediate equitable assignment of future choses in action, another problem arose. It was then within the terms of The Assignment of Book Debts Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 25, and was absolutely void against the creditors of R for non-compliance with the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Smily J. Appeal allowed.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Judson.\nFor the reasons which he has given I agree with his conclusion that the rights of the parties are to be determined on the basis that Admiral received notice of the assignment of each account for the first time when the invoice stamped with notice of assignment was received by it. At these times as between Admiral and Rotor the former had the right to set off against its debt to Rotor whatever amount was due from Rotor to it for the tuners delivered up to that time. The question as to which I wish to add a few words is whether, in the particular circumstances of this case, Admiral is prevented from taking advantage of this equity as between itself and Dommerich.\nThere is no doubt as to the general rule. The debtor has as against the assignee the same right of set-off as he would have had against the assignor at the time at which he receives notice of the assignment; it is for the assignee to make inquiries and the debtor is not under a duty to volunteer information. There is, however, an exception to this rule which is enunciated in the following passage from the judgment of the House of Lords, delivered by Lord St. Leonards L.C., in Mangles v. Dixon and others[2]:\nI must take care and guard myself upon this important point, as not for a moment meaning to say that if that notice of the bankers had shown that they had been deceived, that they were advancing money upon a ground that they misunderstood, and if the charterers, Messrs. Mangles and Co., had stood by, well knowing that circumstance, and had been silent, the result would have been the same: I agree that the case would be altogether different. It would then have been incumbent upon the Messrs. Mangles to disclose the real circumstances of the case to Messrs. Dixon; and if they had not done so, they would be just as much bound as it is now contended they ought to be bound.\nThe limitation of the exception is made clear by the following sentence at p. 734 of the same judgment:\nI admit the books do not establish the rule; but I think the principle is perfectly clear, that where there is no fraud, nothing to lead to the conclusion in the mind of the party who receives the notice, that the party who gives it has been deceived and is likely to sustain a loss; I say it is clear that the former is not bound to volunteer information.\nIt is argued for the respondent that the course of dealing between the parties must have resulted in Admiral knowing that Dommerich would pay over to Rotor the amounts shewn due to Rotor in the invoices which had been assigned by it to Dommerich in ignorance of the fact that Admiral was entitled to the right of set-off which is now asserted. Stress is laid particularly on the facts, (i) that all invoices for goods sold by Rotor to Admiral had for some years been assigned to Dommerich, (ii) that the notation \u201cCheque payable to L.F. Dommerich & Co. Inc.\u201d appeared throughout this period at the top of each page of Admiral\u2019s ledger of accounts payable to Rotor, (iii) that a letter from Dommerich to Admiral dated March 10, 1959, asking for payment of a small balance said to be overdue, contained the following paragraph:\nWe trust that you understand that we as factors must account to our client for the value of any invoice on the maturity date of said invoice and must look to our customers for payment of interest for any additional time taken.\n(iv) that the notice of assignment stamped on every invoice included the following paragraph:\nAny objection to this bill or its terms must be reported on receipt of same to L.F. DOMMERICH & CO., INC., 271 Madison Ave., New York, 16, N.Y.\nAll these circumstances appear to me to fall short of establishing knowledge on the part of Admiral that Rotor would request or accept payment from Dommerich without disclosing to it that Rotor was indebted to Admiral in amounts which the latter was entitled to set off against its liability to Rotor. Admiral had no express notice that Rotor was concealing the existence of this right of set-off from Dommerich or that the latter was not making such inquiries from Rotor as were necessary to protect its interest. I am unable to find that the course of dealing was such as should necessarily have led Admiral to realize that Dommerich was being deceived by Rotor. In the absence of such knowledge Admiral was not under a duty to volunteer information to Dommerich.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Judson and those set out above I would dispose of the appeal as he proposes.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014L.F. Dommerich & Company Incorporated, as assignee of accounts payable to Rotor Electric Company Limited, obtained a judgment against Canadian Admiral Corporation Ltd. for $46,181 and held it on appeal[3]. The question is whether Admiral may exercise a right of set-off against the assignee, which it would have had against Rotor, the assignor.\nUntil September 1954, Admiral purchased materials from Rotor and made payment direct to that company. In September 1954, Rotor entered into a \u201cfactoring agreement\u201d with Dommerich, the substance of which was that Rotor would assign its accounts receivable to Dommerich and Dommerich would notify the customers and make the collections for a stated charge to Rotor.\nThe factoring agreement is in the form of a letter addressed by Dommerich to Rotor. I set out now the provisions with which we are concerned in this appeal:\nYou agree to do all your business through us; to promptly assign to us, as absolute owners, all accounts arising from sales of your merchandise made during the period of this agreement, together with your rights in the merchandise sold; and to furnish us with duly executed confirmatory assignments thereof in form satisfactory to us.\nNo sales or deliveries of merchandise shall be made without our written approval as to the amount, terms of sale and credit of the customer, and we agree to purchase all of such accounts receivable in accordance with the terms of this agrement. We assume any loss on sales finally approved by us in writing which is due to the insolvency of the customer, provided the customer has received and finally accepted the merchandise without dispute, offset or counterclaim\u00bc\nWe will credit you on the last day of each month with the net of the current month\u2019s sales, such credit to be as of the average due date of such sales, plus ten (10) days provided the terms of sale and the credit of the customers have been approved by us. This credit shall constitute our purchase price of the accounts assigned to us. We will remit to you on the average maturity date of customers\u2019 invoices, in Canadian funds, or more often, if requested, but in remitting we may reserve a reasonable amount to protect ourselves against the returns and claims of, and allowances to, customers.\nYou will notify us promptly of all disputes and claims and settle them promptly at your own expense. Our purchase of an account arising out of the sale which is the subject of an offset, claim or dispute, is automatically rescinded forthwith and the amount theretofore credited to you for such sale, together with interest thereon from the date of such credit, at our sole option, may be charged back by us in your account. Irrespective of such rescission or chargeback, the assignment of such account to us shall continue in full force until we are fully reimbursed.\nFor our services we are to charge to and receive from you as of the fifteenth of the month in which the sales are made a commission of one and one-half (1\u00bd) per cent of the net amount of all sales.\nWhen this agreement was signed, Rotor sent to Admiral a form letter dated September 13, 1954, notifying Admiral that Dommerich would act as its factor. A statement of the then current indebtedness of Admiral to Rotor was attached, with the following endorsement:\nThis account has now been assigned to L.F. Dommerich and Company, Inc. and should be paid to them when due.\nAdmiral then began to remit to Dommerich the amounts from time to time accruing due by it to Rotor. In addition, in a ledger kept by Admiral, called \u201cVendors Ledger\u201d, showing the name of Rotor, a notation appeared in the ledger sheet commencing August 30, 1954, reading:\nCHEQUE PAYABLE TO\u2014\nL.F. DOMMERICH & CO. INC.,\n271 MADISON AVENUE,\nNEW YORK 16, N.Y.\nA similar notation appeared in the ledger throughout the whole of the relevant period.\nThe procedure followed is set out in the reasons delivered by Laidlaw J.A. Rotor prepared the invoices, addressing them to Admiral, and stamped each with two notices as follows:\nAny objection to this bill or its terms, must be reported on receipt of same to L.F. Dommerich & Co., Inc., 271 Madison Avenue, New York 16, N.Y.\nFor valuable consideration received this account has been transferred and assigned to L.F. Dommerich & Co. Inc., 271 Madison Avenue, New York 16, N.Y., and is owned by and payable only to it in Canadian funds. Each invoice was given an account number. The invoices to Admiral and other purchasers of merchandise from Rotor were sent to Dommerich together with a document signed by Rotor in these terms:\nWe hereby confirm that for valuable consideration received, we have transferred and assigned to you all our rights, title and interest in and to the attached accounts aggregating $ and numbered from to and that, in consequence, they are owned by and payable only to you.\nDommerich sent to the various purchasers the invoices received from Rotor stamped with the assignment.\nIn the period from 1954 until the fall of 1959, Admiral issued to Rotor a large number of \u201cdebit memos\u201d, primarily arising from \u201ccharge-backs\u201d for defective transformers delivered by Rotor to Admiral. These debit memos were set off against amounts owing by Admiral to Rotor.\nBefore September 23, 1959, negotiations were carried on between the President of Admiral and the President of Rotor for the sale by Admiral to Rotor of certain equipment called \u201ctuners\u201d to be incorporated in stereo phonographs to be manufactured and sold by Rotor. Rotor issued to Admiral a purchase order for 550 stereo tuners, to be delivered in instalments. The total purchase price for such tuners was $43,942.52. The first delivery of these tuners was made by Admiral to Rotor on October 13, 1959, and the order was completed by the last delivery on November 25, 1959.\nAt the time of the first delivery of these tuners to Rotor on October 13, 1959, the amount owing by Admiral on invoices issued by Rotor for goods sold by Rotor to Admiral was $62,470.67. Because the President of Rotor had been associated in some way with another business which had failed and had paid nothing to creditors, the President of Admiral wanted to ensure that his company would always owe more to Rotor than Rotor would owe to Admiral. He had the account checked and learned that his company then owed to Rotor something in excess of $60,000.\nThe result was that Admiral\u2019s supervisor of accounts payable held enough in reserve on the accounts payable to Rotor to offset what was on the accounts receivable from Rotor. At some stage someone wrote a memorandum in Admiral\u2019s ledger relating to Rotor \u201cLeave balance at $43,942.52.\u201d By arrangement between counsel for the appellant and the respondent at the trial, the precise accounting between the parties was not gone into at the trial, it being understood that if this became necessary, it would be dealt with on a reference. As a result, the individual remittances and invoices, together with any accompanying memoranda as to the particular debt in respect of which Admiral was making payments to Rotor\u2019s assignee, were not filed as exhibits. This probably led to the comment of the trial judge that the evidence did not show what accounts were due and payable from time to time by Rotor to Admiral although the ledger sheet did show the dates when they were charged. He went on to find, however, that there was no right of setoff, because of the prior knowledge of the appellant \u201cof the assignments being made of these last-mentioned accounts to the plaintiff.\u201d\nRotor went into bankruptcy; at the date of the bankruptcy Rotor owed Admiral $43,942.52 for the tuners. Dommerich, in this action, claimed from Admiral $49,871.57, of which Admiral paid $5,699.44 without prejudice to its position. The claim is for $43,942.52, against which Admiral seeks to set off in complete extinction of the claim the same amount owing by Rotor to it.\nThe trial judge made a clear finding against the evidence given on behalf of Rotor that there was an agreement between the two companies (Admiral and Rotor) that Admiral would not \u201ccontra the accounts\u201d.\nDommerich did not argue at the trial that the original factoring agreement constituted an equitable assignment of future accounts owing by Admiral to Rotor, and the reasons for judgment do not deal in any way with the point. The trial judge dealt with the matter on the basis that Admiral must have known (even if its President did not) of the existence of the factoring agreement and that the invoices were being assigned to the respondent. His opinion was that it would be contrary to the principles of equity to permit such a set-off as was claimed by Admiral. He also held that the type of set-off here claimed arose from an independent transaction and was not the type of \u201coff-set\u201d or counter-claim which had been referred to in the factoring agreement. On the question whether the onus was upon Admiral or Dommerich to make inquiry, he held that Admiral should have inquired whether Dommerich was aware that such a claim of set-off might arise, or should have notified Dommerich that such accounts were arising. He therefore gave judgment in favour of Dommerich for $43,942.52, with interest from the date of the writ.\nThe Court of Appeal held that Admiral knew that Dommerich was the assignee not only of existing debts owed by Admiral to Rotor but also of future debts, and that Admiral was not entitled to impair Dommerich\u2019s rights by any setoff or counter-claim for an independent debt between Admiral and Rotor unconnected with the dealings giving rise to the assignment from Rotor to Dommerich. The Court of Appeal also held on a point raised by Dommerich for the first time that the factoring agreement of 1954 constituted an equitable assignment of all future debts owing by Admiral to Rotor.\nWith respect, I think there was error in finding that the factoring agreement constitued an equitable assignment of future choses in action. I have set out the relevant provisions above and I can find nothing in them beyond an agreement between Rotor and Dommerich binding each of them to do certain things in the future. The document does not contain words of present effect or transfer which could bind the subject-matter when it might come into existence (4 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 493). It is an agreement to transfer these book accounts each month on payments being made in accordance with the agreement and there was no transfer of any account either at law or in equity until Rotor assigned the various accounts specifically at the end of each month. That specific assignment is set out on p. 244 of these reasons. Admiral, therefore, received notice of assignment of each account for the first time when the invoice was submitted in accordance with the procedure outlined above. The result was that on receipt of the invoice stamped with the assignment, Admiral was not entitled after this date to set off against that invoice an indebtedness of Rotor which arose subsequent to the date of notice of the assignment of that account but the converse also holds true. Admiral was entitled to assert with respect to any particular assignment that on the date when notice of that assignment was given, on a proper accounting between Admiral and Rotor, there was nothing owing to Rotor.\nThere is some significance in the way in which the case was pleaded and put in at the trial. The statement of claim is based upon a series of specific assignments with a balance owing of $49,871.57 at the date of the writ, and the case was put in at the trial pursuant to this statement of claim. The sole basis of the judgment at trial was the imposition of a duty to speak and to warn of a potential right of set-off because Admiral knew the course of dealing between Dommerich and Rotor.\nBut Admiral was in no way concerned with the arrangements between Dommerich and Rotor except to pay in accordance with the assignments when notice was received. The arrangement was entirely for the financial advantage and convenience of Rotor and Dommerich. Dommerich earned a fee and Rotor avoided the trouble of running a collection department. I can see no reason why such an arrangement should impose additional duties on Admiral as a purchaser of Rotor\u2019s products or restrict the rights which it would otherwise have in dealing back and forth with this supplier and customer. Dommerich could have instructed Rotor that it was not to get into a position which might enable a customer to exercise a right of set-off and could have examined Rotor\u2019s books to see that this instruction was being followed.\nOn the other hand, what kind of notice should Admiral have given to Dommerich? Should it have said: \u201cWe are now selling goods to Rotor and may have a right of set-off?\u201d Should it have gone further and said that because of doubts concerning the financial position of Rotor, it intended to keep its accounts in such a way that it would not be caught in a bankruptcy. It was for Dommerich to look after its own business and for Admiral to mind its own business. Admiral did not mislead Dommerich and was under no obligation to disclose its own dealings and to volunteer information. The onus was on Dommerich, as assignee, to satisfy itself as to the equities which might exist when it took these assignments month by month.\nIf this factoring agreement is to be treated as a present and immediate equitable assignment of future choses in action, another problem arises. It is then within the terms of The Assignment of Book Debts Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 25, and is absolutely void against the creditors of Rotor for non- compliance with the Act. This document was never registered. The Act requires registration within thirty days of its execution, together with an affidavit of an attesting witness and an affidavit of bona fides. Admiral was a creditor entitled to the protection of the Act and the fact that Admiral knew in a general way of the arrangement between Dommerich and Rotor does not remove it from this classification. I cannot understand the criticism of Laidlaw J.A of Admiral\u2019s position on this branch of the appeal. It was Dommerich that argued for the first time in the Court of Appeal that the factoring agreement was an equitable assignment. To answer this argument counsel for Admiral put forward a defence based upon The Assignment of Book Debts Act.\nDommerich, on appeal, claimed to appropriate the payments already made by Admiral to the accounts arising after October 13, 1959. This was fully answered on the argument by Admiral, whose payments were dearly appropriated to the accounts arising before that date.\nI would make the following order. The appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at trial and in the Court of Appeal set aside. The order should include\n(a) a declaration that the letter of September 1954 is not an equitable assignment of future debts owing to Rotor by Admiral;\n(b) a declaration that with respect to each assignment from Rotor to Dommerich after October 13, 1959, Admiral is entitled to set off amounts owing to it by Rotor for goods delivered by Admiral to Rotor prior to notice of such assignment; and is obligated to Dommerich with respect to the accounts covered by such assignment for any difference between the total of such accounts and the allowable set-off;\n(c) if the plaintiff so elects within 15 days from the delivery of these reasons, a direction for a reference to the Master at Toronto to determine what amount, if any, is owing by Admiral to Dommerich on the basis of an accounting with respect to each assignment on the basis set out above. If the plaintiff elects to take a reference, the costs of the trial and of the reference are reserved to the trial judge. If the plaintiff does not so elect, the action is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Arnoldi, Parry, Campbell, Pyle, Godfrey & Lewtas, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Garvey, Ferris & Murphy, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 902, 34 D.L.R.

Les demandeurs ont pr\u00e9tendu que cette l\u00e9gislation pourrait leur occasionner des troubles. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que le statut \u00e9tait intra vires. Sans se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 du statut, la Cour d'Appel a renvoy\u00e9 l'action parce qu'une semblable action ne pouvait \u00eatre institu\u00e9e dans la province. Les demandeurs se sont pourvus devant cette Cour et le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a produit une intervention.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 ainsi que l'intervention.\nL'action d\u00e9claratoire n'existe pas dans Qu\u00e9bec, sauf en quelques cas isol\u00e9s. Les tribunaux de cette province ne jugent que les litiges. Les questions acad\u00e9miques et th\u00e9oriques o\u00f9 aucun lis n'existe leur ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8res. La porte des tribunaux n'est pas ouverte \u00e0 quiconque n'a pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel dans un' litige. L'article 77 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile est p\u00e9remptoire \u00e0 ce sujet. Selon cet article, pour poursuivre, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat doit \u00eatre imm\u00e9diat m\u00eame s'il est \u00e9ventuel. La seule crainte que peut avoir un citoyen qu'un jour une action possible puisse \u00eatre institu\u00e9e contre lui ne justifie pas per se un recours en justice. Puisque l'action n'existe pas, il est inutile d'examiner la validit\u00e9 du statut. Il s'ensuit aussi que l'intervention du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nActions\u2014Practice and procedure\u2014Declaratory judgment in Quebec\u2014Validity of provincial statute\u2014Necessary interest required to institute action\u2014An Act Respecting Freedom of Worship and the Maintenance of Good Order, 1953-54 (Que.), c. 15\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 77.\nThe day after the Quebec statute, An Act Respecting Freedom of Worship and the Maintenance of Good Order, 1953-54 (Que.) c. 15, came into force, the plaintiffs instituted an action to have it declared ultra vires. The plaintiffs contended that they were threatened with prosecution under the statute. The Superior Court held that the statute was intra vires. Without passing on the constitutional question, the Court of Appeal dismissed the action on the ground that such an action could not be instituted in the province. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court and the Attorney General for Canada intervened.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed as well as the intervention.\nExcept in some isolated instances provided for by the code or statutes, a declaratory action does not exist in Quebec. The Courts of that province deal only with actual disputes and not with theoretical and academic questions where there is no lis. To have a right of action one must have an interest in a dispute. Art. 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure is peremptory. Under that article no person could bring an action unless he had an interest therein. Although such interest could be eventual, it had to be an existing and actual interest. It could not be based merely on. the fear of future injury. Since the action did not exist, it would be useless to examine the validity of the statute. It follows also that the intervention by the Attorney General of Canada should be dismissed.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, affirmant un jugement du Juge Lizotte.

Ne constitue pas la jouissance ni le libre exercice du culte d'une profession religieuse le fait\na) de distribuer, dans des places publiques ou \u00e0 domicile, des livres, revues, tracts, pamphlets, papiers, documents, photographies, ou autres publications contenant des attaques outrageantes ou injurieuses contre le culte d'une profession religieuse ou les croyances religieuses d'une partie quelconque de la population de la province, ou des propos de caract\u00e8re outrageant ou injurieux pour les membres ou adh\u00e9rents d'une profession religieuse; ou\nb) de se porter, dans des discours ou conf\u00e9rences prononc\u00e9s sur la place publique, ou transmis au public au moyen de haut-parleurs ou autres appareils, \u00e0 des attaques outrageantes ou injurieuses contre le culte d'une profession religieuse ou les croyances religieuses d'une partie quelconque de la population de la province, ou \u00e0 des propos de caract\u00e8re outrageant ou injurieux pour les membres ou adh\u00e9rents d'une profession religieuse; ou\nc) de diffuser ou de reproduire, au moyen de la radiophonie, de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision ou de la presse, de telles attaques ou de tels propos.\n* * *\n10a. Quiconque commet un acte mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe a, au paragraphe b ou au paragraphe c de l'article 2a se rend coupable d'une infraction \u00e0 l'article 2c et est passible, sur poursuite en vertu de la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi des convictions sommaires de Qu\u00e9bec, d'une amende d'au moins cent dollars et d'au plus deux cents dollars pour une premi\u00e8re infraction, d'au moins deux cents dollars et d'au plus quatre cents dollars pour une deuxi\u00e8me infraction et d'au moins quatre cents dollars et d'au plus mille dollars pour toute infraction subs\u00e9quente, avec d\u00e9pens dans chaque cas; et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement de l'amende et des frais, d'un emprisonnement d'au moins quinze jours et d'au plus trente jours pour la premi\u00e8re infraction, d'au moins trente jours et d'au plus soixante jours pour la deuxi\u00e8me et d'au moins cent vingt jours et d'au plus cent quatre-vingts jours pour toute infraction subs\u00e9quente.\nLorsque l'infraction consiste \u00e0 distribuer un livre ou un \u00e9crit mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe a de l'article 2a, ce livre ou cet \u00e9crit peuvent \u00eatre saisis sans mandat et tous leurs exemplaires dans la province peuvent \u00eatre saisis avec mandat. S'il y a condamnation, le juge qui la prononce doit en ordonner la destruction.\n10b. Sur requ\u00eate, appuy\u00e9e du serment d'une personne digne de foi et all\u00e9guant une infraction ou l'imminence d'une infraction aux dispositions de l'article 2c, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou avec son autorisation ou par la corporation municipale dans le territoire de laquelle l'infraction a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise ou est sur le point d'\u00eatre commise, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ou l'un de ses juges peut \u00e9mettre une ordonnance d'injonction interlocutoire pour emp\u00eacher la commission, la continuation ou la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de cette infraction.\nUne injonction interlocutoire peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e et d\u00e9cern\u00e9e contre toute personne et contre toute organisation, association ou collectivit\u00e9 d'individus, jouissant ou non de l'entit\u00e9 juridique, qui enfreint ou est sur le point d'enfriendre les dispositions de l'article 2c.\nDans le cas d'une organisation, association ou collectivit\u00e9 d'individus ne jouissant pas de l'entit\u00e9 juridique, il suffit, pour les fins de la requ\u00eate, de l'ordonnance d'injonction et des proc\u00e9dures qui s'y rattachent, de la d\u00e9signer par le nom collectif sous lequel elle se d\u00e9signe elle-m\u00eame ou sous lequel elle est commun\u00e9ment connue et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, et la signification de la requ\u00eate, de l'ordonnance d'injonction ou de toute autre proc\u00e9dure peut lui \u00eatre valablement faite \u00e0 l'un de ses bureaux, ou \u00e0 l'un de ses lieux d'organisation ou de r\u00e9union, ou \u00e0 l'une de ses places d'affaires, dans la province.\nL'ordonnance d'injonction rendue contre une telle organisation, association ou collectivit\u00e9 lie toutes les personnes qui en font partie et est ex\u00e9cutoire contre chacune d'elles.\nLa demande en injonction peut \u00eatre faite et l'injonction accord\u00e9e sans l'\u00e9mission d'un bref d'assignation. Cette demande constitue alors une instance par elle-m\u00eame.\nLe recours pr\u00e9vu au pr\u00e9sent article est, quant au surplus et sauf incompatibilit\u00e9 avec les dispositions ci-dessus, sujet \u00e0 l'application des articles 959 \u00e0 972 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, sauf qu'aucun cautionnement n'est requis dans aucun cas.\n10c. L'exercice de l'un des recours pr\u00e9vus par les articles 10a et 10b n'exclut pas l'exercice de l'autre.\nLe demandeur-appelant, Laurier Saumur, un t\u00e9moin de J\u00e9hovah, a institu\u00e9 devant les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec une action dans laquelle il demande que cette l\u00e9gislation soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ultra vires des pouvoirs de la province.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 cette action et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel2. Ce dernier tribunal ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9 sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une semblable action ne pouvait \u00eatre institu\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Devant cette Cour, lors des arguments, le tribunal a inform\u00e9 le procureur de l'appelant qu'il ne serait entendu que sur son droit qu'il peut avoir de prendre une telle action d\u00e9claratoire. La Cour a cru et croit encore que, si tel droit existe, l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, et le dossier retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel afin que nous puissions avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'opinion du plus haut tribunal de la province sur la question constitutionnelle. L'unique question qui se pose est donc de savoir si l'action qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e a un fondement l\u00e9gal et si elle est reconnue par la loi et la jurisprudence de la province da Qu\u00e9bec. Il est certain que le demandeur n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9 depuis que la loi est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Au surplus, le procureur de Saumur a affirm\u00e9 qu'il n'entre pas dans les activit\u00e9s des T\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah de faire ce que d\u00e9fend la loi en question. Il nous demande de pr\u00e9venir les troubles que cette l\u00e9gislation pourrait peut-\u00eatre plus tard lui occasionner, et de le pr\u00e9server de l'inconv\u00e9nient dont il n'a pas encore souffert.\nLe demandeur-appelant fait partie d'une secte religieuse connue sous le nom des \u00abT\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah\u00bb. Ces derniers \u00e9videmment ont le droit de pratiquer cette religion, et, comme j'ai eu l'occasion de le dire dans le cause de Chaput v. Romain3:\n\u2026 Dans notre pays, il n'existe pas de religion d'\u00c9tat. Personne n'est tenu d'adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 une croyance quelconque. Toutes les religions sont sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9, et tous les catholiques comme d'ailleurs tous les protestants, les juifs, ou les autres adh\u00e9rents des diverses d\u00e9nominations religieuses, ont la plus enti\u00e8re libert\u00e9 de penser comme ils le d\u00e9sirent. La conscience de chacun est une affaire personnelle, et l'affaire de nul autre. Il serait d\u00e9solant de penser qu'une majorit\u00e9 puisse imposer ses vues religieuses \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9. Ce serait une erreur f\u00e2cheuse de croire qu'on sert son pays ou sa religion, en refusant dans une province, \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9, les m\u00eames droits que l'on revendique soi-m\u00eame avec raison, dans une autre province.\nMais ceci n'est pas le point essentiel qui doit d\u00e9terminer le sort du pr\u00e9sent litige. Je suis d'opinion, pour les raisons suivantes, que cet appel ne peut r\u00e9ussir, parce que le demandeur-appelant ne pouvait instituer la pr\u00e9sente action, et qu'il n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi. Le demandeur-appelant voudrait par une action institu\u00e9e en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, et dont il a pris l'initiative, faire d\u00e9clarer invalide une loi de la L\u00e9gislature avant m\u00eame qu'il ne soit l\u00e9s\u00e9. En vertu du chapitre 8 des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec 1941, le Lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil peut soumettre \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine, jurisdiction d'appel, pour audition et examen, toute question quelconque qu'il juge \u00e0 propos et obtenir ainsi l'opinion des juges. L'opinion de la Cour, bien que ne comportant qu'un avis, est trait\u00e9e pour toutes les fins d'appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, comme un jugement d\u00e9cisif rendu par ladite Cour entre les parties. De plus, le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en conseil peut, en vertu de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, art. 55, soumettre \u00e0 notre Cour des questions importantes de droit ou de faits, l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, la constitutionnalit\u00e9 ou l'interpr\u00e9tation d'une l\u00e9gislation, et, enfin, toute autre mati\u00e8re, qu'elle soit ou non, dans l'opinion de la Cour, ejusdem generis, que celles qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l'art. 55. Mais un tel droit n'appartient pas \u00e0 un citoyen.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec l'action d\u00e9claratoire n'existe pas. Ses tribunaux ne donnent pas de consultations l\u00e9gales; ils jugent les litiges. Les questions acad\u00e9miques et th\u00e9oriques o\u00f9 aucun lis n'existe leur ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8res. La seule crainte que peut avoir un citoyen qu'un jour une action possible peut \u00eatre institu\u00e9e contre lui ne justifie pas per se un recours en justice. La porte des tribunaux n'est pas ouverte \u00e0 quiconque n'a pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel dans un litige. L'article 77 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile est p\u00e9remptoire \u00e0 ce sujet. Il se lit comme suit:\n77. Pour former une demande en justice, il faut y avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nCet int\u00e9r\u00eat, except\u00e9 dans les cas de dispositions contraires, peut n'\u00eatre qu'\u00e9ventuel.\nMais cet int\u00e9r\u00eat doit \u00eatre n\u00e9 et actuel malgr\u00e9 que les cons\u00e9quences ne puissent se faire sentir que plus tard. C'est ainsi que dans B\u00e9langer v. Th\u00e9berge4, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec a d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nUne action bas\u00e9e uniquement sur la crainte de dommages futurs n'est pas fond\u00e9e, et le Demandeur ne peut dans de telles circonstances exiger un cautionnement du D\u00e9fendeur.\nDans Ouimet v. Fleury5, la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec a d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nLes tribunaux sont constitu\u00e9s pour d\u00e9cider les litiges \u2026entre citoyens \u2026 non pour donner des opinions sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de leurs actions; \u2026pour intenter une action, il faut y avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9 et actuel, et \u2026 les jugements doivent \u00eatre susceptibles d'ex\u00e9cution.\nDans Harbour Commissioners of Montreal v. The Record Foundry & Machine Co.6, la Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nNeither do I consider that the fact, that the action stops short by asking for the annulment of the deed, without going on to ask for consequential relief, such as recovery of land or for a boundary procedure, indicates that the action is unfounded because of not having any useful object. A judgment which sets aside a deed, is not a mere judgment of declaration, but is a judgment which executes itself, if I may make use of such an expression. The relief consists in the annulment. I realize that a contrary view was taken recently by the majority of judges who decided the case of Daveluy vs Lamothe, in the particular state of facts which presented itself in that case, and to which I referred later in the case of Angers vs Langelier (20 K.B., 351).\nDans Village de la Malbaie v. Warren7, la Cour a affirm\u00e9 les principes suivants:\nMais, l'action actuelle n'est pas un de ces cas connus dans la doctrine et la jurisprudence, et on n'a jamais vu d'action pour demander au tribunal de d\u00e9clarer que des obligations ou des droits consign\u00e9s en toutes lettres dans un contrat existent, lorsque l'existence n'en est pas ni\u00e9e, ou encore quelle en est l'\u00e9tendue. Il ne suffit pas, en effet pour instituer une action qu'un droit existe, il faut aussi une l\u00e9sion de ce droit qui produit l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, lequel seul justifie l'institution d'une action.\nVide \u00e9galement Rochefort v. Godbout8, o\u00f9 M. le Magistrat de district en chef Ferdinand Roy fait une revue compl\u00e8te des autorit\u00e9s sur la mati\u00e8re et en conclut qu'aucune action ne peut \u00eatre institu\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu'un droit ne soit l\u00e9s\u00e9. C'est ce qui produit l'int\u00e9r\u00eat dans un proc\u00e8s. Pour poursuivre, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat doit \u00eatre imm\u00e9diat m\u00eame s'il est \u00e9ventuel.\nJe n'oublie pas qu'en vertu de l'art. 509 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, les parties qui ne s'entendent pas sur une question de droit susceptible de faire la base d'une action, lorsqu'elles s'accordent sur les faits, peuvent la soumettre au tribunal pour adjudication, en produisant au greffe un factum ou m\u00e9moire conjoint contenant un expos\u00e9 de la question de droit en litige et des faits qui y donnent lieu, et les conclusions de chacune des parties. Ce factum doit \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9 d'une d\u00e9position sous serment de chacune des parties, attestant que les faits sont vrais, que le d\u00e9bat est r\u00e9el, et qu'il n'a pas seulement pour objet l'obtention d'une opinion. Mais, \u00e9videmment, ceci est une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et ne peut en aucune fa\u00e7on affecter la cause qui nous pr\u00e9occupe.\nDe plus, il peut arriver que le tribunal soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement d'un conseil municipal ou d'une commission scolaire, mais ceci est sp\u00e9cifiquement autoris\u00e9 par les lois municipales ou scolaires.\nCette Cour a eu l'occasion de se prononcer sur cette question dans une cause de L'H\u00f4pital Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc v. Garneau9, et \u00e0 la page 435, voici comment se sont exprim\u00e9s les membres du tribunal:\nL'appelante a enfin invoqu\u00e9 l'argument que le jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine n'est qu'un jugement d\u00e9claratoire, non susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution. Je ne puis m'accorder avec cette pr\u00e9tention que je crois non fond\u00e9e. Il est certain que les tribunaux ne doivent pas donner des consultations l\u00e9gales, et qu'ils doivent s'abstenir de se prononcer sur des questions acad\u00e9miques, mais tel n'est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente. Ici, le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, s'il refuse le mandamus demand\u00e9, il annule une r\u00e9solution et redresse un tort dont l'intim\u00e9 souffrait pr\u00e9judice. Il apporte un rem\u00e8de qui est l'annulation de la r\u00e9solution, et comme le dit M. le Juge Cross, c'est l\u00e0 m\u00eame que se trouve l'ex\u00e9cution du jugement. Harbour Commissioners of Montreal v. Record Foundry Company (1911) 21 Qu\u00e9. K.B. 241.\nCe qui importe de retenir dans la pr\u00e9sente cause c'est que l'action d\u00e9claratoire n'existe pas, sauf en quelques cas isol\u00e9s. Il est donc impossible, dans le droit de Qu\u00e9bec, d'instituer une action comme celle qui l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, o\u00f9 l'on demande au tribunal, sans qu'il y ait de litige et sans qu'aucun droit ne soit l\u00e9s\u00e9, de d\u00e9clarer inconstitutionnelle une loi de la L\u00e9gislature. La conclusion doit donc \u00eatre que, si l'action n'existe pas, il est inutile d'examiner la validit\u00e9 du statut qui est attaqu\u00e9.\nLe Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada est intervenu dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, mais, comme je suis d'opinion que l'action principale n'est pas fond\u00e9e, il s'ensuit que l'intervention doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nL'appel est donc renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens et l'intervention sera \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9e, mais sans frais pour ou contre le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, appelants: W.

Bruens et al., [1964] S.C.R. 260\nDate: 1964-01-28\nMike Mamczasz and C. Mamczasz, Mamczasz Construction, Irving Bablitz and John McBride (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nOlive Bruens (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1963: October 24; 1964: January 28.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nMotor vehicles\u2014Motorist colliding at night with road construction equipment\u2014No breach of statutory duty with respect to lighting o) equipment\u2014Negligence in jailing to give adequate warning of presence of stationary packer on highway not established\u2014The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 856, ss. 42, 46.\nThe plaintiff brought an action for damages for personal injuries and property damage resulting from a collision between a motor vehicle, owned and operated by her, and a stationary packer, which was part of some road equipment being used on road construction work. The particular equipment involved consisted of a tractor behind which, in tandem, were two packers. The packers were owned by the defendants MM and CM who were the contractors carrying on the road construction. The defendant B owned the tractor and the defendant McB was the operator of the equipment.\nThe plaintiff's vehicle drove directly into the back of the rear packer. The accident occurred on a clear night; there was no dust and there was no other traffic in the vicinity. The trial judge found that the plaintiff's rate of speed was too fast for the area in question and this finding was not disturbed on appeal. Flare pots had been placed at certain positions on the stretch of the road under construction for the purpose of giving warning of danger, and similar flare pots had been placed on the top and at the corners of each of the two packers, two at the front of the first and two at the back corners of the rear one. The packers also had red reflectors on the rear end.\nThe action was dismissed at trial. On appeal the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that there had been negligence on the part of the defendants as well as on the part of the plaintiff and that responsibility should be apportioned as to two-thirds to the defendants and as to one-third to the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThe conclusion reached by the Appellate Division was based in part upon the provisions of subss. (1) and (2) of s. 42 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 356. However, these subsections related to the provision of equipment on vehicles, but did not lay down any statutory duty as to when that equipment was to be used. It was necessary to look elsewhere to ascertain the requirements of the Act as to lighting. The only provisions in relation to stationary vehicles on the highway which might be relevant in this case were paras. (d), (e) and (f) of s. 46. It was evident, from an examination of these provisions, that there had not been established, as against the defendants, any breach of a statutory duty with respect to the lighting of the rear packer.\nOn the remaining issue as to whether the plaintiff had successfully established negligence on the part of the defendants in failing to give adequate warning of the presence of the stationary packer on the highway, the trial judge had found that the construction area and the packers were adequately lighted so as to warn a reasonably careful driver. This finding was supported by the evidence. This Court did not infer from the evidence, as did the Appellate Division, that it was probable that the two flare pots placed at the back of the rear packer, some five to six feet apart, would induce confusion in the mind of an approaching driver, or mislead such driver as to the true danger.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, reversing a judgment of McLaurin C.J.T.D. Appeal allowed.\nH. L. Irving, for the defendants, appellants.\nH. P. Macdonald, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2, which reversed the judgment at the trial, which had dismissed the respondent's claim for damages for personal injuries and property damage resulting from a collision between a motor vehicle, owned and operated by her, and a stationary packer, sometimes referred to in the evidence as a \"wobbly\". The packer was a part of some road equipment being used on road construction work on provincial highway No. 13, near the town of Sedgwick, Alberta. The particular equipment involved in this case consisted of a tractor behind which, in tandem, were two packers. The appellants Mike Mamczasz and C. Mamczasz, carrying on business as Mamczasz Construction, were the contractors who were carrying on the road construction work and the owners of the packers. The appellant Bablitz owned the tractor and the appellant McBride was the operator of the equipment at the time the accident giving rise to the respondent's claim occurred.\nThis accident took place shortly after 10:00 p.m. on August 20, 1956. The respondent was driving her Austin automobile west along provincial highway No. 13 which, in relation to the scene of the accident, runs generally in an east and west direction. The highway in question was under construction, at that time, for a distance of approximately three miles. The respondent had entered the construction area at its easterly end and had travelled, through the construction area, a distance of some two to two and one-half miles before the collision occurred.\nAs she proceeded west, at the commencement of the construction area, the respondent would pass five signs, each of which was marked with a flare pot, warning of the existence of construction ahead and advising of a speed limit in the construction area of 25 miles per hour. She would then reach a section of the highway where there was a gravel windrow extending down the centre of the road. It was marked by flare pots placed upon it at intervals of 300 to 400 yards.\nOn the night in question the respondent drove past a tractor, to which were attached two wobblies in tandem, which was also proceeding west and which was travelling between the centre windrow and the north side of the highway. The rear packer was marked by two flare pots, one at each side of the back of the packer, and by two reflectors. The respondent, in passing this equipment, drove to the south of the centre windrow. The operator of the equipment had seen her pass by earlier in the evening, when she had been driving in an easterly direction through the construction area toward Lougheed.\nAfter passing this equipment the respondent returned to the north side of the centre windrow and proceeded up a rise in the road. After reaching the crest of this rise there was a gradual descent for a distance of some 400 to 500 yards to the scene of the collision.\nPrior to the collision the respondent had travelled beyond the west end of the centre windrow from where, for a distance of a few hundred feet, there was no obstruction on the highway. She then reached the east end of another windrow which was located along the north boundary of the highway. This windrow was some seven feet in width, occupying that amount of what otherwise would have been a part of the travelled road surface. It was approximately one and one-half feet in height and it continued along the north boundary of the highway for a distance of about 2,000 feet to the west. It was marked at its easterly end by two flare pots and was then marked along its length by further flare pots placed upon it and spaced about 300 to 400 yards apart. At the west end of the construction area there were also warning signs placed on the south side of the road, each of which was marked by a flare pot.\nThe packer with which the respondent's automobile collided was standing facing west alongside and close to the north windrow and about 200 feet from the easterly end of that windrow. The packer consisted of a box-type body, filled with gravel, mounted on axles front and back, on each of which were eight to ten rubber-tired wheels. The box was yellow in colour and had red reflectors some three to four inches in diameter on its rear end. Flare pots, similar to those on the ground and upon the windrows, were placed on the top and at the corners of each of the two wobblies, two at the front of the first and two at the back corners of the rear one.\nThe appellant McBride, the operator of this equipment, shortly before the accident, had been proceeding east along the highway. He proceeded to turn in order to travel west and, while turning, observed a light glow on the top of the rise in the highway to the east. He completed his turn and observed that the glow had been caused by two headlights which were those on the respondent's vehicle. In making the turn he had noticed that one tire on the wobbly did not seem to be packing properly and accordingly he drove alongside the north windrow and stopped, waiting to dismount until the approaching vehicle should pass the equipment. Instead of passing, the respondent's vehicle drove directly into the rear of the back wobbly with sufficient force to move the wobbly slightly toward the left and toward the front and to cause substantial damage to it. The front end of the respondent's automobile was demolished.\nThe highway at the point of collision was 39\u00bd feet wide. The travelled portion, allowing for the seven-foot windrow, was 32\u00bd feet. The distance from the left rear wheel of the wobbly to the south edge of the road was 22 feet four inches.\nThe night was clear, there was no dust and there was no other traffic in the vicinity when the accident occurred. There were no marks on the surface of the highway to indicate that the brakes of the respondent's car had been applied prior to the collision occurring.\nThere was some evidence as to the speed of the respondent's vehicle, on the basis of which the learned trial judge made a finding that the respondent's rate of speed was too fast for the area in question. This finding was not disturbed on appeal.\nThe learned trial judge stated the issue in the case and his conclusion as follows:\nThe simple question arises as to whether the road, a construction area, and the wobblies, were adequately lighted so as to warn any reasonably careful driver. In all the surrounding circumstances it appears to me that the driver Bruens was negligent, and that the road operators were without fault.\nOn appeal the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that there had been negligence on the part of the appellants as well as on the part of the respondent and that the responsibility should be apportioned as to two-thirds to the appellants and as to one-third to the respondent. This conclusion was based in part upon the provisions of subss. (1) and (2) of s. 42 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 356, which provide as follows:\n42. (1) A motor vehicle, any trailer and any vehicle being drawn at the end of a train of vehicles, shall be equipped with at least one tail lamp mounted on the rear and capable, when lighted as required by this Act, of emitting a red light plainly visible from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), in the case of a train of vehicles, only the tail lamp on the rear-most vehicle need be seen from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear.\nThe word \"vehicle\" is defined in this Act, in s. 2(t), as follows:\n\"vehicle\" means a motor vehicle, trailer, traction engine and any vehicle drawn, propelled, or driven by any kind of power, including muscular power, but does not include the cars of electric or steam railways running only upon rails.\nThe Court held that the equipment in question constituted a \"train of vehicles\" within the meaning of s. 42(1) and that there had been a breach by the appellants of the statutory duty imposed upon them by that subsection which had contributed to the accident. The Court was of the opinion that the appellants had substituted their own method of providing protection for users of the highway and held that they did so at their own peril.\nWith respect, I am unable to agree that the appellants were in breach of any statutory duty imposed upon them which could be held to be a cause of this accident. Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 42 of the Act require that, in the case of a train of vehicles, the rear-most vehicle be equipped with a tail lamp at the rear. They provide that such light must be capable, when lighted as required by the Act, of emitting a red light visible at a distance of 500 feet to the rear. These subsections relate to the provision of equipment on vehicles, but do not lay down any statutory duty as to when that equipment must be used. It is necessary to look elsewhere to ascertain the requirements of the Act as to lighting. These requirements are contained in s. 46. Subsection (1)(c) of that section states:\n46. (1) At any time during the period between one hour after sunset and one hour before sunrise or at any other time when atmospheric conditions are such that objects on the highway are not plainly visible at a distance of three hundred feet\n* * *\n(c) no motor vehicle or tractor shall be in motion upon any highway unless the tail lamp with which it is required to be equipped is alight,\nThis is the only provision which contains a requirement as to the lighting of the tail lamp which is mentioned in subss. (1) and (2) of s. 42.\nSection 46 contains separate provisions in relation to stationary vehicles on the highway. The only ones which might be relevant in this case are paras. (d), (e) and (f), which provide that, during the period defined in subs. (1),\n(d) no motor vehicle or tractor shall be stationary on any highway outside the corporate limits of any city, town or village unless either\n(i) it has a lighted tail lamp, or\n(ii) it has affixed to the left of the rear thereof a reflector of any type approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and so fixed as to reflect the lights of any motor vehicle approaching the stationary vehicle from the rear,\n(e) no vehicle other than a motor vehicle, motor cycle or bicycle shall be upon any highway whether in motion or stationary unless there is displayed thereon at least one light visible at a distance of at least one hundred feet from the front of and behind that vehicle, or in the alternative, there are affixed thereon one reflector towards the front and one reflector at the rear thereof of a type approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, so fixed as to reflect the lights of any motor vehicle approaching from the front and the other so fixed as to reflect the lights of any motor vehicle approaching from the rear,\n(f) no vehicle drawn by or attached to a motor vehicle and commonly known as a trailer shall be upon any highway unless it has affixed at the rear thereof a reflector of a type approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council so fixed as to reflect the lights of any motor vehicle approaching from the rear,\nIn the result, therefore, there has not been established, as against the appellants, any breach of a statutory duty with respect to the lighting of the rear packer.\nApart from the issue as to statutory duty, there remains the question as to whether the respondent has successfully established negligence on the part of the appellants in failing to give adequate warning of the presence of the stationary packer on the highway. On this issue the learned trial judge has found that the construction area and the wobblies were adequately lighted so as to warn a reasonably careful driver. In my opinion this finding is supported by the evidence.\nI do not infer from the evidence, as did the Appellate Division, that it is probable that the two flare pots placed at the rear of the back wobbly, some five to six feet apart, would induce confusion in the mind of an approaching driver, or mislead such driver as to the true danger. The respondent had travelled past 21 flare pots before the collision occurred, each of which had obviously been placed in its position for the purpose of giving warning of danger. She had passed, shortly earlier, similar road equipment, which had been similarly marked. At no place along the road under construction, to the point of the accident, had flare pots been placed on each side of the travelled route so as to mark a course between them. I do not, therefore, draw the inference that the two flare pots at the rear of the wobbly, situated some two and one-half feet higher than those which marked the right-hand windrow, would have led an approaching driver, taking reasonable care for her own safety, to conclude that they constituted an invitation to pass between them.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs to the appellants in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and in this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Clement, Parlee, Whittaker, Irving, Mustard & Rodney, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Macdonald & Dean, Edmonton.\n1 (1962), 39 W.W.R. 157, 33 D.L.R.

The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 267\nDate: 1964-03-23\nPhilip Springman Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen Respondent.\n1964: January 31; 1964: March 23.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nCriminal law\u2014Arson\u2014Whether bunkhouses mounted on wheels \"buildings or structures\" within the meaning of s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.\nThe accused was convicted of arson under s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The case for the Crown was that he had counselled another man to set fire to his construction camp consisting of mobile or portable equipment, namely, inter alia, two bunkhouses and a combined bunkhouse and office. It was admitted that these were mounted on wheels for the purpose of ready movement from place to place. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held that, although some of the equipment was not a building or structure within s. 374(1)(a) of the Code, the bunkhouses fell within that meaning. The accused appealed to this Court, the appeal being limited as to the bunkhouses only.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nThe items in question were not buildings or structures within the meaning of s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. To fall within the section, a building or structure must be an unmovable property. In the present case the equipment was fundamentally movable property, without fixed or permanent foundations.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming the conviction of the appellant for arson. Appeal allowed.\nGeorge J. D. Taylor, Q.C. and Calvin F. Tallis, for the appellant.\nS. Kujawa, for the respondent. The Chief Justice:\u2014The appellant Philip Springman, formerly of Nipawin, Saskatchewan, now of Vancouver, B.C., was on April 2, 1963, convicted by His Honour Judge Forbes at Regina on the following charge:\nThat he, the said Philip Springman, did on or about the 16th day of September, 1961, in the Davin District, Saskatchewan, without legal justification or excuse and without colour of right, unlawfully and wilfully set fire to the Nipawin Construction Company Limited camp, and did thereby commit arson, contrary to section 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against both the conviction and the sentence. Both appeals were dismissed.\nThe charge was laid under s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code which says that every one who wilfully sets fire to a building or structure, whether completed or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.\nThe evidence reveals that the Nipawin Construction Company Limited, owned by the appellant and his wife, had a substantial amount of equipment and that, during the summer of 1961, this equipment was situated near Davin. The company was engaged in supplying sand, gravel and crushed rock, and the equipment that was burnt was being made use of in this operation. It consisted of a crusher, loaders, trucks, bunkhouses and work-shops. It is the contention of the respondent that all this equipment was within the meaning of s. 374(1)(a) and was a building or structure, whether completed or not. The appellant contends that the Courts below erred in holding that this equipment should thus be classified because it was completely mobile, being either self-propelled or mounted on wheels and designed to be moved by power Units. It is therefore contended on behalf of the appellant that if he did set fire to this equipment, he should have been prosecuted under s. 374(2) of the Criminal Code which is in the following terms:\n(2) Every one who wilfully and for a fraudulent purpose sets fire to personal property not mentioned in subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years.\nThe maximum punishment if the appellant is found guilty under s. 374(1)(a) is 14 years, and 5 years if convicted under s. 374(2). Parliament has carefully divided s. 374 in two groups, and I am satisfied that subs, (a) of s. 374 \"a building or structure\" covers immovable property and that the balance of subs. (1) also covers property which has a more considerable value than all that is contained in the residuary clause s. 374(2) (the whole subject to s. 375).\nIn the present case, as previously stated, the equipment to which the fire was set could be easily moved from one place to another. I think that fundamentally this equipment was movable property.\nThis I believe is the law in the common law provinces and in the province of Quebec. In the province of Quebec it has been decided by this Court in Dulac v. Nadeau in2:\nMais il y a plus. En effet, et quant au b\u00e2timent de Nadeau,\u2014et on pourrait ajouter, celui de Morin,\u2014il s'agit clairement d'immeubles par nature suivant les dispositions de l'article 376 C.C. Sans doute, on peut bien, ainsi qu'on le fait remarquer dans Colin et Capitant, Cours El\u00e9mentaire de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, XI\u00e8 \u00e9dition, tome 1, N\u00b0 922, ou dans les termes de Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais (1926) tome 3, 75, rappeler que \u00ables constructions volantes \u00e9tablies \u00e0 la surface du sol pour quelques jours et r\u00e9\u00e9difi\u00e9es ailleurs, de place en place, telles que les baraques de foire, ne sont pas des immeubles parce que ces \u00e9difices l\u00e9gers n'ont pas de place fixe.\u00bb Mais les deux auteurs reconnaissent, aux m\u00eames pages, le principe que \u00abpour qu'une construction soit immeuble, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle soit \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, que les b\u00e2timents construits pour une exposition sont immeubles quoiqu'ils soient destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9molis.\u00bb\nIt will be easily realized by the reading of the opinions of these authors that the French law is quite similar to the English law, and that an immovable is something that is not to be forced from its place. It has the characteristics of things real or land, although constructions built on the surface of the soil for some length of time, and later rebuilt somewhere else, from place to place, are not immovables because these buildings have no fixed or permanent foundations.\nI therefore agree with the reasons of my colleague Mr. Justice Hall, and I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014The facts in connection with this appeal are set out fully in the judgment of Culliton C.J.S. and shortly are as follows: the accused was charged that he, the said Philip Springman, did on or about the 16th day of September, 1961, in the Davin District, Saskatchewan, without legal justification or excuse, and without colour of right, unlawfully and wilfully set fire to the Nipawin Construction Company Limited camp and did thereby commit arson contrary to s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was first tried by a judge and jury at which trial the jury were unable to agree upon a verdict. He then elected to be tried by a judge without a jury and was tried by His Honour Judge Forbes who found him guilty and sentenced him to a term of two years in a penitentiary.\nThe Nipawin Construction Company was a limited company, all of the shares of which had been held by the appellant Springman and his wife. The company owned a large amount of equipment, and, immediately prior to the fire on September 16, 1961, had been engaged in the production of crushed rock under a contract with Concrete Rock Products Limited of Regina. The operation was being carried out near Davin, Saskatchewan, and as production was too slow at that point, the appellant had given instructions to his foreman, Charles Wingert, to line up the camp for a move. The camp was lined up for movement so that everything could be moved quickly, and, while stationary, could be served by the central propane unit which supplied heat to the bunkhouses and electricity from the portable light plant. The machinery and equipment consisted of a propane truck, welding truck, a number of other trucks and power units, a house trailer with a half-ton truck, a rock crusher, a front end loader, a light plant, a cook car, two bunkhouses and a combined bunkhouse and office. It was admitted that the bunkhouses, cook car and house trailer were all mounted on wheels for the purpose of ready movement from place to place wherever rock crushing operations were to be carried on.\nThe fire which destroyed this machinery and equipment was set by Charles Wingert, the foreman, and Peter Mihailuk, an employee. The case for the Crown was that the appellant counselled Mihailuk to set the fire. Mihailuk gave evidence that he had been induced by the appellant to set the fire and he was to receive a new truck or car and $4,000 or $5,000 for so doing. Following his conviction by His Honour Judge Forbes, the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal3 for Saskatchewan from both conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal were as follows:\n(1) That on the facts, including the facts as to source and credibility of the evidence of the commission of the crime and the connection of the accused therewith, the verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, and therefore ought to be quashed;\n(2) That as a matter of law there is no evidence of any offence against Section 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, since the \"camp\" referred to in the charge (being mobile or portable equipment consisting of a gravel crusher, trucks, trailers, bunkhouses, etc. \u2026 is not within the meaning of the words \"a building or structure\" appearing in the said Section 374(1)(a).\nThe Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan unanimously rejected the appeal under ground 1, holding that the learned trial judge's findings on the evidence should not be disturbed.\nThe Court, however, (Maguire J.A. dissenting) while accepting the argument that the trucks and power units, the rock crusher, the front end loader and the light plant were not buildings or structures within the meaning of s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, held that the two bunk-houses and the combined bunkhouse and office were buildings or structures within the meaning of the said section.\nMaguire J.A. in his dissenting judgment held that, in addition to the items which the majority found were not \"buildings or structures whether completed or not\", the two bunkhouses and the combined bunkhouse and office were also not \"buildings or structures whether completed or not\" within the meaning of the said section on the grounds that:\n\u2026 being designed and constructed upon a wheeled chassis, for the purpose of ready movement from place to place, and the temporary use in each said place, do not fall within \"a building or structure\".\nThe appeal to this Court is limited to the question as to whether the two bunkhouses and the combined bunkhouse and office were \"buildings or structures\" within the meaning of s. 374(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\nWith respect, I think that Maguire J.A. was right in holding that the two bunkhouses and the combined bunkhouse and office were not buildings or structures within the meaning of the section in question. I accept that the term \"structure\" is not to be construed ejusdem generis with the term \"building\": London County Council v. Tann4. However, both \"buildings\" and \"structures\" do possess certain essential characteristics, some of which are common to both.\nThe case of London County Council v. Pearce5 appears to be in point. There the question whether a builders' office constructed of wood and roofed with zinc, and placed upon iron wheels for the purpose of enabling it to be wheeled about to any place where building operations were being carried on, was, when not required at any such place, kept in the builder's own yard and used as a pay-office for his men was a \"wooden structure or erection of a moveable or temporary character\" within the meaning of s. 13 of the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment Act, 1882. Pollock B. said at p. 111:\nNo special meaning can be given to the word \"structure\" or the word \"erection\" as something distinct from a building; and it cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that everything which could in any sense be called a wooden building of a temporary character should be within the section. It is the duty of the magistrate to say whether a particular thing (I purposely use an indefinite expression) is within the definition. It is obvious that there are many things which, in a sense, would be wooden structures or erections, but could not possibly be held to come within the section, such as a dog-kennel or a van for removing furniture, which would be a much larger and heavier thing than such a pay-office as that in question. There are, therefore, many considerations which ought legitimately to influence the magistrate in coming to his decision. I think that in the present case the learned magistrate was perfectly right in holding that this pay-office was a part of a builder's plant; it is a thing which is moved from one set of buildings to another as occasion requires, and when not in use in the ordinary way it is at rest upon the builder's premises, and is used for the convenience of paying his men, which seems a very reasonable proceeding.\nand Vaughan Williams J. said at pp. 112-3:\nThe magistrate was of opinion that prim\u00e2 facie a carriage on wheels was not a wooden structure or erection within the meaning of the section. I do not mean to say that a man is to be allowed to evade the Act of Parliament by building on wheels what he intends to be a wooden structure, and then saying that it is not within the Act because it is on wheels. In all cases we must be guided by what I may call the intentions of the structure, and must inquire with what intention it was made. This seems clear from the case of Hall v. Smallpiece, 59 L.J. (M.C) 97, where it was held that a steam roundabout was not a wooden structure or erection within the meaning of the Act. Why was that held? Not because a thing on wheels cannot be within the section, but because when one looks into the intention with which the thing was made, it becomes plain that it was made for the purpose of locomotion and for erection in any place where it might be required.\nIn Cardiff Rating Authority v. Guest Keen, Limited6, Denning L.J. (as he then was), in discussing what is a \"building or structure or in the nature of a structure\" said at p. 31:\nA structure is something which is constructed, but not everything which is constructed is a structure. A ship, for instance, is constructed, but it is not a structure. A structure is something of substantial size which is built up from component parts and intended to remain permanently on a permanent foundation, but it is still a structure even though some of its parts may be moveable, as, for instance, about a pivot. Thus, a windmill or a turntable is a structure. A thing which is not permanently in one place is not a structure, but it may be \"in the nature of a structure\" if it has a permanent site and has all the qualities of a structure, save that it is on occasion moved on or from its site.\nWe are not concerned here with anything \"that is in the nature of a structure\". We have to deal with items that are either \"buildings\" or \"structures\".\nMy view that the items in question in this appeal are neither \"buildings\" nor \"structures\" is strengthened by the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Rex v. Arpin7, in which it was held that a railway freight car was not a \"building\" within the meaning of s. 461 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc in The King v. Levy and Gray8, in which it was held that the buffet of a parlour car on a railway was not a \"building\" within s. 461 of the Code. In this latter case Chisholm J. (as he then was) said at p. 232:\nI have come to the conclusion that the buffet of a parlour car is not a building within the meaning of section 461 of the Criminal Code. A building is defined by Bouvier (p. 400) as \"an edifice\", erected by art and fixed upon or over the soil, composed of brick, marble, wood or other proper substance, connected together, and designed for use in the position in which it is so fixed.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal allowed and conviction quashed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Goldenberg, Taylor, Tallis & Goldenberg, Saskatoon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S.

Hamilton (City), [1964] S.C.R. 274\nDate: 1964-01-28\nAlfred K. Herrington (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Corporation of the City of Hamilton (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nGisele Fernande Herrington and Samuel Taylor Respondents.\n1963: November 21, 22; 1964: January 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nExpropriation\u2014Compensation fixed by Municipal Board\u2014Books of going business almost non-existent\u2014Valuation based on land values plus replacement cost of buildings less depreciation\u2014Revision of Board\u2019s figures not to be attempted unless Board exercised judgment upon improper principles.\nThe City of Hamilton expropriated certain lands of which the appellant and his wife were owners as joint tenants and which formed part of the property of a partnership in which they were the only partners. One T was appointed receiver of all the assets of the partnership with power to manage the business of the partnership until the conclusion of the expropriation proceedings. The Ontario Municipal Board, which was appointed the sole arbitrator, fixed the compensation at $50,525. The husband, the wife and T appealed to ask that the compensation be increased. The appeal was dismissed. The husband alone decided to appeal to this Court, and served notice of appeal upon the solicitors for the City and the solicitor for his wife and T. A motion by the City to quash the appeal on the ground that the appellant had no status to maintain the appeal because a partner cannot sue alone to recover a debt due to the partnership was dismissed ([1964] S.C.R. 69.). The husband then proceeded with his appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Municipal Board could not base a valuation of the expropriated premises on the profit situation of the business as the claimants\u2019 so-called books were almost non-existent. It was not possible for the Board to adjourn the matter for further and better evidence on the subject of profits. Such evidence did not exist and could not be created as the foundation data itself did not exist. The Board then proceeded to consider the evidence of value on the basis of land values plus replacement cost of buildings less depreciation. The board members heard the witnesses and had an opportunity to weigh and compare the value of the various pieces of evidence given, and the figures set out in their finding represented their judgment of the probative value of those various pieces of evidence. Unless it appeared that the Board were exercising their judgment upon improper principles, this Court should not attempt to revise their figures. The Court might have found much less drastic rates of depreciation but if that could be done only by exercising judgment upon the evidence, the Court should not apply its opinion of the evidence to amend that of the members of the Board who heard the evidence.\nAs to the claim for certain groynes, despite the fact that they must have cost the claimants a very considerable sum, albeit one quite impossible to determine on the evidence, the Court below was right in saying that the groynes simply were necessary for the preservation of the lands upon which the buildings stood; if the groynes had been absent there would be no land to be expropriated, and the claimants would have simply been able to claim for a useless water-covered lot. Therefore, the Board would not have been justified in making an allowance for the cost of the groynes.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming an expropriation award fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nAlfred K. Herrington, in person.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and B.H. Kellock, for the respondent corporation.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was argued by the appellant in person. The appellant, however, was represented by skilled counsel both in the Court of Appeal and at the hearing before the Municipal Board when all the evidence was the subject of minute examination and cross-examination. That Board fixed the compensation payable to the appellants for the expropriation of the lands and buildings in the City of Hamilton at a total of $50,525 made up as follows:\n1. Duplex..........................................................\n$ 6,500\n2. Cottage property.........................................\n2,000\n3. Vacant lots...................................................\n3,025\n4. Cove Restaurant.........................................\n30,000\n5. Allowance for disturbance..........................\n6,000\n6. Allowance for possibility that Van Wagner\u2019s Beach Road be rebuilt...................\n3,000\n$ 50,525\nIn the Court of Appeal and again in this Court no question was raised as to any of the first three amounts. We are, therefore, concerned with the latter three only.\nThe Board, dealing with restaurant property after reciting the history of the purchase of the various portions of it, the lease of certain other lands, the construction of the groynes to prevent erosion and of certain additions and also the complete washing out of the Van Wagner\u2019s Beach Road access, turned to the fixing of compensation upon the following basis:\n1. Land Values.\n2. Replacement value of buildings, less depreciation.\nIn the notice of appeal from the decision of the Board to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the grounds of appeal include:\n1. The Ontario Municipal Board erred in not applying the test of value to the owner in disallowing the Claimants compensation for the Groynes and for the partly completed addition to the restaurant.\n2. The Board erred in not applying the test of value to the owner in awarding the Claimants compensation for the value of the leasehold interest.\n* * *\n4. The Board erred in assessing compensation for the restaurant in not taking into account the income received from the business which the Claimants were carrying on in those premises.\nExamining these grounds of appeal, Laidlaw J.A. said:\nIt is sufficient to say that in my opinion the amounts of gross estimated profits shown on that statement are dependent to such an extent upon such uncertainties, speculation and estimates upon which no reliance can be placed as to render the probative value of that report nil. It would not be safe in my opinion for any tribunal exercising judicial functions to found an appraisal or an award of compensation on that evidence. In my opinion the claimant has failed entirely to establish the amount of gross profits from the operation of this business as a reliable and proper basis on which to award compensation\u2026\nThen in such circumstances what was the Board to do to ascertain the proper amount of compensation payable to the claimants? It was the duty of the Board, in my humble opinion, to consider the available evidence that would best enable them to value these properties and to fix a compensation that would be adequate and sufficient to indemnify the owners. The only basis upon which the Board could proceed in the particular circumstances was to consider the replacement value of the property expropriated less proper depreciation from the value of each of the various items.\nHaving read the evidence given upon the expropriation proceedings by Mr. Samuel Taylor, the receiver appointed by the Court in Ontario in an action by the female claimant against the male claimant, and also the evidence given by the male claimant A.K. Herrington and the other witnesses called by him, I am of the opinion that Laidlaw J.A.\u2019s view as to the probative value of the evidence as to profits is a sound one and I would not have agreed to have based any valuation of this expropriated restaurant premises upon such a haphazard conjecture.\nThen, I turn to the same query as Laidlaw J.A. expressed upon what was the Board\u2019s task. It would naturally occur to one that the Board might have set the matter over for further evidence in order to obtain reliable information upon the profit situation for admittedly the concept of value to the owner in the case of a going business would require a valuation based on this profit situation. Woods Manufacturing Company v. The King[1], per Rinfret C.J., at p. 514. It is by such an investigation that there could be determined what amount the owner, as a prudent business man, would have been prepared to pay for the property on the date of the expropriation rather than be forced to give up title and possession.\nIt appears, however, from a survey of the evidence to which I referred that such information simply could not be produced. The claimants\u2019 so-called books were almost non existent and consisted of some rather haphazard entries in a series of diaries from 1951 to 1958, and those entries bore little if any relation to the statement worked out by Mr. Taylor, the receiver. It would appear, moreover, that the data given with some degree of detail to Mr. Lounsbury, acting as adviser for the respondent corporation, again bore little relation to either the original data in these diaries or to Mr. Taylor\u2019s subsequently produced summaries. It is significant, in passing, that if Mr. Lounsbury informally offered $75,000 as compensation, an offer which it was stated, the claimant refused, he could only have done so on the inflated figures given to him by the claimant, to which I have just referred.\nIn the light of these circumstances, it was not possible for the Municipal Board to adjourn the matter for further and better evidence on the subject of profits. Such evidence did not exist and could not be created as the foundation data itself did not exist. The Municipal Board then proceeded to consider the evidence of value on the basis of land values plus replacement cost of buildings less depreciation, and the Board said:\nEssentially therefore the Board accepts the evidence of the respondent\u2019s witnesses as to the value of the restaurant and the leasehold interest in the parking lot. The Board then proceeded to cite the evidence of C.E. Parnell as to the value of the lands and the leasehold interest, i.e., land $6,750, leasehold interest $1,080, and the evidence of Donald Hall as to the value of the restaurant buildings at $17,500, being able to verify one item in Hall\u2019s valuation by comparing his valuation of the duplex with that of Mason, a claimant\u2019s witness. The Board found that Mason was only 10 per cent higher than Hall on that item and so the Board added 10 per cent to Hall\u2019s estimate of $17,500. With the addition of $2,920 for fixtures not included in Hall\u2019s valuation, these amounts totalled $30,000. It was this question of the valuation of the restaurant buildings at $17,500 plus 10 per cent which gave me the most concern. Donald Hall gave the replacement value of each of the various portions of the buildings at February 1961 costs and said that those costs were about 10 per cent higher than the cost in the year 1958, the date of the actual expropriation. This would, of course, give the claimants the advantage of that increase in cost. His depreciation allowance was, however, very drastic varying from 33 per cent on the unfinished reinforced concrete addition to 60 per cent on some other portions of the building. Such depreciation items are somewhat shocking. They were, however, the subject of astute cross-examination by skilled counsel for the claimant and no evidence contra other than the haphazard estimates of the claimant himself was introduced. It must be remembered that the Board members heard the witnesses and had an opportunity to weigh and compare the value of the various pieces of evidence given and that the figures set out in their finding represented their judgment of the probative value of those various pieces of evidence. Unless in this Court it appears that the Board were exercising their judgment upon improper principles, this Court should not attempt to revise their figures. So this Court might have found much less drastic rates of depreciation but if we could only do so by exercising our judgment upon the evidence, we should not apply our opinion of the evidence to amend that of the members of the Board who heard the evidence.\nAs I have noted, the Board itself figured the rates of depreciation were excessive and added 10 per cent in an attempt to overcome that excessive depreciation. Again, it is a matter for the Board\u2019s judgment whether that 10 per cent was a sufficient allowance to cover the excess. The various photograph exhibits, particularly those in exhibit 43, seem to show a tumble-down series of buildings and might give considerable support for what would appear an abnormally high depreciation.\nThe complaints to the Court of Appeal that the Board failed to allow the claimants\u2019 compensation for the groynes is dealt with by Laidlaw J.A. in the reasons for judgment. Firstly, reading the record, it would be very difficult to come to a proper ascertainment of the cost of these groynes upon the evidence given at the arbitration hearing before the Board. The evidence of the claimants again is haphazard at the best and the evidence given by others both for the claimants and for the respondent as to the costs of the groynes varied enormously. This factor, however, is not so important as the view taken in the Court of Appeal, and I think the proper view, as to the principle upon which the groynes should be considered. The Board in its reasons said:\nThe Board feels that the claim presented by the claimants for expenditures on the groyne and on the proposed addition, and on the loss on the chattel property, and the value of the leasehold interest and of the goodwill, were all essentially without substance unless Van Wagner\u2019s Beach Road was to be rebuilt.\nIn the Court of Appeal, on the other hand, Laidlaw J.A. dealt with the value of the groynes on a different basis, and said:\nIf the groynes had not been in existence and had not been in place at the time of expropriation, I think that no prudent purchaser would have given much if anything for the land having regard to the probability that it might be washed out for all useful purposes by storm waters. It is because of the existence of the groynes and the value of the land which they protect that the land has a value of $6,750.00. I think it would have been highly improper for the Board to have determined any separate amount as proposed by the claimants as an allowance to the owner for the groynes.\nDespite the fact that these groynes must have cost the claimants a very considerable sum, albeit one quite impossible to determine on the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that Laidlaw J.A. was right in saying that the groynes simply were necessary for the preservation of the lands upon which the buildings stood; if the groynes had been absent there would be no land to be expropriated, and the claimants would have simply been able to claim for a useless water-covered lot. Therefore, the Board would not have been justified in making an allowance for the cost of the groynes. In this Court, no particular argument was addressed to two other complaints before the Court of Appeal, i.e., the failure to value the air conditioning system in the building on the basis that it was a mere chattel, and the failure to make an allowance for a fresh water well on the land. Both of these matters were dealt with by Laidlaw J.A.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the respondent corporation: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\n[1] [1951] S.C.R. 504, 2 D.L.R. 465.\n",

Webster (Informant) Respondent.\n1963: October 29; 1964: January 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nCriminal law\u2014Sunday observance\u2014Non-profit film society providing dues-paying members with showings of films in a theatre on Sunday\u2014No charge made for admission\u2014Whether a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly contrary to the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, s. 6(1).\nThe appellant film society, a non-profit organization whose main function was to provide its members with the opportunity to enjoy films of a character not usually shown at commercial theatres, provided a \"performance\" by the showing of two films elsewhere than in a church on a Sunday. The society was convicted of violating s. 6(1) of the Lord's Lay Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. An appeal from the conviction was dismissed in the County Court and a further appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe society's membership dues, which were determined in accordance with its financial position and the anticipated expenses of the coming year, were fixed for the year 1961-62 at $6, in exchange for which the members were entitled to attend the showings of the society's films without payment of any admission charge and to participate in the affairs of the society generally.\nOn appeal to this Court, the main question to be determined was whether the appellant by providing its dues-paying members with showings of films in a theatre on Sunday without making a charge for admission at such theatre did unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission to such performance. Held: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nThere was nothing in the Lord's Day Act to prevent the society from providing any kind of performance anywhere on Sunday provided that it was not one at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly.\nThe Court was of the opinion that the fee charged for annual membership in the society bore no relationship to the number of times the individual members actually attended the performances which the society provided, and having regard to all the circumstances, these payments had more of the character of \"membership\" than of \"admission\" fees. This would not, however, necessarily conclude the matter if it had been shown that the performance provided by the appellant was one at which any kind of fee was charged directly or indirectly which entitled the person paying it to admission to the performance.\nThis was not a case where money or money's worth was paid at the performance under some device intended to give the payment the appearance of being charged for something other than admission (Recreation Operators Ltd. v. R. (1952), 15 C.R. 360), nor was it a case in which the admission charge was defrayed by the tender of money's worth in the form of a ticket purchased in advance (Marin v. United Amusement Corporation Ltd. (1929), 47 Que. K.B. 1).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, affirming a judgment of Philp Co. Ct. J. whereby appellant's appeal from its conviction by Dubienski P.M. for a violation of s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, was dismissed. Appeal allowed.\nM. J. Arpin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. J. Enns, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba2 which affirmed a judgment of Judge Philp of the County Court of Winnipeg whereby the learned County Court Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal from its conviction by Magistrate Dubienski at the Winnipeg Magistrate's Court on the charge that it\nOn the Lord's Day, to wit: the 7th day of January, A.D. 1962, at the City of Winnipeg aforesaid did unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged, directly or indirectly, for admission to such performance, contrary to the provisions of the statute in such case made and provided \u2026 The statutory provisions which the appellant is alleged to have contravened are those contained in s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, which read as follows:\nIt is not lawful for any person, on the Lord's Day, except as provided in any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to engage in any public game or contest for gain or for any prize or reward, or to be present thereat, or to provide, engage in, or be present at any performance or public meeting, elsewhere than in a church, at which any fee is charged, directly or indirectly, either for admission to such performance or meeting, or to any place within which the same is provided, or for any service or privilege thereat.\nA breach of this section exposes the offender to the penalty provided by s. 12 of the Act and upon conviction the appellant in the present case was sentenced to pay a fine of twenty-five dollars and costs and in default to have distress levied upon it for the said fine and costs.\nIt is not disputed that the appellant was duly incorporated in January of 1960 under the provisions of The Companies Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 43, for the purposes of carrying on without pecuniary gain, objects of a national, patriotic, philanthropic, scientific, artistic or social character or the like and it. is admitted that this society provided a \"performance\" by the showing of two films elsewhere than in a church on Sunday, January 7, 1962.\nThe main function of the society is to provide its members with the opportunity to enjoy films of a character not usually shown at commercial theatres; it is affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Film Societies and the work of its unpaid executive includes obtaining such films as the membership may desire, renting the premises where the films can be displayed, advising the membership of the nature of available film material and attending to the financial and social affairs of the society. The annual membership dues, which are determined in accordance with the financial position of the society and the anticipated expenses of the coming year, were fixed for the year 1961-62 at six dollars, in exchange for which the members were entitled to attend the showings of the society's films without payment of any admission charge and to participate in the affairs of the society generally. Membership in the society also included the privilege of bringing guests to the theatre if seats were available, but no fee of any kind was charged to anyone at the performance. It is relevant to note that many members of the society did not attend all film showings during any year and that some did not attend any at all.\nLeave to appeal to this Court was granted in general terms and twelve grounds of appeal are set out in the notice of appeal, but the main question to be determined is whether the appellant by providing its dues-paying members with showings of films in a theatre on Sunday without making any charge for admission at such theatre \"did\" to employ the words of the charge \"unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission to such performance\".\nThe final paragraph of the reasons for judgment delivered by Schultz J.A. on behalf of himself and Miller C.J.M., reads as follows:\nThe evidence is clear that in the instant case the society provided a showing of films for 850 of its members on Sunday, January 7, 1962, at a place other than a church; that no persons other than members of the society could, or did, obtain admission thereto; that such showing was paid for from the proceeds of the society's annual membership fees. In my opinion this constituted payment of an indirect charge and was a breach of sec. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act.\nMonnin J.A., whose reasons for judgment were concurred in by Guy J.A., concluded by saying:\nThe society, under the umbrella of the duly incorporated non-profit organization was attempting to do what was forbidden to commercial organizations and to other individuals or groups of individuals. The annual membership fee for all practical purposes is a season ticket but for an undetermined number of performances. The membership fee, being an indirect fee, is a violation of sec. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act.\nThe question of whether an annual membership fee entitling the member to repeated and general use of the facilities of a club or society is to be treated, for taxation purposes, as an \"admission fee\" for each occasion of actual use of those facilities, was considered in the case of Executives Club of Louisville v. Glen3, in which Circuit Court Judge Miller had occasion to refer to the test of what constitutes a \"due or membership fee\" laid down by Mr. Justice Jackson in the Supreme Court of the United States in White v. Winchester Club4 in the following terms:\nConsideration of the nature of club activity is a necessary preliminary to the formulation of a test of what constitutes a \"due or membership fee.\" So far as finances go, the fundamental notion of club activity is that operating expenses are shared without insistence upon equivalence between the proportion of an individual's contributions and the proportion of the benefits he receives. Thus, on the one hand, payment of the price of an individual dinner at the club dining room or of a single round of golf lacks the element of making common cause inherent in the idea of club activity. But, on the other hand, payment for the right to repeated and general use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time has that element and amounts to a \"due or membership fee\" if the payment is not fixed by each occasion of actual use.\nThe same test was applied in Merion Cricket Club v. United States5.\nThe appellant is a bona fide non-profit organization with national associations, the members of which, in addition to being admitted without charge to its performances, enjoy many of the intangible benefits to be derived from the sharing of common interests with fellow club members and from participating in guiding the administrative policy of the organization, including the selection of its films.\nI am satisfied that the charge of six dollars for annual membership in the Winnipeg Film Society bears no relationship to the number of times the individual members actually attend the performances which the society provides, and having regard to all the circumstances, I think that these payments have more of the character of \"membership\" than of \"admission\" fees. This would not, however, in my view, necessarily conclude the matter if it had been shown that the performance provided by the appellant on January 7, 1962, was one at which any kind of fee was charged directly or indirectly which entitled the person paying it to admission to the performance.\nIt is to be noted that s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act does not make it unlawful for any person to provide \"a performance\" elsewhere than in a church on Sunday, and there is nothing in the Lord's Day Act to prevent any society from providing any kind of performance anywhere on Sunday provided that it is not one \"at which any fee is charged directly or indirectly\".\nIt appears to me that s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act has its origin in the statute entitled \"An Act for preventing certain Abuses and Profanations on the Lord's Day, called Sunday\" which was passed in England in 1781 as 23 Geo. III, c. 49, and it is interesting to note that no offence is created by s. 1 of that statute for keeping open a place of entertainment on Sunday unless it be an entertainment \"to which persons shall be admitted by the payment of money or by tickets sold for money\". The section in question reads in part:\nThat, from and after the passing of this present Act, any house, room or other place, which shall be opened or used for public entertainment or amusement, or for publicly debating on any subject whatsoever, upon any part of the Lord's Day called Sunday, and to which persons shall be admitted by the payment of money, or by tickets sold for money, shall be deemed a disorderly house or place; and the keeper of such house, room, or place, shall forfeit the sum of two hundred pounds for every day that such house, room, or place, shall be opened or used as aforesaid. \u2026\nIt is clear that payment of money or money's worth for admission to a Sunday performance was an essential ingredient of the offence so created, but the meaning of the words \"admitted by the payment of money\" as used in this section was expressly extended by s. 2 of the same statute which reads, in part, as follows:\n\u2026 any house, room, or place, which shall be opened or used for any public entertainment or amusement, or for public debate, on the Lord's Day at the expense of any number of subscribers or contributors to the carrying on any such entertainment or amusement, or debate, on the Lord's Day, and to which persons shall be admitted by tickets, to which the subscribers or contributors shall be entitled, shall be deemed a house, room, or place, to which persons are admitted by the payment of money, within the meaning of this Act.\nThe Parliament of Canada has, however, not seen fit to extend the meaning of the words \"any performance \u2026 at which any fee is charged directly or indirectly for admission \u2026\" as they occur in s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act, and it appears to me that these words are clearly open to the interpretation that the charging of a fee either directly or indirectly at the performance is an essential ingredient of the offence here charged. It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the language of the charge and of the statute refers not only to a fee which is charged directly or indirectly at the performance, but also to an annual subscription which is charged at a place other than the performance in exchange for the privilege of belonging to the society which provides the performance. This appears to me to be tantamount to saying that a performance for which a fee is charged indirectly at another place and not necessarily on Sunday shall be treated for the purposes of the Lord's Day Act as being \" \u2026 a performance \u2026 at which a fee is charged \u2026 indirectly\" on Sunday. This latter construction does not appear to me to reflect the primary meaning of the language used in the charge by which the appellant is accused that it \"did unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission \u2026\". If these words were capable of the extended meaning sought to be placed upon them by the respondent they would, in my opinion, at best be ambiguous and if the two interpretations could both be sustained, the penal character of the statute would entitle the appellant to the benefit of the construction more favourable to it.\nThe relevant rule governing the construction of penal statutes is well summarized in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 36 at p. 415:\nIt is a general rule that penal enactments are to be construed strictly and not extended beyond their clear meaning. At the present day, this general rule means no more than that if, after the ordinary rules of construction have first been applied, as they must be, there remains any doubt or ambiguity, the person against whom the penalty is sought to be enforced is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.\nThe matter was succinctly stated by Lord Simonds in London and North Eastern Ry. Co. v. Berriman6, where he said:\nA man is not to be put in peril upon an ambiguity, however much or little the purpose of the Act appeals to the predilection of the court.\nThis is not a case where money or money's worth was paid at the performance under some device intended to give the payment the appearance of being charged for something other than admission (e.g. food, see Recreation Operators Ltd. v. The Queen6), nor is it a case in which the admission charge was defrayed by the tender of money's worth in the form of a ticket purchased in advance (Marin v. United Amusement Corporation Ltd.7).\nUnder all these circumstances it cannot in my opinion be said that the language of s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act and of the charge here laid is such as to apply without doubt or ambiguity to the performance provided by the appellant on Sunday, January 7, 1962. I would accordingly allow this appeal with costs throughout and direct that the conviction of the appellant be quashed.\nAppeal allowed with costs and conviction quashed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Arpin, Rich, Houston & Karlicki, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the respondent: O.

The infringement of the by-law was clear and had been persistent, continuous and defiant since 1957. The defendants attempted to have the by-law amended but their efforts were without success. Finally, on October 24, 1960, the city issued a writ for an injunction and obtained judgment on October 30, 1961. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on September 14, 1962.\nThe zoning by-law was invalid because it lacked the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board before it was passed, but this defect was overcome by an amendment to The Planning Act by 1960 (Ont.), c. 83, s. 5. The defendants\u2019 claim that their rights were preserved by subs. (2) of s. 5 was rejected. The defendants had no acquired rights as defined in subs. (2) and there were no pending proceedings commenced on or before the date specified in that subsection. The main issue in the present appeal was a new submission by the defendants that s. 497 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, gave the city no status to maintain this action and that the action could only be maintained by the Attorney General as plaintiff or as plaintiff on the relation of any interested person. The defendants sought to draw an analogy between the action authorized by s. 497 of the Act and one for the abatement of a public nuisance.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 497 of The Municipal Act should be construed according to its plain terms so as to give the municipality a right of action. The municipality, acting within the limits of its legislative power, had an interest in the specifie performance of its by-laws and was the logical plaintiff to enforce them.\nTownship of Scarborough v.

Brewin, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nM.E. Fram and D.D. MacRae, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellants are under an injunction to refrain from using 1 Chestnut Park Road, Toronto, as offices for doctors and a physiotherapist. The injunction is based upon a continuous violation of the City of Toronto Zoning By-law No. 18642, as amended by By-laws Nos. 18878 and 19093. The injunction was granted on October 30, 1961.\nThe unlawful user began in 1957 after the appellant Paul F. McGoey purchased a large residential building containing about thirty rooms and converted it into offices. The infringement of the by-law is clear and has been persistent, continuous and defiant since 1957. The details are set out in the reasons for judgment of Aylen J.\nEvery possible step seems to have been taken by the appellants to obtain an amendment to the by-law but they have all failed. Finally, on October 24, 1960, the city issued a writ for an injunction and obtained judgment on October 30, 1961. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeal1 on September 14, 1962.\nThe claim for the injunction was based on s. 497 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, which reads:\n497. Where any by-law of a municipality or of a local board thereof, passed under the authority of this or any other general or special Act, is contravened, in addition to any other remedy and to any penalty imposed by the by-law, such contravention may be restrained by action at the instance of a ratepayer or the corporation or local board.\nThe substantial defence at trial and before the Court of Appeal was based upon the effect of the decision of this Court in Township of Scarborough v. Bondi[2], and the validating legislation of 1960. The result of the decision in Township of Scarborough v. Bondi was that the zoning by-law 18642 was invalid because of the lack of the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board before it was passed. To overcome this defect, the Legislature enacted an amendment to The Planning Act by 8-9 Eliz. II (1960), c. 83, s. 5, which reads:\n5. (1) A by-law repealing or amending a by-law passed under section 390 of The Municipal Act or a predecessor of that section is not invalid and shall be deemed never to have been invalid solely because of the lack of approval by the Ontario Municipal Board prior to the passing thereof by the municipal council.\n(2) Subsection 1 does not apply to a by-law that never at any time received approval by the Ontario Municipal Board and does not affect the rights acquired by any person from a judgment or order of any court prior to the day on which this Act comes into force, or affect the outcome of any litigation or proceedings commenced on or before the 23rd day of March, 1960.\nThe appellants claimed that their rights were preserved by subs. (2). This submission was rejected by Aylen J. and the Court of Appeal and at the conclusion of argument of counsel for the appellants, we were all of the opinion that this decision was correct and so notified counsel for the respondent. The appellants had no acquired rights as defined in subs. (2) and there were no pending proceedings commenced on or before March 23, 1960.\nThe main issue in this appeal was a new submission by counsel for the appellants that s. 497 of The Municipal Act gave the city no status to maintain this action and that the action could only be maintained by the Attorney General as plaintiff or as plaintiff on the relation of any interested person. The appellants seek to draw an analogy between the action authorized by s. 497, above quoted, and one for the abatement of a public nuisance. In the case of a public nuisance, the Attorney General may, on the information of a private individual, maintain an action for nuisance. A private individual can only maintain an action for a public nuisance if he can show some particular and special loss over and above the ordinary inconvenience suffered by the public at large. Then the nuisance becomes a private one and he can sue in tort. The reason for the rule is to prevent multiplicity of actions.\nI can see no analogy between the right of action given by s. 497 for the enforcement of a municipal by-law and the enforcement of a remedy for a public nuisance. The principal cases on which the appellants rely are: Wallasey Local Board v. Gracey[3]; Tottenham Urban District Council v. Williamson & Sons, Limited[4]; Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council[5]. These are based on this principle. When public health legislation in the 19th century began to create nuisances by statute, at the same time it gave local authorities the right to cause proceedings to be taken against any person in any superior court of law or equity to enforce the abatement or prohibition of any nuisance under the Act. The Courts held that these were public nuisances and would have to be restrained in the usual way at the suit of the Attorney General.\nThis procedural technicality, for which there was sound reason in the case of a public nuisance, has no application to a proceeding by a municipality to enforce its own by-law. Municipal by-laws usually provide for a penalty for non-observance but the legislature has recognized that unless there is a stronger remedy, a penalty may become a mere licence fee. Something equivalent to s. 497 may be traced back in the legislation to 4 Edw. VII (1904), c. 22, s. 19.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal had held in City of Toronto v. Solway[6] that the infringement of a by-law relating to the location, erection and use of buildings for stables for horses for delivery purposes, could be restrained by injunction. The section itself has been invoked with the city as plaintiff in City of Toronto v. Rudd[7]; City of Toronto v. Hutton[8], and City of Toronto v. Ellis[9]. There is every reason why the section should be so construed according to its plain terms so as to give the municipality a right of action. The municipality, acting within the limits of its legislative power, has an interest in the specific performance of its by-laws and is the logical plaintiff to enforce them.\nThere are no equitable defences available to the appellants in this case. The granting of the injunction should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs. I would allow the appellants three months, and no more, for the purpose of arranging their affairs. They have been acting in defiance of this by-law since 1957.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Cameron, Weldon, Brewin, McCallum & Shells, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: W.R.

Anderson, David Cass-Beggs, Saskatchewan Power Corporation (Defendants) Respondents.\n1964: February 4, 5, 6; 1964: March 12.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nLibel\u2014Express malice\u2014Defence of qualified privilege destroyed\u2014Discretion of trial judge to permit plaintiff to postpone evidence in rebuttal of plea of justification until after defendant has given evidence in support of plea\u2014Cross-examination.\nThe plaintiff had been employed by the defendant power corporation for some eighteen years and had attained the position of a project foreman. The defendant C was the corporation's general manager and the defendant A was powerline construction engineer. The plain- tiff was told to report to the corporation's headquarters and on his arrival there was taken to A's office where, without any previous question or discussion, he was handed a letter of dismissal. The letter, copies of which were sent to four departmental officers, impugned the integrity, honesty and character of the plaintiff. In an action for libel the trial judge gave judgment in favour of the plantiff against A and the corporation for $28,500 and dismissed the action against C without costs. An appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal and the action against all three defendants was dismissed with costs.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The finding of the trial judge that express malice had been proved was supported by the evidence and ought not to have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal. The words of the letter complained of were clearly defamatory of the plaintiff; their falsity was presumed and no evidence was led to rebut that presumption; the defence of qualified privilege ceased to avail the defendants in view of the finding of express malice.\nWhere a plea of justification is raised it is within the discretion of the court to allow the plaintiff either to give all the evidence he intends to offer in rebuttal at the outset, or to postpone giving such evidence and leave it to the defendant to make out his plea, and then give evidence on any matters which are properly admissible to rebut the plea. There is no hard and fast rule, and the practice is based on general convenience. Where the court has ruled that the plaintiff may so reserve his evidence, it rests in the discretion of the court to rule that the right to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses in support of the plea of justification be postponed as was done in the present case, or if counsel for the defendants is allowed in cross-examination to elicit facts in support of the plea of justification the fact of his having done so is not to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the ruling that he may reserve his general evidence in rebuttal of the plea of justification until after the defendants have given their evidence in support of that plea.\nAs to the question of the quantum of damages it could not be said that the amount at which these were assessed by the trial judge was excessive. The sum of $2,212 which had been paid by the defendants to the plaintiff, but not on account of the plaintiff's claim for damages for libel, should not have been deducted from the amount of damages. Accordingly, the amount of the judgment was increased by this amount.\nDickson v. Wilton (Earl) (1859), 1 F. & F. 419; Turner v. M.G.M. Pictures Ltd., [1950] 1 All E.R. 449; Maclaren and Sons v.

Smith (1816), 2 Stark 31, referred to.\nPer Judson J.: The ruling of the trial judge permitting the plaintiff to postpone evidence in rebuttal of the defendants' plea of justification was erroneous. The plaintiff had given evidence\u2014most of it directed to showing malice on the part of the defendants. It was the right of counsel for the defendants to then cross-examine at large and the normal conduct of a trial should not have been interfered with except on very grave grounds that did not exist in this case. Beevis v. Dawson, supra, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of McKercher J. Appeal allowed.\nL. J. Jerome, in person.\nG. J. D, Taylor, Q.C., and C. F. Tallis, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan2 whereby an appeal from a judgment of McKercher J. in an action for damages for libel was allowed and the action as against all three defendants was dismissed with costs. Following a trial without a jury which occupied twelve days, the learned trial judge had given judgment in favour of the appellant against the defendants Anderson and Saskatchewan Power Corporation for $28,500 and had dismissed the action as against the defendant Cass-Beggs without costs.\nIn the month of July 1959 and for some years prior thereto the appellant was employed by the respondent, the Saskatchewan Power Corporation; he had 18 years' seniority in service, some of which had been acquired with another company which was purchased by the defendant corporation. The appellant had attained the position of a project foreman.\nThe respondent corporation was incorporated under The Power Corporation Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 35. The members of the board are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, who also designates the chairman. The corporation now controls all rural electrification in the province of Saskatchewan.\nAt all material times the respondent Cass-Beggs was the general manager and the respondent Anderson was power-line construction engineer of the corporation.\nThe appellant was a project foreman with headquarters in Swift Current, Saskatchewan; he was under the direct supervision of L. A. Dowie, superintendent of light construction; Dowie in turn was under the direct supervision of Anderson. The appellant's duties consisted mainly of the supervision of contractors constructing rural power lines in the southern portion of Saskatchewan and included dealing with difficulties of contractors in respect of clearing right-of-way problems with property owners and tenant farmers along line routes. As of June 1, 1959, the appellant's salary had been raised from $456 to $474 per month.\nOn the afternoon of July 17, 1959, the appellant was working in the Coronach area checking rural power lines. At 1:30 that afternoon he received a note that he was to call Dowie in Regina immediately. He did so and Dowie told him that he was to come to Regina at once, because a Mr. Buehler had written a letter of a very serious nature. The distance the appellant had to travel was 161 miles and it was agreed he should try to be in Regina by 4:30 p.m. On his arrival in Regina Dowie took the appellant to Anderson's office. Without any previous question or discussion, Anderson handed to the appellant a letter of dismissal, dated July 17, 1959, which is the libel complained of. This reads as follows:\nTO: L. J. Jerome, FROM: D. J. Anderson,\nI regret that the Saskatchewan Power Corporation must terminate your employment with the Corporation as of Friday night, July 17, 1959. As you are no doubt aware, your work has not been entirely satisfactory for the last two and a half years. Mr. Dowie has been forced to register several letters and to administer a large number of verbal reprimands for various things ranging from quantity and quality of your work to reporting private long distance telephone charges as being legitimate calls made for Company business, your attitude towards farmers and land owners and your practices in dealing with other Corporation staff. There is also a question of time which was taken off this past winter and spring, supposedly sick leave, which to my mind is at least very questionable although we have an indication from the doctor at Swift Current that some sick leave was required.\nAll these previously mentioned things add up to one thing, mainly that you do not have the type of integrity and character which is required by this Corporation for out of scope staff. In other words, we have arrived at the state where we now do not feel we can trust you.\nThe incident which brought all this to a head was the altercation which you had with Mr. Henry Buehler of Burstall. The type of language which you used to Mr. Buehler and the approach and attitude you made to him clearly show to me that you are no longer fitted for the type of work which you are now doing. If this were the only case, or if there were no other factors, then you would probably be demoted to some other position. However, in view of the factors mentioned previously, I feel that I am entirely justified in the suspension of your services. If you wish to submit your resignation to me in writing this afternoon, it will be accepted. This procedure will probably make it somewhat easier for you to obtain other employment.\nWe are very sorry to have to do this, however, your record over the past two and a half years and this last incident leaves me no choice.\n\"D. J. Anderson\"\nDJA\/pa Power line Construction Engineer\ncc: W. B. Clipsham \u2014 Asst. G. M. i\/c Engineering\nD. G. Brown \u2014 Industrial Relations\nR. J. Waller \u2014 Personnel\nC. E. Smith \u2014 Public and Employee Relations\nThe second paragraph of this letter is set out verbatim in the statement of claim but the whole letter is complained of.\nEvidence was given that the expression \"out of scope staff\" describes persons employed by the respondent corporation, the nature of whose duties and responsibilities is such that they are not eligible for membership in the union of the corporation's employees.\nAfter the appellant had read this letter of dismissal, Anderson handed him a \"Department memo\" from the Honourable Russel Brown, chairman of the respondent corporation, addressed to Mr. Cass-Beggs, the general manager. This is dated July 14, 1959, and is headed \"Re Henry Buehler, P.O. Box 60, Burstall\". It reads as follows:\nSome time ago the above mentioned called on me to discuss what he termed the abusive and disgusting approach of one of our foremen.\nAs the charges were, in my opinion, somewhat serious I asked Mr. Buehler to put his complaint in writing and assured him that on receipt of a letter from him I would have an investigation made.\nI have now received a letter from Mr. Buehler in which in order to set out the facts and indicate the language used by our employee he uses some rather, shall we say, improper expressions. Hardly, I must say, fit for the eyes and ears of our respective secretaries. In any event, I am forwarding the letter to you and would ask that an immediate investigation be made of the charges contained therein. I would appreciate a detailed report at the earliest possible time.\nAttached to this was Buehler's letter. The appellant read the memorandum and part of the Buehler letter; he put them in his pocket and stated he would read them when he had time. Anderson said they were not his letters and requested that they be returned to him and the appellant did this. Buehler's letter does not form part of the record. A conversation followed, Anderson, Dowie and the appellant being present. The appellant testified that he said to Anderson in discussing the memorandum of dismissal: \"Don, what did you\u2014what got into you to fire me like that?\" and that Anderson replied: \"Well, we are using that, Levi, but it's not that\". The making of this answer was neither denied nor explained by Anderson. Dowie was not called as a witness.\nIt will be observed that Mr. Brown's memorandum requested an immediate investigation and a detailed report. Anderson said that he received Mr. Brown's letter on either the afternoon of July 16 or the morning of July 17. Asked whether he conducted any investigation, Anderson's reply was: \"I discussed the matter with Mr. Dowie and this was all the investigation I conducted\". Asked whether Dowie had urged him to fire Jerome, Anderson replied that he had not. Asked whether he had ever reprimanded Jerome, his answer was \"No\".\nAnderson stated that after he had discharged Jerome and circulated the letter of dismissal, an investigation of Buehler's complaint was carried out by Mr. L. J. Bright. Mr. Bright's report was filed as an exhibit. It is dated August 5, 1959, addressed from \"L. J. Bright, Field Relations\" to \"C. E. Smith, Public and Employee Relations\". It contains a lengthy and detailed report of the investigation. The gist of it is that in the matter out of which his complaint arose Buehler had been unco-operative throughout and that Jerome had done all that could be expected of anyone. The only passage in any way derogatory of Jerome is the following:\nI have already given you my impression of Mr. Jerome which from a public relations viewpoint and trouble prevention viewpoint was second to none in the Province; but, while I am sure that the vulgar language is greatly exaggerated, I do not condone it. However, in other cases which I have investigated, I have always taken into consideration education, occupation, characteristic adjectives, general attitude, and the amount of provocation. On this basis, I have exonerated men who habitually use far worse language than that quoted.\nThe report contains such statements as the following:\nMy only criticism having looked at the line would be that Mr. Jerome went to too much trouble to please a man who was non co-operative, obviously is generally disliked, and who wrote the defamatory and slanderous letter as a thank you note. He (a District Operator) said that Mr. Jerome was the best Foreman he had ever worked with that he was always pleased to see him come and that when Mr. Jerome checked the line he carried his hooks and shovel and used both of them. He said when I heard a good man like Mr. Jerome was fired, I could not sleep at night.\n* * *\nIn reply to questions, Mr. Everest (a District Superintendent) stated that he had always found Mr. Jerome's public relations more than good. He further stated that Mr. Jerome was very conscientious in checking lines. He said he climbed poles to check tie-ins and walked out into fields to check poles otherwise not in view. He said that when he heard that Mr. Jerome was let out, he just didn't believe it.\n* * *\nHe (Jerome) sure goes through a lot of trouble to avoid trouble.\nOf course, this document is not evidence of the truth of the facts stated in it. Its significance is in the effect, or lack of effect, it had upon the defendants' attitude towards the appellant.\nThe appellant refused to resign, consistently maintained that the charges contained in the memorandum of dismissal were false and sought reinstatement in the position from which he had been discharged. After lengthy negotiations, the appellant was offered re-employment in an inferior position at reduced pay; the offer was couched in terms which implied that the charges were persisted in. It is not surprising that the appellant refused the offer. On the assumption that the charges were false, as they must now be taken to be, a self-respecting man could hardly have done otherwise. On February 29, 1960, this action was commenced.\nThe amended statement of claim alleged that Anderson, with the approval and authority of Cass-Beggs, had falsely and maliciously written the letter of July 17, 1959, that he had published it to W. B. Clipsham, D. G. Brown, R. J. Waller and C. E. Smith, and that both Anderson and Cass-Beggs were acting within the scope of their employment with the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. General damages of $100,000 were claimed.\nThe defendants filed a single statement of defence, pleading (i) qualified privilege, (ii) justification, (iii) that Cass-Beggs had assented to the dismissal of the plaintiff but not to the contents of the letter of July 17, 1959, and (iv) that the plaintiff's claim had been settled.\nThe statement of defence also recited an interlocutory order made in the action by Graham J. holding that the action was one for libel only and not an action for libel and in addition for damages for wrongful dismissal and stated that the statement of defence was pleaded on the basis of that order.\nThe ground on which the defendants asserted that the letter of July 17, 1959, was published on an occasion of qualified privilege is set out in particulars delivered by them as follows:\nThe memorandum was sent to the Plaintiff and also to Mr. W. B. Clipsham, Assistant General Manager in charge of Engineering, Mr. D. G. Brown, Industrial Relations Director, Mr. R. J. Waller, Personnel Director and Mr. C. E. Smith, Public and Employee Relations Director, all being persons employed by the Defendant Corporation in capacities which invested them with a right to receive the information in question, and to whom the Defendant Anderson had an obligation of communicating the said information.\nThe defendants delivered particulars of their plea of justification consisting of a little over eight pages of approximately 50 lines each. For reasons that will appear I do not find it necessary to refer to these in detail.\nNo evidence was led to support the plea of justification. This defence and that of settlement were rightly rejected by both Courts below and nothing more need be said about them except as to the conduct of the trial in regard to the plea of justification.\nThe learned trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege was not established. He reached this conclusion on several grounds. On the view that the occasion giving rise to the suggested duty to publish was the request for an investigation and report made by Mr. Russell Brown, he held there was no duty to publish to any of the four persons named in the statement of claim. On the view that the occasion was the dismissal of the plaintiff by Anderson he held that there was no duty to publish to R. J. Waller or D. G. Brown. The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, were of opinion that the occasion was the dismissal of the plaintiff and that the privilege was not exceeded by publication to the four persons named.\nI do not find it necessary to choose between these conflicting views as I am satisfied that the finding of the learned trial judge that express malice had been proved was supported by the evidence and ought not to have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal. On the assumption that the defamatory statement was published on an occasion of qualified privilege the onus of proving the existence of malice rested upon the plaintiff. Malice, in this connection, does not necessarily mean personal spite or ill-will; it may consist in some indirect motive not connected with the privilege or, as it was put by Lord Campbell in Dickson v. Wilton (Earl)3 at p. 427:\nBut by that term is meant, not only spite, for any indirect motive, other than a sense of duty, is what the law calls \"malice\".\nThe decision whether or not malice has been established involves an inquiry into the state of mind of the defendant at the time when the libel was published. The difficulty of proving the state of a man's mind at a particular time was commented on by Bowen L.J. in his famous dictum in Edgington v. Fitzmaurice4 at p. 483; but as was said by Lord Wright in Clayton v. Ramsden5 at p. 331: \"States of mind are capable of proof like other matters of fact\".\nQuestions of fact arising in civil cases are decided on the balance of probabilities. In Turner v. M.G.M. Pictures Ltd.6, an action for libel in which it was conceded that the publication was made on a privileged occasion, Lord Oaksey, at p. 470, stated the question as follows:\nDid the appellant prove that it was more probable than not that the respondents were actuated by malice?\nIn the same case at pp. 454 and 455 Lord Porter said:\nIt is common ground, as I have indicated, that qualified privilege is rightly claimed by the respondents, but it is said that any reliance on it is ruled out by the existence of express malice on their part. Where such an allegation is made it is the duty of the plaintiff to establish the existence of malice and, unless he does so, the defendant succeeds. If, however, the plaintiff can show any example of spite or indirect motive, whether before or after the publication, he would establish his case provided that the examples given are so connected with the state of mind of the defendant as to lead to the conclusion that he was malicious at the date when the libel was published. No doubt, the evidence must be more consistent with malice than with an honest mind, but this does not mean that all the evidence adduced of malice towards the plaintiff on the part of the defendant must be set against such evidence of a favourable attitude towards him as has been given and the question left to, or withdrawn from, the jury by ascertaining which way the scale is tipped when they are weighed in the balance one against the other. On the contrary, each piece of evidence must be regarded separately, and, even if there are a number of instances where a favourable attitude is shown, one case tending to establish malice would be sufficient evidence on which a jury could find for the plaintiff. Nevertheless, each particular instance of alleged malice must be carefully analysed, and if the result is to leave the mind in doubt, then that piece of evidence is valueless as an instance of malice whether it stands alone or is combined with a number of similar instances.\nI do not take the last sentence in this passage to mean that a number of items of evidence, each in itself insufficient to satisfy the tribunal of the existence of the fact sought to be proved, may not in combination be sufficient to attain that result.\nI accept as accurate the statement in Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th ed., at p. 435:\nThe effect of a body of circumstantial evidence is sometimes compared to that of a chain, but the metaphor is inaccurate, since the weakest part of the chain is also its strongest. Such evidence is more aptly to be compared to a rope made up of many strands twisted together. The rope has strength more than, sufficient to bear the stress laid upon it, though no one of the filaments of which it is composed would be sufficient for the purpose.\nI do not find it necessary to go through all the grounds on which the learned trial judge found that express malice existed. He said in the course of his reasons while speaking of the letter of July 17, 1959, which was exhibit P. 14:\nI find that such charges were made by Anderson recklessly and not in honest belief on the part of Anderson that all the allegations in P. 14 were true; and I further find that Anderson knew or should have known that the allegations were untrue.\nIn my opinion the learned trial judge was justified in making this finding on the statement made by Anderson, quoted earlier in these reasons, \"Well we are using that, Levi, but it's not that.\" The fact that Anderson used these words is accepted by the Court of Appeal. It seems obvious that if Anderson had not used them he would have denied having done so and that Dowie, who was present, would have been called as a witness to support his denial. The making of the statement must be considered in the light of the other relevant evidence. Anderson's conduct, (i) in writing P. 14, within a matter of hours after receiving a request for an investigation and detailed report of the Buehler incident and without having made any investigation worthy of the name, (ii) calling the plaintiff in from a distance of 160 miles and then giving him no opportunity to say a word of explanation or defence before publishing the libel, and (iii) failing to modify his stand when Bright's report was received, appears to me to be more consistent with the existence than with the absence of malice. I would, however, be prepared to support the finding of the learned trial judge as to the existence of malice on Anderson's undenied and unexplained statement. If there was any explanation of what he meant by the words quoted which was consistent with the absence of malice and of indirect motive surely it would have been brought out by counsel for the defendants.\nThe view taken by the Court of Appeal on this branch of the matter appears sufficiently in the following paragraph of their reasons:\nThe whole of the occurrence does give rise to some questioning in one's mind, but this question or suspicion does not supplant the evidence, substantially not contradicted, nor reasonably incapable of belief, that Anderson acted in good faith, on grounds which he believed to be adequate and true. A suspicion engendered by what was said and done, that some reason or reasons other than those given, actuated the defendant Anderson, unsupported, by evidence and thus remaining, at best, a suspicion, cannot be taken, as I have just said, to support a valid inference or conclusion of the existence of some improper motive or purpose. Accepting Anderson's evidence that he believed just cause existed to discharge the plaintiff, and that an employer need not give all or any reasons for discharging an employee, I cannot infer that Anderson wrote and published the letter intending to harm the plaintiff thereby, or for any other improper reason, or any reason other than to effectuate the discharge and give reasons therefor.\nWith respect, this passage appears to me to give insufficient weight to the finding of the learned trial judge expressed as follows:\nI find\u2014and I regret to have to do this\u2014I find that from his, Mr. Anderson's demeanour in the witness box and his attitude there that Mr. Anderson is not a credible witness.\nIt is only in exceptional circumstances that an appellate court is justified in accepting and acting upon the evidence of a witness whom the trial judge has expressly disbelieved. I can find no such circumstances in this case.\nIt follows from what I have said above that the appeal must succeed. The words of the letter complained of are clearly defamatory of the plaintiff; their falsity is presumed and no evidence was led to rebut that presumption; the defence of qualified privilege ceases to avail the defendants in view of the finding of express malice. Before proceeding to the question of damages it is necessary to examine the contention of the respondents that if the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not affirmed a new trial should be ordered by reason of matters occurring in the course of the trial.\nIn this regard the respondents complain, (i) that the learned trial judge limited and interfered with the cross-examination of the plaintiff, (ii) that the plaintiff was permitted to adduce hearsay and irrelevant evidence, and (iii) that the plaintiff was permitted to split his case.\nThe first witness called by the plaintiff at the trial was D. G. Brown. He was neither examined nor cross-examined in regard to the matters alleged in the defendants' particulars of justification. Before calling the plaintiff, who was the next witness, his counsel, Mr. Wellman, told the Court that he proposed to postpone giving evidence to rebut the defendants' plea of justification until after the defendants had given their evidence in support of that plea. This course was objected to by counsel for the defendants. After a somewhat lengthy discussion the learned trial judge ruled that the course proposed by counsel for the plaintiff should be followed and that while counsel for the defendants would be at liberty to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses on matters going to credit he would not be permitted to elicit evidence in support of the plea of justification under the guise of attacking credit.\nI think it clear that it was in the discretion of the learned trial judge to make this ruling, although, as was pointed out by Cave J. in Maclaren and Sons v. Davis et al.7, the exercise of that discretion may, in a proper case, be reviewed in an appellate court.\nThe judgment of Abbott Ld. C.J. in Browne v. Murray8, which was a ruling made during the course of the trial, appears to indicate the view that the plaintiff in a libel action has a right to choose which course he will take. The judgment reads as follows:\nIn actions of this nature, the plaintiff may, if he thinks fit, content himself with proof of the libel, and leave it to the defendant to make out his justification, and then the plaintiff may, in reply, rebut the evidence produced by the defendant. But if the plaintiff in the outset, thinks fit to call any evidence to repel the justification, then, I am of opinion, that he should go through all the evidence he proposes to give for that purpose, and he shall not be permitted to give further evidence in reply. It is much more convenient for the due administration of justice that this course should be adopted, otherwise there will be no end to evidence on either side, as the defendant would be entitled again to call witnesses to answer those last produced by the plaintiff to rebut the justification.\nIn Maclaren and Sons v. Davis, supra, the libel complained of described the plaintiffs as \"unmitigated literary-thieves\" and accused them of stealing articles from the defendants' paper and misleading advertisers into thinking that the plaintiffs' paper was that of the defendants. Cave J. said at p. 373:\nThe plaintiff might wait till the evidence of the defendant was given, and then the Judge should allow the plaintiff to give evidence in reply. Here there were two charges in the libel, one that the plaintiffs had stolen Davis's articles; secondly, that he had stolen Lowe's advertisements. The words were that he was \"an unmitigated literary thief.\" Upon the question whether the plaintiff had stolen Davis's articles, the evidence of his securing advertisements, which should properly have gone to Lowe's paper, would have been irrelevant. It would have been most inconvenient for the plaintiff to have gone through all the articles and then have attempted to prove that they were not taken from the defendant's paper. It was obviously more convenient for the plaintiff to wait till he found what articles or what advertisements were dealt with by the defendants. That was shown in this case, as the defendants were not able to give proof of any advertisers having been misled. A great deal of time would have been wasted if the plaintiff had gone through all the advertisements. It was never convenient to prove a negative. When the defendant had set up something affirmative then was the time to dispose of it. The learned Baron had exercised an erroneous discretion in refusing to allow the rebutting evidence.\nThe report states that A. L. Smith and Vaughan Williams JJ. \"concurred in saying there must be a new trial\". It may be taken that they did not disagree with the reasons given by Cave J.\nThe proper practice in such circumstances is discussed in the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal in Beevis v. Dawson9. In that case counsel for the plaintiff did not call upon the trial judge to rule as to the course which he proposed to follow. At p. 213, Singleton L.J. said:\nThe judge ought to have been asked to decide early on the mode or manner in which the case should be heard. If he had decided what, in his view, was most convenient, counsel should have followed that.\nIn the case at bar the request for a ruling and the ruling of the judge were made sufficiently early in the trial. At p. 203, Singleton L.J. said:\nIt is claimed on behalf of the plaintiff that, there being a plea of justification in the defence, the plaintiff was entitled to reserve his evidence upon that part of the case until later, and then to give evidence in rebuttal. That submission is based on statements of practice in several textbooks. I refer to one only Gatley on Libel and Slander, 4th ed., at p. 582: \"Where there is a plea of justification on the record it is usual, and more convenient, for the plaintiff not to call any evidence in rebuttal as part of his own case, but to leave it to the defendant to make out his plea. The plaintiff may, however, anticipate, if he thinks fit, and give all the evidence he intends to offer in rebuttal at the outset. But he is not entitled to call some evidence in rebuttal in the first instance, and to reserve the remainder for reply to the defendant's case.\"\nSingleton L.J. then quotes the whole of the judgment of Abbott Ld. C.J. in Browne v. Murray, supra, and considers the case of Rees v. Smith and Others10, an action for trespass, in the course of which, at pp. 32 and 33 of the report, Lord Ellenborough said:\nAs a general rule, I beg that it may be understood that a case is not to be cut into parts, but that when it is known what the question in issue is, it must be met at once. If, indeed, any one fact may be adduced by the defendant to which an answer can be given, the plaintiff must have an opportunity given for so doing; but this must be understood of a specific fact, he cannot go into general evidence in reply to the defendant's case. There is no instance in which the plaintiff is entitled to go into half his case and reserve the remainder.\nHaving referred to these two cases, Singleton L.J. continued at pp. 204 and 205:\nI venture to doubt whether there is a hard and fast rule either way. The authorities seem to me to show that the practice is based on general convenience. It must depend, of course, upon the issues which are raised; obviously it must depend upon the pleadings in the case in which the issues are set out. If publication is admitted and justification is set up as a defence, the plaintiff is entitled to say that the onus is upon the defendant; that it is for him to prove his case. Equally if, by the answer to an interrogatory, the plaintiff can prove his case, and does so, the onus on the issue of justification is upon the defendant. In most cases there are other pleas, and the question arises as to what is the most convenient way of dealing with the matter in the interests of justice, in the interests of parties, and from the point of view of the court. Those interests are really all the same. If, after hearing submissions, the judge decides that one course is preferable to another, his decision should in general be treated as final. He will not deprive the plaintiff of the opportunity of reserving his evidence until he has heard the evidence of the defendant in support of the plea of justification, if he considers that any injustice can be done to the plaintiff by such a ruling. If the judge considers that the better course is that the plaintiff should be allowed to reserve his answer to the plea of justification until after the defendant's evidence in support of the plea has been given, the defendant's counsel cannot offset that by asking questions on that issue to draw the plaintiff's witnesses, as Mr. Platts-Mills suggests. It is not for the defendant to decide how the trial shall be conducted.\nThe judgment of Jenkins L.J. is to the same effect. He says at p. 215:\nFor my part, I do not think the principle which is stated in the case of Browne v. Murray, to which my Lord has referred, really amounts to a rule of law, or a right to which the plaintiff may invariably lay claim as a matter of law. The first sentence of Abbott C.J.'s judgment, if I may read it again, is this: \"In actions of this nature, the plaintiff may, if he thinks fit, content himself with proof of the libel, and leave it to the defendant to make out his justification; and then the plaintiff may, in reply, rebut the evidence produced by the defendant.\" Then the Lord Chief Justice went on to say that the plaintiff should not sever his evidence on the issue of justification, leading some of the evidence in presenting his own case and some of it in rebuttal of the defendant's case. I think that the principle there stated may well reflect a practice which in appropriate circumstances it is right to follow, but is subject to the over-riding discretion of the court to give such directions as to the order in which the onus of proof is to be dealt with and in which witnesses are to be called as the court may find just and convenient in the circumstances of the particular case.\nand at p. 216:\nThe rule of practice, as the learned Baron called it, may be the best to follow in some cases, whereas in other cases it could not but be productive of inconvenience. It seems to me that the decision must rest in the discretion of the court.\nIn the fifth edition of Gatley the passage corresponding to that quoted by Singleton L.J. is to be found at pp. 561 and 562 and reads:\nWhere there is a plea of justification on the record, it is within the discretion of the court to allow the plaintiff either to give all the evidence he intends to offer in rebuttal at the outset, or to postpone giving such evidence and leave it to the defendant to make out his plea, and then give evidence on any matters which are properly admissible to rebut the plea. There is no hard and fast rule, and the practice is based on general convenience. If the judge does consider that the plaintiff should be allowed to reserve his answer to the plea of justification, the defendant's counsel cannot offset that by asking questions on that issue in order to draw the plaintiff's witness. In any event, the plaintiff is not entitled to call some evidence in rebuttal in the first instance, and reserve the remainder for reply to the defendant's case.\nThis passage appears to me to be an accurate summary of the effect of the judgments in Beevis v. Dawson.\nThe earlier cases do not discuss the effect which the making of a ruling that the plaintiff may postpone giving evidence in rebuttal of a plea of justification has upon the right of defendant's counsel to cross-examine witnesses called by the plaintiff to prove other matters, such as e.g. publication; and there is no lengthy discussion of this question, in the-judgments delivered in Beevis v. Dawson. The following sentence from the judgment of Singleton L.J., at p. 205, has already been quoted:\nIf the judge considers that the better course is that the plaintiff should be allowed to reserve his answer to the plea of justification until after the defendant's evidence in support of the plea has been given, the defendant's counsel cannot offset that by asking questions on that issue to draw the plaintiff's witnesses, as Mr. Platts-Mills suggests. It is not for the defendant to decide how the trial shall be conducted.\nThis appears to have reference to passages in the argument of Mr. Platts-Mills which are reported as follows at p. 198:\nThe witnesses called, by the plaintiff at the outset were known as close associates of his and some of those witnesses in their cross-examination had revealed a good deal of the matter relied on in justification, which may have affected the jury in coming to their verdict.\nand at p. 199:.\nWhere the plaintiff's case is made suspect by his own witnesses he may not exercise an option to call rebutting evidence. The answers given by the plaintiff's witnesses in cross-examination, although they are called only on the issue of publication, may alter the right of the plaintiff as to the order in which he deals with the issue of justification. It is not open to the judge to rule that counsel for the defence cannot cross-examine as to the issue of justification plaintiff's witnesses called on the issue of publication. If the judge has already given a ruling as to procedure, the position will be quite different, but here the judge had given no ruling. The evidence can change, the onus of proof. The moment there is evidence given by the plaintiff's witnesses tending to prove justification, they must be treated as rebutting witnesses, and the plaintiff no longer has a right to reserve further evidence in rebuttal until after the defendant's case is closed.\nAt this point in the argument Singleton L.J. interjected:\nI think it was a matter of discretion for the judge, as a question of general convenience.\nThese passages appear to me to be susceptible of either or both of the following interpretations in cases in which the trial judge has ruled that the plaintiff may reserve his evidence in rebuttal of the plea of justification; (i) that the trial judge may rule that the right to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses in support of the plea of justification be postponed as was done in the case at bar, and (ii) that if counsel for the defendants is allowed in cross-examination to elicit facts in support of the plea of justification the fact of his having done so shall not deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of the ruling that he may reserve his general evidence in rebuttal of the plea of justification until after the defendants have given their evidence in support of that plea.\nIn my opinion it rests in the discretion of the trial judge to follow either of these courses and the manner in which that discretion should be exercised will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. There may well be cases in which it will prove more convenient, while preserving the plaintiff's right to reserve his rebuttal, to permit counsel for the defendant to cross-examine the plaintiff at large when he is first called; I do not think any hard and fast rule can be laid down.\nI have already indicated my view that in the case at bar, it was within the discretion of the learned trial judge to make the ruling which he did make. I do not think it can be said that he exercised that discretion wrongly. In view of the nature of the particulars of the plea of justification delivered in this action it would, I think, have been highly inconvenient to call upon the plaintiff to prove the negative of that issue before having heard the evidence offered by the defendants in support of it.\nIt may well be, as counsel for the respondents contends, that from time to time during the putting in of the plaintiff's case his cross-examination was unduly limited even on the basis of the ruling which had been made; but it was made clear that the right of the defendants' counsel to cross-examine at large was not denied but was merely postponed. Had he wished to do so he could, after leading his evidence in support of the plea of justification, have asked that the plaintiff be recalled for cross-examination in regard to the matters raised by that plea. He did not do this; and when the plaintiff was recalled towards the end of the trial he did not cross-examine him. He had decided to pursue a different course.\nBefore calling the first witness for the defendants their counsel made the following statement:\nYour Lordship will recall that on Thursday morning last, October 26th, Your Lordship ruled that the defendants were not, at the then stage of this trial, to be allowed to cross-examine the plaintiff in respect to paragraph 6 of the statement of defence and the whole of the particulars furnished with respect thereto, either to support the defendants' plea of justification or for the purpose of bringing into question the credibility of the plaintiff in respect of the testimony which he had already given in support of his claim. In the exercise of my best judgment on behalf of all the defendants, I wish to advise Your Lordship most respectfully that the defendants do not propose to adduce any evidence in proof of the plea of justification contained in paragraph 6 of the defendants' statement of defence or in respect of the particulars furnished pursuant thereto. I do this, My Lord, because it is my most respectful submission that Your Lordship's ruling is wrong in law and has made it impossible for the defendants to adequately present their defence based on paragraph 6 of the statement of defence and the particulars delivered in respect thereof, and for the further reason that the defendants do not wish, by leading evidence on paragraph 6 of the statement of defence and the particulars furnished with respect thereto, to be taken to have waived any rights whatsoever which the defendants may have with respect to an appeal from Your Lordship's ruling.\nTo order a new trial because the defence decided to adopt this course would be to disregard the statement of Singleton L.J., with which I have already indicated my agreement, that \"it is not for the defendant to decide how the trial shall be conducted.\"\nAn examination of the lengthy record satisfies me that none of the matters of which the respondents complain in respect of the conduct of the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. To order a new trial in the circumstances of this case would, in my opinion, be a denial of justice to the plaintiff.\nThere remains the question of the quantum of damages. I am quite unable to say that the amount at which these were assessed by the learned trial judge was excessive. Without justification and without being heard in his own defence, the plaintiff, who had spent the greater part of his working life in the service of the respondent company and that of another company which it had acquired, was defamed as incompetent and untrustworthy and these charges were persisted in up to and during the trial. That the defendants were aware of the effect that these imputations would have on the plaintiff's chance of obtaining future employment is plain from the penultimate paragraph of the libel:\nIf you wish to submit your resignation to me in writing this afternoon, it will be accepted. This procedure will probably make it somewhat easier for you to obtain other employment. In arriving at the final figure for which judgment should be entered the learned trial judge deducted from the amount at which he decided the damages should be assessed the sum of $2,212 which had been paid by the defendants to the plaintiff. With respect I think this amount should not have been deducted. It was not paid on account of the plaintiff's claim for damages for libel, but either ex gratia or on account of his claim for damages for wrongful dismissal which, under the order of Graham J. and by the reasons of the learned trial judge, was excluded as a head of damage in this action. It is therefore my opinion that the amount of the judgment should be increased by this sum of $2,212.\nIt remains only to consider what order should be made as to the costs of the defendant Cass-Beggs. In my opinion, the learned trial judge did not err in deciding not to award costs to this defendant.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, direct that the judgment at the trial be varied to provide that the plaintiff do recover from the defendants Donald J. Anderson and the Saskatchewan Power Corporation the sum of $30,712 and that, subject to this variation, the judgment at the trial be restored. The appellant will recover his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court from the defendants Donald J. Anderson and Saskatchewan Power Corporation. The action as against the defendant Cass-Beggs stands dismissed without costs and there will be no order as to his costs in the Court of Appeal or in this Court.\nJudson J. (dissenting in part):\u2014I think that the ruling of the learned trial judge in this case was erroneous and that it should not receive any approval in this Court based on what was said in Beevis v. Dawson11. Beevis v. Dawson was a case where the plaintiff did not give evidence himself. His counsel stated that he would call the plaintiff to give evidence in rebuttal after the defendant's evidence of justification had been heard. If a plaintiff wishes to conduct his case in this way, with its incidental risks, there is nothing to prevent him. No rule requires that he go into the witness box initially. But the present case is different. This plaintiff did give evidence\u2014a lot of evidence\u2014most of it directed to showing malice on the part of the defendants. Counsel for the defendants then proposed to cross-examine at large. This was his right and the normal conduct of a trial should not have been interfered with except on very grave grounds that do not exist in this case.\nThe defendants had delivered particulars which covered nine pages in the record. These are mostly concerned with alleged fraudulent expense accounts filed by the plaintiff. I. refer to only one of them\u2014car expense account for 1958, for which the plaintiff claimed 34,858 miles, which, according to the speedometer reading, was the total mileage of the car, less three miles. Surely counsel for the defendants was entitled to cross-examine on this and similar matters when the witness was in the box, having given evidence of malice. After cross-examination on these matters it might well have been that the judge would have had a very different impression of the case and particularly of the reason given for the dismissal and testified to by Jerome.\nIt is also possible that the defendants could have gone a long way towards proving justification and absence of malice by cross-examination when the plaintiff was in the box initially. I see no reason why they should have to postpone the exercise of this right until they had put in their defence. If this had been a jury trial they had the right to make out their whole defence from the plaintiff when he was in the witness box. There is no doubt left by Singleton L.J. in Beevis v. Dawson on what he thought was the better course to follow. At p. 205 he said:\nIn these days particulars of justification have to be given, and the defendant is bound by them and cannot go beyond them. So that the plaintiff knows, before the hearing commences, what charges he has to meet, Thus there can be no element of surprise in the case before us. There were given abundant particulars of justification. One might have thought that a plaintiff seeking damages for libel would have been only too anxious to answer those charges. The plaintiff was not. He might have followed that which I regard as the usual practice, and have gone into the witness box; but he did not do so. His counsel said often that he proposed to do so later. The judge told him of the position, though he did not rule either way. As to general convenience, it cannot be doubted that it would have been better had the plaintiff been called and examined and cross-examined on the particulars of justification. That which happened in the present case gives as good an instance of inconvenience as could be found. Had this been a jury trial, I would have been prepared to hold that the error was so serious that it warranted the ordering of a new trial. However, there was no jury in this case. At some inconvenience the defence could have given evidence on the defence of justification and insisted on the plaintiff being called back for cross-examination. Instead of taking this course, counsel for the defence said that he would not call any evidence on the plea of justification in view of the serious error that he said existed in the judge's ruling. He took this course deliberately. He went on with the trial and there have been two appeals. In the circumstances, I do not think that a new trial should be ordered, but I wish to emphasize that in my opinion, there can be very few cases where a judge, in circumstances such as existed in this case, would be justified in ruling as the trial judge did here.\nI agree that the appeal be disposed of according to the reasons of Cartwright J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Goldenberg, Taylor & Tallis, Saskatoon.\n1 (1963), 42 W.W.R. 641, 39 D.L.R.

The residue of the estate was to go to a nephew of the testatrix or alternatively to his wife and family in the event that he predeceased the survivor of the testatrix and her husband. As a result of the sale of the testatrix\u2019s interest in the company following her death, the residue of the estate was currently producing an income of more than $16,000 per annum or approximately $4,000 more than the amount of the annuity to the husband. On an application to construe the will, the trial judge held that there was no intestacy as to the surplus income and that it should continue to be accumulated until the death or remarriage of the husband or until the expiration of 21 years from the death of the testatrix. This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs found by the trial judge, there was a clear expression of intention on the part of the testatrix that the husband was to have nothing from the estate except enough to make up $12,000 per year if the salary from the company fell short of that sum and that income not required for this purpose became part of the residue of the estate then remaining and was to go to the nephew and his family. In addition, the principle, that the accumulated surplus income should be held to follow the principal as an accessory, was applicable in this case. Re Hammond, [1935] S.C.R. 550, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. Appeal dismissed.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for the appellant.\nD.J. Wright, for the respondents.\nG.C. Hollyer, for the executors and trustees.\nS.M. McBride, for the Official Guardian.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant John Hewitt Watson is the husband of the testatrix, Leona Watson, who died in 1959. He was left an annuity of $12,000 and the question in this appeal is what is to happen to surplus income in the residue. Both the judgments of McRuer C.J.H.C. and the Court of Appeal1 have held that there was no intestacy as to the surplus income and that it should be added to the residue. The appellant husband contends that there is an intestacy and that he is entitled to his share over and above the annual sum that is given to him by the will.\nThe residuary clauses with which we are concerned are:\n(f) To keep invested the residue of my Estate and to pay my husband during his life or until his remarriage a sum which with the salary he may then be receiving from the Canada Law Book Company Limited, if any, will aggregate $1,000 per month, and if the income shall be at any time insufficient to provide the amount so as to make up the said aggregate sum, then the deficiency shall be made up from the capital of my estate and so often as such shall be necessary. Provided always if the above provision which I have made to my husband should in any year or years be impossible to comply with due to the lack of capital funds available therefor, or occasion any difficulties in the administration of my estate, all as may be determined by my Executors in their sole and unfettered discretion and judgment, then to the extent of the moneys above directed to be paid out of the capital of my estate, shall abate by such amount as my Executors in their sole discretion and judgment may determine and so often as same may happen.\n(g) Upon the death of the survivor of me and my said husband or his remarriage after my death, to hold the residue of my estate then remaining in trust to pay and transfer the same to my nephew Kenneth John Conant of Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.A., provided however, if he shall predecease the survivor of my husband and myself then the residue of my estate shall be divided between his widow and children in equal shares per capita. Provided further that my Trustees in their absolute discretion may carry on the business of the said Canada Law Book Company Limited for a period of not more than three (3) years after the death of the survivor of me and my said husband, within which time I express the hope that they shall have been able to dispose of the common shares belonging to my estate.\nThe testatrix was the owner of the majority of the shares of the Canada Law Book Company and as a result of the sale of these shares and a parcel of real estate held in connection with the business of the company, the residue is currently producing an income of more than $16,000 per annum or approximately $4,000 more than the amount of the annuity to the husband.\nBoth the Chief Justice and the Court of Appeal have held that the surplus income should continue to be accumulated until the death or remarriage of the husband of the testatrix or until the expiration of twenty-one years from the death of the testatrix. The husband\u2019s annuity is being paid out of income. He is not receiving any salary from the Canada Law Book Company and, as far as the material shows, never received any such salary since the death of the testatrix.\nThe judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. found on the part of the testatrix a clear expression of intention that the husband was to have nothing from the estate except enough to make up $12,000 per year if the salary from Canada Law Book Company fell short of that sum and that income not required for this purpose became part of the \u201cresidue of my estate then remaining\u201d under clause (g) of the will above quoted and was to go to Kenneth Conant or his family.\nThe appellant submits that clause (f) first directs the executors to keep invested \u201cthe residue of my estate\u201d, and that this phrase means the whole of the assets as they existed at the time of the death less legacies, debts and succession duties, and that the annuity of the husband is charged on the capital and income of this residue. So far I agree. He then goes on to say that \u201cthe residue of my estate then remaining\u201d in clause (g) cannot include surplus income because residue must be given the same meaning in clauses (f) and (g). According to him, then, \u201cresidue of my estate then remaining\u201d means capital as it stood at the date of the death less the above-mentioned deductions and less encroachments on capital which may have been made to make up the annuity but does not include surplus income. This mathematical interpretation of the will ignores the force of the inference drawn by McRuer C.J.H.C. that the intention of the testatrix was to augment from the estate an outside source of income up to a maximum of $12,000 per year from both sources and no more. I would affirm the judgment in favour of the residuary interests and their right to the surplus income on the construction put upon the will by McRuer C.J.H.C.\nThe Court of Appeal found in this will an implied power and trust to accumulate surplus income. I have some hesitation about a disposition of the case on this ground. The annuitant has no right to compel the accumulation of surplus income to meet possible future deficiencies. His right is to have his annuity fully secured (Re Cotter\u2019s Deed Trusts, Coller v. Coller[2]). Further, a corresponding conclusion that the remainder interests had a right to have surplus income accumulated to safeguard them against a possible need to resort to capital assumes in their favour the very question in dispute\u2014whether they have any interest in surplus income. I prefer to rest my decision on the ground of interpretation and the second ground stated by the Court of Appeal, namely, that the case is governed by Re Hammond[3].\nRe Hammond decided that surplus income in the one half of the residuary estate which was under consideration had accumulated for a period of 21 years for the benefit of those who had vested defeasible interests in the residue. In spite of the absence of a direction to accumulate, the Court made this finding as a clear implication to be gathered from the entire will and, in addition, approved of the judgment of Middleton J.A. in the Court of Appeal[4] that the accumulated surplus income should be held to follow the principal as an accessory. Middleton J.A. had founded his judgment on Wharton v. Masterman[5] and the dictum of Westbury L.C. in Countess of Bective v. Hodgson[6]. To me the present case is governed by Re Hammond and I agree with the Court of Appeal in so finding. Counsel for the annuitant urged us to accept the principle that only a contingent residuary bequest can carry the intermediate income and cited in support of his argument Berry v. Geen[7]; Re Oliver, Watkins v. Fitton[8]; Re Gillett\u2019s Will Trusts, Barclays Bank Ld. et al. v. Gillett[9]; Re Wragg, Hollingsworth et al. v. Wragg et al.[10] This seems to have been the opinion expressed in all editions of Theobald on Wills from the 8th ed. (1927) to the present date. On the other hand, Jarman on Wills, 6th ed. (1910) p. 1046, held the opinion that the principle applied both to deferred and contingent residuary bequests. This was repeated in the 7th ed. (1930) p. 1006, and was abandoned in the 8th ed. (1951) p. 1021, doubtless as a result of the cases then recently decided. I am not sure that I understand even now the logical basis for the distinction between contingent residuary bequests and future vested interests whether indefeasible or defeasible when surplus intermediate income is involved but I am certain that in 1935 the matter was settled as far as this Court is concerned in Re Hammond.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs of all parties payable out of the estate, those of the executor as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, Sheard, Johnston & Heighington, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\nThe Official Guardian, Toronto.\nSolicitors for Crown Trust Co. and O.N.

The grandson who was domiciled in the State of Michoacan in the Republic of Mexico died intestate and was survived by two daughters. The second daughter was born out of wedlock on December 12, 1937. Her parents were married in a religious ceremony on January 22, 1953, although they were never married by the civil ceremony which was a prerequisite to legitimation by subsequent marriage under the Civil Code of Mexico. The daughter obtained an order from the appropriate Court in Michoacan declaring that for all legal effects she was the daughter of the testator\u2019s grandson having the right to bear his name and to receive a portion of his estate and a living allowance as prescribed by law. The trustees of the testator\u2019s estate sought the advice of the Supreme Court of Ontario as to whether the daughter was entitled to share in that estate. The trial judge\u2019s decision that she was not so entitled was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court of Appeal was not precluded from looking behind the name which the foreign law attached to the sum total of the capacities and obligations accorded to a person in the position of the daughter, so as to determine whether these capacities and obligations would in fact be recognized in Ontario as fulfilling the requirements necessary to the status of a legitimate child in that province. The daughter, the sum total of whose capacities and obligations under the law of the State of Michoacan included all those of a child born in wedlock in Ontario, had the status of a legitimate child in that province for the purpose here in question and the fact that under the law of the domicile some social limitations might attach to her position in Mexico, and that her status in that country was therefore described as \u201cillegitimate\u201d, could have no effect on the standards required in order to qualify as a legitimate child for the purpose of benefiting as one of \u201cthe issue\u201d of the grandson of an Ontario testator.\nRe Andros, Andros v.

Gibson, for the respondent, Maria Guadalupe Wardrope Sanchez.\nF.S. Weatherston, Q.C., for the respondent, William Hugh Masson Wardrope.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which set aside the judgment of Landreville J. and gave an affirmative answer to the following question upon which the opinion, advice and direction of the Court had been sought at the instance of the trustees of the estate of the late John Duff MacDonald:\nIs Maria Guadalupe Wardrope Sanchez entitled to share in the estate of John Duff MacDonald Wardrope?\nJohn Duff MacDonald was domiciled at Hamilton, Ontario, at the date of his death on March 10, 1901, and by his last will provided inter alia that:\nAs to the Capital of the Trust fund (including any accretions thereto) my Will is that if my daughter Sarah remain unmarried or if she marry and die without issue then on her death and subject to the rights of her sisters and their children in the income one third of the trust fund shall on the youngest of my surviving grandchildren attaining twenty one years be divided in equal shares among all my grandchildren living at the period of division and the issue of any deceased \u201cgrandchild such issue taking the share their parent would have taken if alive at such division and as to the remainder of the trust fund the same shall as it becomes freed from the rights of my daughters in the income of the whole or part thereof be divided in equal shares among all my grandchildren living at the period or periods of such division and the issue then living of any grandchild such issue taking the share their parent would have taken if then alive, provided always that if any grandchild living at the period or periods of division of the remainder of the trust fund shall die before attaining twenty-five years of age he or she shall not be entitled to any of such capital but the same shall go in equal shares to those who attain twenty-five years and the children of any deceased grandchild whether dying before or after the period of division.\nThe testator\u2019s grandson, John MacDonald Wardrope, hereinafter referred to as John Wardrope, who died intestate and domiciled in the State of Michoacan in the Republic of Mexico before the death of the last surviving life tenant under the terms of the said will, left two surviving daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth Lucia MacDonald Wardrope was born on April 3, 1929, the issue of his lawful marriage with Lucia Montano Bosque, and the other of whom, Maria Sanchez, was born on December 12, 1937, the child of his union with Gudelia Sanchez, to whom he was not married.\nIt appears to be agreed by all concerned that John Wardrope was domiciled in Mexico at the date of the birth of his second daughter and at the time when he acknowledged her to be his child. Nor is it questioned that being still domiciled in Mexico, he married Gudelia Sanchez in a religious ceremony on January 22, 1953, although they were never married by the civil ceremony which is a prerequisite to legitimation by subsequent marriage under the Civil Code of Mexico.\nThe sole question to be determined is whether Maria Sanchez is one of the \u201cissue of any deceased grandchild\u201d of the testator so as to be entitled under the law of Ontario to share in that portion of the personal estate of the testator now available for distribution among such issue.\nIt is conceded that in construing an Ontario will the word \u201cissue\u201d is to be treated as meaning \u201clegitimate children\u201d, and it is accordingly first necessary to determine the status of any child claiming to be entitled under such a will.\nSome of the difficulties to which the present circumstances give rise were expressed by Kay J. in Re Andros, Andros v. Andros[2] at p. 639 in the following language:\nA bequest in an English will to the children of A. means to his legitimate children, but the rule of construction goes no further. The question remains who are his legitimate children. That certainly is not a question of construction of the will. It is a question of status. By what law is that status to be determined. That is a question of law. Does that comity of nations which we call international law apply to the case or not? That may be a matter for consideration, but I do not see how the construction of the will has anything to do with it. The matter may be put in another way. What did the testator intend by this gift? That is answered by the rule of construction. He intended A.\u2019s legitimate children. If you ask the further question, Did he intend his children who would be legitimate according to English law or his actual legitimate children? How can the rule of construction answer that?\nBefore the enactment of the Legitimacy Act, 1926, 16 & 17 Geo. 5 (U.K.), c. 60, it was well established in England that in the case of a child born out of wedlock whose father was domiciled in that country at the time of its birth, the indelible taint of bastardy could not be removed, but at least since the early 1880\u2019s, it has been equally well recognized in the English Courts that if the laws of the country in which the putative father was domiciled at the date of the birth of an illegitimate child provide for legitimation by a subsequent marriage of the parents, then such a child would be recognized as being legitimate for the purpose of inheriting personal property in England if the father, being still domiciled in the foreign country, complied with the condition of marrying the mother. In this regard I refer to Udny v. Udny[3]; Re Wright\u2019s Will Trusts[4]; Re Goodman\u2019s Trusts[5]; Re Grove, Vaucher v. Treasury Solicitor[6] and other cases which are reviewed in the reasons for judgment delivered by MacKay J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe principle underlying many of these decisions is to the effect that recognition of legitimation by subsequent marriage is predicated upon the domicile of the father at the date of birth having given to the child a capacity of being made legitimate by such marriage, (see Re Grove, supra, per Cotton L.J. at p. 233), and it appears from the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in England in Re Luck\u2019s Settlement Trusts[7], that that Court would have extended this principle to include legitimation by recognition if the father in that case had been domiciled in the foreign jurisdiction at the date of the child\u2019s birth. We are not concerned in the present case with the somewhat vexed questions which have been raised by legal writers as to the soundness of the proposition that subsequent legitimation should be made dependent for its validity upon the law of the domicile of the father at the date of the birth because, as has been indicated, it is conceded that John Wardrope was domiciled in Mexico at all material times, and I am of opinion that under the circumstances of the present case, the status of Maria Sanchez is to be determined according to the law of the State of Michoacan. The question to be decided is whether that status is such as to enable Maria Sanchez to participate in the estate of the late John Duff MacDonald as one of the \u201cissue\u201d of his grandson.\nIn the case of Re Donald, Baldwin v. Mooney[8], this Court declined to apply the cases dealing with legitimation by subsequent marriage to the case of a foreign adoption and considered that the question was not one of status but rather whether the child in question was a child within the meaning of the will which the Court was there considering. \u201cAdoption\u201d appears to me to differ from \u201clegitimation by recognition\u201d in the sense that the latter can only apply to an illegitimate natural child of the father who recognizes it whereas the former may apply to a legitimate orphan who is adopted by strangers in blood. This would, in my opinion, provide a distinction between the case of Re Donald, supra, and the present case, but in any event, the Donald case is, in my view, to be regarded as subject to the limitations explained by Judson J. in Re Gage; Ketterer et al. v. Griffith et al.[9] at pp. 249 and 250, to which reference is made in the reasons for judgment of MacKay J.A.\nIt is to be noted that after her father\u2019s death, Maria Sanchez obtained an order from the appropriate Court in the State of Michoacan which read, in part, as follows:\nIt is hereby declared for all legal effects that Maria Guadalupe Wardrope Sanchez is the daughter of John Duff MacDonald Wardrope having the right to bear his name and to receive a portion of the estate and a living allowance as prescribed by law.\nThe Courts in the present case have been assisted in determining the law of the State of Michoacan by the evidence of Tomas Sanchez Baylon, a lawyer who practised for the last ten years in that state and a substantial part of whose evidence is reproduced in the reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Ontario by MacKay J.A. I confine myself to reciting the following excerpts from Mr. Baylon\u2019s evidence:\nQ. May I take it that Miss Guadalupe Wardrope Sanchez has the status of legitimacy in the State of Michoacan with respect to inheriting property? A. Yes.\nQ. May I take it also that Guadalupe Sanchez Wardrope is lawful issue and has the right of inheriting property by law of the State of Michoacan? A. Yes.\nQ. I gather then that Sanchez has the status of legitimacy with respect to inheritance of property within an estate? A. Yes.\nQ. In no way then, the law considers it otherwise with respect to inheritance? A. In no way.\nQ. Then I suggest that she has a status of legitimacy for all purposes? A. She does.\nAt a later stage Mr. Baylon was asked with respect to the Civil Code of Michoacan:\nQ. I ask whether the Code provides anywhere that children whose paternity is established without marriage are to be treated as born in wedlock? A. I think this question requires a long explained answer. The Code does not have an article which specifies clearly that children born out of wedlock and legitimate children are to be treated equally, but that is precisely one of the motives of Mexican law, that children born in and out of wedlock are treated as children only, without referring to legitimacy or illegitimacy in the whole Code. Besides, the Legislature contain very clear reasonings to that effect.\nThese questions and answers must be read together with the following:\nQ. In view of the judgment Exhibit No. 1, would you describe Miss Sanchez as legitimate or illegitimate? A. We consider her as illegitimate according to the Civil Code of Mexico although she is a legitimate daughter by canonical law.\nQ. Is the canonical law part of the law of the State of Michoacan? A. No.\nQ. Once paternity has been established, does that confer on Miss Sanchez as the status of legitimacy? A. No, but we must have in mind that legitimacy does not affect the rights of sons or daughters toward the parents, as they are the same for legitimate or illegitimate sons and daughters.\nIn the course of his evidence Mr. Baylon quoted from the following articles of the Civil Code of Michoacan:\nART. 318\u2014The filiation of children born out of wedlock is derived, with respect to the mother, from the mere fact of birth. With respect to the father, it is established only by acknowledgement or by a judgment declaring his paternity.\nART. 312\u2014The subsequent marriage of the parents causes the child, had before such marriage, to be considered as born in wedlock.\nART. 329\u2014The husband may acknowledge a child born before his marriage, or during the same, but shall not have the right to take it to live in the marital home, except with the express consent of the wife.\nBeing questioned on these articles, Mr. Baylon said:\nQ. I put it to you that the results of the subsequent marriage referred to in Article 312 of the Code, of the parents of a child of theirs which was previously born, is to make that child for all purposes the legitimate child of those parents? A. Yes.\nQ. I put it to you, that there is a distinction in the Mexican Law between the child whose parents so marry and the child who establishes as a fact that a certain man was her father? A. There is a distinction, but I want to make clear that the purpose and spirit of the Law in this case is only to obligate parents to marry and certainly not to deprive the sons of their rights.\nQ. Now I want to draw your attention to Article 329. Does it not impose a limitation upon rights of the child as compared with rights of a legitimate child, that is, a child born of the union of married people. A. No, there is no limitation on his or her rights. About Art. 329, its purpose is to establish harmony in a marriage whose child is to be born and certainly not to establish a limitation whatsoever on the child\u2019s rights.\nQ. Does Art. 329 not prevent a child, whose paternity has been established by acknowledgement of the father, from living with the father if he has a living wife who objects? A. It does not prevent the child from having its rights, but merely prevents the father from taking the child to live with him.\nMr. Baylon also said of Maria Sanchez: \u201cShe cannot be called legitimate because her parents were not legally married they were just married by the church.\u201d\nFrom the whole of Mr. Baylon\u2019s evidence, I conclude that all the rights and capacities and obligations requisite for the purpose of attaining the status of a legitimate child in the Province of Ontario are enjoyed by Maria Sanchez by virtue of the law of Michoacan.\nThere do, however, appear to be certain limitations having to do with parental control and with the father\u2019s inability to bring a child born out of wedlock into his home without the consent of his wife, which afford a distinction recognized in Mexico and giving rise to the differentiation there made between a natural child who has been recognized by its parents and is still characterized as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and a child who is characterized as \u201clegitimate\u201d by reason of its parents having been married in a civil ceremony after its birth.\nIn the course of his most persuasive argument, counsel for the appellant submitted that the rights which are given to Maria Sanchez in Mexico are not accorded to her by virtue of her having attained the status of \u201clegitimate child\u201d in that jurisdiction, and that unless the Court of Appeal of Ontario could have found (which on the evidence it could not do) that under the law of Mexico she is a legitimate child of her father, it was bound to find that under that law she was illegitimate and therefore under the Ontario law could not inherit.\nIn support of this proposition reliance was placed on the decision of Hall V.C. in Atkinson v. Anderson[10], where it was held that the recognized natural children of an English native domiciled in Rome although capable of taking property by succession according to Roman law were to be regarded as \u201cstrangers in blood\u201d to their natural father for the purpose of construing s. 10 of the Succession Duty Act, 1853.\nThis case had to do with the rate of tax to be levied on the proceeds of the sale of English real estate which were to be divided under the terms of a valid English will between the testator\u2019s \u201cfour natural sons\u201d who were named in the will, and the sole question was whether these sons were \u201clineal issue of the testator\u201d and as such liable to pay duty at the rate of one per cent only or \u201cstrangers in blood\u201d to him and as such liable to pay at the rate of ten per cent.\nThis decision appears to me to be an isolated case turning on the construction of the statute in question, and it does not, in my view, stand as an authority for the proposition that the Court of Appeal of Ontario is precluded from looking behind the name which the foreign law attaches to the sum total of the capacities and obligations accorded to a person in the position of Maria Sanchez, so as to determine whether these capacities and obligations would in fact be recognized in the Province of Ontario as fulfilling the requirements necessary to the status of a legitimate child in that province.\nIn my opinion the title of \u201clegitimacy\u201d or \u201cillegitimacy\u201d when attached to the status of an individual in any juris- diction reflects the capacity or lack of capacity which the law of that jurisdiction recognizes in the case of the individual concerned. Just as \u201clegitimate\u201d when used in relation to a child is only a symbol employed to designate the legal rights and obligations which flow from being born in wedlock, so the word \u201cillegitimate\u201d is used to denote the limitations of capacity which attach to being born out of wedlock, and the word \u201clegitimitation\u201d is descriptive of the legal effects incident to being relieved of those limitations.\nMaria Sanchez, the sum total of whose capacities and obligations under the law of the State of Michoacan include all those of a child born in wedlock in Ontario, in my opinion has the status of a legitimate child in that province for the purpose here in question and the fact that some social limitations may attach to her position in Mexico, and that her status in that country is therefore described as \u201cillegitimate\u201d, can, in my view have no effect on the standards required in order to qualify as a legitimate child for the purpose of benefiting as one of \u201cthe issue\u201d of the grandson of an Ontario testator.\nFor these reasons, as well as for those stated in the very full judgment delivered by MacKay J.A., I would dismiss this appeal with costs of all parties to be paid out of the trust fund established under the will of the late John Duff MacDonald. The costs of the trustee to be taxed on a solicitor-client basis.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Grant W.

However, notwithstanding the incorporation of the company, J continued to conduct the business. Under a by-law passed by the respondent city in 1947 a licensing fee for professional boxing or wrestling exhibitions was fixed at $100 and by virtue of schedule \"A\" of the by-law this was an annual fee. The by-law was amended on three occasions, namely, in 1948, 1955 and 1957. The 1948 amendment changed the fee to a \"per day\" fee of $25; the 1955 amendment increased the fee to $37.50 and the 1957 amendment further increased it to $50. Neither the amendment of 1955 nor that of 1957 fixed the fee as a per day fee, and, accordingly, under schedule \"A\" of the original by-law the fee was an annual fee, not having been otherwise specified. The city's licensing inspector and J erroneously believed that the 1955 and 1957 amendments provided for per day fees. In the years 1955 to 1959 J paid on the per day basis $8,125 more than he would have paid had the licence fees been collected on an annual basis. After the discovery of the error the appellant brought an action in which it claimed repayment of the $8,125; the trial judgment in favour of the appellant was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe appellant was entitled to succeed on either or both of the following grounds: (1) The payments were made not under a mistake of law but under a mistake of fact. The mutual mistake of fact was as to the existence of one or more by-laws calling for a licence fee on a per day basis. Both the licence inspector and J believed that such by-laws existed in fact but they did not actually exist at all so the mistake was one as to the fact of the existence of the by-laws and not one of interpretation of by-laws that in any way purported to stipulate a per day fee. (2) The payments were made under compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity and not voluntarily as claimed by the respondent.\nOther grounds raised by the respondent, i.e., (i) that the appellant company had never been organized and capable of doing business as required by The Companies Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 124, (ii) that any right which J may have had was not assigned to the appellant company and that the appellant company never at any time acquired any rights against the respondent, (iii) that the claim was barred by the provisions of s. 34 of The Tax Enforcement Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 156, and (iv) that the appellant was not entitled to recover because of laches, also failed.\nMaskell v.

Leslie, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. M. Nicol, Q.C., and H. F. Feuring, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014For a considerable period prior to August 1956, one George Jacobs promoted and put on periodic wrestling exhibitions within the city of Regina, a municipal corporation in the province of Saskatchewan. On June 8, 1956, Jacobs caused the appellant company to be incorporated under The Companies Act of Saskatchewan. By an agreement in writing made in August 1956 but undated, Jacobs assigned to the appellant his business as a wrestling promoter in the province of Saskatchewan including his property and assets, if any, and also all debts owing to him in connection with the said business. Notwithstanding the incorporation of the company, he continued to conduct the business and promote his wrestling exhibitions as he had done prior to incorporation and prior to the agreement just mentioned.\nIn the year 1947 the respondent city of Regina passed a by-law, no. 2252, providing, amongst other things, for the licensing of professional boxing or wrestling exhibitions in the city of Regina. The by-law provided in s. 6 that unless specifically mentioned therein to be for a shorter period the licence granted was for the current year, and in Schedule \"A\" of the said by-law it was provided that the licence fee was an annual fee unless otherwise specified.\nThe said by-law no. 2252 was amended on three occasions as follows:\n(a) By-law no. 2313\u2014passed December 7, 1948, amending by-law no. 2252. Boxing or wrestling exhibitions (Professional) per Day \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...$ 25.00\n(b) By-law no. 2741\u2014passed January 6, 1955, amending by-law no. 2252.\nBoxing or wrestling exhibitions (Professional) \u2026..$ 37.50\n(c) By-law no. 3043\u2014passed December 24, 1957, amending by-law no. 2252.\nBoxing or wrestling exhibitions (Professional)\u2026\u2026$ 50.00\nThe licence fee in by-law no. 2252 was $100, and by virtue of Schedule \"A\" it was an annual fee. By-law no. 2313 changed the fee to a \"per day\" fee of $25. By-law no. 2741 changed the licence fee to $37.50 and by-law no. 3043 increased the licence fee to $50. Neither by-law no. 2741 nor by-law no. 3043 fixed the fee as a per day fee, and, accordingly, under Schedule \"A\" of the original by-law no. 2252 the fee was an annual fee, not having been otherwise specified.\nIt was said by counsel for the respondent that the omission of the \"per day\" provisions in by-laws 2741 and 3043 was due to an error. Mr. Justice Brownridge seems to have accepted the error theory when he said:\nOn January 6, 1955, the licensing by-law was amended. From the exhibits filed, there is no doubt that the amendment was intended to raise the licence fee from $25 per day to $37.50 per day, but through an error, the words \"per day\" were omitted and it was clearly stated in the schedule of fees, \"licence fee annual unless otherwise specified\".\nA careful reading of the whole record and of the exhibits fails to disclose any admissible evidence of this so-called error by the body which had the legislative power to pass, amending by-laws 2741 and 3043, namely, the Regina city council. It is true the licence inspector erroneously believed that the amending by-laws provided for per day fees and so did Jacobs but that is not evidence of an actual error by the council which enacted the amendments.\nThere was no suggestion that either by-law 2741 or bylaw 3043 was invalid in any way nor was the right of the city of Regina to a licence fee either on an annual or a per day basis challenged. The city of Regina had the power to impose a per day fee. It could exercise that power by by-law but it did not do so.\nPrior to each Wrestling exhibition, Jacobs applied to the Regina Boxing and Wrestling Commission for a permit to hold the exhibition. After by-law 2741 was passed on January 6, 1955, Jacobs was required to pay a per day licence fee of $37.50 for each exhibition until by-law 3043 was passed on December 24, 1957, after which he was required to pay a per day fee of $50 for each exhibition. He paid altogether the sum of $8,125 on this per day basis in the years 1955 to 1959 inclusive, more than he would have paid had the licence fees been collected on an annual basis. The appellant's position is that this $8,125 was paid: (a) under a mutual mistake of fact; and (b) under compulsion. In either event it claims repayment of the $8,125 so paid to the city of Regina.\nIt is common ground that the licence inspector for the respondent city erroneously believed that the amending bylaws 2741 and 3043 provided for per day fees and so did Jacobs. The respondent city takes the position that the $8,125 was a voluntary payment and that it was not paid under a mutual mistake of fact but under mistake of law and that the appellant has no right to recover. The respondent city goes further and says that any right which Jacobs may have had was not assigned to the appellant company and that the appellant company never at any time acquired any rights as against the city of Regina and that, in fact, the appellant company had never been organized and capable of doing business as required by the Saskatchewan Companies Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 124. The respondent also argued that the claim, whether by Jacobs or the appellant company, was barred by the provisions of s. 34 of The Tax Enforcement Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 156, and in any event that the appellant was not entitled to recover because of laches.\nDealing, first, with the question of whether the mistake was one of fact or of law, I am of opinion that it was a mistake of fact. I agree with Brownridge J. when he states that the distinction between what is a mistake in law and what is a mistake in fact is often one of difficulty but I do not see the distinction here as being a difficult one. Interpretation of the amending by-laws 2741 and 3043 was never in question in the action. These by-laws never purported to stipulate for a per day fee. There was no mistake either of fact or of law in respect of what the by-laws actually said. The mutual mistake of fact here was as to the existence of one or more by-laws calling for a licence fee on a per day basis. Both the licence inspector and Jacobs believed that such by-laws existed in fact but they did not actually exist at all so the mistake is one as to the fact of the existence of the by-laws and not one of interpretation of by-laws that in any way purported to stipulate for a per day fee.\nI am also of opinion that the payments were made under compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity and not voluntarily as claimed by the respondent. The law on this subject was aptly summarized by Lord Reading C.J. in Maskell v. Horner2 at p. 1755 as follows:\nIf a person with knowledge of the facts pays money which he is not in law bound to pay, and in circumstances implying that he is paying it voluntarily to close the transaction, he cannot recover it. Such a payment is in law like a gift, and the transaction cannot be re-opened. If a person pays money which he is not bound to pay, under the compulsion of urgent and pressing necessity, or of seizure, actual or threatened, of his goods, he can recover it as money had and received. The money is paid, not under duress in the strict sense of the term, as that implies duress of person, but under the pressure of seizure or detention of goods, which is analogous to that of duress. Payment under such pressure establishes that the payment is not made voluntarily to close the transaction\u2014Atlee v. Backhouse (7 L.J. Ex. 234, per Lord Chief Baron Abinger, at p. 237, and per Baron Parke, at pp. 238\u20139; 3 M. & W. 633, at pp. 645\u20136, 650). The payment is made for the purpose of averting a threatened evil, and is made, not with the intention of giving up a right, but under immediate necessity and with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand.\nThe question was reviewed by this Court in Municipality of Saint John et al. v. Fraser-Brace Overseas Corporation et al.3 Rand J. at p. 272 dealt with the subject of voluntariness as follows:\nIn considering the question of voluntariness or coercion, the status and circumstance of the party resisting is a matter to be taken into account. As representing the United States the contractors were firm in their objection to the taxation, and the municipal authorities, with all the information before them, equally insistent on pressing it. In that state of things, to require either the contractors or the United States Government to take proceedings that might later be obviated, or to await action taken to seize the property is going beyond what is necessary to rebut the inference of voluntary payment. \"Voluntariness\" implies acquiescence, the absence of pressure inducing payment. (The italics are mine.)\nThe learned trial judge found that the per day licence fees were paid under compulsion. With that finding I respectfully agree. It is clear from the evidence that the licence inspectors were firm in telling Jacobs that a per day fee had to be paid if he was to continue the business of promoting wrestling exhibitions in the city of Regina. Believing that the by-law in force for the time being called for a per day fee, Jacobs had no actual alternative but to pay the fee being demanded by the agents of the respondent. Jacobs had asked to be shown the by-law and was told that there was not a copy available. In these circumstances the statement by Lord Denning in Kiriri Cotton Co. Ltd. v. Dewani4 is particularly in point. He said at p. 204:\nNor is it correct to say that money paid under a mistake of law can never be recovered back. The true proposition is that money paid under a mistake of law, by itself and without more, cannot be recovered back. James L.J. pointed that out in Rogers v. Ingham, (1876) 3 Ch. D. 351, 355. If there is something more in addition to a mistake of law\u2014if there is something in the defendant's conduct which shows that, of the two of them, he is the one primarily responsible for the mistake\u2014then it may be recovered back. Thus, if as between the two of them the duty of observing the law is placed on the shoulders of the one rather than the other\u2014it being imposed on him specially for the protection of the other\u2014then they are not in pari delicto and the money can be recovered back; see Browning v. Morris, (1778) 2 Cowp. 790, 792, by Lord Mansfield. Likewise, if the responsibility for the mistake lies more on the one than the other\u2014 because he has misled the other when he ought to know better\u2014then again they are not in pari delicto and the money can be recovered back; see Harse v. Pearl Life Assurance Co., [1904] 1 K.B. 558, 564, by Romer L.J. These propositions are in full accord with the principles laid down by Lord Mansfield relating to the action for money had and received.\nOn either or both of these grounds the appellant is entitled to succeed unless the other defences urged by the respondent are fatal to the appellant.\nThe first point taken by the respondent was that the appellant company had never been organized and capable of doing business as required by the Saskatchewan Companies Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 124, if it was a public company. In the first place there was no evidence that it was a public company, and in the second by para. 2 of its defence the respondent admitted the allegation contained in para. 2 of the statement of claim that: \"The Plaintiff is a body corporate, duly registered and licensed to carry on business in the Province of Saskatchewan.\"\nThe next objection was based on the contention that, after purporting to assign his business to the appellant company, Jacobs continued to carry on business in his own name as he had previously done and that the respondent city was never advised of the assignment or that the appellant company had any interest in Jacobs' business as a promoter. The learned trial judge rightly disposed of this objection. He accepted Jacobs' evidence that the payments made after the execution of the agreement in August 1956 had been made on behalf of the appellant company. With respect, he was entitled to apply the rule set out in Bowstead on Agency, 12th ed., p. 202, where the learned author states:\nA principal is entitled to sue for the recovery of money paid by an agent on the principal's behalf where the payment is made under mistake of fact or upon a consideration that fails or in consequence of fraud, duress or any other circumstance ordinarily entitling a person paying money to recover it from the payee.\nJacobs' right to recover the excess payments made prior to the agreement of August 1956 was, as the learned trial judge found, a chose in action which was assigned to the appellant company by Jacobs under the agreement of August 1956 and was covered by the clause in the agreement which read: \"All other property and assets, if any, of the Vendor in connection with the said business.\"\nIt was also objected that the appellant's claim was barred by s. 34 of The Tax Enforcement Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 156, which reads:\nNo action for the return by the municipality of any moneys paid to it, whether under protest or otherwise, on account of a claim, whether valid or invalid, made by the municipality for taxes shall be commenced after the expiration of six months from the date of payment of such moneys, and after the expiration of such period of six months without any action having been commenced, the payment made to the municipality shall be deemed to have been a voluntary payment.\nThis limitation section was not pleaded in the defence. Rule 145 of the Rules of Court of the Court of Queen's Bench for the province of Saskatchewan requires that such a defence be pleaded. That disposes of this objection, but, apart from the matter of pleading, it is doubtful if the section relied upon applies in the instant case at all. A similar section in The Tax Recovery Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 161, s. 27 was held not applicable in Wells Construction Co. Ltd. v. Municipal District of Sugar City No. 55.\nThe respondent also alleged laches. It is impossible on the facts of this case to discern any laches on the part of the appellant. It appears to have acted without undue delay after it learned that it had been paying on a per day basis when it should not have been required to do so. The appeal should accordingly be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Goetz & Murphy, Regina.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: C.

Similar operations on the part of the defendants created a bay into the adjacent lot 4 the mouth of which opened into the bay already created in lot 3. The plaintiff company subsequently obtained the rights to remove sand from the said lot 4, the defendants\u2019 rights to do so having lapsed, and permission was requested to cross the bay of lot 3 so as to gain access to lot 4. The defendants refused this permission. However, the plaintiffs later commenced sailing through the bay of lot 3 into the bay of lot 4 with sand-removing equipment and barges. The defendants then placed obstructions to navigation in the bay of lot 3 and the plaintiff brought action for an injunction. An injunction was granted by the trial judge and his judgment was affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of Appeal. A further appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The bay into lot 3 was navigable water and the defendants had no right to prevent navigation in that bay by either the plaintiffs or anyone else. This conclusion was reached without making any finding as to the ownership of the lands now under water but which originally formed part of lot 3, although the Court presumed that such lands were still the property of the defendants.\nIt was, of course, to be understood that the Court did not imply that the plaintiffs had any rights in the waters of the bay in lot 3 except the right of navigation.\nCram v. Ryan et al. (1894), 24 O.R. 500 and 25 O.R. 524, approved; Sim E. Bak et al. v. Ang Yong Huat, [1923] A.C. 429, distinguished.\nDefendant\u2014Individual defendant properly enjoined from continuance of illegal acts.\nThe individual defendant had conveyed his interests in lot 3 to the corporate defendant long before the circumstances which were the subject of the present litigation arose. His submission that the evidence did not support a judgment against him, and that his refusal to permit the passage of the plaintiffs\u2019 vessels, and any obstruction which the defendants put to the plaintiffs\u2019 navigation, was only the act of the corporate defendant for whom he merely acted as the officer and agent, was rejected.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, affirming a judgment of Stewart J. Appeal dismissed.\nAdrian T. Hewitt, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nA.B.R. Lawrence, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario affirming the judgment at trial of Stewart J. In that latter judgment, the learned trial judge granted the injunction as prayed for in the statement of claim and referred the question of damages to the Master at Ottawa.\nThe appellants (defendants) had from 1929 or 1930 taken sand from lot 3 on Grenadier Island in the St. Lawrence River some miles above the City of Brockville. They had previously taken sand from the river bed in front of the said lot 3 and then purchased lot 3 on the island itself and proceeded to remove sand therefrom, using a ship with sand-sucking equipment known as the S.M. Douglas. Prior to 1950, this work was done by the individual defendant but in that year he sold all his interest in the enterprise to the corporate defendant. In the course of removing the sand from the said lot 3, the appellants cut northerly into the lands on the foreshore of the said lot 3 resulting in the formation of a bay now in places about 600 feet in depth and about 545 feet in width at the mouth. This bay had a sufficient depth of water to admit the appellants\u2019 ship the S.M. Douglas and various scows and other equipment.\nIn 1957, the corporate appellant made arrangements with the owner of lot 4, the lot immediately adjacent to the east of lot 3, to remove sand from the said lot 4, and in the course of such excavation operations by the similar process of sand-sucking created a bay into lot 4 the mouth of which opened into the bay already created in lot 3. Both of these bays may be observed clearly in a photograph filed at trial as exhibit 2, and are shown on a large plan produced by one K.M. Wiseman, a surveyor, and marked exhibit 1 at the trial. In the year 1958, the respondent, through one Douglas McIntosh, obtained the rights to remove sand from the said lot 4, the appellants\u2019 rights to do so having lapsed, and in June 1959, the said Douglas McIntosh requested from the individual appellant (defendant) permission to cross the bay of lot 3 with barge and tug to gain access to lot 4 for the purpose of removing sand. This permission was refused. The respondent company then attempted to excavate a channel from the main waters of the St. Lawrence River northerly across the point between the bay of lot 4 and such main channel so that its equipment could enter the bay of lot 4 without crossing the appellants\u2019 lands. Due to the existence of a rock spur, this effort proved economically unfeasible and the respondents then commenced sailing through the bay of lot 3 into the bay of lot 4 with their sand-sucking equipment and barges.\nThe learned trial judge found, as a fact:\nDuring this time they experienced great difficulty in that the defendants blocked their activities as much as possible, placing hawsers across the mouth of the channel into the bay and building barricades of screenings, earth and sand, slightly to the west of the lot line, blocking the entrance to it from Lot 3.\nAs a result, the respondent brought these proceedings.\nIt is implicit in the findings of the learned trial judge, and it is stated in the reasons for judgment of Porter C.J.O. in the Court of Appeal, that the bay of lot 3 was created not for any use which the appellants should make of it but resulted incidentally from the removal of sand. In argument in this Court, counsel for the appellants stressed also that the bay was dug to a sufficient depth to permit the entry of its crane the S.M. Douglas but such procedure was only incidental to the removal of the sand, first from the waters below the foreshore and then from the actual foreshore, and later the main body of the island itself.\nI think it is proper to summarize the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge as being an acceptance of an application of the decision in Cram v. Ryan et al.[1] It is also I think a brief summary of the argument made by the appellant in this Court that he relied most strongly on the decision of the Privy Council in Sim E. Bak et al. v. Ang Yong Huat[2], although counsel for the appellant cited many other cases. The facts in Cram v. Ryan bear considerable resemblance to those in the present case. There, a purchaser of lands along the shore of the St. Mary\u2019s River near Sault Ste. Marie held the same under a grant from the Crown which grant contained two reservations:\nReserving free access to the shore of the lands hereby granted for all vessels, boats and persons, and\nReserving nevertheless unto Us, our Heirs and Successors the free use, passage, and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters that shall or may hereinafter be found on or under, or be flowing through or upon, any part of the said parcel or tract of land hereby granted as aforesaid.\nIn the present case, the grant to the appellants\u2019 predecessor in title dated October 8, 1877, and produced at trial as exhibit 21, contained this provision:\nsaving, excepting and reserving nevertheless unto Us, Our Heirs and Successors, the free use, passage and enjoyment of, in, over and upon all navigable waters that shall or may be hereafter found on or under, or be flowing through or upon any part of the said Parcel or Tract of land hereby granted as aforesaid.\nIt will be seen this is exactly the second reservation recited above from the deed considered in Cram v. Ryan.\nThe defendants in Cram v. Ryan had a licence to remove sand from the said lands and in the course of such removal had created a bay which extended about 150 feet back from the original shore line. The bay had a mouth of about 60 feet and was about twice that width back of the mouth. In this bay, thus created, the plaintiff moored its boarding scow and when the defendant proceeded to operate its sand-removing equipment sparks from the stack thereof ignited the plaintiff\u2019s scow and it was destroyed. It was held on appeal that the plaintiff was not a trespasser as the plaintiff was moored on navigable waters and not in any private waters. At p. 528 of 25 O.R., Armour C.J. said:\nIt is unnecessary to discuss the question whether the removal of the shore line back from its natural line, by the license of Fitzsimmons and Moran, had the effect of removing the boundary of their land back to the new shore line, and of making the land covered with water, by reason of such removal, the property of the Crown.\nBut it is plain, I think, that the effect of such removal was that the water so let in was as much publici juris as any other part of the water of the river, and the removal of the shore line back from its natural line did not take away the free access to the shore so removed for all vessels, boats and persons.\nIt must be noted that in Cram v. Ryan and in the present case, the bays or indentations cut into the foreshore by the owner of the foreshore terrain were cut for the purpose of removing sand and not so that the water could be allowed over the land to be used for any such purpose as the operation of machinery, channels, canals, boat harbours, etc., and it should further be noted that in both cases the waters flowing into these bays were a recognized navigable water resulting in the increase of the channel.\nSim E. Bak et al. v. Ang Yong Huat, supra, was concerned with the following circumstances. The Kalang River was evidently a shallow river which, in the course of nature, moved from place to place. At p. 432, Lord Wrenbury said:\nThe Kalang River must have shifted its bed between 1843 and the present time, a matter which is highly probable in a place which obviously is more like a mango swamp than a public navigable river.\nTwo parcels of land lay alongside of what appeared to be a 10 foot reservation which had run at one time along the course of the said Kalang River. These parcels of land both contained brick clay and the owners of the plots had, from time to time, dug out the clay leaving large and deep holes. More than thirty years before, there had come into existence a bridge through which the waters of the Kalang River had been admitted and these waters filled the holes made by the excavation of the brick clay so that the lands in question and many adjacent plots had become ponds or lagoons.The defendants\u2019 land had as well been excavated to remove brick clay with the result that there was one of these ponds on his land, and he cut through the bank so that the tidal water could obtain access to this pond, his purpose being to allow prawns and fish to come up with the tide, flow into the pond on his land and there be intercepted by a sluice which he had erected. The plaintiff thereafter erected on the soil of his land and extending across the mouth of the defendants\u2019 sluice, a fence with the result that the prawns and fish were intercepted and could not get into the defendants\u2019 pond. The defendants tore down this fence and the plaintiff took action. The Judicial Committee held that the waters in these ponds were not navigable waters and that the defendants could not object to any erection such as the fence made by the plaintiff on his own lands despite the fact that those lands were from time to time covered by tidal waters. At p. 433, Lord Wrenbury said:\nThe learned judge of first instance was of opinion that the creek formed part of a tidal navigable river. That it is tidal in the sense that the water in all the ponds or excavations which formed the creek rises and falls with the tide there is no doubt. That it is navigable in the sense that boats within limits of size could and did pass through the bridge and up the waterway and could and did bring away brick, earth or bricks burnt in kilns which have been erected there there is also no doubt. But from these facts it does not follow that the creek is a tidal navigable river. The question is one of degree, to be determined by reference to all the facts. \u201cThe flowing and re-flowing of the tide does not make it so\u201d, i.e., a navigable river; \u201cfor there are many places into which the tide flows which are not navigable rivers; and the place in question may be a creek in their own private estate\u201d: per Lord Mansfield in Mayor of Lynn v. Turner, 1 Cowp. 86. An instance of this might be a boathouse or boat harbour which an owner might create on his own land. \u201cIt does not necessarily follow, because the tide flows and re-flows in any particular place, that it is therefore a public navigation although of sufficient size\u201d: per Bayley J., in Rex v. Montague, 4 B. & C. 598, 601. The flowing of the tide is strong prima facie evidence of the existence of a public navigable river, but whether it is one or not depends upon the situation and nature of the channel. Not every ditch or cutting which is reached by the tide forms part of the public navigable river, even though it be large enough to admit of the passage of a boat. The question is one of degree, and is for the jury, having regard to all the facts.\nThe evidence as to user is that \u201cboats come in and go out over 100 times a month\u201d, say, four a day. There is no evidence at all that these are not boats used by the owners of the plots to bring out their bricks\u2014and presumably they are. There is absolutely nothing to induce any member of the public to take a boat up this creek, and there is no evidence that any member of the public did so. On the other hand, it is the convenient and obvious way of bringing out the bricks. I am of the opinion that even the paramount authority of this decision in the Privy Council does not govern the present case and cannot be seen as over-riding the decision in Cram v. Ryan, which has stood as the law of the Province of Ontario for 70 years. I am of the view that there the learned Lordships were dealing with quite different circumstances. These so-called ponds were not on the Kalang River but they were some little distance away from the then flow of the river and they only received the tidal flow of water by means of channels constructed to bring the water into them. Such channels evidently passed under a bridge so that in fact the ponds were artificially created holes first and only became ponds when the tidal waters were introduced into them through the channels. This is a very different situation from the mere broadening of the St. Lawrence River by digging a bay into its banks or to be more accurate the bank of an island in this navigable river.\nCounsel for the appellants argued that the bay on lot 3 on Grenadier Island could not be considered navigable water despite the fact that it was admittedly navigable in fact because there was no evidence of commercial utility and cited, inter alia, (1) Attorney-General of Quebec v. Fraser[3], per Girouard J. at p. 597:\nThe test of navigability is its utility for commercial purposes. Every river is not equally useful. The Moisie, which is in the wilderness, with few fishing and mineral establishments for 15 or 17 miles from its mouth, cannot be compared with the River St. Lawrence, where the state has spent millions to improve its navigation possibilities.\n(2) Keewatin Power Co. v. Town of Kenora[4], at p. 243, where Anglin J. adopted the statement of Davis J. in The Montello[5] where, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, he said:\nThe true test of the navigability of a stream does not depend on the mode by which commerce is, or may be, conducted nor the difficulties attending navigation\u2026 It would be a narrow rule to hold that in this country, unless a river was capable of being navigated by steam or sail vessels, it could not be treated as a public highway. The capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce affords the true criterion of the navigability of a river, rather than the extent and manner of that use.\n(3) Ratte v. Booth[6] (4) Gordon v. Hall and Hall[7], where McRuer C.J.H.C. said at p. 382:\nIn the first place, to be regarded as a navigable water, it must have something of the characteristics of a highway, that is, it must afford a means of transportation between terminal points to which the members of the public have a right to go as distinct from a means of transportation between one private terminus and another.\nIt is sufficient to say that if these are tests which must be passed before waters can be considered navigable, then the bay into lot 3 on Grenadier Island complies with such tests. The respondent certainly operated the bay for commerce and was concerned with access thereto only for the purpose of carrying on its business. The bay was used not only by the respondent itself but by the respondent\u2019s customers who resorted to the bay for the purpose of taking delivery of sand and also by others both for personal and for business reasons. Douglas McIntosh, president of the respondent company, swore:\nWe had five boats, the dredge which had a draught of approximately four feet, the tug which had a draught of four feet, six inches, the four scows the draught was ten feet.\nI have seen quite a few boats some of which I knew and some of which I did not know. I have seen people\u2014I do not know how many small boats in the bay along the beach and I have seen boats from Andrews and Huckmarine bringing people up there and I have seen most of the people that live around about with small boats coming in from time to time.\nThey have come in sometimes fishing and sometimes bathing and sometimes on business errands to see us or see Simpson Sand.\nCertainly, the travel is not between one private terminus and another. One terminus is undoubtedly the respondent\u2019s bay but the other terminus may be any place to which the sand recovered from the bay in lot 4 is hauled by the respondent or its customers.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the bay into lot 3 on Grenadier Island is navigable water as was the bay formed into the land along the St. Mary\u2019s River in Cram v. Ryan, and the appellants have no right to prevent navigation in that bay by either the respondents or anyone else. I have come to this conclusion without making any finding as to the ownership of the lands now under water but which originally formed part of lot 3, and have presumed for the purpose of these reasons, that such lands under water are still the property of the appellants. This was the course taken by the Divisional Court in Cram v. Ryan.\nIt must, of course, be understood that I do not imply that the respondents have any rights in the waters of the bay in lot 3 except the right of navigation.\nThere remains to be disposed of the appeal of the personal appellant Wells Charles Simpson. Counsel submits that the evidence does not support a judgment against the individual appellant who had conveyed his interest in lot 3 to the corporate appellant in 1950, long before the circumstances which are the subject of this litigation arose, and that his refusal to permit the passage of the respondents\u2019 vessels, and any obstruction which the appellants put to the respondents\u2019 navigation, was only the act of the corporate appellant for whom the individual appellant merely acted as the officer and agent. I am of the opinion that there is no merit in this contention. If the refusal to permit navigation and the obstruction of that navigation are illegal acts and I have so found, then the carrying out of such illegal acts by the individual appellant results in his liability therefor whether or not he was instructed to do so by the corporate defendant, and he is properly enjoined from the continuance of such illegal acts.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Hewitt, Hewitt & Nesbitt, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Honeywell, Baker, Gibson, Wotherspoon, Lawrence & Diplock, Ottawa.\n[1] (1894), 24 O.R. 500, and on appeal 25 O.R. 524.\n[2] [1923] A.C. 429.\n[3] (1906), 37 S.C.R. 577.\n[4] (1907), 13 O.L.R. 237.\n[5] (1874), 20 Wallace 430.\n[6] (1886), 11 O.R. 491 at 498.\n[7] (1959), 16 D.L.R.

The Board granted the certificate, but for the purposes of determining the representative character of the union and the appropriateness of the unit, excluded, among others, all employees under sixteen years of age, as it was authorized to do by one of its own by-laws. Had employees under sixteen been included in the bargaining unit, the union would not have had the majority called for under the Act. A writ of prohibition taken by the employer was refused by the trial judge, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, granted the writ and set aside the certification. The Board was granted leave to appeal to this Court. It was argued, inter alia, that the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction in excluding from the bargaining unit employees less than sixteen years old.\nHeld (Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the writ of prohibiton dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbot and Judson JJ.: Under The Labour Relations Act, the Board was given the powers, inter alia, to determine (1) the unit of employees which was appropriate for collective bargaining purposes and (2) the representative character of the union seeking certification as the agent of the employees in that unit. The responsibility of determining what employees were to be included or excluded from a bargaining unit had been committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board. Aside from being prohibited by the Act from including certain specified categories of employees, the Board was free to include or exclude other categories, and provided it exercised that discretion in good faith its decision was not subject to judicial review. To hold otherwise would fail to give effect to the plain words of s. 41a of the Act. The decisions of L'Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. The Labour Relations Board of Quebec, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 140, and Toronto Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Co., [1953] 2 S.C.R. 18, had no application to the present case.\nLes Juges Cartwright et Fauteux, dissidents: La Commission n'avait pas le pouvoir d'exclure les moins de seize ans, comme elle l'a fait, en suivant un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et en s'appuyant sur un motif dont la constante application aurait in\u00e9vitablement pour cons\u00e9quence de priver d\u00e9finitivement les moins de seize ans d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociations et d'avoir les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que la Loi accorde aux salari\u00e9s.

Ayant ainsi rendu une d\u00e9cision ultra vires, la Commission ne peut validement invoquer l'art. 41a de la Loi pour faire obstacle au recours adopt\u00e9 par l'employeur.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Bertrand J.

Vaillancourt, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nLawrence Marks, Q.C., and Guy Gagnon, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nPhilip Cutler, for the mis-en-cause.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal, by leave, is from a majoriy judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench2 allowing an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, granting a writ of prohibition against the appellant Board and declaring void certain of its decisions.\nThe facts are not now in dispute. On March 21, 1956, the mis-en-cause (which I shall refer to as the Union) applied to the Board for recognition as collective bargaining agent for certain employees of the respondent company at its Lachine plant, described as follows in the application:\ntous les employ\u00e9s pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'heure et \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, except\u00e9 les contrema\u00eetres, contrema\u00eetresses, arrangeurs de machines, personnes ayant fonction de surveillance, employ\u00e9s de bureau, chauffeurs, les personnes pay\u00e9es \u00e0 la semaine, et ceux automatiquement exclus par la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res. That application was opposed by the respondent. On November 13,1956, following a series of hearings, the Board rendered a decision certifying the Union as bargaining agent to represent\u2014\ntous les employ\u00e9s pay\u00e9s sur une base horaire ou \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce except\u00e9 les contrema\u00eetres, contrema\u00eetresses, personnes ayant fonction de surveillance, employ\u00e9s d\u00e9 bureau, les personnes pay\u00e9es \u00e0 la semaine, les \u00abproduction supervisors\u00bb, le chef m\u00e9canicien, les mineurs de moins de seize ans et ceux automatiquement exclus par la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res, \u00e0 l'emploi de l'Intim\u00e9e Burlington Mills Hosiery Company of Canada Limited, 130 rue St-Joseph, Lachine, P.Q.\nA petition to have this certificate cancelled was filed with the Board by respondent on December 6, 1956, and after a hearing was dismissed on January 17, 1957. The present proceedings were launched by respondent on February 12, 1957, asking for the issuance of a writ of prohibition and that the decisions of the Board be set aside as having been made outside its jurisdiction.\nIn the Courts below and before this Court, respondent challenged the decisions of the Board upon two grounds namely, that the Board had exceeded its jurisdiction in\n(1) recognizing as bargaining agent a Union which had neither constitution nor by-laws and which had not complied with s. 27 of the Labour Relations Act and\n(2) excluding from the bargaining unit employees less than sixteen years old.\nAs to the first of these grounds the learned trial judge held that the Union had complied with the provisions of the statute and that view was shared by Taschereau J. in the Court below. After hearing counsel for respondent, counsel for appellant was advised that this Court did not need to hear him in reply on this point.\nTurning now to respondent's second grounds of objection to the jurisdiction of the Board. The relevant sections of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 162A, as amended, are as follows:\n2. In this act and in its application, unless the context requires otherwise, the following words and expressions have the meaning hereinafter given to them:\na) \"Employee\" means any apprentice, unskilled labourer or workman, skilled workman or journeyman, artisan, clerk or employee, working individually or in a crew or in partnership; but it does not include:\n1\u00b0 persons employed as manager, superintendent, foreman or representative of an employer in his relations with his employees; 2\u00b0 the directors and managers of a corporation;\n3\u00b0 any person belonging to one of the professions contemplated in chapters 262 to 275, or admitted to the study of one of such professions;\n4\u00b0 domestic servants or persons employed in an agricultural exploitation.\n4. Every employer shall be bound to recognize as the collective representative of his employees the representatives of any association comprising the absolute majority of his said employees and to negotiate with them, in good faith, a collective labour agreement.\nSeveral associations of employees may join to make up such majority and appoint representatives for purposes of collective negotiation upon such conditions, not inconsistent with this act, as they may deem expedient.\n5. The employer shall incur the obligation contemplated in the preceding section, as the Board may decide, either towards the aggregate of his employees or towards each group of the said employees which the Board declares is to form a separate group for the purposes of this act.\n* * *\n6. Every association desiring to be recognized, for the purposes of this act, as representing a group of employees or of employers, shall apply by petition in writing to the Board and the latter, after inquiry, shall determine whether such association is entitled to be so recognized and what group of employees it shall represent, or in the case of an association of employers, with respect to what group of the employees of its members it is qualified to represent them.\n* * *\n7. The Board shall assure itself of the representative character of the association and of its right to be recognized and, for such purpose, shall examine its books and records.\nIn order to assure itself of such representative character, the Board may, by by-law subject to the formalities of section 38, determine the conditions on which a person may be recognized as a member of an association.\n41a. Notwithstanding any legislative provision inconsistent herewith,\na) the decisions of the Board shall be without appeal and cannot be revised by the courts;\nb) no writ of quo warranto, of mandamus, of certiorari, of prohibition or injunction may be issued against the Board or against any of its members, acting in their official capacity;\nc) the provisions of article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall not apply to the Board, or to its members acting in their official capacity.\nIn establishing the bargaining unit, for which it certified the Union as collective bargaining agent, the Board excluded from such unit, among others, all employees under sixteen years of age. For the purpose of determining the representative character of the Union it also excluded members of the Union under that age. On this basis the Board found that the bargaining unit contained 324 employees and that the eligible members of the Union totalled 165. Had employees under sixteen been included in the bargaining unit, the Union would not have had the majority called for under the Act.\nNo doubt the Board had sound reasons for excluding these young persons from the bargaining unit, and it might be observed in passing, that By-law 3a of the Board adopted pursuant to s. 7 of the Act (which by-law has been in force since 1946) specifically excludes them as members of a union for the purpose of determining its representative character. At all events, in my opinion the decision to include or exclude such young persons as members of a bargaining unit is one which is clearly within the jurisdiction of the appellant Board.\nUnder the Act the Board is given the powers inter alia to determine (1) the unit of employees which is appropriate for collective bargaining purposes and (2) the representative character of the Union seeking certification as the collective bargaining agent of the employees in that unit. It is clear that the absolute majority referred to in s. 4 means the absolute majority of a bargaining unit, where that unit does not comprise all employees.\nThe responsibility of determining what employees are to be included or excluded from a bargaining unit has been committed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Appellant Board. Indeed that is one of its principal functions. The Act prohibits the inclusion of certain specified categories of employees in such a bargaining unit, but aside from these prohibitions, the Board is free to include or exclude other categories, and provided it exercises that discretion in good faith its decision is not subject to judicial review. In my respectful opinion, to hold otherwise fails to give effect to the plain words of s. 41a of the Act.\nIn my view the decisions of this Court in the Alliance des Professeurs3 case and the Toronto Newspaper Guild4 case, which were cited in argument, have no application here. In the Alliance case it was held that the rule audi alteram partem applies to the hearings of a Board such as the Labour Relations Board, and that in issuing the order complained of in that case, without holding a hearing, the Quebec Labour Relations Board had acted without jurisdiction. No such situation existed here. The Board in this case held not merely one hearing, but a series of hearings. In the Toronto Newspaper Guild case the majority of this Court held that the Ontario Labour Relations Board, at a hearing before it, had refused to allow cross-examination of a union secretary and that, in so doing, it had declined jurisdiction. Nothing of this sort is in issue here.\nOne other point. In his argument before us Mr. Mercier drew attention to the following dictum of Choquette J. who delivered the majority opinion in the Court below\u2014\nJ'ajouterai que la Commission n'est pas un tribunal judiciaire, mais un tribunal administratif exer\u00e7ant certains pouvoirs judiciaires. Ces pouvoirs, \u00e0 mon avis, sont du domaine des faits et non du domaine du droit.\nWith respect, the statement made by the learned judge in the second sentence as to the powers of the Board, while perhaps obiter, is in error. The judgment in Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd.5 and other decisions which have held that a board of this kind is competent to decide questions of law, were reviewed recently by my brother Judson in Farrell v. Workmen's Compensation Board6.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nLe Juge Fauteux (dissident):\u2014La mise-en-cause a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de Relations Ouvri\u00e8res de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec d'\u00eatre reconnue, aux fins de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res, comme repr\u00e9sentante d'un groupe de salari\u00e9s form\u00e9 de\n\u2026 tous les employ\u00e9s pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'heure et \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, except\u00e9 les contrema\u00eetres, contrema\u00eetresses, arrangeurs de machines, personnes ayant fonction de surveillance, employ\u00e9s de bureau, chauffeurs, les personnes pay\u00e9es \u00e0 la semaine et ceux automatiquement exclus par la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res, \u00e0 l'emploi de Burlington Mills Hosiery Co. of Canada Ltd \u2026\nApr\u00e8s contestation, la Commission d\u00e9cida d'\u00e9mettre un certificat de reconnaissance syndicale \u00e0 la mise-en-cause pour repr\u00e9senter\n\u2026 tous les employ\u00e9s pay\u00e9s sur une base horaire ou \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, except\u00e9 les contrema\u00eetres, contrema\u00eetresses, personnes ayant fonction de sur- veillance, employ\u00e9s de bureau, personnes pay\u00e9es \u00e0 la semaine, les \u00abproduction supervisors\u00bb, les mineurs de moins de seize ans, et ceux automatiquement exclus par la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res \u00e0 l'emploi de l'intim\u00e9e Burlington Mills Hosiery Company of Canada Limited \u2026\nD'o\u00f9 l'on voit que les moins de seize ans, faisant partie du groupe de salari\u00e9s pay\u00e9s sur une base horaire ou \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, furent exclus par la Commission de ce groupe de salari\u00e9s pour lequel la mise-en-cause demandait d'\u00eatre accr\u00e9dit\u00e9e comme agent n\u00e9gociateur. On aper\u00e7oit, \u00e0 l'extrait suivant de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission le 13 novembre 1956, le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et le motif par elle adopt\u00e9s pour justifier cette exclusion:\nATTENDU que le 31 juillet 1956, la Commission \u00e9crivait au Procureur de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, l'avisant qu'elle avait pris connaissance de sa lettre du 19 juillet et \u2026 qu'elle l'informait \u00e0 nouveau, en regard des mineurs de moins de seize ans, qu'il appartenait \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9terminer le groupe faisant partie des n\u00e9gociations et qu'elle consid\u00e9rait que, vu qu'elle les enlevait pour d\u00e9terminer la majorit\u00e9, elle les enlevait \u00e9galement dans l'unit\u00e9 des n\u00e9gociations;\nIl est conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que si la Commission n'avait pas soustrait le nombre des moins de seize ans du nombre total des salari\u00e9s pay\u00e9s sur une base horaire ou \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible pour l'union mise-en-cause de pr\u00e9tendre compter dans ses rangs la majorit\u00e9 absolue de tous les salari\u00e9s. Et, comme on le sait, c'est la majorit\u00e9 absolue qui conditionne essentiellement le titre \u00e0 la reconnaissance syndicale et le pouvoir de la Commission de l'accorder \u00e0 l'union qui la recherche.\n\u00c9tant d'opinion que la Commission n'avait aucune juridiction pour ainsi agir, l'intim\u00e9e fit \u00e9mettre un bref de prohibition, demandant particuli\u00e8rement que cette d\u00e9cision de la Commission soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ill\u00e9gale, nulle et sans effet et qu'il soit enjoint \u00e0 la Commission de ne faire aucun acte\u2014 proc\u00e9dure de n\u00e9gociations ou autres\u2014pour donner effet \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision.\nRejet\u00e9 en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, ce recours fut admis en Cour du banc de la reine7 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire. Par la suite, l'appelante demanda et obtint la permission d'en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLa Commission avait-elle le pouvoir d'ainsi proc\u00e9der pour accorder la reconnaissance syndicale \u00e0 l'union mise-en-cause et, dans la n\u00e9gative, y a-t-il, en l'esp\u00e8ce, un exc\u00e8s de juridiction donnant lieu au bref de prohibition, nonobstant l'art. 41a de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res qui \u00e9carte tout recours en revision des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission. Tels sont les deux points qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition.\nPour justifier cette d\u00e9cision, on s'est appuy\u00e9 sur les dispositions de l'art. 3(a) du R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 1 des R\u00e8glements de la Commission et sur celles de l'art. 5 de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res.\nIl convient de reproduire en entier l'art. 3 du R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 1:\n3. Pour l'appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif d'une association, les conditions auxquelles une personne peut \u00eatre reconnue membre d'une association, sont les suivantes:\na) \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9e d'au moins seize ans;\nb) avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement admise membre et avoir sign\u00e9 une carte d'adh\u00e9sion d\u00fbment dat\u00e9e;\nc) avoir personnellement pay\u00e9 un droit d'entr\u00e9e ou d'initiation d'au moins un dollar ($1);\nd) \u00eatre tenue de payer personnellement des cotisations \u00e0 un taux non inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 cinquante cents (.50\u00a2) par mois;\ne) avoir personnellement pay\u00e9 les cotisations pour au moins un mois, s'il s'agit d'un nouveau membre;\nf) n'avoir pas d'arri\u00e9r\u00e9s de cotisations pour plus de trois mois, s'il s'agit d'un membre d\u00e9j\u00e0 initi\u00e9;\ng) occuper r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement un emploi se rattachant aux occupations professionnelles normales de l'employeur \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard duquel la reconnaissance est demand\u00e9e;\nh) les conditions pr\u00e9vues pour \u00e9tablir le caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif d'une association doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies le ou avant le jour du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate pour reconnaissance syndicale \u00e0 la Commission de relations ouvri\u00e8res.\nNous ne sommes pas appel\u00e9s \u00e0 nous prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 des dispositions du para. (a) de l'art. 3. Ce qui est certain, c'est que si, pour appr\u00e9cier le caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif d'une union, la Commission doit \u00e9carter de ceux qui en sont membres les personnes qui sont \u00e2g\u00e9es de moins de seize ans, il ne s'ensuit pas qu'elle doive aussi les exclure pour \u00e9tablir la somme totale des salari\u00e9s, somme dont elle doit tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si l'union r\u00e9unit comme membres la majorit\u00e9 absolue. Comme le note M. le Juge Choquette, l'exclusion des moins de seize ans est prescrite par l'art. 3(a) pour l'appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif d'une union et non pour la d\u00e9termination du nombre total des salari\u00e9s de l'entreprise ou du groupe. Et si, ajoute t-il, parce que, en ob\u00e9issance au R\u00e8glement, on les exclut pour appr\u00e9cier le caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif, on doit \u00e9galement les exclure pour \u00e9tablir le nombre total de salari\u00e9s, il faudrait, pour \u00eatre cons\u00e9quent, adopter le m\u00eame proc\u00e9d\u00e9 en ce qui concerne ceux qui ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux exigences des paras, b), c), d), e) et f) du m\u00eame article du R\u00e8glement. L'article 2 de la Loi d\u00e9finit le mot \u00absalari\u00e9\u00bb; les moins de seize ans ne sont pas de ceux qui sont exclus de cette d\u00e9finition. Ils ont donc droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice que la Loi accorde aux salari\u00e9s d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour fins de n\u00e9gociations.\nQuand \u00e0 l'art. 5 de la Loi, il autorise bien la Commission \u00e0 former des groupes distincts de salari\u00e9s pour les fins de la Loi, ce qui implique \u00e9videmment, comme l'a soumis le procureur de l'appelante, l'exclusion d'une partie des salari\u00e9s dans la formation d'un groupe distinct. En l'esp\u00e8ce, cependant, la Commission n'a pas exclu les moins de seize ans afin de former un groupe distinct, mais elle a form\u00e9 un groupe distinct parce qu'elle les avait exclus pour l'appr\u00e9ciation du caract\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentatif de l'union et la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si celle-ci r\u00e9unissait parmi ses membres la majorit\u00e9 absolue. En tout respect pour les tenants de l'opinion contraire, la Commission n'avait pas le pouvoir d'exclure les moins de seize ans, comme elle l'a fait, en suivant un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 et s'appuyant sur un motif dont la constante application aurait in\u00e9vitablement pour cons\u00e9quence de priver d\u00e9finitivement les moins de seize ans d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociations et d'avoir les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que la Loi accorde aux salari\u00e9s.\nDe plus, et en agissant comme susdit, la Commission s'est attribu\u00e9 le pouvoir d'imposer \u00e0 l'employeur la reconnaissance d'une association minoritaire, contrairement aux prescriptions des arts. 4 et 5 de la Loi.\nAyant ainsi rendu une d\u00e9cision ultra vires, la Commission ne peut validement invoquer l'art. 41a de la Loi des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res pour \u00e9chapper au pouvoir de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Comme en a jug\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel, en s'appuyant particuli\u00e8rement sur les principes formul\u00e9s par cette Cour dans L'Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. La Commission de Relations Ouvri\u00e8res de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec8 et Toronto Newspaper Guild Local 87, American Newspaper Guild (C.I.O.) v. Globe Printing Company9, cet article ne fait pas obstacle, en l'esp\u00e8ce, au recours adopt\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e.

An injunction was also sought to restrain the defendant from selling any pharmaceutical preparations in association with any of the plaintiff's ten trade marks consisting of different coloured bands for encircling capsules, including the grey and green bands, all of which have been registered in Canada in 1950. The capsule is a small cylindrical gelatine container made up of two halves intended to contain a measured quantity of medicament. The coloured band is placed around the centre of the capsule at the point where the two halves are joined. It is made of the same substance as the capsule itself which it seals. The trial judge dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff's ten registered trade marks had a functional use or characteristic and could not, therefore, be the subject of a trade mark. There was ample evidence to support such a finding. There was also evidence that the plaintiff held between 1932 and 1949 a United States patent on sealed capsules with similar bands. That evidence was relevant on this question of fact as to whether these bands had a functional use or characteristic. Evidence that the plaintiff so considered its bands when it applied for the U.S. patent in 1932 was surely some evidence that the bands had in fact a functional use.\nAs to the passing-off claim, the plaintiff had failed to show that the trade marks had been relied upon to distinguish its goods from any others.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing an action for infringement. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Peter L. Beck, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nMorris M. Kertzer, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014The appellant is the owner of 10 trade marks registered in Canada on September 19, 1950, as set out in the judgment of No\u00ebl J. from which this appeal is taken. These trade marks are identical except that each of the 10 refers to a distinct band colour, white, black, etc. The trade mark covering the white band reads in part as follows:\nThe mark of which registration is requested is a design mark, of which five accurate and complete representations are furnished herewith, its principal features requiring to be indexed being in the applicant's opinion, a white band applied approximately around the middle of a capsule and encircling the same.\nThe capsule referred to in all 10 trade mark registrations is a small cylindrical gelatin container made up of two halves intended to contain one measured quantity of some drug or other medicament for human consumption by swallowing the capsule and contents. The band, whether white or one of the other nine colours, is placed around the centre of the capsule at the point where the two halves are joined one into the other. The band is a strip of the same substance as the capsule itself which, when applied, creates a small bulge around the capsule and seals it.\nThe action proceeded to trial upon the following admission:\nADMISSION\nFor the purposes of this action only, the parties hereto admit the following facts:\n1. Before February 18, 1960, the defendant sold in Canada a pharmaceutical preparation identified by it as chloramphenicol in bottles of 100 capsules of which the bottles and its contents marked Exhibit A to the affidavit herein of Thomas V. Grubb, dated February 15, 1960, is a typical sample.\n2. The capsules of chloramphenicol referred to in paragraph 1 sold by the defendant were not manufactured by the defendant but were bought by it from a European supplier in the state in which they are found in the said Exhibit A and were then bottled and labelled by the defendant.\n3. After February 18, 1960, the defendant sold in Canada a pharmaceutical preparation identified by it as chloramphenical in bottles of 100 capsules of which the bottle and their contents identified as Exhibits I and II to this admission are typical samples.\n4. The capsules of chloramphenical referred to in paragraph 3 sold by the defendant were not manufactured by the defendant but were bought by it from a European supplier in the state in which they are found in the said Exhibits I and II and were then bottled and labelled by the defendant.\nBy an interim injunction made on February 18, 1960, the date of the commencement of the action, and by subsequent interlocutory injunctions dated February 23, 1960, March 8, 1960, April 14,1960, and May 17, 1960, the respondent company was restrained until the trial or other disposition of the action from further sale of any pharmaceutical preparaions in association with the appellant's gray banded or green banded trade marks or any trade mark confusing with them.\nThe issues in the action are fully set out in the judgment of No\u00ebl J. as follows:\nAfter the first of the interlocutory orders, the defendant company, subsequent to February 18, 1960, changed over to a green band around its chloramphenicol capsules. Mr. Winters, president of the defendant company, states that a saleswoman from the Joint Marsing Co. came in to see him and showed him some samples of green banded capsules of chloramphenicol. As he put it at p. 82 of the transcript:\nWhen we were ordered to stop selling the gray banded capsules, we said: \"Fine, we are not interested in the colour, we will sell green banded capsules and gave her an order for the green banded chloramphenical capsules\".\nThe plaintiff, therefore, claims that the defendant, by its actions, has infringed its rights in the trade marks registered under number N.S. 148\/37803 (green) and N.S. 148\/37804 (gray), has directed public attention to its pharmaceutical preparations in such a way as to be likely to cause confusion in Canada between the pharmaceutical preparations of the defendant and theirs and has passed off, and enabled others to pass off, its pharmaceutical preparations as and for theirs. It also states that it is apprehensive that if the defendant is restrained from using the green bands it will then begin to use, in association with the sale of its pharmaceutical preparations, one of the other of its registered colour banded marks and, therefore, requests an injunction restraining the defendant from selling, distributing and advertising any pharmaceutical preparations in association with any of the plaintiff's ten registered trade marks, an order directing the defendant to deliver on oath to the plaintiff all such pharmaceutical preparations as may be in the possession or power of the defendant bearing the plaintiff's said trade marks registered under number N.S. 148\/37803 and N.S. 148\/37804 or any trade mark confusing with either of the said trade marks, or alternatively, for the destruction on oath of such pharmaceutical preparations, damages or an account of the profits made by the defendant as to the plaintiff may elect, such further and other relief as the justice of the case requires and, finally, costs. The defendant, on the other hand, denies the plaintiff's allegations made in its statement of claim and adds that the plaintiff is not entitled to the exclusive use of the pharmaceutical preparation known as chloramphenicol and that it is, therefore, entitled to sell in Canada this pharmaceutical preparation.\nAn amended counterclaim granted on January 12, 1961, produced by the defendant, attacks the validity of the plaintiff's ten trade marks in that they would not be distinctive on their face nor capable of distinguishing one preparation from another. The defendant further alleges that the plaintiff's trade marks are distinguishing guises incapable of constituting a trade mark in that the gelatin band encircling the middle of each capsule performs the function of sealing the capsule; that this function is described in U.S.A. patent number 1861047, granted on May 31, 1932, and owned by the plaintiff prior to its expiry and that the plaintiff is thereby estopped from denying that the gelatin band encircling each capsule performs the said function. The defendant adds that bands of coloured gelatin around a gelatin capsule containing a pharmaceutical preparation were incapable of constituting a trade mark and that such bands are incapable of distinguishing particular pharmaceutical preparations. The defendant further states that the plaintiff is attempting to monopolize the process of using this process by registering the said trade marks. He finally urges that it is unlawful or contrary to good practice within the trade to distribute capsules containing chloramphenicol identified solely by a gray band encircling each. It then claims that the ten above mentioned registered trade marks be expunged and finally that it be allowed costs and such further and other relief as this Court may order.\nThe plaintiff never claimed, nor does it now, that it is entitled to the exclusive use of chloramphenicol nor that the defendant cannot sell this product in Canada. What it does say, however, is that defendant cannot sell any of its pharmaceutical products, be it chloramphenicol or any other, under the plaintiff's registered trade marks.\nThe validity of the trade marks may, in my view, be disposed of on the ground that the coloured bands have a functional use or characteristic and cannot, therefore, be the subject of a trade mark.\nThe law appears to be well settled that if what is sought to be registered as a trade mark has a functional use or characteristic, it cannot be the subject of a trade mark. With respect, I agree with Maclean J. when, in Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada, Limited v. The Registrar of Trade Marks1, he said:\nIn my opinion any combination of elements which are primarily designed to perform a function, here, a transparent wrapper which is mois- ture proof and a band to open the wrapper, is not fit subject matter for a trade mark, and if permitted would lead to grave abuses.\nNo\u00ebl J. found as a fact that the gelatin band performed a function. There was ample evidence to support that finding. The appellant's Canadian manager, Mr. William Speed, said in his evidence:\nQ. 4 Forget for the moment any advantages or disadvantages of banding and forget for the moment colouring. Can we agree on one thing and that what a gelatin band does when it is put around a capsule is that it performs the function of sealing the capsule. Is that correct?\nA. It performs the function of sealing the cap to the body.\n* * *\nQ. 1 And in view of the fact that the band is also composed of gelatin it sort of combines with the gelatin cap and body and makes it one whole capsule without any joints in it. Is that correct?\nA. Yes.\nBut in addition to the evidence relied on by No\u00ebl J., there was evidence that the appellant at one time held a United States patent on sealed capsules with similar bands from 1932 until it expired in 1949. The relevant part of that patent read:\nThe present invention relates to capsules for containing measured quantities of materials such as drugs or other medicaments, including liquids, such as oils.\nHeretofore, in enclosing dry materials in the ordinary two-part capsule, there has always been present the possibility and often the probability that the two parts, i.e., the cap and body, may become disengaged and the contents lost. Also, the many attempts to retain liquid material in the ordinary two-part capsule have been without success due to several causes. If the liquid be placed in the capsule without sealing in some manner, the liquid may creep between the two parts and be lost.\nMany attempts at sealing have been restored to, one such being the moistening of the body before applying the cap. This method is unsuccessful due to the shrinkage of the body away from the cap.\nAmong the objects of the present invention is to obviate all of these difficulties and provide the ordinary hardened gelatin capsule with an effective seal and thereby prevent losses of contents whether liquid or solid.\nAnother object is to provide a means of identification of the sealed in contents of such capsules.\n* * *\nIt is also proposed to use different colors of sealing material so as to furnish a visible indication of the identity or general character of the contents and this is believed to be a novel feature in itself.\nNow, having described the invention and the preferred form of embodiment thereof, it is to be understood that the said invention is to be lim- ited, not to the specific details herein described and illustrated, but only by the scope of the claims which follow:\nI claim:\u2014\n1. As a new article of manufacture, a hardened gelatin capsule comprising telescopically engaged body and cap portions, each of uniform diameter throughout its length with oppositely disposed convex rounded ends and a circular band of hardened gelatin of substantially the same solubility as said capsule gelatin, said band being integrally united to both said body and cap and enveloping the annular edge of said cap.\n2. As a new article of manufacture, a hardened gelatin capsule comprising telescopically engaged body and cap portions, each of uniform diameter throughout its length with oppositely disposed convex rounded ends and a circular band of hardened gelatin of substantially the same solubility as said capsule gelatin, said band being integrally united to both said body and cap and enveloping the annular edge of said cap, said band having incorporated therein means for imparting a color contrasting to the color of said body and cap.\n3. As a new article of manufacture, a hardened gelatin capsule comprising telescopically engaged body and cap portions, each of uniform diameter throughout its length with oppositely disposed convex rounded ends and a circular soluble sealing band integrally united to both said body and cap and enveloping the annular edge of said cap.\nThen, after the patent had expired, the appellant registered its 10 trade marks in Canada on September 19, 1950. In this way it sought to perpetuate its monopoly of the patent by applying for registration of the trade marks which, if regularly renewed, may be perpetuated. A similar situation arose in the case of Canadian Shredded Wheat Company v. Kellogg Company et al2\nThe shredded biscuit involved in that case was produced by an apparatus protected by a Canadian patent which expired in 1919. For some years thereafter the appellant continued in fact to enjoy the monopoly in Canada as no rival manufacturers appeared upon the scene. In 1928 the words \"shredded wheat\" were registered as the appellant's trade mark to be applied to the sale of biscuits and crackers and in 1929 the same words were registered with respect to cereal foods.\nLord Russell ((1938) D.L.R.) at p. 150 stated:\n\u2026 There can be little doubt that had the plaintiff, when the patent expired, attempted to register the words \"Shredded Wheat\" as a trade mark for the sale of biscuits and crackers, the application would have met with short shrift. It would be attempting by registering the name of the patented product to prolong the patent monopoly; and this may not be done. And Lord Russell goes on to approve the dictum of Lindley L.J. in Re Palmer's Trade Mark3:\nI do not mean to say that a manufacturer of a patented article cannot have a trade-mark not descriptive of the patented article so as to be entitled to the exclusive use of that mark after the patent has expired; ' for instance, if he impressed on the patented articles a griffin, or some other device; but if his only trade-mark is a word or set of words descriptive of the patented article of which he is the only maker, it appears to me to be impossible for him ever to make out as a matter of fact that this mark denotes him as the maker as distinguished from other makers.\nIn the present case the appellant's patent was not a Canadian but a United States patent, and the learned trial judge held the fact of the appellant having obtained the United States patent was not relevant to the question regarding Canadian trade mark rights and he declined to give any weight to the fact that the appellant had had the United States patent from 1932 to 1949. In the circumstances, it seems to me that the evidence was relevant. We are dealing here with what is essentially a question of fact, namely, have these coloured bands a functional use or characteristic? Evidence that the appellant so considered its bands when it applied for the United States patent in 1932 is surely some evidence that the bands have in fact a functional use.\nIt will not, therefore, be necessary to pass upon the contention that the appellant's trade marks reside in colour alone and cannot be the subject of a valid trade mark.\nThere remains to be dealt with the appellant's passing-off claim.\nSection 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act, 1953, reads:\n7. No person shall\n* * *\n(b) direct public attention to his wares, services or business in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in Canada, at the time he commenced so to direct attention to them, between his wares, services or business and the wares, services or business of another.\nThe learned trial judge, with respect, correctly stated the law and the burden that was on the appellant when he said, quoting from J. B. Williams Company v. H. Bronnley & Company4: What is it necessary for a trader who is plaintiff in a passing off action to establish? It seems to me that in the first place, he must, in order to succeed, establish that he has selected a peculiar\u2014a novel\u2014design as a distinguishing feature of his goods and that his goods are known in the market, and have acquired a reputation in the market by reason of that distinguishing feature, and that unless he establishes that, the very foundation of his case fails.\nThe learned trial judge then proceeded to analyze the relevant law. I find myself so completely in accord with his reasons that I adopt them and his conclusion stated by him as follows:\nI have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff has not successfully discharged the burden of establishing that these trade marks distinguish its wares or indicate their common origin. I am also of the opinion that the plaintiff has not established that the manner in which its goods or wares were done up has become associated in the mind of the consumer or purchaser with its goods or wares and the evidence does not show that these marks have been relied upon by the pharmacists, physicians nor the public who consumes its goods as distinguishing them from all others.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Horwitz & Kertzer, Ottawa.\n1 [1939] Ex.

L'intim\u00e9 et un nomm\u00e9 Dumas se sont introduits de nuit dans la r\u00e9sidence d'un octog\u00e9naire pour le voler. A la faveur d'une obscurit\u00e9 relative, Dumas se dirigea \u00e0 la chambre o\u00f9 se trouvait une valise dans laquelle ils avaient appris que la victime gardait de l'argent, pendant que l'intim\u00e9 entrait dans la chambre o\u00f9 couchait le vieillard. Dumas t\u00e9moigna qu'il entendit un bruit de lutte et qu'il fut appel\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9. Lorsque Dumas se rendit \u00e0 cet appel, la victime \u00e9tait debout et r\u00e9sistait alors que l'intim\u00e9 la retenait contre lui avec une main sur la bouche. Dumas b\u00e2illonna le vieillard, lui attacha les mains derri\u00e8re le dos et lui ligota les pieds. Apr\u00e8s quoi, l'intim\u00e9 coucha la victime sur son lit, et les deux s'empar\u00e8rent de la valise et se sauv\u00e8rent. Dumas d\u00e9clara de plus qu'apr\u00e8s avoir b\u00e2illonn\u00e9 la victime, il sentit sur ses mains quelque chose de liquide et chaud qu'il r\u00e9alisa une fois dehors \u00eatre du sang. Au moment de leur d\u00e9part, le vieillard g\u00e9missait \u00e0 travers son b\u00e2illon. Deux jours plus tard, le vieillard fut trouv\u00e9 gisant pr\u00e8s de son lit, horriblement bless\u00e9 et sans vie, ayant des liens, particuli\u00e8rement aux pieds et \u00e0 la main gauche. L'autopsie r\u00e9v\u00e9la que la victime avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvagement attaqu\u00e9e et que l'h\u00e9morragie et l'asphyxie avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause conjugu\u00e9e de la mort.\nLa preuve de ces faits ainsi que celle des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et suivi l'attentat n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par les t\u00e9moins produits par la d\u00e9fense. La d\u00e9fense a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au jury la possibilit\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s le vol d'autres personnes se seraient introduites dans la maison pour commettre l'assaut qui entra\u00eena la mort de la victime. L'intim\u00e9 ne s'est pas fait entendre comme t\u00e9moin.\nL'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9. Par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel infirma le verdict et ordonna un nouveau proc\u00e8s sur l'accusation telle que port\u00e9e. La Cour d'Appel a retenu deux griefs contre l'adresse du juge: (1) Une d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9e sur l'ivresse aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soumise aux jur\u00e9s; (2) le juge aurait par une application non qualifi\u00e9e de l'art. 21(2) omis de pr\u00e9ciser les r\u00f4les respectifs de l'intim\u00e9 et de Dumas pour d\u00e9cider s'il y avait eu meurtre simple ou qualifi\u00e9. D'o\u00f9 l'appel de la Couronne devant cette Cour en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 598(1)(a) du Code Criminel.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le verdict des jur\u00e9s r\u00e9tabli, les Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nPar la Cour: Aucune preuve de fait ne sugg\u00e8re que la boisson consomm\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 et Dumas les ait rendus incapables de former et ex\u00e9cuter l'intention sp\u00e9cifique ou d'avoir la volont\u00e9 de causer des l\u00e9sions corporelles aux fins de faciliter la perp\u00e9tration du vol ou leur fuite apr\u00e8s l'avoir commis. En l'absence de cette preuve, le juge au proc\u00e8s n'avait pas \u00e0 inviter les jur\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l'ivresse comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. D'ailleurs le procureur de l'accus\u00e9 n'a m\u00eame pas soulev\u00e9 ce moyen devant les jur\u00e9s.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Ne peut \u00eatre retenue, l'objection que le juge au proc\u00e8s aurait laiss\u00e9 les jur\u00e9s sous l'impression que m\u00eame si les blessures mortelles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par Dumas seul, sans aucune assistance de l'intim\u00e9, ils pouvaient trouver ce dernier coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9. Appliquant les directives que l'on trouve dans Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, \u00e0 l'effet que les paroles du juge au proc\u00e8s doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es en regard des faits sp\u00e9ciaux qui sont alors soumis au jury, et consid\u00e9rant la charge comme un tout, ce grief n'est pas bien fond\u00e9. L'entraide de l'intim\u00e9 et de Dumas pour assaillir, b\u00e2illonner et ligoter la victime \u00e9tait un facteur ins\u00e9parablement inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la Couronne fond\u00e9e sur la condition dans laquelle fut trouv\u00e9e la victime et sur le t\u00e9moignage non contredit de Dumas. Plus d'une fois, le juge au proc\u00e8s a insist\u00e9 sur l'obligation de la Couronne de prouver que la mort du vieillard avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par des coups donn\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9 et son compagnon. Aussi bien est-il impossible de dire que les jur\u00e9s ont pu avoir l'impression qu'ils pouvaient trouver l'intim\u00e9 coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9 sans \u00eatre convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'il avait, par son propre fait, caus\u00e9 ou aid\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les blessures entra\u00eenant la mort du vieillard.\nDans les circonstances de cette cause, le juge au proc\u00e8s a validement \u00e9cart\u00e9, comme possible en droit, un verdict de coupable de meurtre simple. Ayant accept\u00e9, comme ils en avaient le droit, le t\u00e9moignage de Dumas sur l'attentat, les jur\u00e9s \u00e9taient in\u00e9vitablement conduits \u00e0 accepter que ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ne pouvait \u00eatre en fait que l'\u0153uvre des deux agresseurs et que C\u00f4t\u00e9 avait, par son propre fait, soit caus\u00e9 ou aid\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les blessures, ce qui faisait du meurtre commis un meurtre qualifi\u00e9.\nLes Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence, dissidents: Le juge au proc\u00e8s a err\u00e9 en laissant les jur\u00e9s sous l'impression que si les blessures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9es soit par l'intim\u00e9 ou soit par Dumas, il importait peu qui des deux les avait inflig\u00e9es, ils pouvaient trouver l'accus\u00e9 coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9. Dans toutes les parties de la charge invoqu\u00e9es par le procureur de la Couronne comme supprimant de l'esprit des jur\u00e9s l'effet de cette erreur, le juge attirait l'attention des jur\u00e9s sur la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'effet que le meurtre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par une tierce personne, apr\u00e8s que l'accus\u00e9 et Dumas aient laiss\u00e9 la victime, peut-\u00eatre bless\u00e9e, mais non mourante. Ces parties de la charge n'\u00e9taient pas destin\u00e9es \u00e0 changer l'impression ant\u00e9rieure qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e aux jur\u00e9s. A l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvent ces passages, l'esprit des jur\u00e9s \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si les blessures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9 et Dumas ou par une tierce personne. On ne trouve dans la charge aucune directive clairement exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'effet que les jur\u00e9s pouvaient trouver l'intim\u00e9 coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9, en opposition \u00e0 un meurtre simple, seulement dans le cas o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient satisfaits que l'intim\u00e9 par son propre fait avait Caus\u00e9 ou aid\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les blessures qui avaient entra\u00een\u00e9 la mort.\nLes dispositions de l'art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code Criminel ne peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es avec succ\u00e8s dans une cause o\u00f9 les jur\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment dirig\u00e9s sur un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la charge qu'ils avaient \u00e0 juger.\nCriminal law\u2014Capital murder\u2014Crime committed during commission of burglary\u2014Trial judge's charge\u2014Whether jury should have been charged as to suggested drunkenness of accused\u2014Whether jury properly instructed as to the distinction between capital and non-capital murder\u2014Whether substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice\u2014New trial ordered by Court of Appeal\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 21(2), 202(a)(i), 202A(2)(b)(i), 592(1)(b)(iii), 598(1)(a).\nThe accused and one Dumas broke into the dwelling-house of an elderly man with the intent to steal. Dumas entered the room containing a valise in which they had learned the victim kept his money. At the same time, the accused went into the room where the victim was sleeping. Dumas testified that he heard noises of a struggle and that the accused called for his help. When Dumas entered that room, the victim was standing and struggling with the accused who was holding him and had a hand on his mouth. Dumas gagged the victim and tied his hands and feet. The accused then laid the victim on his bed and the two companions grabbed the valise and fled. Dumas further declared that after gagging the victim, he felt something liquid and hot on his hands which, when outside, he realized was blood. When they left, the victim was moaning. Two days later the victim was found dead near his bed with his feet and left hand tied. The autopsy revealed that he had been savagely attacked and had died from hemorrhage and asphyxiation.\nThat evidence and the evidence of other incidents which preceded and followed the crime were not contradicted by any defence witnesses. The defence suggested to the jury that the murder was committed by third persons who later came on the scene. The accused was not heard as a witness.\nThe accused was found guilty of capital murder. By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the charge as laid. The Court of Appeal found (1) that the trial judge should have charged the jury as to drunkenness; and (2) that in applying art. 21(2) of the Code the trial judge failed to define the respective parts played by the accused and Dumas in Older for the jury to decide whether there had been capital or non-capital murder. The Crown appealed to this Court pursuant to s. 598(1)(a) of the Code.\nHeld (Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.\nPer Curiam: There was no evidence to suggest that the alcoholic liquor consumed by the accused and Dumas prevented them from forming and executing the specific intention or from having the will to cause bodily harm in order to facilitate the burglary or their subsequent escape. In the absence of such evidence, the trial judge did not have to draw to the attention of the jury the defence of drunkenness. Furthermore, defence counsel did not even raise that defence at the trial.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The objection that the trial judge had left the jury under the impression that even if the bodily harm which caused the death of the victim was inflicted by Dumas alone, without any assistance from the accused, they could find the latter guilty of capital murder, could not be sustained. Applying the directives found in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, that the language of the trial judge must always be considered with regard to the special facts then before the jury, and considering the charge as a whole, this objection was not founded. The mutual aid of the accused and Dumas to assault, gag, and bind the victim was a factor unseparately inherent in the Crown's theory based as it was on the state in which the victim was found and on the uncontradicted testimony of Dumas. More than once, the trial judge insisted on the obligation of the Crown to establish that the death of the victim had been caused by the injuries inflicted by the accused and Dumas. Hence it is impossible to say that the jury could have had the impression that they could find the accused guilty of capital murder without being convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he had, by his own act, caused or assisted in causing the bodily harm from which death ensued. In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge rightly omitted to mention, as possible in law, a verdict of guilty of non-capital murder. Having accepted, as they had the right to do, the testimony of Dumas, the jury were inevitably driven to accept that what had happened was the result of the deeds of both aggressors and that C\u00f4t\u00e9 had, by his own act, either caused or assisted in causing the injuries, which made the murder a capital murder.\nPer Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge erred in leaving the jury with the impression that if the injuries which proved fatal were inflicted by either the respondent or Dumas it was of no importance by which of the two they were inflicted, and they could find the accused guilty of capital murder. In all the passages of the charge referred to by counsel for the Crown, as removing from the minds of the jury the effect of this error, the attention of the jury was being directed to the theory of the defence that the murder was committed by a third person after the accused and Dumas had left the victim, perhaps injured, but not dying. These passages were not intended to alter the previous impression given to the jury. At the stage where these passages occurred, the minds of the jury were being directed to the question whether the fatal injuries were caused by the accused and Dumas or by a third person. Nowhere in the charge was there a clear direction to the jury that they could find the respondent guilty of capital murder, as distinguished from non-capital murder, only if they were satisfied that the accused by his own act had caused or assisted in causing the injuries from which the death of the victim ensued.\nThe provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of The Criminal Code could not be successfully invoked in a case in which the jury have been misdirected as to an essential element of the charge which they were trying.\nAPPEAL d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, Province de Qu\u00e9bec1, ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s sur une charge de meurtre qualifi\u00e9.

Le r\u00e9cit qu'il donne sur le fait m\u00eame de l'attentat, ainsi que des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pertinents qui l'ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et suivi, n'est pas contest\u00e9. Sur le fait m\u00eame de l'attentat commis dans la nuit du 25 au 26 octobre 1961, en la r\u00e9sidence de la victime, Dumas est le seul \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Voici la substance de son t\u00e9moignage: Lui et C\u00f4t\u00e9, sachant que Philippe Raymond, un octog\u00e9naire vivant seul dans sa maison, y gardait de l'argent dans une valise, se sont introduits de nuit dans sa r\u00e9sidence pour le voler. La disposition des lieux leur \u00e9tait connue. A la faveur d'une obscurit\u00e9 relative, Dumas se dirigea \u00e0 la chambre o\u00f9 se trouvait la valise; il heurta une chaise pr\u00e8s de la valise et entendit alors du bruit dans la chambre oppos\u00e9e, o\u00f9 couchait le vieillard. C\u00f4t\u00e9 entra dans cette chambre. Alors que, dans l'autre pi\u00e8ce, Dumas tentait d'ouvrir la valise avec un couteau, il entendit \u00abun bruit de lutte\u00bb. Le vieillard appela \u00e0 l'aide en criant \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises: \u00abOmer\u00bb. D'autre part, C\u00f4t\u00e9 cria \u00e0 Dumas: \u00abViens ici\u00bb. Dumas se rendit \u00e0 la chambre \u00e0 coucher; la victime \u00e9tait debout et r\u00e9sistait alors que C\u00f4t\u00e9 la retenait contre lui et avait une main appuy\u00e9e sur sa bouche. C\u00f4t\u00e9 ayant dit \u00e0 Dumas: \u00abIl faut l'attacher\u00bb, celui-ci se fit des liens en d\u00e9chirant un des v\u00eatements port\u00e9s par la victime, une taie d'oreiller et un coussin qu'il alla chercher sur un sofa dans la cuisine. Puis, il b\u00e2illonna le vieillard, lui attacha les mains derri\u00e8re le dos et lui ligota les pieds. Apr\u00e8s quoi, C\u00f4t\u00e9 coucha la victime sur son lit, et les deux s'empar\u00e8rent de la valise et d\u00e9guerpirent. Dumas d\u00e9clare de plus qu'apr\u00e8s avoir b\u00e2illonn\u00e9 la victime, il sentit sur ses mains quelque chose de liquide et chaud, qu'une fois \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, il r\u00e9alisa \u00eatre du sang. Au moment de leur d\u00e9part, le vieillard g\u00e9missait \u00e0 travers son b\u00e2illon.\nDeux jours plus tard, le 28 octobre 1961, Dolor\u00e8s Raymond, ni\u00e8ce de la victime, s'\u00e9tant rendue \u00e0 la demeure de son oncle, le trouva gisant pr\u00e8s de son lit, horriblement bless\u00e9 et sans vie, ayant des liens, particuli\u00e8rement aux pieds et \u00e0 la main gauche. Elle alerta les autorit\u00e9s polici\u00e8res qui, arriv\u00e9es sur les lieux, constat\u00e8rent la mort de Raymond et la disparition de la valise. L'autopsie r\u00e9v\u00e9la que Raymond avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sauvagement attaqu\u00e9; outre de nombreuses \u00e9raflures, tous les os de la face, ou \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, \u00e9taient fractur\u00e9s en plusieurs morceaux de m\u00eame que plusieurs c\u00f4tes de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du thorax. La trach\u00e9e, les bronches et l'estomac \u00e9taient remplis de sang. Le pathologiste en conclut que l'h\u00e9morragie et l'asphyxie avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause conjugu\u00e9e de la mort.\nA cette preuve sur les d\u00e9tails du fait de l'attentat s'ajoute celle des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui l'ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et suivi, dont, particuli\u00e8rement, les suivants:\u2014 Bien avant le mois d'octobre, C\u00f4t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par un nomm\u00e9 Gauthier du fait que la victime gardait plusieurs milliers de dollars dans une valise en sa r\u00e9sidence; pour cette information, C\u00f4t\u00e9 promit \u00e0 Gauthier une commission de dix pour cent sur le produit du vol envisag\u00e9, ainsi qu'en a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 Denis McMahon, gar\u00e7on de table de l'h\u00f4tel Normandie, qui entendit la conversation entre C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Gauthier sur le sujet; le soir du crime, Dumas, accompagn\u00e9 de C\u00f4t\u00e9, loua d'Yvan Gagnon, \u00e0 Granby, l'automobile dans laquelle ils se rendirent de cet endroit \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de Raymond, \u00e0 St-Nic\u00e9phore; avant leur d\u00e9part, comme durant les quelques arr\u00eats faits au cours de ce voyage de plusieurs milles, des boissons alcooliques furent consomm\u00e9es; en cours de route, Dumas rev\u00eatit des v\u00eatements trouv\u00e9s dans l'automobile de Gagnon et que celui-ci avait oubli\u00e9 d'enlever; arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 St-Nic\u00e9phore, ils stationn\u00e8rent la voiture \u00e0 quelque distance de la maison de Raymond o\u00f9 ils entr\u00e8rent apr\u00e8s avoir enjamb\u00e9 une cl\u00f4ture. Dumas t\u00e9moigne qu'apr\u00e8s l'attentat, la valise vid\u00e9e de l'argent ainsi que les v\u00eatements qu'il avait rev\u00eatus furent abandonn\u00e9s \u00e0 divers endroits le long d'un chemin de terre pris pour le retour \u00e0 Granby; apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9couverte du crime, on retouva ces effets aux diff\u00e9rents endroits indiqu\u00e9s par Dumas. Sur les v\u00eatements, identifi\u00e9s par Gagnon, comme sur la porte avant droite de son automobile, on trouva du sang humain; le 26 octobre, C\u00f4t\u00e9 visita le docteur Dub\u00e9 pour traitement d'un bleu et d'un \u0153d\u00e8me \u00e0 la main droite; enfin, le 26 octobre \u00e9galement, C\u00f4t\u00e9 paya, tel que convenu, une commission \u00e0 Gauthier.\nAucun des faits ci-dessus rapport\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins produits par la poursuite n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par les t\u00e9moins produits par la d\u00e9fense. La preuve offerte par ceux-ci avait pour objet, suivant la d\u00e9claration faite aux jur\u00e9s par l'avocat de l'accus\u00e9 avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la leur faire entendre, de tendre \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la possibilit\u00e9 d'un doute raisonnable en faveur de l'accus\u00e9. Bref, cette preuve rapporte ce qui suit. D'une part, une chicane intervenue en juillet 1960 entre le vieillard et son neveu, Roland Raymond, et, d'autre part, l'opinion d'un m\u00e9decin sur un certain \u00ab\u00e9tat psychique et psychologique\u00bb de l'accus\u00e9. Par le premier de ces faits, la d\u00e9fense entendait sugg\u00e9rer aux jur\u00e9s la possibilit\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s le vol, ce neveu ou d'autres personnes soient\u2014par une \u00e9trange co\u00efncidence\u2014entr\u00e9s dans la maison, entre le 26 et le 28 octobre, pour commettre sur la personne du vieillard l'assaut qui entra\u00eena sa mort. Par l'opinion du m\u00e9decin, on voulut prouver que C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9tait facilement influen\u00e7able. Cette preuve offerte par la d\u00e9fense a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise par le Juge aux jur\u00e9s qui, manifestement, ont refus\u00e9 de l'accepter ou d'y donner suite. Enfin, nonobstant la preuve accablante faite contre lui, l'accus\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame se s'est pas fait entendre comme t\u00e9moin.\nDiff\u00e9rant, pour l'insant, la consid\u00e9ration des deux seuls griefs retenus en appel sur l'adresse du Juge, notons qu'apr\u00e8s avoir instruit les jur\u00e9s que Dumas et Gauthier \u00e9taient des complices, le Juge a plus d'une fois insist\u00e9 pour les pr\u00e9venir du danger qu'il y avait d'accepter leurs t\u00e9moignages et surtout celui de Dumas. Il leur a de plus expliqu\u00e9 les raisons de ce danger. Dans la derni\u00e8re partie de son adresse il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les verdicts qui pouvaient \u00eatre rendus. Il leur a dit qu'\u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable de la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9, ils devaient l'acquitter. S'il a, \u00e0 mon avis, vu l'accusation, erron\u00e9ment indiqu\u00e9, comme possible en droit, un verdict de coupable de vol qualifi\u00e9\u2014ce dont l'accus\u00e9 ne saurait se plaindre\u2014, il a validement, dans les circonstances de cette cause et pour les raisons qui suivent, \u00e9cart\u00e9, comme possible en droit, un verdict de coupable de meurtre simple. Comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le procureur de l'accus\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition de cet appel, la preuve des faits ant\u00e9rieurs et subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 l'attentat ne permet pas, \u00e0 elle seule et sans le t\u00e9moignage de Dumas, de savoir ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 entre la victime et celui ou ceux qui l'ont assaillie, m\u00eame si, dans cette preuve, on trouve par ailleurs une corroboration du t\u00e9moignage de Dumas. De toute \u00e9vidence, les jur\u00e9s, pour pouvoir, comme ils l'ont fait, trouver l'accus\u00e9 coupable, ont accept\u00e9, comme ils en avaient le droit, le t\u00e9moignage de Dumas sur le fait circonstanci\u00e9 de l'attentat. Suivant ce t\u00e9moignage:\u2014C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Dumas \u00e9taient les agresseurs de la victime; une bataille entre celle-ci et C\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9e quand l'assistance de Dumas fut requise par C\u00f4t\u00e9; \u00e9tant alors intervenu pour aider C\u00f4t\u00e9, Dumas se procura les liens dont il se servit pour b\u00e2illonner et ligoter le vieillard qui, encore debout, r\u00e9sistait et criait \u00e0 l'aide pendant que C\u00f4t\u00e9 le retenait. Ces m\u00eames liens on les trouva par la suite attach\u00e9s aux pieds et \u00e0 la main gauche de la victime. Les jur\u00e9s pouvaient-ils raisonnablement concevoir que, pendant que l'un des agresseurs se procurait les liens, qu'il b\u00e2illonnait et ligotait les mains et les pieds de la victime, l'autre demeurait inactif et n'apportait aucune participation en l'affaire. Il reste que les deux se sont entraid\u00e9s dans cet assaut pour ma\u00eetriser, blesser, b\u00e2illonner, garrotter et abandonner, dans cette condition, le vieillard seul dans la nuit, le tout \u00e0 l'occasion et aux fins d'un vol, et que l'un comme l'autre a par son fait soit caus\u00e9 ou, \u00e0 tout le moins, aid\u00e9 l'autre \u00e0 causer les blessures, l'h\u00e9morragie, l'asphyxie entra\u00eenant la mort. Dans les circonstances, l'acceptation par les jur\u00e9s du t\u00e9moignage de Dumas ne pouvait justifier et ne pouvait autoriser le Juge \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer, comme possible en droit, un verdict de meurtre simple, mais uniquement un verdict de meurtre qualifi\u00e9, tel que d\u00e9fini aux dispositions pertinentes des arts. 202, 202A et 288 du Code Criminel. Les jur\u00e9s ne pouvaient rendre un verdict de meurtre simple sous l'art. 202 sans accepter le t\u00e9moignage de Dumas o\u00f9 seulement ils pouvaient trouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette offense. De l\u00e0, ils \u00e9taient in\u00e9vitablement conduits \u00e0 accepter que l'assaut, l'application de b\u00e2illon et de liens, et l'abandon du vieillard, ne pouvaient \u00eatre en fait que l'\u0153uvre des deux agresseurs et que C\u00f4t\u00e9 avait, par son propre fait, soit caus\u00e9 ou aid\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les blessures entra\u00eenant la mort, ce qui faisait du meurtre commis un meurtre qualifi\u00e9, en vertu de l'art. 202A.\nEn Cour d'Appel3, on a reproch\u00e9 au Juge d'avoir, dans son adresse aux jur\u00e9s, omis (i) de leur soumettre un moyen de d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9 sur l'ivresse et (ii) de les inviter \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper des r\u00f4les respectifs de C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Dumas dans l'assaut sur le vieillard pour d\u00e9cider s'il y avait eu meurtre simple ou qualifi\u00e9. M. le Juge Hyde est le seul \u00e0 retenir ces deux reproches; le Juge en chef retient le second et M. le Juge Casey, le premier.\nPremier grief: C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Dumas ont quitt\u00e9 Granby vers 8.30 heures et sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 St-Nic\u00e9phore environ quatre heures plus tard. Peu de temps avant leur d\u00e9part de Granby, comme lors d'un arr\u00eat fait \u00e0 Roxton Falls et un autre \u00e0 Actonvale au cours de ce trajet de plusieurs milles, on a pris quelques consommations de boissons alcooliques. Loin d'indiquer qu'il en soit r\u00e9sult\u00e9 chez C\u00f4t\u00e9 ou Dumas un \u00e9tat d'\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible de supporter un moyen de d\u00e9fense, la preuve manifeste, au contraire, qu'ils ont poursuivi et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 leur projet nonobstant la r\u00e9sistance pr\u00e9visible qu'ils ont rencontr\u00e9e, qu'apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre empar\u00e9s de l'argent, ils se sont d\u00e9barrass\u00e9s de la valise et des v\u00eatements en abandonnant ces effets \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits le long du chemin de terre emprunt\u00e9 pour le retour et qu'ils ont retourn\u00e9 l'automobile de Gagnon, \u00e0 Granby, \u00e0 l'heure dont ils avaient convenu avec lui au d\u00e9but de la soir\u00e9e. Aucune preuve de fait ne sugg\u00e8re que la boisson consomm\u00e9e les ait rendus incapables de former et ex\u00e9cuter l'intention sp\u00e9cifique ou d'avoir la volont\u00e9 de causer des l\u00e9sions corporelles aux fins de faciliter la perp\u00e9tration du vol ou leur fuite apr\u00e8s l'avoir commis. En l'absence de cette preuve, le Juge au proc\u00e8s n'avait pas \u00e0 inviter les jur\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer l'ivresse comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. Le procureur de l'accus\u00e9 n'a m\u00eame pas soulev\u00e9 ce moyen devant les jur\u00e9s. A une question pos\u00e9e par un des membres de cette Cour, il a candidement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment abstenu de ce faire pour pouvoir soulever ce moyen en Cour d'Appel. C'est l\u00e0 une technique dont la justice ne saurait s'inspirer.\nDeuxi\u00e8me grief: Le Juge au proc\u00e8s, dit-on, aurait laiss\u00e9 les jur\u00e9s sous l'impression que m\u00eame si les blessures entra\u00eenant la mort de Raymond avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par Dumas seul, sans aucune assistance de C\u00f4t\u00e9, ils pouvaient trouver ce dernier coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9. Les parties de la charge invoqu\u00e9es au soutien de ce reproche sont reproduites aux raisons de notre coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Cartwright. Certes, ainsi isol\u00e9e du contexte entier de la charge et du contexte de la cause soumise en l'esp\u00e8ce aux jur\u00e9s, et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e in abstracto comme proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de droit, la teneur de certains de ces extraits ne peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9e comme conforme \u00e0 la loi. Dans la critique ad\u00e9quate d'une charge aux jur\u00e9s, il importe cependant, comme l'a not\u00e9 M. le Juge Rivard dans ses raisons de jugement, de retenir et donner effet aux directives suivantes de Lord Birkenhead dans Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard4:\nIn examining the language used in these and later oases it is extremely necessary to bear in mind that the judge when directing the jury with reference to the facts and circumstances of a particular case is not writing in abstracto a treatise upon the criminal law, and that his words must always be considered with regard to the special facts then before the jury.\nAppliquant ces directives \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce et consid\u00e9rant la charge comme Un tout en rattachant la somme des instructions donn\u00e9es par le Juge aux jur\u00e9s aux faits et circonstances plac\u00e9s devant eux, tant par la poursuite que par la d\u00e9fense, et \u00e0 la substance v\u00e9ritable des questions en d\u00e9coulant, je ne puis, en tout respect pour les tenants de l'opinion contraire, conclure au bien-fond\u00e9 de ce grief. L'entraide, en fait, de C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Dumas pour assaillir, b\u00e2illonner, ligoter la victime abandonn\u00e9e seule dans la nuit, \u00e9tait un facteur ins\u00e9parablement inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie de la Couronne fond\u00e9e sur la condition dans laquelle fut trouv\u00e9e la victime le 28 octobre et sur le t\u00e9moignage non contredit de Dumas. Plus d'une fois apr\u00e8s avoir dit ce qu'on lui reproche, le Juge au proc\u00e8s a insist\u00e9 sur l'obligation de la Couronne de prouver que la mort de Raymond avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par des coups donn\u00e9s par C\u00f4t\u00e9 ou par des coups donn\u00e9s par C\u00f4t\u00e9 et son compagnon. Aussi bien m'est-il impossible de dire que les jur\u00e9s aient pu avoir l'impression qu'il \u00e9tait en leur pouvoir de trouver C\u00f4t\u00e9 coupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9 sans \u00eatre convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'il avait, par son propre fait, caus\u00e9 ou aid\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les blessures entra\u00eenant la mort de Raymond.\nA l'audition, bien qu'invit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce faire s'il y avait lieu, le procureur de l'intim\u00e9 ne formula aucun grief additionnel pour supporter le jugement majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine. De plus, alors que la cause \u00e9tait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, la Cour lui permit, \u00e0 sa demande, de fournir un factum suppl\u00e9mentaire, dans lequel, cependant, je n'ai trouv\u00e9 aucun motif de modifier l'opinion ci-dessus exprim\u00e9e.\nDans les circonstances, je maintiendrais l'appel et r\u00e9tablirais le verdict des jur\u00e9s.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014 The relevant facts out of which this appeal arises and the manner in which the matter was dealt with in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)5 are set out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux, which I have had the advantage of reading.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Fauteux I agree with his conclusion that the learned trial judge did not err in omitting to charge the jury in regard to the effect in law of the suggested drunkenness of the respondent.\nThe other ground on which the Court of Queen's Bench held that the conviction of the respondent should be quashed and a new trial directed is set out in the reasons of Tremblay C.J. P.Q. I find myself so fully in accord with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice that I would be content simply to adopt them. However, in view of the differences of opinion in the Court of Queen's Bench and in this Court I shall state my reasons, as briefly as possible.\nThe theory of the Crown was that the respondent was guilty of capital murder by the combined effect of s. 202(a)(i) and s. 202A(2)(6)(i) of the Criminal Code, in that C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Dumas acting together had decided to break into the dwelling-house of Philippe Raymond by night and to steal the money which they had learned was in a valise in the victim's house, that for the purpose of facilitating the commission of this offence and meaning to cause bodily harm to the victim they had inflicted the injuries from ' which his death ensued, and that C\u00f4t\u00e9 by his own act caused or assisted Dumas in causing the bodily harm from which the death ensued.\nThe error in the charge of the learned trial judge which Tremblay C.J. found to be fatal to the validity of the conviction was that the jury were given to understand that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Dumas and C\u00f4t\u00e9 had formed the intention in common to carry out the burglary mentioned above and to assist each other therein and that C\u00f4t\u00e9 knew or ought to have known that the infliction of bodily harm on the victim would be a probable consequence of carrying out that common purpose then C\u00f4t\u00e9 would be guilty of capital murder even if the bodily harm which caused the death was inflicted by Dumas alone and C\u00f4t\u00e9 neither inflicted it nor aided in its infliction.\nThat this was the effect of the charge of the learned trial judge appears from the following passages:\nJe dois vous lire \u00e0 ce sujet, ce que dit l'article 21 au paragraphe (deux) du Code Criminel: \u00abQuand deux ou plusieurs personnes forment ensemble le projet de poursuivre une fin ill\u00e9gale\u00bb, le vol est une fin ill\u00e9gale \u00abet de s'y entraider et que l'une d'entre elles commet une infraction\u00bb en l'occurrence c'est un assaut avec violence, \u00aben r\u00e9alisant cette fin commune, chacune d'elles qui savait ou devait savoir que la r\u00e9alisation de l'intention commune aurait pour cons\u00e9quence probable la perp\u00e9tration de l'infraction, chacune est partie \u00e0 cette infraction\u00bb.\nQuand on va commettre un vol dans une r\u00e9sidence priv\u00e9e, \u00e9videmment on peut bien esp\u00e9rer le faire sans que la personne ou les personnes qui sont l\u00e0 ne se r\u00e9veillent, c'est \u00e9vident, \u00e7a, seulement, je pense bien qu'on peut dire que c'est toujours possible et m\u00eame probable que quelqu'un se r\u00e9veille et alors, \u00e9videmment il y a deux choses qu'on peut faire, que peut faire le voleur, d\u00e9guerpir au plus vite s'il a fini son ouvrage ou bien prendre les moyens pour que la personne ou les personnes qui sont l\u00e0 ne soient pas des obstacles.\nC'est \u00e0 vous messieurs, de dire si l'assaut commis sur le vieillard Raymond \u00e9tait une cons\u00e9quence probable, si l'un comme l'autre de ceux qui y sont all\u00e9s pouvait pr\u00e9voir la probabilit\u00e9 qu'ils auraient \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser le vieillard qui pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9veill\u00e9 \u00e0 leur arriv\u00e9e ou qui pouvait se r\u00e9veiller pendant qu'ils \u00e9taient dans la maison.\nEt, il n'y a pas de probl\u00e8me dans le fait qu'ils soient deux. S'ils \u00e9taient deux et que vous en venez \u00e0 la conclusion qu'ils ont fait ce qu'on leur reproche, que \u00e7a ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par C\u00f4t\u00e9 ou que \u00e7a ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par Dumas quand ils \u00e9taient ensemble, \u00e7a n'a aucune importance. Dumas, au point de vue du Code Criminel serait responsable de tout ce qu'a pu faire C\u00f4t\u00e9, et C\u00f4t\u00e9 serait responsable de tout ce qu'a pu faire Dumas.\nVous savez c'est la cons\u00e9cration du vieux dicton: celui qui tient le sac est aussi coupable que celui qui commet le vol.\n* * *\nVous avez le droit d'asseoir votre verdict uniquement sur la preuve directe faite par Dumas, du moment que vous \u00eates convaincus qu'il a dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 quand il nous dit qu'ils sont all\u00e9s chez Eaymond ce soir-l\u00e0, qu'ils ont vol\u00e9, qu'il y a eu des coups de donn\u00e9s \u00e9videmment, Dumas nous dit qu'il y en a eu plus de donn\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9 que par lui-m\u00eame, c'est un d\u00e9tail, \u00e7a, mais qu'il y a eu des coups de donn\u00e9s.\n* * *\nEn regard de la preuve de circonstances, sans tenir compte de la preuve directe, si cette preuve vous satisfait que C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Dumas sont all\u00e9s chez Raymond, y ont commis un vol et au cours du vol que l'un ou l'autre ou les deux ensemble, ont bless\u00e9 le vieillard avec la cons\u00e9quence que la mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat des coups port\u00e9s, et si cette preuve est telle que dans vos esprits, elle exclut toute possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable que d'autres ont pu faire le coup.\nAlors vous pouvez rendre un verdict contre l'accus\u00e9.\nEt, combien de verdicts messieurs pouvez-vous rendre.\nL'Article 202A, je vous l'ai lu, dit:\u2014 \u00abQue le meurtre est dit qualifi\u00e9\u00bb lorsqu'il tombe, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute personne, lorsqu'il tombe sous le coup de l'Article 202.\u00bb L'Article, sous paragraphe (3) dit: \u00abTout meurtre autre qu'un meurtre qualifi\u00e9 est un meurtre non qualifi\u00e9\u00bb. Mais le premier alin\u00e9a du 202A nous parle du meurtre qualifi\u00e9: \u00abcelui qui est projet\u00e9 et commis de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\u00bb\nCe meurtre, ce n'est pas celui que vous avez \u00e0 juger. Si c'\u00e9tait celui-l\u00e0, je vous dirais que vous pouvez rendre un verdict de meurtre non qualifi\u00e9, dans le cas par exemple o\u00f9 vous ne seriez pas satisfaits que l'accus\u00e9 aurait eu une pr\u00e9m\u00e9ditation suffisante pour constituer un meurtre qualifi\u00e9.\nSeulement, comme il s'agit ici, d'apr\u00e8s la preuve apport\u00e9e par la Couronne, d'un meurtre non qualifi\u00e9 qui tombe sous l'Article 202 et qu'il suffit qu'il y ait eu blessures et mort en r\u00e9sultant le tout accompagn\u00e9 d'un vol qualifi\u00e9 pour que le meurtre soit le meurtre qualifi\u00e9, je crois qu'il n'y a pas de place ici pour un verdict de meurtre ordinaire.\nFor the appellant it is said that the charge must, of course, be read as a whole and that it contains other passages which would remove from the minds of the jury the effect of the error, if error there was, in the passages which I have just quoted.\nThe following portions of the charge are referred to and particular emphasis is laid upon the phrases which I have italicized:\nPar ailleurs messieurs, je dois tenir compte, je dois dire que j'y ai pens\u00e9 pas mal, je dois tenir compte de la th\u00e9orie prouv\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense, th\u00e9orie qui serait celle-ci et sur laquelle \u00e9videmment je vous l'ai dit la d\u00e9fense a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute raisonnable. La Couronne est oblig\u00e9e de prouver que la mort est le r\u00e9sultat des coups port\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9 et son compagnon. L\u00e0-dessus, vous avez le m\u00e9decin, et vous avez \u00e9videmment le fait que le vieux \u00e9tait un vieillard qui \u00e9tait tout seul, qui vivait solitaire, il n'y a pas de toute, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9, ligot\u00e9 enfin.\nLa suggestion que l'on vous fait, bas\u00e9e sur une certaine preuve du moins, c'est qu'on aurait laiss\u00e9 le vieillard bien vivant, non pas en danger de mort et que \u00e7a serait une autre personne qui serait venue le tuer, disons le mot \u2026\nL\u00e0-dessus, si vous avez un doute raisonnable, apr\u00e8s avoir bien pes\u00e9 la preuve et que vous pensez qu'il y a place pour un doute raisonnable l\u00e0dedans, c'est votre affaire, et bien, je crois qu'il y aurait lieu, dans ce cas-l\u00e0 seulement, j'insiste, dans ce cas-l\u00e0 seulement, la Couronne n'aurait pas satisfait vos esprits hors de tout doute raisonnable que la mort \u00e0 r\u00e9sult\u00e9 des coups donn\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9.\nEt il faudrait que vous en veniez \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a quelque chose dans la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense, qu'un autre serait venu le finir.\nSi vous \u00eates de l'opinion que le vieillard est rest\u00e9 seul dans la maison et que personne n'est all\u00e9 lui donner d'autres coups pour le tuer et qu'il est mort soit au bout d'une heure, ou deux heures, ou d'une journ\u00e9e, \u00e7a n'a pas d'importance, des suites, quand bien m\u00eame qu'il serait mort de faim, parce qu'il \u00e9tait attach\u00e9, ou de la perte de son sang, des suites des coups donn\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9, messieurs, \u00e7a c'est du meurtre.\n* * *\nMais si vous entretenez un doute sur la th\u00e9orie apport\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense, un doute raisonnable que quelqu'un est all\u00e9 apr\u00e8s, alors que le vieillard n'\u00e9tait pas en danger de mort, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 bless\u00e9, \u00e9videmment, mais rien de grave, qu'il ne serait pas mort, et que cette autre personne est venue le finir, bien alors l\u00e0, il faudrait en conclure que la mort n'est pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9e des coups donn\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, mais que la mort est r\u00e9sult\u00e9e des coups donn\u00e9s par une tierce personne.\n* * *\nSi vous avez un doute quant \u00e0 la suggestion apport\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense, et vous pouvez en tenir compte de cette suggestion-l\u00e0 en autant que dans la preuve vous trouvez des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour vous baser, alors si vous avez un doute l\u00e0-dessus, ce serait que la Couronne n'a pas prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 votre satisfaction que la mort est le r\u00e9sultat des coups donn\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9 et dans ce cas-l\u00e0, il resterait quoi? Il resterait le fait qu'on est all\u00e9 voler le vieillard qu'on l'a frapp\u00e9 mais que possiblement ce sont d'autres qui sont all\u00e9s le finir.\nSi c'est l\u00e0, votre sentiment, messieurs, vous avez le droit de rapporter un verdict de vol qualifi\u00e9.\n* * *\nCoupable de vol qualifi\u00e9 ce serait si vous n'\u00eates pas satisfaits hors de tout doute raisonnable que la mort est le r\u00e9sultat \u2026 mais l\u00e0-dessus par exemple j'ai bien dit si vous \u00eates convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'aucun \u00e9tranger n'est intervenu apr\u00e8s les coups port\u00e9s par l'accus\u00e9 et son compagnon, pour finir le vieillard.\u2026\n(The suggestion in the two last quoted passages that the respondent could be convicted of robbery is wrong in law, being contrary to the provisions of s. 569(2) of the Criminal Code, but this error is not relevant to the question now under discussion.)\nI am unable to accept this argument of the appellant. In all these passages the attention of the jury is being directed to the theory of the defence that the murder was committed by third persons who came on the scene after C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Dumas had left the victim, perhaps injured, but not dying.\nI am not satisfied that these portions of the charge would alter the impression previously given to the jury that if the injuries which proved fatal were inflicted by either C\u00f4te or Dumas it was of no importance by which of the two they were inflicted. As I read the charge, they were not intended to have this effect; at this stage of the charge, the minds of the jury were being directed to the question whether the fatal injuries were caused (i) as the Crown submitted, by C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Dumas or (ii) as the defence suggested, by third persons.\nIt was in the part of his charge dealing with the theory of the defence that the learned trial judge said:\nSi vous croyez que personne n'est intervenu, je ne crois pas qu'il y ait de place pour un verdict de meurtre ordinaire parce que l'intention n'a rien \u00e0 faire dans \u00e7a.\nNowhere in the charge was there a clear direction to the jury that they could find the respondent guilty of capital murder, as distinguished from non-capital murder, only if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he, C\u00f4t\u00e9, by his own act either caused or assisted in causing the injuries from which the death of the victim ensued. This was, in my opinion, a fatal omission.\nOn the question whether, notwithstanding the errors in the charge to the jury, it can be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred I agree with what was said by Tremblay C.J. The provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code cannot, in my opinion, be successfully invoked in a case in which the jury have been misdirected as to an essential element of the charge which they are trying. To hold otherwise would be to substitute, in a capital case, the decision of an appellate Court for the verdict of a properly instructed jury. For the reasons given by Tremblay C.J. and those set out above, I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppel maintenu et verdict des jur\u00e9s r\u00e9tabli, les Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur de l'appelante: L.

This being so, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not there had been defaults as alleged in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the notice.\nIn my opinion, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, appellants: A.

Yukon Air Service Limited (Defendants).\n1963: May 15, 17; 1964: March 23.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nExecutors and administrators\u2014Direction in will to sell testator's shares in company for cash and to first offer them to person or persons holding other shares in company\u2014Whether right of first refusal given to only other shareholder\u2014Whether contract to sell to another party binding.\nJudgments and orders\u2014Alternative remedies\u2014Judgment not entered\u2014Jurisdiction of trial judge to recall original judgment and substitute another.\nDamages\u2014No interference by Supreme Court with amount allowed by Court of appeal unless error of principle on part of latter.\nA clause in a testator's will directed his trustees to sell his shares (which constituted 49 per cent of the issued shares) in an air service company \"for cash at any price which they in their uncontrolled discretion deem reasonable\" and further directed them \"to first offer my shares \u2026 to the person or persons holding other shares in the company at my death, with such person or persons to have a reasonable and just opportunity in which to accept or reject the offer to purchase my said shares.\" The respondents S and G were the executors named in the will and the respondent B, who held 2 per cent of the issued shares as trustee for the testator, was the solicitor of the estate. One K held the remaining 49 per cent of the issued share capital. K made offers for the testator's shares which were refused by the executors. After rejecting what was specified by K as his final offer, the executors and B entered into an agreement with the appellant W to sell the shares to him. K's solicitors, acting on K's behalf, then sent a letter to the executors which read in part \"\u2026 exercising our right of first refusal \u2026 we hereby agree to match the best offer that you are proposing to accept \u2026\" As the result of an action instituted by K, an interim injunction was granted restraining the estate from offering for sale, disposing of or otherwise dealing with the shares. B and the executors thereupon proceeded to sell the shares to K.\nOn hearing that B and the executors were not going to complete the sale of the shares to him, W commenced an action claiming specific performance, damages for breach of contract and costs. The trial judge gave judgment for specific performance, damages in the sum of $6,000 and costs. However, the formal judgment was not entered. W applied to the trial judge to reopen the case to substitute a judgment for damages and not for specific performance on the grounds that a decree for specific performance was no longer an adequate remedy. The trial judge directed that his original judgment be reconsidered and, following argument by counsel, gave judgment against the respondents as executors of the estate and also against the said respondents personally for damages in the sum of $40,000. On appeal, the Court of Appeal sustained the judgment against the respondents as executors but reduced the damages to $12,000. The appeal was allowed insofar as judgment had been given against the respondents personally.\nW appealed to this Court to have restored the award of $40,000 damages given him by the trial judge. The respondents cross-appealed to have the action dismissed or alternatively to have the damages awarded to the appellant by the Court of Appeal further reduced.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored except insofar as it directed that the appellant recover damages and costs from S and G in their personal capacities. The cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court agreed with the Court of Appeal in rejecting the respondents' contention that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to reopen the trial and to give the judgment for damages on the grounds that the appellant had elected to claim specific performance, and, having been given judgment for specific performance, he was bound thereby. United Australia, Ld. v. Barclays Bank, Ld., [1941] A.C. 1; Dobson v. Winton and Robbins Ltd., [1959] S.C.R. 775, followed.\nThe clause in the will directing the executors to first offer the shares to the person or persons holding other shares in the company did not give K a right of first refusal. He was the only person who, in fact, qualified as a person holding other shares, but there might well have been two or more such other persons for the clause specifically said \"to the person or persons\". A right of first refusal could not be given to two or more such persons, and was not, in fact, given to K. There was no doubt as to the power of the executors to sell to the appellant after they had duly considered and rejected K's offer expressly stated by him to be his final offer. An additional ground upon which the executors were precluded from asserting that they were bound to accept K's offer was the fact that the said offer was not a cash offer. The will had specifically directed the executors to sell for cash. Accordingly, as held by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, there was a binding contract to sell the shares to the appellant.\nAs to the quantum of damages, this Court would not interfere with an amount allowed for damages by the Court of last resort in a province unless there was error in principle on the part of the Court of Appeal in reducing the amount of damages. In this case there were errors of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal in reducing the amount of damages. Having regard to all the circumstances and the matters which the trial judge took into account in arriving at the amount of $40,000, it could not be said that in assessing the damages the trial judge applied a wrong principle of law or that the amount was so high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld., [1951] A.C. 601; Lang and Joseph v. Pollard and Murphy, [1957] S.C.R. 858, applied.\nAPPEAL by plaintiff and cross-appeal by defendants from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, sustaining a judgment against the defendants as executors but reducing the amount of damages and allowing an appeal from judgment against the defendants personally. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nW. A. McGillivray, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. F. Moir, Q.C., and J. P. Brumlik, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014On July 3, 1962, the appellant Widrig recovered judgment in an action tried by Milvain J. against the respondents John W. D. Buchanan, Shirley Mae Strazer and Lloyd W. Gardiner, the Public Trustee of the Province of Alberta, as executors of the estate of Richard R. Strazer and also against the said Shirley Mae Strazer, Lloyd W. Gardiner and John W. D. Buchanan personally for damages in the sum of $40,000. The action against two other defendants Harold Komish and B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited was dismissed without costs. The defendants Buchanan, Strazer and Gardiner appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta2 which Court sustained the judgment against the defendants as executors but reduced the damages to $12,000. The appeal was allowed insofar as judgment had been given against the said Buchanan, Strazer and Gardiner personally.\nThe appellant Widrig has appealed to this Court to have restored the award of $40,000 damages given him by Milvain J. The respondents Buchanan, Strazer and Gardiner have cross-appealed to have the action dismissed or alternatively to have the damages awarded to the appellant by the Court of Appeal further reduced.\nThe facts and circumstances giving rise to this litigation are unusual and complicated.\nOne Richard R. Strazer died on November 15, 1960. A grant of probate of his will issued on June 29, 1961, to the executors named therein, the respondent Shirley Mae Strazer and the Public Trustee of the Province of Alberta. The respondent Lloyd W. Gardiner is and was at all material times the Public Trustee for the Province of Alberta.\nPrior to his death the said Richard R. Strazer was the owner of 49 per cent of the issued shares in the company B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited. The respondent Buchanan held 2 per cent of the issued shares as trustee for Richard R. Strazer. The said Komish held the remaining 49 per cent of the issued share capital. Buchanan was at all times solicitor for the Strazer estate.\nClause (c) of the will of the deceased Richard R. Strazer provided:\nI direct my trustees to sell my shares in B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited for cash at any price which they in their uncontrolled discretion, deem reasonable. I further direct my trustees to first offer my shares in B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited to the person or persons holding other shares in the company at my death, with such person or persons to have a reasonable and just opportunity in which to accept or reject the offer to purchase my said shares.\nFollowing the death of Richard R. Strazer, the operations of the company, B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited (an Alberta company) based at Watson Lake in the Yukon Territory continued under the management of Komish. That was the state of affairs when in July of 1961 Widrig, who was an experienced and licensed pilot, became interested in purchasing the 51 per cent of the issued share capital in the company from the executors and Buchanan. He had been employed as a pilot by the company during the years 1953, 1954 and until the fall of 1955. His father-in-law, one G. C. F. Dalziel, had been the founder of the company but in 1961 had no interest in the company, having sold out his interest a year or two before. It was through Dalziel that Widrig learned that the majority share holdings in the company might be for sale.\nHaving heard this, he went to Watson Lake about July 10th and there he saw Mrs. Strazer who told him she was very anxious to sell the controlling shares in the company held by the estate of her late husband. Mrs. Strazer told Widrig that Buchanan was her solicitor and that she would have Buchanan communicate with him. Widrig returned to Seattle. He had a 'phone call from Buchanan about July 18th. He received a letter from Buchanan inviting him to come to Edmonton to meet with Mrs. Strazer who would come from Watson Lake.\nWidrig went to Edmonton the following week. He met with Buchanan and Mrs. Strazer on July 27th. He then was told that there was a provision in Strazer's will that before the shares could be sold they would first have to be offered to Komish and Komish given a reasonable opportunity to come forward with an offer. Widrig was not shown a copy of the will. He was told, however, that Komish had been informed of his interest in the shares and had been asked to come forward with an offer before July 31st. On the following day, July 28th, Widrig met Gardiner with Buchanan and Mrs. Strazer and was advised by them that Komish had requested more time and that he had been given until August 15th to come forward with an offer.\nWidrig thereupon returned to Seattle. He kept in touch with Buchanan by 'phone. With Buchanan's encouragement he returned to Edmonton on August 14th. He saw Buchanan on the 15th and was told by him that Komish had made several offers but that these offers were inadequate and the executors were now perfectly free to deal with him.\nWidrig then made certain offers which were not accepted, the principal difficulty being whether he could find the cash to purchase the shares. He had $10,000 of his own available. The executors had to sell for cash as directed by Strazer's will. Widrig went to Watson Lake where he arranged to borrow $50,000 from his father-in-law Dalziel, the former owner of the company. He returned to Edmonton on August 24th. He was then in a position to offer $60,000 cash for the shares. Widrig in his testimony tells how the deal progressed from that point:\nA. Well, after I made that offer he said, he advised me that there was liability from the company to the estate in the amount of slightly over $20,000 and that if I would go another fifteen or twenty thousand dollars they would assign that over to me, make it part of the same deal and I told him I couldn't get any more cash but I would certainly be willing to give them promissory notes for the balance and, so, with a little negotiation we finally arrived at a purchase price for the shares and that liability of $75,000, ten thousand cash and promissory notes for $15,000.\nQ. Yes.\nA. And when we reached that point he, Mr. Buchanan telephoned, while I was there, Mr. Gardiner and just made the proposal briefly to him and from what I gathered from the conversation that was fine. Then Mr. Buchanan advised me that his office would draft up some agreements for signature and that, as we had outlined our deal there and advised me to come back in a couple of hours and look them over.\n* * *\nQ. Mr. McGillivrat: Yes, sir, go ahead.\nA. So I returned back to Mr. Buchanan's office a short time later, several hours later and the agreements were prepared and he said, well, let us take them over to Mr. Gardiner's office, we will show them to him and if he approves of them you can take them over then to your solicitor's office, Mr. Becker, and if he approves of them you can sign them with him as a witness and bring them back. So, we did that and I walked over with him to Mr. Gardiner's office, he took them in to Mr. Gardiner, showed them to him and from what I gathered Mr. Gardiner was in accord with the proposal as set forth in the agreement. And Mr. Buchanan then gave me the agreements and asked me to take them over to my solicitor and have him read them and if they were satisfactory to sign them.\n* * *\nA. The agreements called for $10,000 down which I then gave to Mr. Buchanan who gave me a receipt for the $10,000 and he said, well, that is it, it is a deal, you might as well go to Watson Lake for good and you can take the agreements with you and have Mrs. Strazer sign them when you get there and return them to me on Monday's plane, which would be the next plane, and Mr. Gardiner and I both will sign them and we'll schedule a directors' meeting for Thursday, that would be August the 31st, at which time we will officially appoint you as manager and transfer the shares on the books of the company.\n* * *\nQ. By the way, you had, how many copies of the agreement that you signed were there?\nA. It was prepared in four copies, I had signed the copies he prepared, in a large envelope with a return address that I was to mail them back to him in and, I believe, he also wrote an accompanying letter to Mrs. Strazer which he sealed and gave to me to give to her. That letter reads:\nWe are enclosing herewith the original and three copies of an agreement between the Estate and Mr. Widrig covering the sale of shares, etc. to him.\nLengthy discussions took place today between our Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Widrig and later between our Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Gardiner. The upshot of the discussions was that Mr. Widrig put forward an offer to purchase the estate's shares in B.C. Yukon and the estate's debt due from B.C. Yukon for a total price of $75,000, this amount to be paid in the manner set out in the enclosed agreement.\nMr. Widrig's offer will result in the estate receiving $60,000 cash immediately. The remaining $15,000 is secured by two Promissory Notes on which Mr. Dalziel is a co-signer. From the writer's and your own knowledge of Mr. Dalziel we would feel that the $15,000 is well secured.\nBy dealing with Mr. Widrig the estate will be free to collect from Mr. Komish the personal liability of approximately $10,000 which he owes the estate. As soon as the sale to Mr. Widrig is finalized it is our intention to make a formal demand on Mr. Komish for the payment of the amount due from him.\nAfter you have perused the agreement enclosed and given this matter your consideration we would appreciate your signing the agreement in the presence of a witness (Burns McEathron would be a good witness) and return all copies of the agreement to us in the envelope provided.\nWe might add that it is Mr. Widrig's hope that Mr. Dalziel will arrange further financing so that the two Promissory Notes totalling $15,000 can be eliminated and the total of $75,000 paid in cash. If this is done, you might amend Clause 2(b) to read $65,000 and strike out Clauses 2(c) and 2(d). If these changes in the agreement are made they should be initialled by yourself and Mr. Widrig.\nWe are handing this letter to Mr. Widrig who is going up by plane tomorrow. If everything works out according to plan all documents necessary should come down on Monday's plane and we would be in a position to finalize the transaction on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.\nWe will keep you posted as to developments.\nAlthough we would be pleased to see you again it does not seem necessary for you to come into Edmonton at this time. Should there be anything arise, though, you might contact our Mr. Buchanan by telephone.\nWidrig took the letter containing the documents to Watson Lake. Mrs. Strazer signed the documents and they were returned by 'plane on August 28th.\nOn August 30th, Widrig 'phoned Buchanan who acknowledged receipt of the documents. He was advised by Buchanan that the $50,000 had been received and a court order approving of the sale had been obtained, the agreements had been signed and that \"the matter was finished\". The following day, August 31st, Widrig received a 'phone call from Buchanan telling him that the directors of the company were holding a meeting at which Komish's solicitor had appeared but that the sale to him (Widrig) was completely finished and he was being appointed as manager of the company. Widrig did receive the following telegram later that same day:\nYou are employed as manager of B.C. Yukon Air Service effective immediately copy of minutes being forwarded by mail Mr. Komish has been advised.\nJ. W. D. Buchanan Secretary.\nThe agreements had in fact been signed and approval obtained from the Court to the sale on August 30th. Buchanan denied having told Widrig that the agreements had been signed. The learned trial judge accepted Widrig's evidence in preference to that of Buchanan and, in my opinion, was justified on the evidence in doing so. Having received that wire, Widrig attempted to take control of the company's operations at Watson Lake but this was resisted by Komish. Eventually the R.C.M.P. were called in but Widrig found it impossible to take over due to Komish's interference.\nThings continued in this state until September 5th when Widrig wired Buchanan as follows:\nDue circumstances beyond my control I hereby resign as manager B.C. Yukon Air Service effective immediately stop Komish assuming control\nRalph Widrig\nMeanwhile, on September 1st, Widrig had received the following telegram:\nTake notice that by an injunction order of the Honourable Mr. Justice M. E. Manning the Estate of Richard Strazer is restrained from offering for sale disposing of or otherwise dealing with its shares in B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited You are also so restrained by such order\nMorrow Hurlburt Reynolds Stevenson and Kane.\nThe injunction referred to in this letter was obtained from Mr. Justice Manning on September 1st in an action instituted by Komish naming Widrig as one of the defendants. Messrs. Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson and Kane were Komish's solicitors. The injunction provided, amongst other things, that:\nIT IS ORDERED that the Defendants and each of them, their agents and employees, be enjoined until the determination of this action from offering for sale, disposing of, transferring or otherwise dealing with the shares of B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited held by the late Richard Robert Strazer. We must now go back in time to the events after August 15th which preceded the granting of this injunction at the suit of Komish.\nKomish had made offers for the shares which had been refused by the executors. The situation as of August 14th is shown by exhibit no. 37 sent August 14th and which reads:\n\"19\"\nAugust 14th, 1961.\n(Date Stamp: RECEIVED\nAUG 14 1961)\nMessrs.

This is our client's final offer.\nYours very truly,\nWGM\/es MORROW, HURLBURT, REYNOLDS, STEVENSON\n& KANE\nPer: \"W. G. Morrow\"\ncc. H. Komish, Esq. The alterations and deletions as they appear in the foregoing were made by Komish's solicitor on August 19th when, having been advised by Buchanan that the offer was not acceptable, amended the letter as it now appears. Although other parts were changed or deleted, it is important to note that the final sentence \"This is our client's final offer\" remained.\nIt was after rejecting this final offer by Komish that the executors and Buchanan proceeded to sell the shares to Widrig.\nWhile the company's directors were concluding the sale to Widrig on August 31st, Komish's solicitor appeared at the meeting, and, on being told that the shares were being sold to Widrig, he produced and left with Buchanan the following letter:\nAugust 31st, 1961\n(Date Stamp: \"RECEIVED\nAUG 31 1961\")\nThe Public Trustee,\nThe Executor of the Estate of\nRichard R. Strazer and\nJ. W. Buchanan.\nDear Sirs: Re: B.C. YUKON AIR SERVICE LIMITED\nOn behalf of our client, Harold Komish, and exercising our right of first refusal under the Will of the above deceased, we hereby agree to match the best offer that you are proposing to accept, and hereby agree to purchase on the same basis, same price and same terms in all respects.\nYours truly,\nMORROW, HURLBURT, REYNOLDS, STEVENSON & KANE,\nWGM\/ns\nPer: \"W. G. Morrow\"\nKomish on September 1st instituted the action previously mentioned and obtained the injunction from Mr. Justice Manning referred to above. Buchanan and the executors thereupon proceeded to sell the shares to Komish, the deal being concluded on or about September 29th.\nOn hearing that Buchanan and the executors were not going to complete the sale of the shares to him, Widrig commenced this action on September 22nd claiming specific performance, damages for breach of contract and costs.\nMilvain J., at the conclusion of the trial, gave judgment on June 11, 1962, for specific performance, damages in the sum of $6,000 and costs. There was also to be an accounting to determine the company's indebtedness to the Strazer estate. However, the formal judgment was not entered.\nIn this situation, counsel for Widrig applied to Milvain J. on June 27, 1962, to reopen the case to substitute a judgment for damages and not for specific performance on the grounds that a decree for specific performance was no longer an adequate remedy having regard to the time that had elapsed with Komish in control of the company and which would elapse while an appeal was being disposed of.\nMilvain J. directed that the judgment delivered by him on June 11th be reconsidered. Following argument by counsel, the learned trial judge delivered the judgment referred to in the opening paragraph hereof.\nThe respondents argued in the Court of Appeal and in this Court that Milvain J. had no jurisdiction to reopen the trial and to give the judgment for damages on the grounds that Widrig had elected to claim specific performance and, having been given judgment for specific performance, he was bound thereby. The Court of Appeal rejected this contention. With respect, I agree with Johnson J.A. when he said that the argument is answered by a passage from the judgment of Lord Atkin in United Australia, Ld. v. Barclays Bank, Ld.3:\n\"I therefore think that on a question of alternative remedies no question of election arises until one or other claim has been brought to judgment. Up to that stage the plaintiff may pursue both remedies together, or pursuing one may amend and pursue the other: but he can take judgment only for the one, and his cause of action on both will then be merged in the one.\"\nA claim for damages was in the prayer for relief in the statement of claim. The trial judge's right to recall his original judgment and substitute another was settled, if in fact there was any doubt about his right to do so, by the case of Re Harrison's Settlement, [1955] 1 All E.R. 185. See also Stevenson v. Dandy, (1918), 14 A.L.R. 99 (a judgment of this Division). No election therefore took place until the later judgment was signed and entered.\nThe statement by Judson J. in Dobson v. Winton and Robbins Ltd.4, which reads:\nOn the purchaser's repudiation of the contract, the vendor could have forfeited the deposit and claimed for loss of bargain and out-of-pocket expenses. The Judicature Act gives him the right to join this claim with one of specific performance. At some stage of the proceedings he must, of course, elect which remedy he will take. He cannot have both specific performance and a common law claim for loss of bargain. But he is under no compulsion to elect until judgment, and the defendant is not entitled to assume that by issuing the writ for specific performance with a common law claim for damages in the alternative, the vendor has elected at the institution of the action to claim specific performance and nothing else.\nput this question of election beyond doubt.\nThe learned trial judge found that a binding agreement was completed between Widrig and the executors and Buchanan as of August 30th. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nHowever, the power of the executors to enter into the agreement was questioned in this Court. The issue arises out of the clause in Strazer's will previously quoted and which reads:\nI direct my trustees to sell my shares in B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited for cash at any price which they in their uncontrolled discretion, deem reasonable. I further direct my trustees to first offer my shares in B.C. Yukon Air Service Limited to the person or persons holding other shares in the company at my death, with such person or persons to have a reasonable and just opportunity in which to accept or reject the offer to purchase my said shares.\nIt was contended on behalf of Komish that this clause gave Komish a right of first refusal and the right to match the best offer that the executors had received from Widrig.\nI do not read the clause in question as giving Komish a right of first refusal. As the situation stood in August 1961, the will directed the executors to first offer the shares to the person or persons holding other shares in the company. Komish was the only person who, in fact, qualified as a person holding other shares, but there might well have been two or more such other persons for the clause specifically says \"to the person or persons\". A right of first refusal could not be given to two or more such persons, and was not, in fact, given to Komish. Komish was offered the shares. He asked for and was given further time to make his offer and it was not until his final offer contained in exhibit 37 as amended by his solicitor on August 19th had been rejected that the executors proceeded to sell to Widrig. I entertain no doubt as to the power of the executors to sell to Widrig after they had duly considered and rejected Komish's offer expressly stated by him to be his final offer.\nThere is another ground upon which the executors are in my view precluded from asserting that they were bound to accept Komish's offer which was in fact so near in amount to Widrig's as to be substantially the same. The will of the deceased Strazer specifically directed the executors to sell the shares for cash. Komish's offer of August 14th, as amended on August 19th, was not a cash offer. In his first alternative, he was offering to put up $30,000 cash and the balance subject to an hypothecation arrangement within 60 days, and in his second alternative, he was offering $25,000 cash and $60,000 within six months. Widrig's offer, on the other hand, was a cash offer for the shares. The $60,000 put up by him was more than the value of the shares which had been fixed at $55,000. The balance of his offer was to cover the indebtedness of the company to the Strazer estate in an amount of $20,671.24 which was being assigned to him.\nThe judgment of Milvain J. and of the Court of Appeal that there was a binding contract to sell the shares to Widrig must, therefore, be sustained.\nThere remain for consideration the appeal and the cross-appeal as to the quantum of the damages.\nThe Court of Appeal reduced the trial judge's award of $40,000 to $12,000. The right of the Court of Appeal to review a trial judge's award is governed by well-settled principles as stated by Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld.5, as follows:\nWhether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nUnless there was error of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal, this Court will not interfere with an amount allowed for damages by the court of last resort in a province. I adopt what Cartwright J., speaking for himself and Taschereau J. (as he then was) said in Lang and Joseph v. Pollard and Murphy6:\nUnder these circumstances where no error of principle and no misapprehension of any feature of the evidence is indicated I think that the rule which we should follow is that stated by Anglin J., as he then was, giving the unanimous judgment of the Court, in Pratt v. Beaman [1930] S.C.R. 284 at 287:\nThe second ground of appeal is that the damages allowed for pain and suffering by the trial judge, $1,500, should not have been reduced, as they were on appeal, to $500. While, if we were the first appellate court, we might have been disposed not to interfere with the assessment of these damages by the Superior Court, it is the well established practice of this court not to interfere with an amount allowed for damages, such as these, by the court of last resort in a province. That court is, as a general rule, in a much better position than we can be to determine a proper allowance having regard to local environment. It is, of course, impossible to say that the Court of King's Bench erred in principle in reducing these damages.\nThis decision was followed in the unanimous judgment of this Court, delivered by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Hanes et al. v. Kennedy et al., [1941] S.C.R. 384 at 387.\nThe principle appears to me to be equally applicable whether the first appellate Court has increased or decreased the general damages awarded at the trial.\nIn my view there were errors of principle on the part of the Court of Appeal in reducing the amount of the damages. The Court of Appeal appears to have equated share control of the company with a partnership in which the parties share control of a business. The two situations are not comparable. Widrig was desirous of acquiring control of the company because he was an experienced pilot and would have continuous employment in a going concern which had certain flying rights and which showed every indication of being a profitable undertaking. Widrig knew the company's potentialities. He had been employed as one of its pilots and was experienced in the specialized nature of the company's operations. Johnson J.A. appears to have overlooked these considerations in referring to Widrig's lack of experience in relation to this type of business. Widrig had been looking for an opportunity to get into this kind of business. He had looked as far as Australia for a suitable situation or opportunity to get into the commercial flying business. He was justified in not going away from Alberta while there was a reasonable chance that he would get control of the company. Also, in giving the weight which the Court did to the price actually paid by Komish for the shares, it overlooked that Komish was interested only in meeting Widrig's offer and not in making an objective offer based on his own ideas of the actual value of the shares which he was so anxious to obtain and which he got under the threat of litigation. It is of interest that when Komish took the action before referred to in which the injunction was obtained that resulted in Widrig being pushed aside and the shares sold to Komish, he, Komish, claimed $100,000 damages in lieu of the shares in question. That claim was, no doubt, somewhat exaggerated but it shows that Komish placed a high value on these shares when he was contending for them.\nJohnson J.A. placed some importance on the fact that the net average profit of the company for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961 was $10,250. I am unable to reconcile this figure with the total of $36,900.29 which he gives for the three-year period which works out at an average of $12,300 a year. In any event, he appears to have overlooked that the figures for these three years were arrived at after depreciation allowances had been deducted which were not in fact reflected in the actual value of the aircraft. The income figures, after paying $10,372.94 income tax for these three years, before deducting depreciation were $42,063.10 for 1959, $37,329.47 for 1960 and $41,912.22 for 1961. These figures are indicative of the earning capacity of the company as a going concern and this is what Widrig was acquiring in buying share control of the company.\nHaving regard to all of these circumstances and the matters which the learned trial judge said he took into account in arriving at the amount of $40,000, I cannot say that in assessing the damages Milvain J. either applied a wrong principle of law or that the amount was so high as to be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.\nIn the result, Widrig's appeal to restore the amount awarded to him by the learned trial judge will be allowed and the judgment of the trial Court restored except insofar as it directed that the appellant recover damages and costs from Shirley Mae Strazer and Lloyd W. Gardiner in their personal capacities. The cross-appeal to have the action dismissed or, alternatively, to have the damages awarded to the appellant by the Court of Appeal further reduced will be dismissed. The appellant will be entitled to his costs here and in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitors' for the defendants, respondents: Wood, Moir, Hyde & Ross, Edmonton.\n1 (1963), 41 W.W.R. 257, 37 D.L.R.

The trustee submitted itself to the decision of the Court and concluded its plea in the following terms: \"Wherefore defendant prays for judgment \u2026 instructing it as to the disposition of this trust property \u2026 by dismissing or by allowing plaintiff's action \u2026\" Subsequently, the intervenants intervened to ask that the action be dismissed. The case proceeded to trial and, after hearing but before judgment, the plaintiff and the intervenants, at the suggestion of the trial judge, met to discuss settlement and in due course executed a Deed of Transaction, each party agreeing that the trust property would be divided on the basis of 50 per cent for the plaintiff and 50 per cent for the intervenants; the trustee was advised thereof but was not a party thereto. The trial judge then rendered judgment confirming the transaction and ordering the trustee to render an account. The trustee appealed to the Court of Appeal, but that appeal was quashed on the ground that the trustee had no right to appeal. The trustee appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe material filed in the record disclosed that the trustee, through its attorneys of record and at least one of its officers, was fully aware at all times of the discussions for settlement and with the Deed of Transaction entered into and that it acquiesced in the settlement agreed upon and in the judgment confirming such settlement.

That judgment confirmed a transaction entered into between plaintiff-respondent and intervenants-respondents and ordered the appellant to render an account of the administration of a certain trust fund referred to in the transaction and to dispose forthwith of the said trust fund, including all revenues accrued thereon from and after July 18, 1959, the whole in accordance with the terms of the transaction.\nThe relevant facts are as follows. By Deed of Donation executed before Edouard Cholette, Notary, on February 10, 1931, one Agnes L. Holliday, mother of the plaintiff-respondent, conveyed, inter vivos, to the appellant certain securities as a trust fund to be held by it in trust:\n1. to pay the revenues during a five-year period in certain proportions to her two sons, Thomas J. R. Macaulay and Norman Holliday Macaulay;\n2. upon the expiration of the five-year period to pay all the revenues to the said Thomas J. R. Macaulay during his lifetime;\n3. on his death to pay such revenues to his widow during her lifetime or until her remarriage;\n4. upon his death, and that of his widow, or her remarriage, to pay the capital, with all accumulated income, if any, to his lawful child or children in equal shares upon each attaining the age of thirty years.\nThe Deed provided that if the said Thomas J. R. Macaulay died unmarried or without leaving any lawful child or children, the capital was to go as to one half to the said Norman Holliday Macaulay and as to the other half to the plaintiff-respondent. If there should be no child or children issue of the marriage of the said Norman Holliday Macaulay, and of the plaintiff-respondent, the capital was to go to the survivor of the said Norman Holliday Macaulay and the plaintiff-respondent.\nThomas J. R. Macaulay died August 16, 1954 and his widow, Marjory Dorothy Prodgers Macaulay remarried on July 18, 1959.\nThere were no children issue of the marriage of Thomas J. R. Macaulay and the said Marjory Dorothy Prodgers but they had legally adopted, in England where they were then residing, the two intervenants-respondents.\nNorman Holliday Macaulay died on October 20, 1957 without lawful issue.\nUpon the remarriage of the widow of Thomas J. R. Macaulay the plaintiff-respondent claimed the capital of the trust fund, and all revenues accumulated in it since the remarriage, on the ground that the intervenants-respondents were not the lawful children of her brother Thomas J. R. Macaulay within the meaning of the Deed of Donation, and that by reason of the death of Norman Holliday Macaulay, without lawful issue, she was solely entitled to the trust fund.\nUpon the refusal of the appellant to comply with her request she took the present action.\nAppellant in its plea alleged that conflicting claims had been made against it by the intervenants-respondents but submitted itself to the decision of the Court, concluding its plea as follows:\nWHEREFORE defendant prays for judgment of this Honourable Court instructing it as to the disposition of the Trust property held by it under the Deed of Trust entered into before Edouard Cholette, Notary, on the 10th day of February 1931, by dismissing or by allowing plaintiff's action, with or without costs as this Honourable Court shall see fit to do.\nSubsequently, the intervenants-respondents intervened alleging that the plaintiff-respondent was not entitled to what she asked and prayed that their intervention be received and maintained and the action dismissed with costs.\nThe case then proceeded to trial in March 1962 and, after hearing but before judgment, the plaintiff-respondent and the intervenants-respondents, at the suggestion of the presiding judge, met to discuss settlement and in due course executed a Deed of Transaction on November 1, 1962, each party agreeing that the trust property and revenues thereon would be divided on the basis of 50 per cent for the plaintiff-respondent and 50 per cent for the intervenants-respondents and the appellant-trustee was advised thereof but was not a party thereto.\nOn November 5,1962, judgment was rendered reciting the transaction in full and it concludes as follows:\nNOW THEREFORE THE COURT, as requested by plaintiff and intervenants hereby renders judgment confirming the said transaction in all respects and for all legal purposes, and doth hereby order the defendant, Crown Trust Company, to render an account of the administration of the said trust fund and to dispose forthwith of the said trust fund, including all revenues accrued thereon from and after July 18, 1959, in accordance with the terms of the aforesaid transaction.\nThe sole question in issue both in the Court below and before this Court is whether the appellant had a right to appeal from that judgment. We are not here concerned with the interpretation and effect of the Deed of Donation of February 10, 1931.\nFrom the material filed in the record I am satisfied that appellant, through its attorneys of record and at least one of its trust officers, was fully aware at all times of the discussions for settlement and with the Deed of Transaction entered into and that it acquiesced in the settlement agreed upon and in the judgment confirming such settlement. That settlement was of course binding upon both the plaintiff-respondent, Dame Mary Agnes Macaulay, and the intervenants-respondents Peter Charles Macaulay and Sarah Ann Macaulay.\nAs I have said the sole question now in issue is whether the appellant acquiesced in the judgment of the Superior Court both in anticipation and after the judgment was rendered, thereby abandoning its right to appeal under the provisions of art. 1220 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Court of Queen's Bench held unanimously that appellant had so acquiesced and I am in agreement with that finding.\nAt the opening of the hearing before this Court appellant filed a discontinuance of its appeal against the plaintiff- respondent Dame Mary Agnes Macaulay, and the appeal was argued only as against the intervenants-respondents. For the reasons which I have given I would dismiss that appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Besehenes, Forget & Cr\u00e9peau, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the intervenants, respondents: Duquet, MacKay, Weldon, Bronstetter, Willis & Johnston, Montreal.\n1 [1963] Que.

At that time, L was carrying out a contract with C involving the replacement of the heating system. The employee elected to claim compensation under The Workmen's Compensation Act. Having been subrogated in the rights of the employee, the Workmen's Compensation Board sued C for the amounts paid by it. C contested that action and at the same time instituted an action in warranty against L, alleging that L or his servants had made alterations or repairs to the heater. Both actions were joined for purposes of proof and hearing.\nThe heater had been used for some years by the appellant for the domestic supply of hot water and was designed to use either wood or coal as fuel. The fire box was surrounded by a metal cylinder in which water circulated entering through a pipe inserted at the base of the cylinder and passing out to the hot water reservoir through a similar opening near the top. The heater was disconnected from these pipes and a hot water heater operated by electricity was installed. Following this the appellant continued to use the heater for the purpose of burning rubbish but found that it gave off a nauseating odour, whereby L's foreman plugged the two holes so that the cylinder was now hermatically sealed and transformed into a highly dangerous thing.\nThe claim of the Board was allowed and the action in warranty dismissed by the trial judge. This judgment was upheld by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. C appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge and the majority in the Court below found that the effective cause of the accident was an imprudent use of the heater by the appellant or by persons for whom he was responsible. The appellant has failed to satisfactorily show that this was a case in which concurrent findings of fact should be interfered with.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: As between the appellant and L the whole blame for the occurrence of the explosion rested upon the latter. He was employed to do what was necessary to prevent the heater giving off offensive smells. While there were suggestions in the evidence that neither L nor his foreman fully realised the danger of sealing the cylinder, it was clearly the duty of L to know and guard against this danger. Having sealed the cylinder, L had the duty to give a clear and explicit warning to the appellant of the potential danger; this he failed to do.\nAssuming that as \"gardien juridique\" of the heater the appellant would have been responsible to the employee under art. 1054 of the Civil Code, if the latter had not claimed under the Act, it was clear that L would have been liable to indemnify the appellant against the damages the latter would have been called upon to pay to the employee. Since, however, the employee elected to take compensation under the Act, to order the appellant to pay the employee's damages and to order L to indemnify the appellant would in the result be to order L to pay the damages suffered by his employee. This would be contrary to the Act; the law does not permit to do indirectly that which it forbids to do directly. The action in warranty was therefore unnecessary.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Chief Justice S\u00e9vigny. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJacques de Billy, Q.C., for the defendant and plaintiff in warranty, appellant. Guy Dorion, for the plaintiff Commission, respondent.\nAndr\u00e9 Levesque, for the defendant in warranty, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014These two appeals are from judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench2, Marchand J. dissenting, which confirmed two judgments of the Superior Court, the one condemning the appellant to pay to respondent a sum of $4,490.50, and the other dismissing appellant's action in warranty against the respondent Leclerc.\nThis litigation is the result of the explosion of a jacket-heater which occurred on January 18, 1952, in the basement of a property belonging to appellant, in which one Cl\u00e9ment Richard, a plumber in the employ of the respondent Leclerc was injured. The business of the respondent Leclerc, a plumbing contractor, came under the provisions of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act.\nSubrogated in the rights of the said Cl\u00e9ment Richard for the amounts paid to him under the said Act, the respondent Commission on January 14, 1953, sued the appellant Cauchon for the amounts paid by it. Cauchon contested that action and at the same time instituted an action in warranty against the respondent Leclerc asking that he, Cauchon, be indemnified against any condemnation which might be rendered against him in the principal action. The action in warranty was contested and both actions joined for purposes of proof and hearing. Judgment was rendered in both actions on February 22, 1956.\nThe facts relating to the accident are fully set out in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in those of St. Jacques J. in the Court below. Both the learned trial judge and the majority in the Court below found that the effective cause of the accident was an imprudent use of the jacket-heater by appellant or by persons for whom he is responsible, and appellant has failed to satisfy me that this is a case in which these concurrent findings of fact should be interfered with.\nFor the reasons given by St. Jacques and Montgomery JJ., with which I am in respectful agrement, I would dismiss both appeals with costs. Cartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014These are appeals from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec (Appeal Side)3 which confirmed judgments of the Superior Court for the District of Quebec whereby the appellant was ordered to pay to the respondent, La Commission des Accidents du Travail de Qu\u00e9bec, hereinafter referred to as \"The Commission\", the sum of $4,490.50 and his action in warranty against the respondent Leclerc was dismissed. Marchand J., dissenting, would have allowed the appeals and dismissed the Commission's action; as a result he would have affirmed the dismissal of the action in warranty on the ground that it was unnecessary.\nThere does not appear to me to be any serious dispute as to the facts on which the rights of the parties depend.\nThe Commission brought its action against the appellant by virtue of its right to be subrogated to the claim of Cl\u00e9ment Richard who was an employee of the defendant in warranty Leclerc. The business of Leclerc, that of a plumbing and heating contractor, was subject to the provisions of the Quebec Workmen's Compensation Act, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act.\"\nOn January 18, 1952, Richard was an employee of Leclerc; while in the course of his employment he was seriously injured by the explosion of a jacket-heater in the basement of the appellant's cottage in which Leclerc was carrying out a contract with the appellant involving the replacement of the heating system. Richard elected to claim compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nThe jacket-heater, which exploded, had been used for some years by the appellant for the domestic supply of hot water. It was designed to use either wood or coal as fuel. The fire box was surrounded by a metal cylinder in which water circulated entering through a pipe inserted in an opening one inch in diameter about one inch above the base of the cylinder and passing out to the hot water reservoir through a similar opening near the top of the cylinder.\nIn December 1951, Leclerc in the course of performing his contract with the appellant disconnected the jacket-heater from the pipes mentioned above and installed a hot water heater operated by electricity. The appellant's evidence was that he intended to get rid of the jacket-heater; Leclerc's evidence as to the conversation between them was as follows:\nQ. Et est-ce qu'apr\u00e8s \u00e7a, le docteur Cauchon ne vous a pas dit qu'il n'en avait plus besoin et qu'il allait s'en d\u00e9barrasser, de ce chauffe-eau-l\u00e0?\nR. Non, il m'a demand\u00e9 par exemple s'il pouvait le chauffer. J'ai dit; \u00abJe ne vois pas d'inconv\u00e9nient, il peut chauffer pareil comme un autre petit po\u00eale, dans la condition o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait.\u00bb\nFollowing this the appellant used the jacket-heater on several occasions for the purpose of burning rubbish consisting of discarded papers of various sorts but found that it gave off a nauseating odour. The appellant says that he reported this to Leclerc, the latter denies this, but it would seem probable that he is in error as it is established that his foreman Delisle went to the appellant's house and plugged the two holes in the water-jacket so that, in the result, the cylinder in which formerly the water circulated was now hermetically sealed.\nWhile there is some conflict in the evidence as to matters of detail, if taken at its worst against the appellant it establishes the following facts.\nThe appellant told Leclerc that he would continue to use the jacket-heater for the burning of waste-paper. Prior to the plugging of the holes Leclerc had told the appellant that he could use the jacket-heater like any other little stove. The holes were plugged by the servant of Leclerc acting in the course of his employment. This action, on the uncontradicted evidence of the expert witnesses, transformed the jacket-heater from an ordinary and harmless stove into a highly dangerous thing. Leclerc gave the appellant neither notice nor warning of this danger. The appellant had no knowledge of the danger created and relied on Leclerc, as an experienced heating and plumbing contractor, to do what was necessary to get rid of the disagreeable smell which the heater had been causing. The immediate cause of the explosion was the use made of the jacket-heater by the appellant and his wife to heat the basement while the normal supply of heat was cut off owing to the work being done on the furnace. Instead of merely burning waste paper on January 17, the appellant burned fire-wood in the stove. Before it was re-lighted on January 18 the appellant's wife cleaned out the ashes which had accumulated in the stove; to some extent these had acted as insulation and when the stove was re-lighted and fire-wood added to it on January 18 a sufficiently high temperature was generated to cause the explosion by which Richard was injured. Both Leclerc and Delisle were present while wood was being burned in the stove on January 17 and January 18.\nOn this state of facts, it appears to me that as between the appellant and Leclerc the whole blame for the occurrence of the explosion rests upon the latter. The appellant employed Leclerc to do what was necessary to prevent the jacket-heater giving off offensive smells. The appellant whose profession was that of a physician did not know, and would not be expected to know, how this should be accomplished. On the other hand, while there are suggestions in the evidence that neither Leclerc nor his employee Delisle fully realized the danger of hermetically sealing the cylinder while it contained rust or moisture, it was clearly the duty of Leclerc to know and guard against this danger; spondet peritiam artis. It is clear that the appellant relied entirely upon Leclerc in the matter. Leclerc committed a grave fault in sealing the cylinder. Having done this it was his duty to give a clear and explicit warning to the appellant of the potential danger which he had created; this he failed to do.\nI do not find it necessary to consider whether, if Richard had not been entitled to compensation under the Act, the fact that as between the appellant and Leclerc all the blame rested upon the latter would have afforded a defence to the appellant against the claim made by Richard. I will assume that as \"gardien juridique\" of the jacket-heater the appellant would have been responsible to Richard under art. 1054 of the Civil Code; on that assumption I think it clear that Leclerc would have been liable to indemnify the appellant against the damages the latter was called upon to pay to Richard. Since, however, Richard is entitled to, and has elected to take, compensation under the Act, to order the appellant to pay Richard's damages and to order Leclerc to indemnify the appellant would, in the result, be to order Leclerc to pay the damages suffered by his employee; such a result would be contrary to the provisions of the Act; the law does not permit that to be done indirectly which is forbidden to be done directly. In my view Marchand J. was right in holding that the action of the Commission should be dismissed. It follows from this, as Marchand J. held, that the action in warranty becomes unnecessary and should be dismissed but as, in my opinion, the fault of Leclerc was the sole effective cause of the injuries suffered by Richard I would not award any costs to him.\nI would allow the appeals, set aside the judgments in the Courts below and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action of the Commission against the appellant with costs throughout and dismissing the action in warranty of the appellant against Leclerc without costs; I would make no order as to costs in the last mentioned action in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) or in this Court.\nSpence J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of both Cartwright J. and Abbott J. in this appeal, and I have further re-read much of the evidence and all of the judgments in the courts below. I have come to the conclusion that the judgment of Sevigny C.J. in the Superior Court was a finding of fact made after considering conflicting evidence and that judgment was confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)4.\nThis Court cannot reverse the finding of fact made in the trial court and confirmed on appeal unless there was evident error in the lower courts: Paradis v. Limoilou5, per Girouard J.\nI adopt what was said by Anglin J. in Frith v. Alliance Investment Company6:\nWhile not satisfied that, if I had been presiding at the trial of this action, I should, upon my present appreciation of the evidence, have reached the conclusion that the defendants had fully discharged their duty to the plaintiff as his agents, I am not prepared to reverse the concurrent finding of two courts upon that point, which must to a considerable extent, in the case of the learned trial judge, have rested upon the view taken by him of the credibility and weight of the testimony of the several witnesses.\nI find myself in the same position in this case and I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Gagnon & de Billy, Quebec.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: G.

M\/S Willowbranch, [1964] S.C.R. 402\nDate: 1964-04-28\nImperial Oil Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nM\/S Willowbranch (Defendant) Respondent.\n1964: February 24, 25, 26; 1964: April 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritche and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nShipping\u2014Collision between two tankers in approach to Halifax harbour\u2014 Negligence of parties\u2014Dense jog\u2014Alteration of course\u2014Excessive speed\u2014Improper radar look-out\u2014Narrow channel rule.\nThe plaintiff's tanker Imperial Halifax outbound from Halifax collided in a dense fog with the defendant's tanker Willowbranch inbound, in the approach to Halifax harbour. Both vessels were equipped with radar sets. The Imperial Halifax maintained full speed until entering a fog bank at which time the echo of an approaching ship 3\u00b0 on the star-board bow and about one and a half miles ahead was noticed on the radar. Her engines were then reduced to half speed and about one-half minute later to slow. When the ships were about a mile apart and the angle of the approaching ship appeared to have broadened to 4\u00b0 on the starboard bow, the Master of the Imperial Halifax assumed that the two ships would pass starboard to starboard if each maintained her course. He therefore continued his course until a ship's whistle was heard on the starboard bow. The radar indicated to him that the approaching ship was on a course that would cross that of the Imperial Halifax from starboard to port. He then stopped engines and altered course 4\u00b0 to port. Within one minute of that order the approaching vessel was heard directly ahead and the engines were reversed. The Imperial Halifax was going at about four knots when the collision took place.\nAfter observing on the radar a ship at 10\u00b0 on the port bow and one directly ahead and about two and a half miles away, the Willowbranch, which was then at half speed, altered her course four times to star-board by gradual degrees. All these alterations were made within four to four and a half minutes before the collision and their effect was to bring the Willowbranch directly across the bow of the Imperial Halifax. Although the whistle of the latter ship was first heard about two minutes before the collision and a second whistle was heard before they met, no action was taken to stop the engines of the Willowbranch. When the aproaching vessel came into view about 300 feet away the engines were reversed and the Willowbranch was practically stopped at the time of the collision.\nThe trial judge held the Imperial Halifax one-third to blame and the Willowbranch two-thirds to blame. On appeal to the Exchequer Court, the fault was divided in exactly the reverse proportions. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. The defendant contended that the narrow channel rule or alternatively the meeting end-on rule applied and justified her four alterations of course to starboard in order to pass port to port. The Imperial Halifax contended that the area was open sea and that it was the duty of the Willowbranch to maintain her course without alteration so that the ships would pass starboard to starboard. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe parties were equally responsible for the collision. The evidence did not justify the finding that the area was a narrow channel. It was a general rule that in fog, when by one vessel the course of another within a danger zone was not yet ascertained, without sufficient indication to justify action, no change of course should be made. The plaintiff was negligent in not reducing speed earlier. The defendant was guilty of an act of negligence by changing course before he had ascertained the course of the incoming ship. The position of difficulty would not have arisen if the radar sets had been tended with care and intelligence by the operators. Different degrees of fault not having been established, the liability should be shared equally by both parties.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Pottier D.J.A. Appeal allowed.\nDonald McInnis, Q.C., and John Dickey, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDonald Kerr and R. N. Pugsley, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Thurlow of the Exchequer Court of Canada2 allowing an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Pottier, District Judge in Admiralty for the Admiralty District of Nova Scotia, whereby the latter judge had found the M.S. Willow-branch chiefly to blame for a collision between that ship and the Imperial Halifax, two radar-equipped motor driven oil tankers which collided in the dense fog in the approaches to Halifax Harbour at 8.23 or 8.23\u00bd a.m. on July 16, 1959, when the sea was calm, the wind light and the tide ebbing at about one-quarter knot.\nMr. Justice Pottier would have apportioned the blame for the collision two-thirds of the Willowbranch and one-third to Imperial Halifax. Mr. Justice Thurlow, however, divided the fault in exactly the reverse proportions.\nThere appears to be direct conflict between the parties as to many of the details relating to the movements, courses and speeds of the two ships at the time of the collision and for a period of approximately twenty minutes which preceded it, but apart from one major difference, to which reference will hereafter be made, the trial judge and the judge sitting in appeal are in substantial agreement as to what happened, and where they agree I do not hesitate to accept the version which they have adopted.\nThe movements of the two ships can most conveniently be considered separately and after reading the reasons for judgment in light of the evidence and listening to exhaustive argument from the counsel concerned, it appears to me that the essential factors contributing to the collision can be summarized as follows:\nThe appellant's motor ship, Imperial Halifax, of 3,734 gross tons, 357 feet length overall and 48 feet in width, left Imperoyal on the east side of Halifax Harbour at 7.51 a.m., outbound for Charlottetown, P.E.I., and proceeding seaward in clear weather and without a pilot on a course of 163\u00b0 True, she had attained her full speed of 12 knots by about 8.13 when the master first observed a bank of fog one and a half miles away. Two minutes later the course was altered to 159\u00b0 True so as to veer to the eastward and thus avoid a group of American naval vessels which appeared to be taking the westerly route out of the harbour. When the course was so altered the order \"standby engines\" was rung on the telegraph, and sounding of the fog whistle at one-minute intervals was commenced. Full speed was, however, maintained until entering the fog bank about four minutes later, at which time the echo of an approaching ship was first seen on the radar, whereupon engines were reduced to \"half speed\" and about one half minute later to \"slow\". The Captain estimated the approaching ship to be approximately one and a half miles ahead and without plotting its course he further estimated that it was bearing 3\u00b0 on the starboard bow. When the ships were about a mile apart and the angle of the approaching ship appeared to have broadened to 4\u00b0 on the starboard bow, the Captain of the Imperial Halifax assumed that the two ships could pass starboard to starboard if each maintained its course, and he therefore continued on a course of 159\u00b0 True until a ship's whistle was heard on the starboard bow when he stopped engines and altered course 4\u00b0 to port. He states that at this time the radar indicated to him that the approaching ship was on a course that would have crossed that of the Imperial Halifax from starboard to port. I agree with Mr. Justice Thurlow that the 4\u00b0 alteration to port was too late to have any bearing on the collision, as within one minute of that order the approaching vessel was heard directly ahead and engines were reversed. In the result, Imperial Halifax was going at about four knots when the collision took place and was heading 155\u00b0 True.\nThe Willowbranch, on the other hand, which is 259 feet in length, 43.9 feet in breadth and of 2,153 gross tons, was entering the harbour enroute from Montreal and having taken on her pilot at 8.00, the course was set at 330\u00b0 True, but on the pilot advising that the American warships were proceeding out of the harbour probably to the westward of Neverfail Buoy, the course was altered to 340\u00b0 and at the same time the engines were put to \"full ahead\". Shortly afterwards the course was further altered to 345\u00b0 True, but \"full ahead\" was maintained on the engines for about ten minutes when the Captain decided to reduce to \"half speed\". The course was again altered to 340\u00b0 True shortly before the echo of an approaching ship was first seen on the radar. Various accounts are given by the officers and the pilot as to exactly what was seen, but it can be gathered from the pilot's evidence that there was one ship at 10\u00b0 on the port bow and one directly ahead. The latter ship was estimated to be about two and one-half miles away, and when it had been under observation for approximately two or three minutes, the course of the Willowbranch was again altered to 345\u00b0 True and later to 350\u00b0 in the hope of putting her to the eastward out of the path of the oncoming ship. Shortly afterwards it appearing that this ship was approaching at a high speed and that the angle of her approach on the port bow was not broadening, the course was altered to 355\u00b0. True and still later to 360\u00b0 True. It appears from the evidence that the alterations in course from 340\u00b0 to 345\u00b0 to 350\u00b0 to 355\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 were all made within four to four and a half minutes before the collision, and the effect of these changes was to bring the Willowbranch directly across the bow of the Imperial Halifax. The whistle of Imperial Halifax was first heard on the Willowbranch about two minutes before the collision and a second whistle was heard before they met. No action was taken to stop the engines of the Willowbranch on hearing these whistles, but when the approaching vessel came into view about 300 feet away, the order \"hard astarboard\" and \"full astern\" was given and Willowbranch was practically stopped at the time of collision. Pottier D.J.A. expressed the opinion, with which I am in full accord, that the course of prudence on the part of those in charge of both vessels would have been to stop after sighting each other on the radar so that each could determine the course of the other before coming to close quarters, but he found the Willowbranch chiefly to blame on the ground that her course was altered to starboard by gradual degrees in fog without the course of the Imperial Halifax having first been determined, and that she was thus placed directly in the path of the approaching vessel when they came in sight of each other through the fog, by which time it was too late to avoid the collision.\nIn assessing the degree of fault to be attributed to the Imperial Halifax, Pottier D.J.A. proceeded on the assumption that this ship had run into thick fog at 8.15 and had then put her engines at \"half speed\", whereas it is now agreed that she did not run into the fog until about 8.19 and that she was travelling at full speed until that time. In view of the fact that Thurlow J. found the grossly excessive speed of the Imperial Halifax while in fog to be one of the chief elements of her fault, it will be seen that the discrepancy is a significant one.\nBy virtue of the provisions of s. 645(1) of The Canada Shipping Act, the Governor-in-Council is empowered to make rules and regulations for the prevention of collisions at sea, and by s. 647 such regulations, subject to any local rules or by-laws, are required to be obeyed by all masters of vessels and a fine is provided \"not exceeding $200 for failure, without reasonable cause, to comply with such regulations\".\nBy P.C. 1953-1287, The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (hereinafter referred to as The Regulations) are made applicable to the waters here in question, and the conduct of ships in fog is governed by Rule 16 of those Regulations, sub-para, (a) of which reads as follows:\n16(a) Every vessel, or seaplane when taxi-ing on the water, shall, in fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms or any other condition similarly restricting visibility, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nIn my opinion, entirely apart from the provisions of Rule 16, the Captain of the Imperial Halifax should, as a matter of seamanship, have reduced his speed on first sighting the bank of fog a mile and a half away. I agree with the following excerpt from Marsden's Work, The Law of Collisions at Sea, 11th ed., page 770:\nApart from the regulations, the law requires a ship to be navigated in or near a fog at a moderate speed; the regulations make no alteration in the law in this respect.\nVessels approaching a bank of fog or snow, which they are about to enter, should, as a matter of seamanship, go at a moderate speed. Failure to comply with this duty does not, however, amount to a breach of rule 16; but if, in the result, her speed when she enters the fog is not moderate she may then be in breach \u2026\nThe appellant's counsel discounted the speed of the Imperial Halifax as a factor contributing to the collision saying that although it may have had some bearing on the extent of the damage which was done to the respective ships, it was not shown to have been in any sense a cause of their coming together. It appears to me that the requirement of Rule 16(a) is not designed merely for the purpose of lessening the violence of collisions between ships, but rather that its primary purpose is to prevent collisions altogether by providing that each ship shall go at such a speed as to afford the maximum time for the taking of avoiding action when another suddenly comes into view at a short distance. I can see no answer in the present case to the contention that if the Imperial Halifax had started reducing speed four minutes sooner than she did (i.e., when she first sighted the fog), her ability to stop before the collision occurred would have been proportionately increased.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Thurlow that the speed of the Imperial Halifax on entering fog, taken together with her master's failure to sooner identify the approaching vessel on radar and his error in judgment when he did see it in deciding to take the chance of passing at such close quarters in fog, are factors which substantially contributed to the collision, and I agree also that Pottier D.J.A.'s error as to the time when speed was first reduced affected his judgment as to the degree of fault to be attributed to the Imperial Halifax. I have, however, reached the conclusion, for the reasons hereinafter set forth, that the Willowbranch was equally at fault.\nIn reducing the fault attributable to the Willowbranch from two-thirds to one-third, Thurlow J. adopted the view that immediately before and at the time of the collision, these ships were proceeding along the course of a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of Rule 25(a) of the Collision Regulations which reads as follows:\n(a) In a narrow channel every power-driven vessel when proceeding along the course of the channel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\nIn this regard, Mr. Justice Thurlow said:\n\u2026 the locality in which the collision occurred is a narrow channel within the meaning of Rule 25 and adopting this view of the nature of the locality I am of the opinion, again relying to a considerable extent on Captain Bird's advice, that in the particular circumstances it was not wrong for the Willowbranch on detecting the approach of the Imperial Halifax directly ahead to alter to starboard in an effort to get to her side of the mid-channel or fairway.\nThe test to be employed in determining whether or not an area is a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of Rule 25(a) is discussed by Wilmer J. in Anna Salen3, where he says:\nAs I understand it the question whether article 25 of the Collision Regulations applies in relation to a given piece of water is one to be determined on the evidence given in the particular case, the Court being assisted by the knowledge and experience of the Elder Brethren.\nAnd again in The Sedgepool4, where he says:\nAs I understand the law, one of the determining factors in deciding whether a given area is or is not within the \"narrow channel\" rule is the way in which seamen in fact regard it and behave in it.\nIn reaching his conclusion in this regard, Thurlow J. undoubtedly relied in great degree, as he was entitled to do, on the advice of the nautical assessor sitting with him on appeal, but the advice of the learned assessor who sat at the trial did not lead Pottier D.J.A. to the same conclusion, and there does not appear to be any case deciding that the area of this collision is within a \"narrow channel\". Under the circumstances the matter appears to me to be one to be decided upon the evidence.\nApart from the fact that the Captain of the Willowbranch referred to the easterly route into Halifax Harbour as \"the eastern channel in the approach to the harbour\" and his pilot and first officer both referred to the area of the collision as a channel, there is no direct evidence whatever in the record which could, in my view, be said to establish that seamen make a practice of treating the area here in question as a \"narrow channel\" within the meaning of Rule 25(a). It is true the Captain of the Imperial Halifax uses the word \"channel\", but he expressely states that he did not regard these waters as a place to which Rule 25 applied.\nOn such evidence I am not prepared to make any finding that the area described by the learned judge in appeal is a \"narrow channel\", but this should, of course, not be construed as precluding the making of such a finding in another case if evidence can be adduced to support such a conclusion.\nThurlow J., however, also expressed the view that even treating the narrow channel rule as inapplicable, it was nevertheless not \"wrong for the Willowbranch to alter to starboard to take herself out of the way in case the oncoming ship should be passing to the east\". In so finding, Mr. Justice Thurlow took into consideration the fact that the Willowbranch had a ship dead ahead of her proceeding at a high rate of speed and had no means of knowing whether that ship was going to attempt to pass to the east or to the west.\nIn this regard, counsel for the Willowbranch sought to invoke the provisions of Rule 18 of the Regulations, the opening sentence of which reads as follows:\nRule 18: When two power-driven vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other.\nIt is, I think, important to remember that Rules 17 to 27 inclusive are contained in part C of the Regulations which is entitled \"Steering and Sailing Rules\", and which contains the following preliminary paragraph:\nIn obeying and construing these Rules, any action taken should be positive, in ample time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.\nI agree with Thurlow J. that the action of the Willowbranch in altering course as she did was neither sufficiently positive nor in time, and it appears also that alteration of course in fog when the position of an approaching ship has not been ascertained is anything but good seamanship. As was said by Rand J. The Dagmar Salen v. The Chinook5: It is a general rule as old as navigation that in fog, when by one vessel the course of another within a danger zone is not yet ascertained, without sufficient indication to justify action, no change of course should be made: Vindomore v. Haswell, 1891 A.C. 1; and in The \"Wear\", 164 E.R. 419, Hill J. used this language:\nIt has been said over and over again in this court that when in a fog you sight a ship whose direction or course you do not know the worst thing you can do is to take helm action.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the actions of the Willowbranch in altering course as she did cannot be justified as a compliance with Rule 18 of the Regulations.\nIn my opinion, however, the fault of these two ships is not to be assessed only in terms of their respective actions at close quarters, and I adopt the language used by Wilmer J. in The Billings Victory6, where he said:\nIt appears to me that the most important thing to give effect to in considering degrees of blame is the question which of the two vessels created the position of difficulty.\nIn this regard, I am of opinion that the overriding negligence common to both ships in the present case lay in the use made of their respective radar equipment, and I am satisfied that \"the position of difficulty\" would not have arisen at all if the radar sets with which both ships were equipped had been tended with the degree of care to which Rand J. referred in The Dagmar v. The Chinook, supra, at page 612 where he said:\nIf radar is to furnish a new sight through fog the report which it brings must be interpreted by active and constant intelligence on the part of the operator.\nRule 16(b) of the Regulations provides that:\n16(b) A power-driven vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog-signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nThe considerations giving rise to this rule appear to me to apply with added force when a ship is equipped with radar and thereby has available a means of detecting an approaching ship at a greater distance and with greater accuracy than any fog signals could afford. The ships involved in this collision detected each other forward of their respective beams before hearing each other's fog signals or sighting each other visually, and they were thus in a position to take early and substantial action to avoid coming to close quarters. In lieu of taking such action, the proper course for both would have been to stop engines and not to proceed again until each had established the position of the other so that both could proceed without risk of collision.\nAs I have indicated, I take the view that the Imperial Halifax should have seen the echo of the Willowbranch sooner, but the greater negligence consisted in the Captain, after he had detected the presence of the approaching ship by radar, proceeding on the assumption that the ships would pass starboard to starboard without first having plotted the course of the ship ahead. It seems probable that the ships would indeed have passed if Willowbranch had not altered course, but under all the circumstances, Captain Kent's decision to proceed, based on his own unverified estimate, exposed both ships unnecessarily to the risk of collision.\nThe negligence of the Willowbranch was of the same character. The echo of the Imperial Halifax was detected on the radar two and a half miles away and yet, despite this warning, the course of the approaching ship was never plotted. On the contrary, the Willowbranch appears to have adopted a series of courses which resulted in the ship edging her way directly into the path of the Imperial Halifax. If the radar information had been \"interpreted by active and constant intelligence on the part of the operator\". I find it difficult to believe that this action would have been taken.\nUnder all the circumstances, I have reached the conclusion that the two ships were equally to blame for this collision. In so doing I am conscious of the fact that where each of the courts below has assessed the fault between the parties in different proportions, the cases are rare in which this Court will undertake to allocate the responsibility without adopting one or other of such assessments. In the present case, however, I find that in holding Imperial Halifax less than one-half to blame, Pottier D.J.A. was mistaken as to the time when that ship started to reduce speed, and that in reducing the degree of fault attributable to the Willowbranch to less than one-half, Thurlow J. took the view, with which I do not agree, that that ship was not wrong in altering course to starboard in fog and that her only fault in this regard lay in the fact that the alterations were not sufficiently bold or timely.\nIn the result, as I am unable to conclude that different degrees of fault have been established, it follows that liability should be borne equally between the two ships in accordance with the provisions of s. 648(2) of The Canada Shipping Act.\nI would accordingly allow this appeal with costs in this Court and direct that the order of Pottier D.J.A., including his disposition of the costs, be varied so as to give effect to this decision. I see no reason for disturbing the disposition of the costs in the Exchequer Court as directed by Thurlow J.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: D. McInnes, Halifax.

Il d\u00e9clina la juridiction de la Cour et, avant la date fix\u00e9e pour les enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires, obtint de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de prohibition suspendant les proc\u00e9dures. Le Ministre, par voie d'exception d\u00e9clinatoire, attaqua la juridiction de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur le motif que ce tribunal n'avait pas la comp\u00e9tence pour \u00e9mettre un bref de prohibition dans une affaire \u00e0 caract\u00e8re criminel. Cette exception fut rejet\u00e9e. Port\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire. La Cour d'Appel jugea qu'elle n'avait pas juridiction pour entendre l'appel pour le motif que le jugement rejetant l'exception d\u00e9clinatoire \u00e9tait un jugement en mati\u00e8re criminelle pour lequel le Code Criminel ne pr\u00e9voyait pas d'appel. Cette Cour, [1962] R.C.S. 588, infirma ce jugement et retourna le dossier \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel pour adjudication sur le m\u00e9rite du jugement rejetant l'exception d\u00e9clinatoire. Par un jugement majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel jugea que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait juridiction pour \u00e9mettre des brefs de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle en vertu de statuts adopt\u00e9s avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration et non express\u00e9ment ni implicitement rappel\u00e9s depuis par le Parlement. Le Ministre se pourvoit devant cette Cour \u00e0 l'encontre de ce dernier jugement.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et le bref de prohibition annul\u00e9.\nLes expressions \u00abToute Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de juridiction criminelle, ainsi que toute Cour d'Appel\u00bb que l'on trouve \u00e0 l'art. 424 du Code Criminel, lequel conf\u00e8re \u00e0 ces cours le pouvoir d'\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de cour s'appliquant \u00e0 toute mati\u00e8re de leur comp\u00e9tence, sont d\u00e9finies aux arts. 2(14) et 2(12) du Code comme \u00e9tant la Cour du Banc de la Reine (Crown Side) et la Cour du Banc de la Reine (Division d'Appel), respectivement, toutes deux dans l'exercice de leur juridiction criminelle. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure se trouve donc \u00e0 \u00eatre exclue de l'art. 424. On ne peut qu'inf\u00e9rer que le Parlement ne reconna\u00eet plus cette juridiction que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pouvait avoir en mati\u00e8re criminelle, en vertu des statuts d'avant Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\nLes dispositions de la partie XXIII du Code supportent la proposition que le Parlement a int\u00e9gralement absorb\u00e9 la juridiction sur les brefs de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle. L'art. 680 du Code statue que cette partie s'applique aux proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re criminelle sous forme de certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus et de prohibition. Puisque les dispositions et les parties du Code forment un tout, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter en cette partie ce qui r\u00e9sultait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des dispositions de l'art. 424, tel que compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par les arts. 2(12) et 2(14), lesquels n'incluent pas la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. En somme, le Parlement a l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le bref de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle, tant en ce qui concerne la juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance que la juridiction d'appel, et cette l\u00e9gislation ne reconna\u00eet pas la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Le droit ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration ne se concilie plus avec le droit r\u00e9sultant de la l\u00e9gislation depuis adopt\u00e9e sur la question par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente surtout si l'on tient compte de la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans In Re Storgoff, [1945] R.C.S. 526. Le droit pr\u00e9valant sous l'Union, transitoirement maintenu par l'art. 129 de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'a pas juridiction sur les proc\u00e9dures de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle.\nJurisdiction\u2014Writ of prohibition in criminal matters\u2014Objection to jurisdiction of Sessions Court to hear complaints under the Income Tax Act\u2014Competency of Superior Court to issue writ\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 2, 424, 680.\nThe respondent was summoned before the Court of Sessions to answer complaints under the Dominion Income Tax Act. He objected to the jurisdiction of the Court, and prior to the date set for the preliminary inquiry obtained the issue of a writ of prohibition suspending the proceedings. The Minister, by a declinatory exception, objected to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to issue a writ of prohibition against a Court of criminal jurisdiction in a criminal matter. The exception was dismissed. The Court of Queen's Bench, by a majority decision, found that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the ground that the judgment dismissing the declinatory exception was a judgment in a criminal matter from which no appeal was provided for under the Criminal Code. This Court, [1962] S.C.R. 588, allowed the Minister's appeal and returned the case to the Court of Queen's Bench to hear the appeal on the merits. That Court, by a majority judgment, found that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to issue writs of prohibition in a criminal matter by virtue of pre-Confederation statutes which had neither been expressly nor implicitly repealed by Parliament. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the writ of prohibition annulled.\nThe expressions \"Every Superior Court of criminal jurisdiction and every Court of Appeal\" found in s. 424 of the Criminal Code, which confers on these Courts the jurisdiction relating to procedure in criminal matters, are defined in ss. 2(14) and 2(12) of the Code as the Court of Queen's Bench (Crown Side) and the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side), respectively, both in the exercise of their criminal jurisdiction. The Superior Court is excluded from the provisions of s. 424. It must be inferred that Parliament does not recognize any more this jurisdiction which the Superior Court had in criminal matters by virtue of pre-Confederation statutes.\nThe provisions of Part XXIII of the Code support the proposition that the Parliament has absorbed all the jurisdiction respecting writs of prohibition in criminal matters. Section 680 of the Code provides that this part applies to proceedings in criminal matters by way of certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus and prohibition. Since the provisions and parts of the Code form a whole, it was not necessary to repeat in this part what was the result of the provisions of s. 424 as completed by ss. 2(12) and 2(14), which do not include the Superior Court. In short, the Parliament has legislated on the writ of prohibition in criminal matters both as to the jurisdiction of first instance and the jurisdiction on appeal, and this legislation does not recognize the competence of the Superior Court. The pre-Confederation law is not in harmony any more with the subsequent law adopted by competent authority, especially if the decision of In Re Storgoff, [1945] S.C.R. 526, is taken into account. The law under the Union, transitorily maintained by s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act, has been abrogated and the Superior Court has no jurisdiction over proceedings by way of prohibition in criminal matters.\nAPPEAL d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, affirmant un jugement du Juge Reid.

Les appelants se pourvoient maintenant \u00e0 l'encontre de ce dernier jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine (Division d'appel).\nA venir jusqu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans In re Storgoff4 la jurisprudence attribuait \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du Qu\u00e9bec une juridiction sur les brefs de pr\u00e9rogative en mati\u00e8res criminelles comme en mati\u00e8res civiles. C'est qu'on consid\u00e9rait que ces brefs de pr\u00e9rogative \u00e9taient des brefs d'ordre civil m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient incidents \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res criminelles. Depuis In re Storgoff, supra, on consid\u00e8re qu'un bref de prohibition est une proc\u00e9dure civile ou criminelle selon la mati\u00e8re \u00e0 laquelle il se rattache. La pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9, admise en Cour d'Appel par la majorit\u00e9, rejet\u00e9e par M. le Juge Bissonnette, dissident, aussi bien que par M. le Juge Casey lors du premier appel5 est que m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 le bref de prohibition est, en raison de la mati\u00e8re \u00e0 laquelle il se rattache, une proc\u00e9dure de nature criminelle, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction en vertu de ces statuts ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 1867 et non abrog\u00e9s depuis. Telle est la question qui nous est soumise.\nAinsi qu'il appert des pr\u00e9ambules pr\u00e9fa\u00e7ant les chapitres 37, 38 et 41 du Statut 12-Victoria sanctionn\u00e9s le m\u00eame jour sous l'Union en 1849, la L\u00e9gislature du Bas-Canada proc\u00e9da alors \u00e0 changer et r\u00e9former le syst\u00e8me judiciaire du Bas-Canada et \u00e0 d\u00e9finir, entre autres, le mode de proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9 dans les cours de justice relativement aux brefs de pr\u00e9rogative. Les dispositions pertinentes de cette l\u00e9gislation peuvent \u00eatre ainsi r\u00e9sum\u00e9es.\nAu chapitre 37, intitul\u00e9 \u00abActe pour \u00e9tablir une cour ayant jurisdiction en appel et en mati\u00e8res criminelles, pour le Bas-Canada\u00bb, on constitue la Cour du banc de la reine \u00e0 laquelle on donne une juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8res civiles et criminelles, et de premi\u00e8re instance en mati\u00e8res criminelles, lui accordant \u00e0 ces fins tous les pouvoirs jusqu'alors attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait avant la Cour du banc de la reine. On a donc la Cour du banc de la reine, Division d'appel ou Crown side, suivant qu'on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 sa juridiction d'appel tant en mati\u00e8res civiles ou criminelles, ou de premi\u00e8re instance en mati\u00e8res criminelles, respectivement.\nAu chapitre 38, intitul\u00e9 \u00abActe pour amender les lois relatives aux cours de juridiction civile en premi\u00e8re instance, dans le Bas-Canada\u00bb, on cr\u00e9e la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 laquelle on transf\u00e8re et conf\u00e8re la juridiction civile de premi\u00e8re instance jusqu'alors exerc\u00e9e par la Cour du banc de la reine, avec tous les pouvoirs qu'avait celle-ci \u00aben mati\u00e8res civiles mais non en mati\u00e8res criminelles\u00bb. De plus, on lui transf\u00e8re et conf\u00e8re \u00e9galement le droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le exerc\u00e9 jusqu'alors par la Cour du banc de la reine sur toutes les Cours, sauf \u00e9videmment la Cour du banc de la reine; cette juridiction s'\u00e9tendant \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et \u00e0 ses Juges et pouvant \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e durant les termes ou les vacances.\nAu chapitre 41, intitul\u00e9 \u00abActe pour d\u00e9finir le mode des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 adopter dans les cours de justice du Bas-Canada dans les mati\u00e8res relatives \u00e0 la protection et \u00e0 la r\u00e9gie des droits de corporation et aux writs de pr\u00e9rogative, et pour d'autres fins y mentionn\u00e9es\u00bb, on statue que tous les \u00abwrits\u00bb \u00e9maneront de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et qu'il y aura un droit d'appel \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine (Division d'appel) dans tous les cas, sauf dans le cas de certiorari.\nLa juridiction et les pouvoirs ainsi attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure lui furent conserv\u00e9s substantiellement dans la m\u00eame forme en 1860, par le Statut 23-Victoria ch. 78 et 89 et \u00e9taient tenants en 1867 au moment de l'adoption de l'Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, 1867, 30-31 Victoria ch. 3 . Si, par ailleurs, on tient compte du fait que jusqu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision dans In re Storgoff, supra, on consid\u00e9rait que les brefs de pr\u00e9rogative \u00e9taient des brefs civils m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 ils se rattachent \u00e0 des mati\u00e8res criminelles, on peut se demander si, en donnant alors cette juridiction et ces pouvoirs, sur le sujet, \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure,\u2014comme elle avait, d'ailleurs, le droit de ce faire\u2014la L\u00e9gislature du Bas-Canada manifestait vraiment une intention de lui donner, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, une juridiction en mati\u00e8res criminelles plut\u00f4t qu'une juridiction en mati\u00e8res civiles. Quoi qu'il soit de l'intention de la L\u00e9gislature du Bas-Canada ou, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, de l'effet de cette l\u00e9gislation jusqu'\u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, il reste que ces pouvoirs, et ce droit de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de les exercer en mati\u00e8res criminelles, transitoirement maintenus par la nouvelle constitution de 1867 (art. 129 ), relevaient d\u00e9sormais, \u00e0 compter d'icelle, de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du Parlement (art. 91 para. 27). C'est dire que, depuis lors, la L\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec ne peut, sur le sujet, poser aucun acte l\u00e9gislatif. Et comme toute l\u00e9gislature est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer dans les. limites de sa comp\u00e9tence, toute l\u00e9gislation adopt\u00e9e par la L\u00e9gislature du Qu\u00e9bec depuis la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, sur le sujet du droit de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et des brefs de pr\u00e9rogative au moyen desquels ce droit s'exerce, ne saurait en principe s'interpr\u00e9ter comme s'\u00e9tendant aux mati\u00e8res criminelles ou, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, \u00eatre tenue comme valide sous cet aspect. La constitution, le maintien et l'organisation des cours provinciales de juridiction criminelle sont de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la L\u00e9gislature (art. 92 para. 14), mais seul le Parlement peut attribuer \u00e0 ces cours provinciales une juridiction criminelle. Aussi bien suffit-il \u00e0 la solution de la question qui nous est soumise d'examiner la l\u00e9gislation que le Parlement peut avoir adopt\u00e9e sur le sujet.\nSi l'on tient que cette juridiction et ces pouvoirs attribu\u00e9s sous l'Union \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure s'appliquaient en mati\u00e8res criminelles comme en mati\u00e8res civiles, on ne saurait s'\u00e9tonner de ne trouver aucune l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale les abrogeant in toto et sans que ne soit faite la distinction que requi\u00e8rent les limites de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement. On ne trouve, par ailleurs, aucune loi du Parlement r\u00e9f\u00e9rant sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 ces statuts d'avant Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour abroger cette juridiction et ces pouvoirs en ce qui concerne leur application en mati\u00e8res criminelles.\nIl est manifeste cependant que, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, le droit criminel, pr\u00e9valant jusqu'en 1867 dans les diverses juridictions territoriales depuis r\u00e9unies pour constituer ce qui est maintenant la juridiction territoriale de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration canadienne, a consid\u00e9rablement \u00e9volu\u00e9 durant cette p\u00e9riode bient\u00f4t s\u00e9culaire. Cette \u00e9volution, orient\u00e9e vers l'uniformit\u00e9 d'un droit criminel canadien, s'est accomplie par des changements r\u00e9sultant express\u00e9ment ou implicitement de diverses dispositions l\u00e9gislatives successivement adopt\u00e9es au cours des ans par le Parlement. Ce droit perfectionn\u00e9, non pas par de simples refontes (consolidations), mais par deux codifications, appara\u00eet aujourd'hui dans cet ensemble de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives que le Parlement a syst\u00e9matiquement r\u00e9unies dans un seul corps\u2014le Code Criminel de 1953\u2014apr\u00e8s avoir apport\u00e9 au Code Criminel pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent des additions, soustractions, modifications, aussi bien que des changements dans la structure. La relative interd\u00e9pendance des dispositions ainsi que des diverses parties du Code Criminel a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9e dans Welch v. The King6 o\u00f9 r\u00e9f\u00e9rant, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, aux pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'art. 873, cette Cour disait:\nLike many others in the Code, they remain subject to qualifications and restrictions implicitly and necessarily flowing from other provisions of the same Act.\nCes consid\u00e9rations doivent \u00eatre retenues dans l'examen des dispositions du Code Criminel relativement \u00e0 la question qui nous occupe, soit: (i) Celles de l'art. 424 conf\u00e9rant aux cours y d\u00e9sign\u00e9es le pouvoir d'\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de cour s'appliquajit \u00e0 toutes mati\u00e8res de leur comp\u00e9tence et (ii) celles apparaissant \u00e0 la Partie XXIII du Code intitul\u00e9e: Recours extraordinaires.\nLes dispositions pertinentes de l'art. 424 prescrivent que:\n424. (1) Toute cour sup\u00e9rieure de juridiction criminelle, ainsi que toute cour d'appel, peut en tout temps, avec l'assentiment de la majorit\u00e9 de ses juges pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 une r\u00e9union tenue \u00e0 cette fin, \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de cour non incompatibles avec la pr\u00e9sente loi ou quelque autre loi du Parlement du Canada, et les r\u00e8gles ainsi \u00e9tablies s'appliquent \u00e0 toute poursuite, proc\u00e9dure, action ou appel, selon le cas, de la comp\u00e9tence de ladite cour, intent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute mati\u00e8re de nature criminelle ou d\u00e9coulant de quelque semblable poursuite, proc\u00e9dure, action ou appel, ou s'y rattachant.\n(2) Les r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9vues par le paragraphe (1) peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablies\na) ................................................................\nb) ................................................................\nc) pour r\u00e9glementer, en mati\u00e8re criminelle, la plaidoirie, la pratique et la proc\u00e9dure devant la cour, y compris les actes de proc\u00e9dure concernant les mandamus, certiorari, habeas corpus, prohibition, cautionnement et frais, et les actes de proc\u00e9dure sur une demande, \u00e0 une cour des poursuites sommaires, d'exposer une cause pour l'opinion de la cour \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, ordonnance, d\u00e9cision ou autre proc\u00e9dure; et\nd) ................................................................\n(3) Lorsque, dans une province, des r\u00e8gles de cour sur des mati\u00e8res criminelles sont en vigueur au moment de l'entr\u00e9e en application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ces r\u00e8gles demeurent en vigueur sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles peuvent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es ou abrog\u00e9es, \u00e0 l'occasion, par la cour que le pr\u00e9sent article autorise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles.\n(4) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n(5) Nonobstant les dispositions du pr\u00e9sent article, le gouverneur en conseil peut \u00e9tablir les dispositions qu'il juge opportunes pour assurer l'uniformit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles de cour en mati\u00e8re criminelle, et toutes r\u00e8gles uniformes \u00e9tablies sous l'autorit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent paragraphe auront cours et seront ex\u00e9cutoires comme si elles \u00e9taient \u00e9dict\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente loi.\nOn notera que peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir adopt\u00e9 ses premi\u00e8res lois concernant la proc\u00e9dure dans les causes criminelles, en 1869, aux chapitres 29 et suivants, 32-33 Victoria et, en 1886, aux chapitres 174 et suivants, 49-Victoria, le Parlement adoptait en 1889, au chapitre 40, 52-Victoria, un \u00abActe concernant les r\u00e8gles de cour au sujet des affaires criminelles\u00bb \u00e9dictant particuli\u00e8rement:\n1. Toute cour sup\u00e9rieure du Canada ayant juridiction en mati\u00e8res criminelles, pourra en tout temps, avec le concours d'une majorit\u00e9 de ses juges pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 toute r\u00e9union tenue \u00e0 cet effet, \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de cour, non incompatibles avec les statuts du Canada, qui s'appliqueront \u00e0 toutes les proc\u00e9dures se rattachant \u00e0 toute poursuite, proc\u00e9dure ou action intent\u00e9e au sujet de toute affaire d'une nature criminelle, ou r\u00e9sultant ou d\u00e9coulant d'une affaire criminelle, et particuli\u00e8rement pour tous ou aucun des objets suivants:\u2014\na) .....................................................................................\nb) Pour r\u00e9gler la plaidoirie, la pratique et la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour en mati\u00e8res criminelles et concernant les mandamus, certiorari, habeas corpus, la prohibition, le quo warranto, l'admission \u00e0 caution et les d\u00e9pens;\nc) ................................................................\n2...................................................................\nCette loi ne comportait pas de dispositions similaires \u00e0 celles qui apparaissent aux paragraphes 3 et 5 de l'art. 424. A cette \u00e9poque, comme aujourd'hui suivant le chapitre 15 des Statuts R\u00e9vis\u00e9s de 1941, on classifiait les tribunaux de la province en trois cat\u00e9gories: les tribunaux de juridiction civile, ceux de juridiction criminelle et ceux de juridiction mixte; la Cour du banc de la reine ayant une juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8res criminelles et civiles et juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance en mati\u00e8res criminelles; et la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait une Cour de juridiction civile. Cf. Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1888, Vol. I, Titre VI.\nLes dispositions de l'art. 424 doivent \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9es par celles de l'art. 2 du Code Criminel. Selon l'art. 2(14), l'expression \u00abcour sup\u00e9rieure de juridiction criminelle\u00bb d\u00e9signe \u00abla Cour du banc de la reine\u00bb et, selon l'art. 2(12), l'expression \u00abcour d'appel\u00bb signifie \u00abla Cour du banc de la reine, Division d'appel\u00bb. De toute \u00e9vidence, dans le contexte de l'art. 424, on doit entendre par \u00abToute cour sup\u00e9rieure de juridiction criminelle, ainsi que toute cour d'appel,\u00bb la Cour du banc de la reine (Crown side) et la Cour du banc de la reine (Division d'appel), respectivement, toutes deux dans l'exercice de leur juridiction criminelle. D'o\u00f9 l'on voit que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure est exclue de la disposition de l'art. 424.\nLe Parlement, \u00e0 mon avis, a, par les dispositions de cet art. 424, int\u00e9gralement absorb\u00e9 toute la juridiction en mati\u00e8res criminelles sur tous les sujets relativement auxquels il attribue, d'une part, \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine (Division d'appel) et \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine (Crown side) le pouvoir d'\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de cour et, d'autre part, au gouverneur en conseil le pouvoir d'assurer l'uniformit\u00e9 de ces r\u00e8gles de cour par tout le Canada. En d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant, au paragraphe 1 que\n... les r\u00e8gles ainsi \u00e9tablies s'appliquent \u00e0 toute poursuite, proc\u00e9dure, action ou appel, selon le cas, de la comp\u00e9tence de ladite cour, intent\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de toute mati\u00e8re de nature criminelle ou d\u00e9coulant de quelque semblable poursuite, proc\u00e9dure, action ou appel, ou s'y rattachant.\nle Parlement reconna\u00eet et affirme la comp\u00e9tence des cours mentionn\u00e9es en l'article sur les sujets qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s. De plus, si l'on consid\u00e8re que l'article ne fait aucune mention de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, qu'en l'absence d'aucun texte \u00e0 cet effet les r\u00e8gles \u00e9tablies par les membres d'une Cour ne r\u00e9gissent pas la conduite des affaires venant devant une autre Cour que la leur, que les r\u00e8gles autoris\u00e9es par l'article n'ont en fait d'application que pour la r\u00e9glementation des affaires venant devant les cours y mentionn\u00e9es, et si, de plus, on tient compte du souci du Parlement de pourvoir, par les dispositions du paragraphe 5, \u00e0 l'uniformit\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles que les diff\u00e9rentes cours provinciales autoris\u00e9es par l'article peuvent \u00e9tablir en mati\u00e8res criminelles, on ne peut qu'inf\u00e9rer que le Parlement ne reconna\u00eet plus cette juridiction que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pouvait avoir en mati\u00e8res criminelles sur les sujets mentionn\u00e9s, en vertu des statuts d'avant Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration.\nLes dispositions de la Partie XXIII supportent la proposition que le Parlement a int\u00e9gralement absorb\u00e9 la juridiction sur les brefs de prohibition en mati\u00e8res criminelles.\nL'art. 680, disposition nouvelle ins\u00e9r\u00e9e au Code de 1953, statue que cette partie s'applique aux proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re criminelle sous forme de certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus et de prohibition. All\u00e9guant, cependant, qu'aucune disposition de cette partie ne d\u00e9signe nomm\u00e9ment la cour ayant juridiction en la mati\u00e8re, l'intim\u00e9 en d\u00e9duit qu'aucune de ces dispositions n'abroge la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les dispositions et les parties du Code Criminel forment un tout. Il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 mon avis, de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter en cette partie ce qui r\u00e9sultait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des dispositions de l'art. 424, telles que com- pl\u00e9t\u00e9es par l'art. 2(12) et 2(14); ces dispositions n'incluent pas la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nDe plus, l'art. 691 de la Partie XXIII du Code Criminel prescrit ce qui suit:\n691. (1) Appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour d'appel contre une d\u00e9cision qui accorde ou refuse le secours demand\u00e9 dans des proc\u00e9dures par voie de mandamus, de certiorari ou de prohibition.\n(2) Les dispositions de la Partie XVIII s'appliquent, mutatis mutandis, aux appels pr\u00e9vus au pr\u00e9sent article.\nSuivant l'art. 586(1) de la Partie XVIII, le d\u00e9lai d'appel est le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles de la Cour d'Appel, lequel, suivant la r\u00e8gle 3, est de quinze jours. De plus, et suivant l'article 586(2), ce d\u00e9lai peut \u00eatre prorog\u00e9 \u00e0 toute \u00e9poque par la Cour d'Appel ou l'un de ses Juges.\nD'autre part, au moment o\u00f9 l'Acte de 1867 est venu en vigueur, la proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 l'exercice de la comp\u00e9tence que pouvait avoir la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, cour de juridiction civile, \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le premier Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, adopt\u00e9 sous l'Union et mis en vigueur le 28 juin 1867. Suivant les dispositions de l'art. 1033 de ce premier Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, l'appel d'un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en mati\u00e8re de prohibition devait \u00eatre log\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9lai de quarante jours \u00e0 compter du prononc\u00e9 du jugement et, pass\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai, le droit d'appel \u00e9tait p\u00e9rim\u00e9. Deux jours apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de ce Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, l'Acte de 1867 est lui-m\u00eame venu en vigueur et, d\u00e8s lors, il n'\u00e9tait plus loisible \u00e0 la L\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec de faire acte de l\u00e9gislation relativement au bref de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Par la suite, le premier Code de proc\u00e9dure civile fut remplac\u00e9 par le Code de proc\u00e9dure civile actuellement en vigueur. Suivant les dispositions de l'art. 1006 de ce nouveau Code, le d\u00e9lai d'appel en mati\u00e8re de prohibition est de trente jours et ce d\u00e9lai ne peut \u00eatre prorog\u00e9. D'o\u00f9 l'on voit que les dispositions du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, que ce soit celles de l'ancien ou du nouveau, sont en conflit, sur cette question du droit d'appel, avec les dispositions de l'art. 691 du Code Criminel; et les deux ne peuvent, cons\u00e9quemment, coexister.\nEn somme, le Parlement a l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le bref de prohibition en mati\u00e8re criminelle, tant en ce qui concerne la juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance que la juridiction d'appel et cette l\u00e9gislation ne reconna\u00eet pas de comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Le droit ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, ne se concilie plus avec le droit r\u00e9sultant de la l\u00e9gislation depuis adopt\u00e9e sur la question par l'autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, surtout si, dans la consid\u00e9ration de la question, on tient compte de la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans In re Storgoff, supra.\nAussi bien, d'accord avec MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Casey de la Cour du banc de la reine (Division d'appel), et en tout respect pour les tenants de l'opinion contraire, je dirais que le droit pr\u00e9valant sous l'Union, transitoirement maintenu par l'art. 129 de l'Acte de 1867, a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 et que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n'a pas juridiction sur les proc\u00e9dures de prohibition en mati\u00e8res criminelles.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais le jugement a quo et, statuant \u00e0 nouveau, accorderais les conclusions de l'exception tion d\u00e9clinatoire; d\u00e9clarerais que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait sans juridiction pour \u00e9mettre le bref de prohibition; annulerais ce bref; d\u00e9bouterais l'intim\u00e9 de ses conclusions, sauf \u00e0 se pourvoir; le condamnerais \u00e0 tous les d\u00e9pens et permettrais aux appelants de retirer le d\u00e9p\u00f4t consign\u00e9 avec l'exception d\u00e9clinatoire.

Gibson Holdings Limited (Respondent) Appellant;\nand\nPrincipal Investments Limited (Applicant) Respondent.\n1964: March 16; 1964: April 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Lease\u2014Clause providing for renewal for successive 21-year terms in perpetuity\u2014Validity of clause.\nA motion was brought by the respondent company for a declaration that the covenant for renewal contained in its lease from the appellant company was a perpetually renewable clause and that the renewable term of 21 years, subject to the arbitration provision as to rent, was for an indefinite number of additional successive 21-year terms in perpetuity. The reversion was presently vested in the appellant company which attacked the validity of the clause. Both the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal held that the clause was valid.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was no dispute that the lease was intended to be renewable in perpetuity and that clauses of this kind, if expressed in terms of an option to renew, do not offend the rule against perpetuities. The appellant's contention that this case was different because the renewal clause imposed an absolute obligation on the lessor to grant a new lease including the covenants for renewal (subject to arbitration as to rent) and a like obligation on the part of the lessee to accept the new lease failed. There was no logical distinction between a present contract for successive renewals in perpetuity and options to achieve the same end.\nThe further submission that this lease created a term which was indefinite or infinite in time and was in effect a term in perpetuity also failed. This was a lease for 21 years. When that term expired a new lease was drawn on the same terms except as to rent and that lease, in turn, had a term certain of 21 years.\nGooderham & Worts, Ltd. v. C.B.C., [1947] A.C. 66, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Fraser J. Appeal dismissed.\nC.E. Woollcombe, for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and J.J. Carthy, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by JUDSON J.:\u2014The subject-matter of this appeal is a clause in a lease which provides for renewal for successive twenty-one year terms in perpetuity, subject to arbitration provisions as to rent. The reversion is now vested in the appellant company which attacks the validity of the clause. Both Fraser J., at first instance, and the Court of Appeal[2] have held that the clause is valid.\nThe lease was made by John Elias Gibson and Principal Investments Limited for a term of 21 years from December 15, 1949. The renewal clause is in these terms:\nAnd further, that the said lessor, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns will at the end or expiration of said term hereby granted and of every subsequent term of twenty-one years granted in pursuance of these presents, and whenever the rent for said future term shall have been fixed by arbitration as aforesaid, at the cost and charges of the said Lessee, its successors, as aforesaid, make execute and deliver unto the said Lessee, its successors and assigns, and that the said Lessee, its successors and assigns, will accept a new and further lease of the hereby demised premises with the appurtenances for the same and containing the same covenants and stipulations, including covenant for renewal, as are contained in this present lease (save only that the yearly rent of the said premises be the rent ascertained or agreed upon as stipulated by arbitration, as hereinbefore mentioned.)\nPrincipal Investments Limited moved under R. 611 for a declaration of its rights. Fraser J. made the following declaration:\nTHIS COURT DOTH DECLARE that the renewal clause in the lease between John Elias Gibson and Principal Investments Limited dated the 15th day of December, 1949 is a valid renewal clause for additional successive twenty-one year terms in perpetuity subject to the arbitration provisions as to rent contained in the said lease, AND DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE THE SAME ACCORDINGLY.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal from this judgment and, in my opinion, the further appeal to this Court must also be dismissed.\nThere is no dispute between the parties that the lease was intended to be renewable in perpetuity and that clauses of this kind, if expressed in terms of an option to renew, do not offend the rule against perpetuities (Morris and Leach\u2014The Rule against Perpetuities, 2d ed., p. 223). The appellant says that this case is different because the renewal clause imposes an absolute obligation on the lessor to grant a new lease including the covenants for renewal (subject to arbitration as to rent) and a like obligation on the part of the lessee to accept the new lease.\nThere is a thorough historical survey of the case law on this subject in the reasons of Fraser J. which I wish to adopt. He is unable to find any logical distinction between a present contract for successive renewals in perpetuity and options to achieve the same end, and I agree with his conclusion. Further, Gooderham & Worts Ltd. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation[3], where the obligations of lessor and lessee concerning renewal were expressed in mutual covenants to grant and accept a lease, is against any such distinction.\nThe further submission that this lease creates a term which is indefinite or infinite in time and is in effect a term in perpetuity also fails. This is a lease for twenty-one years. When that term expires a new lease is drawn on the same terms except as to rent and that lease, in turn, has a term certain of twenty-one years.\nThe appellant also took objection that the application for a declaration of rights was premature, the lease not expiring until December 15, 1970, and that in the circumstances, the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction under R. 611. Both Fraser J. and the Court of Appeal ruled against this contention and we informed the respondent at the hearing that we did not need to hear him on this point. We agree with both Courts that the jurisdiction was properly exercised.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Calvin, Mackenzie, Williston & Swackhamer, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\n[1] [1963] 2 O.R. 507, 40 D.L.R.

Le p\u00e8re d\u00e9tenait une police d'assurance \u00e9mise par les appelantes et qui contenait une clause omnibus. Sur refus des assureurs d'accepter la responsabilit\u00e9, une action en garantie leur fut intent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s.\nLa police d'assurance en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise originairement en 1950 en faveur de l'intim\u00e9-p\u00e8re relativement \u00e0 une automobile Chevrolet 1949 dont il \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire. Pour obtenir cette police, il avait d\u00fb signer une formule, fournie par les assureurs, aux termes de laquelle il repr\u00e9sentait qu'il \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 de l'automobile. Cette police fut renouvel\u00e9e d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e alors qu'elle fut amend\u00e9e en 1953 pour couvrir une Chevrolet 1952 achet\u00e9e \u00e0 cette date et en paiements partiels de laquelle la Chevrolet 1949 fut donn\u00e9e au vendeur. C'est le fils qui signa en son propre nom l'offre d'achat de cette automobile; c'est \u00e0 ses nom et adresse que fut \u00e9mise la facture du vendeur; c'est lui qui signa le contrat de finance relatif \u00e0 la balance impay\u00e9e sur le prix de vente; c'est lui qui paya par la suite la mensualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 ce contrat. A la suite d'un accident survenu quelques mois avant et qui avait caus\u00e9 la d\u00e9molition compl\u00e8te d'une automobile appartenant au fils, le p\u00e8re avait mis \u00e0 la disposition de ce dernier la Chevrolet 1949 et s'\u00e9tait achet\u00e9 pour son propre usage une Pontiac. Ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la date de l'achat de la Chevrolet 1952, il \u00e9tait de la connaissance du p\u00e8re ainsi que du fils que les compagnies d'assurance refusaient de consentir au fils des assurances automobiles.\nLes assureurs plaid\u00e8rent que la Chevrolet 1952 n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni en la possession, ni sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le du p\u00e8re mais bien de son fils; et qu'il y avait eu changement de la nature et de l'\u00e9tendue du risque.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s jugea que le p\u00e8re n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable dans la Chevrolet 1952 et n'en \u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire, et qu'il y avait eu un changement mat\u00e9riel dans le risque. Il rejeta les deux actions intent\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9s. Ce jugement fut renvers\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel qui jugea que le p\u00e8re, qui en fait \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9, avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable m\u00eame s'il n'\u00e9tait pas le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire et qu'il n'y avait eu par cons\u00e9quent aucun changement dans la nature et l'\u00e9tendue du risque. Les assureurs en appel\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et les actions rejet\u00e9es, le Juge Abbott \u00e9tant dissident.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux et Judson: Sans doute le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire de la Chevrolet 1952 mais fausse \u00e9tait la repr\u00e9sentation qu'il \u00e9tait vraiment le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 au sens de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142. Ni au sens du droit commun, ni au sens plus large de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, le p\u00e8re n'avait droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la possession, l'usage, la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de la Chevrolet 1952 ou le pouvoir de permettre \u00e0 autrui de l'utiliser, tel que le para. 23 de l'art. 2 de cette Loi d\u00e9finit le mot propri\u00e9taire. Admettre comme bien fond\u00e9 le recours des intim\u00e9s serait imposer aux appelantes une obligation que manifestement elles n'avaient jamais consenti d'assumer. Non seulement on ne peut trouver dans les actes des appelantes une intention nette et claire de couvrir la nullit\u00e9 de la police d'assurance, mais la ligne de conduite qu'elles ont suivie traduit une intention toute contraire.\nPer Ritchie J.: Even if it be accepted that the father had an insurable interest in the 1952 Chevrolet, it was still an interest materially different from his interest in the car which was originally insured. The same applied if the case is put upon the footing that the father's interest was that of a registered owner. There was therefore a material change in the nature of the insurable interest, and as there was no statement or endorsement on the policy covering this change the insurors were relieved from liability by the provisions of statutory condition 6(d).\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: The interest of the father in the 1952 Chevrolet was that of unconditional ownership and there was no material change in the nature of the insurable interest of the insured in the automobile within the meaning of statutory condition 6. From the time of its purchase, the father was the registered owner of the 1952 Chevrolet. The fact that the purchase was negotiated by the son, that the major portion of the balance on the purchase price was advanced by him, and that he appeared to have exclusive use of the car, was not sufficient to establish that he had any right of ownership in the new vehicle. It followed that statutory condition 6 had no application.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement du juge Pager. Appel maintenu, le Juge Abbott dissident.\nA. M. Watt, Q.C., et M. Rioux, pour les d\u00e9fenderesses, appelantes.\nJ. Duchesnes, pour les demandeurs, intim\u00e9s, Le jugement du Juge en Chef Taschereau et des juges Fauteux et Judson fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014Le 4 juillet 1953, une collision se produisit, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, entre une automobile conduite par son propri\u00e9taire, Maurice Svamvour, et un Chevrolet 1952 enregistr\u00e9 au nom d'Arthur-R. Lafl\u00e8che sr et conduit par son fils Arthur-R. Lafl\u00e8che jr. Au moment de cet accident, Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re d\u00e9tenait des appelantes une police d'assurance-automobile dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice s'\u00e9tendait \u00e0 toute personne utilisant le v\u00e9hicule avec permission de l'assur\u00e9.\nCet accident donna lieu \u00e0 quatre actions:\u2014Svamvour poursuivit les deux Lafl\u00e8che en dommages; la compagnie Service Fire Insurance Company of New York poursuivit Lafl\u00e8che jr pour le recouvrement d'une indemnit\u00e9 par elle pay\u00e9e avec subrogation \u00e0 Svamvour, son assur\u00e9, pour dommages \u00e0 l'automobile d'icelui; enfin, sur le refus des appelantes d'accepter une responsabilit\u00e9 sous la police d'assurance par elles \u00e9mise \u00e0 Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re, une action en garantie leur fut intent\u00e9e par les deux Lafl\u00e8che et Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re prit, contre elles, une action personnelle pour dommages au Chevrolet 1952 enregistr\u00e9 en son nom.\nCes quatre causes furent entendues par feu M. le Juge Pager. La preuve faite dans chacune fut, du consentement de tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, commune \u00e0 toutes les causes. Par jugement subs\u00e9quemment rendu, le 15 f\u00e9vrier 1960, dans chacune, les actions intent\u00e9es par Svamvour et Service Fire Insurance Company of New York furent maintenues alors que les deux actions prises contre les appelantes furent renvoy\u00e9es.\nTrois de ces d\u00e9cisions furent port\u00e9es en appel et modifi\u00e9es par des arr\u00eats rendus par la Cour du banc de la reine le 30 avril 1962. Le jugement dans la cause de Svamvour contre les deux Lafl\u00e8che fut infirm\u00e9 quant au p\u00e8re et confirm\u00e9 quant au fils; sur cette action, il y a chose jug\u00e9e. Le jugement sur l'action en garantie des Lafl\u00e8che et le jugement sur l'action personnelle de Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re furent infirm\u00e9s et ces deux actions dirig\u00e9es contre les appelantes furent accueillies.\nD'o\u00f9 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour relatif \u00e0 ces deux derniers jugements de la Cour d'Appel2.\nLa police d'assurance sur laquelle se fondent les recours des intim\u00e9s contre les appelantes a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise originairement, le 11 mai 1950, en faveur d'Arthur-R. Lafl\u00e8che sr, relativement \u00e0 une automobile Chevrolet 1949 dont il \u00e9tait le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire. Pour obtenir cette police d'assurance, il avait d\u00fb signer une formule, fournie par les assureurs, aux termes de laquelle le signataire repr\u00e9sente qu'il est le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 de l'automobile. Tenante pour un an, cette police fut par la suite renouvel\u00e9e d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e alors qu'advenant le 28 mai 1953, elle fut amend\u00e9e pour couvrir un Chevrolet 1952 achet\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour et en paiement partiel duquel le Chevrolet 1949 fut donn\u00e9 au vendeur. Sujet \u00e0 ce seul amendement, la police \u00e9mise en 1950 en faveur de Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re se continua et ce, sur la base de la d\u00e9claration faite lors de son \u00e9mission que l'assur\u00e9 est le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 de la voiture indiqu\u00e9e en la police. Un peu plus d'un mois apr\u00e8s cet incident se produisit l'accident donnant lieu aux actions dirig\u00e9es contre les appelantes.\nNiant toute responsabilit\u00e9, elles plaid\u00e8rent particuli\u00e8rement que le Chevrolet 1952 n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni en la possession, ni sous la garde ou le contr\u00f4le de Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re mais bien de son fils; qu'en raison d'accidents ant\u00e9rieurs en lesquels celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9, il ne pouvait pas obtenir d'assurance des appelantes ou de toute autre compagnie d'assurance d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00abtariff company\u00bb; qu'on avait, par erreur ou \u00e0 dessein, mal repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ou non d\u00e9voil\u00e9 aux appelantes la v\u00e9ritable situation quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la possession, la garde et le contr\u00f4le du Chevrolet 1952; qu'il y avait eu changement de la nature et de l'\u00e9tendue du risque et qu'elles auraient refus\u00e9 ce risque et annul\u00e9 la police eussent-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9es de la v\u00e9ritable situation. Les appelantes conclurent \u00e0 l'annulation de la police et au rejet des deux actions prises contre elles.\nLe Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure fit une revue et appr\u00e9ciation minutieuses de la preuve. Il jugea que si Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re \u00e9tait, lors de l'\u00e9mission de la police en 1950, le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire et, comme il l'avait alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 du Chevrolet 1949, c'\u00e9tait son fils qui avait exclusivement le droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aussi bien qu'\u00e0 la possession, l'usage, la garde et le contr\u00f4le du Chevrolet 1952 enregistr\u00e9 au nom de son p\u00e8re. Cette conclusion est amplement support\u00e9e par la preuve. C'est Lafl\u00e8che jr qui signa, en son propre nom, l'offre d'achat de cette automobile; c'est \u00e0 ses nom et adresse que fut \u00e9mise la facture du vendeur; c'est lui qui signa le contrat de finance relatif \u00e0 la balance impay\u00e9e sur le prix de vente; c'est lui qui paya par la suite la mensualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 ce contrat. Le savant Juge n'attacha pas d'importance au fait que le Chevrolet 1949 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au vendeur en paiement de ce qui repr\u00e9sentait en fait moins de la moiti\u00e9 du prix du Chevrolet 1952; il consid\u00e9ra que si le p\u00e8re, banquier retir\u00e9 r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Ste-Ad\u00e8le-en-haut, n'avait pas fait don du Chevrolet 1949 \u00e0 son fils r\u00e9sidant et ayant ses affaires \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, il lui en avait abandonn\u00e9 l'usage, la possession et le contr\u00f4le et s'\u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame, pour obvier \u00e0 la privation de son Chevrolet 1949, achet\u00e9 un Pontiac pour son propre usage. En fait, c'est \u00e0 la suite d'un accident survenu le 29 novembre 1952 et causant, outre la perte d'une vie humaine, la d\u00e9molition compl\u00e8te d'une autre automobile alors conduite par le fils que Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re mit ainsi \u00e0 la disposition de ce dernier le Chevrolet 1949. Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re affirma dans son t\u00e9moignage qu'il avait donn\u00e9 instructions \u00e0 son fils de n\u00e9gocier, pour et au nom de son p\u00e8re, l'achat du Chevrolet 1952; le Juge au proc\u00e8s d\u00e9clara n'accorder aucune foi \u00e0 cette affirmation et la rejeta. Quant au fait de l'enregistrement du Chevrolet 1952 au nom du p\u00e8re, il appr\u00e9cia comme r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur le fait que la demande d'enregistrement avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par le fils dont la signature fut subs\u00e9quemment ratur\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e par celle du p\u00e8re. Retenant que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu'ant\u00e9rieurement au 28 mai 1953, date d'achat du Chevrolet 1952, le fils avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9 dans des accidents s\u00e9rieux et que les compagnies de l'Association canadienne des assureurs, dont les appelantes, refusaient de lui consentir une assurance-automobile, le Juge trouva dans ces faits la raison de l'enregistrement du Chevrolet 1952 au nom du p\u00e8re plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 celui du fils et la raison de l'omission, r\u00e9alis\u00e9e par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, de d\u00e9voiler aux appelantes le nom du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire et usager de ce Chevrolet. Il a not\u00e9 que c'est le fils qui, \u00e0 titre de membre d'une firme de courtiers d'assurance agissant pour les appelantes, avait personnellement vu \u00e0 effectuer, en leur nom, l'amendement qui fut fait \u00e0 la police d'assurance pour couvrir le Chevrolet 1952, et que non seulement le fils n'ignorait rien de la v\u00e9ritable situation quant au titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette automobile et quant \u00e0 l'impossibilit\u00e9 pour lui-m\u00eame d'obtenir, en son propre nom, de l'assurance des appelantes, mais, ajouta le Juge:\n\u2026 son omission de porter \u00e0 la connaissance des d\u00e9fenderesses le nom du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile Chevrolet 1952 constitue une r\u00e9ticence relative \u00e0 un changement tr\u00e8s important dans le risque qu'il cherchait \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 la charge des d\u00e9fenderesses, r\u00e9ticence qui a un caract\u00e8re frauduleux.\nD'autre part, retenant que le p\u00e8re avait express\u00e9ment admis qu'il \u00e9tait bien au courant de l'accident du 29 novembre 1952 dans lequel son fils avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9, le Juge exprima et motiva la conviction qu'il avait que le p\u00e8re n'ignorait pas l'attitude prise par les compagnies membres de l'Association canadienne des assureurs quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 pour son fils d'obtenir pour lui-m\u00eame de l'assurance-automobile. Il trouva singulier que le p\u00e8re n'ait pas confi\u00e9 \u00e0 son fils, mais \u00e0 une autre firme de courtiers, l'assurance de son Pontiac et il rejeta, comme \u00e9tant nettement contredite par la preuve, l'explication que le fils donna de ce fait. En somme, dit le Juge, relativement \u00e0 la police d'assurance couvrant le Chevrolet 1952:\nEn s'en remettant \u00e0 son fils d'obtenir ce changement dans la police \u00e9mise en sa faveur, en acceptant lui-m\u00eame ce changement ainsi qu'il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer qu'il l'a accept\u00e9, et en tenant par la suite de s'en pr\u00e9valoir pour demander l'ex\u00e9cution par les d\u00e9fenderesses des obligations qu'elles avaient souscrites en \u00e9mettant la police, Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re a fait siennes la r\u00e9ticence et l'omission susdites, qui ont eu pour effet que le contrat d'assurance est apparemment rest\u00e9 en vigueur, alors que, sans aucun doute, les d\u00e9fenderesses eussent express\u00e9ment mis fin \u00e0 ce contrat, si elles avaient connu la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Il en r\u00e9sulte donc que la police est devenue nulle d\u00e8s le 29 mai 1953.\nIl ressort enfin de l'appr\u00e9ciation qu'il fit des t\u00e9moins que le Juge accorda peu de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, si aucune, aux t\u00e9moignages des intim\u00e9s. Viola, en substance, les principaux motifs adopt\u00e9s par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance pour rejeter les actions des intim\u00e9s.\nEn Cour d'Appel, on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, pour consentir ce contrat d'assurance, les appelantes s'\u00e9taient limit\u00e9es \u00e0 demander \u00e0 Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re s'il \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9; qu'en fait, il l'\u00e9tait, et qu'\u00e0 ce titre \u00e0 tout le moins, il avait un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable, m\u00eame s'il n'\u00e9tait pas le v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire; que le fait que son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvait \u00eatre limit\u00e9 n'invalidait pas l'assurance; qu'en raison de la clause \u00e9tendant l'assurance aux personnes auxquelles l'assur\u00e9 pouvait permettre l'usage de l'automobile, il n'y avait eu aucun changement dans la nature et l'\u00e9tendue du risque.\nAvec le plus grand respect, il m'est impossible de partager ces vues et, d'accord avec les raisons exprim\u00e9es par le Juge au proc\u00e8s, je dirais que les deux actions prises contre les appelantes ne peuvent \u00eatre accueillies.\nIl ne s'agit pas en ce litige des obligations que peut encourir vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, en vertu de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 142, celui qui n'\u00e9tant pas propri\u00e9taire au sens \u00e9tendu de cette loi est enregistr\u00e9 comme tel au Bureau d'enregistrement des automobiles; et il importe peu \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la pr\u00e9sente cause que celui qui est ainsi enregistr\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire quand il ne l'est pas puisse, en certaines circonstances qui ne se pr\u00e9sentent pas en l'esp\u00e8ce, avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat assurable. Le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9bat est entre les assureurs et leur assur\u00e9. Et la question \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est de savoir si, en vertu du contrat d'assurance intervenu entre elles et Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re, les appelantes ont, au regard de la somme des faits accept\u00e9s comme prouv\u00e9s par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, des obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re et fils par suite de la police d'assurance.\nLe consentement donn\u00e9 par les appelantes \u00e0 ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu sur la repr\u00e9sentation de Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9. Manifestement cette repr\u00e9sentation signifiait qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 au sens de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, supra. Sans doute, il \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire, mais fausse \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentation qu'il \u00e9tait vraiment le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 au sens de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, supra. Le paragraphe 23 de l'art. 2 de cette loi d\u00e9finit comme suit le mot \u00abpropri\u00e9taire\u00bb:\n2. (23\u00b0) Le mot \u00abpropri\u00e9taire\u00bb s'applique \u00e0 toute personne qui a acquis un v\u00e9hicule automobile et le poss\u00e8de en vertu d'un titre soit absolu, soit conditionnel qui lui donne le droit d'en devenir le propri\u00e9taire ou d'en jouir comme propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 charge de rendre.\nC'est au propri\u00e9taire ainsi d\u00e9fini que l'art. 4 impose l'obligation, sous les sanctions p\u00e9nales de l'art. 49, d'enregistrer son automobile et de faire, personnellement ou par repr\u00e9sentant, la demande de cet enregistrement, tel que l'exige l'art. 3. Ni au sens du droit commun ni au sens plus large de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, supra, Lafl\u00e8che p\u00e8re n'avait droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la possession, l'usage, la garde ou le contr\u00f4le du Chevrolet 1952 ou le pouvoir de permettre \u00e0 autrui de l'utiliser. On ne saurait donner effet \u00e0 la substitution de son nom \u00e0 celui de son fils pour fins d'un enregistrement fait en vue d'obtenir une police d'assurance dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice s'\u00e9tendait au fils par le jeu de la clause omnibus, et imposer, par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, aux appelantes, un risque qu'\u00e0 la connaissance du p\u00e8re comme \u00e0 celle du fils, celles-ci ne voulaient pas assumer. Il se peut qu'en certains cas, la repr\u00e9sentation, faite de bonne foi, qu'on est propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 s'av\u00e8re juridiquement inexacte et que cette inexactitude soit indiff\u00e9rente \u00e0 l'assureur; tel n'est pas le pr\u00e9sent cas. Admettre comme bien fond\u00e9s les recours des intim\u00e9s serait imposer aux appelantes une obligation que, manifestement, elles n'ont jamais consenti d'assumer.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9tendu que les appelantes ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 invoquer la nullit\u00e9 de la police d'assurance. Les faits qu'ils invoquent au soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention sont expos\u00e9s et discut\u00e9s en d\u00e9tails aux raisons de jugement donn\u00e9es en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, auxquelles il suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer. M. le Juge Pager, apr\u00e8s avoir rappel\u00e9 le principe que nul n'est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 renoncer \u00e0 son droit, a jug\u00e9, \u00e0 bon droit, que non seulement on ne peut trouver dans les actes des appelantes une intention nette et claire de couvrir la nullit\u00e9 de la police d'assurance, mais que la ligne de conduite qu'elles ont suivie traduit une intention toute contraire.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour ceux qui peuvent entretenir une opinion oppos\u00e9e, je dirais que les deux appels en cette cause doivent \u00eatre maintenus avec d\u00e9pens.\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts are fully set forth in the judgments below and in the reasons of my brothers Fauteux and Ritchie which I have had the advantage of considering.\nI am in agreement with the reasons of Owen J. in the Court of Queen's Bench and there is little I could usefully add to them. Although the question was not discussed during the argument before us or in the judgments below, with respect, I am also of opinion that the interest of the respondent Arthur Lafi\u00e8che Sr. in the 1952 Chevrolet was that of \"unconditional ownership\" and that there was no \"material change in the nature of the insurable interest of the insured in the automobile\", within the meaning of these expressions as used in Automobile Statutory Condition 6 quoted by my brother Ritchie. Admittedly that was so with respect to the 1949 Chevrolet turned in as part payment for the 1952 model. From the time of its purchase, Lafi\u00e8che Sr. was the registered owner of the 1952 Chevrolet. The fact that the purchase of this car was negotiated by Lafl\u00e8che Jr., that the major portion of the balance of purchase price was advanced by him, and that he appears to have had exclusive use of the car, in my view, is not sufficient to establish that he had any right of ownership in the new vehicle. He may or may not have had a claim to recover from his father any amounts advanced. It follows that in my opinion the Statutory Condition referred to has no application.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeals with costs.\nRitchie J.:\u2014Both the actions which are the subject of these appeals from the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Division) of the Province of Quebec3 were brought to enforce the provisions of an automobile insurance policy whereby the appellants agreed to indemnify the respondent Arthur R. Lafleche, Sr., for \"collision damage\" to the insured automobile and also against liability imposed upon him by law for bodily injury accidentally sustained by any person and for damages for accidental injury to or destruction of property of others if such injury or damage was \"caused by the ownership, maintenance or use\" of the insured automobile. One of these actions is an action in warranty brought by both the respondents seeking indemnity in respect of a judgment recovered by one Svamour who had suffered injuries to his person and damage to his property as the result of a collision between his automobile and an automobile operated by Arthur R. Lafleche, Jr., which the respondents allege to have been covered by the insurance policy above referred to.\nThe other actions with which this appeal is concerned was brought by Arthur Lafleche, Sr., under the \"collision damage\" provisions of the said policy to recover damage sustained in the same accident by the automobile which he alleges to have been covered thereby.\nThe respondent Arthur R. Lafleche, Sr., is a retired banker and when the policy in question was first issued on May 11, 1950, he was the sole owner of the 1949 Chevrolet thereby insured. His son, Arthur R. Lafleche, Jr., is engaged in the insurance business with Lafleche, Wyndham & Co., Ltd., which company, at all times material hereto, was an agent of the appellants for the purpose, inter alia, of issuing automobile insurance policies on their behalf.\nIn November 1952, the son, while driving his own MG Sports model car, was involved in a serious accident as a result of which a man was killed and the sports model car became a total loss. After this accident, none of the \"tariff\" insurance companies, including the appellants, would issue an automobile insurance policy to the younger Lafleche and, notwithstanding the fact that the father knew, as the trial judge has found, that his son could not obtain such insurance, he nevertheless turned over his 1949 Chevrolet to the exclusive custody of the son without notifying the appellants.\nIn May 1953, Lafleche Jr., acquired a 1952 Chevrolet convertible for which the dealer accepted the 1949 Chevrolet as part-payment, the son undertaking to pay the balance of the purchase price. The 1952 Chevrolet was registered in the father's name and the son, through his insurance agency, issued an amendment to the original insurance policy so that the 1952 convertible was covered thereby, and it was while operating this vehicle on July 4, 1953, that Lafleche, Jr., collided with Svamour causing the injuries and damage which gave rise to these actions.\nThe basis of the insurance company's denial of liability under the policy is set out in the following paragraphs of the pleadings:\n5. That the 1952 Chevrolet convertible automobile was actually never the property of Arthur R. Lafleche, Sr., nor in his possession, care, custody and control, and defendants deny that the aforesaid insurance ever applied to that automobile in law or in fact and defendants deny any liability or obligation in respect of the aforesaid accident.\n* * *\n10. That Arthur R. Lafleche, Sr., either by error or design, misrepresented or concealed from defendants the absolute change of possession, care and control, first, of the 1949 Chevrolet automobile, and secondly, the true facts of ownership and\/or exclusive care, possession and control of the 1952 Chevrolet automobile.\n11. That there was a material change of risk such that defendants, if notified or aware of it, would have refused the risk in the first instance or cancelled the policy instantly in the second case, and any insurance under said policy ceased to have any force or effect as and from that date when the 1949 Chevrolet automobile was transferred to the care, custody and control of Lafleche, Jr.\nThe respondents contend, as the Court of Queen's Bench has found, that the father as registered owner of the auto- mobile had an insurable interest and that there was no material change in the risk by reason of the son taking over exclusive use and control of his father's 1949 Chevrolet and subsequenly of the 1952 convertible. The respondents further invoke and rely upon the provisions of s. 5 of the original insuring agreement by which the insurer agrees in respect of the public liability and property damage coverage, inter alia, \"to extend this insurance \u2026 in the same manner and under the same conditions as this insurance is afforded the insured, to any person or persons while riding in or legally operating the automobile and to any person, firm or corporation legally responsible for the operation thereof; but upon the condition that such use or operation is with the permission of the insured; or if the insured is an individual, with the permission of an adult member of the insured's household other than a chauffeur or domestic servant\".\nThe learned trial judge found that Lafleche, Sr., had no insurable interest in the 1952 Chevrolet and was in no sense the owner thereof, and he found also that Lafleche, Sr.'s act in turning over the custody and control of the insured automobile to his son who could not obtain such insurance from the appellants effected a \"change material to the risk \u2026 within the control and knowledge of the insured\" and that the father's failure to notify the insurers resulted in the voiding of the policy by reason of the provisions of s. 3 of the automobile Statutory Conditions which formed a part of the contract of insurance.\nAs to the first of these findings, Owen J.C.Q.B., with whose reasons for judgment all the members of the Court of Queen's Bench were in accord, had this to say:\nIn my opinion the father had an insurable interest in the Chevrolet 1952. As the registered owner of the automobile, if for no other reason, he had an insurable interest. The only information required in this connection on the application for the policy was as to who was the registered owner. If the insurance company had wanted further information regarding ownership or those who would be driving the automobile they could have asked for it. The fact that the owner's ownership of the automobile may have been limited did not invalidate his insurance on the automobile placed with the defendants in warranty.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the learned members of the Court of Queen's Bench, in reaching this conclusion overlooked the provisions of s. 6 of the said automobile Statutory Conditions which provides in part:\nUnless otherwise specifically stated in the policy or endorsed thereon, the insurer shall not be liable\u2026 (b) if the interest of the insured in the automobile is other than unconditional sole ownership \u2026(d) if there is any material change in the nature of the insurable interest of the insured in the automobile by sale, assignment or otherwise, except through change of title by succession or by death or by an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act.\nIt is to be remembered that the 1952 Chevrolet which was involved in the accident which gave rise to this litigation was purchased by Arthur R. Lafleche, Jr., on May 25, 1953. The purchase price was $2,931 and with the consent of Lafleche, Sr., the 1949 Chevrolet was turned over to the dealer Harland Automobiles Ltd. and Lafleche, Jr., was given a credit of $1,250 in respect thereof, the balance of the purchase price, i.e., $1,681, was assumed as a personal obligation by Lafleche, Jr.\nThe trial judge viewed any interest which Lafleche, Sr., might have acquired in the 1952 Chevrolet by reason of his 1949 car being accepted in part payment as being nothing more than that of \"un cr\u00e9ancier chirographaire\", but even if it be accepted that the credit given for the old Chevrolet gave the father an insurable interest in the new car it was still an interest materially different from his interest in the car which was originally insured. Similarly, if the case be put upon the footing, as the Appeal Division put it, that the father's interest in the 1952 Chevrolet was that of a \"registered owner\", this does not alter the fact that it was an interest of a different nature from that which the father had in the car originally insured.\nThe circumstances under which the 1952 model was purchased, when taken in conjunction with all the other evidence, satisfy me that Lafleche, Jr., assumed the obligation to pay $1,681 on his own behalf and for his own benefit, and that the highest interest which the father can have been said to have in the new car is limited to the value allowed by Harland Automobiles Ltd. in respect of the old one. There was, therefore, in my view, a material change in the nature of the insurable interest of Lafleche, Sr., which occurred between the time when the original policy was issued and the time of the accident. As there was no statement or endorsement on the policy covering this change, the provisions of Statutory Condition 6(d) would appear to relieve the insurers from liability.\nI would accordingly allow these appeals and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs.\nAppel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens, le Juge Abbott dissident.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fenderesses, appelantes: Foster, Watt, Leggat & Colby, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, intim\u00e9s: Pag\u00e9, Beauregard, Duchesne, Renaud & Reeves, Montr\u00e9al.\n1 [1962] B.R. 909.\n2 [1962] B.R. 909.\n3 [1962] Que.

The drilling of a well was commenced on March 21, 1961, and the formation in question was reached on March 27. The Jumping Pound Sand was dry, but crude oil had been encountered at a lesser depth in the Cardium Sand formation. On March 29, 1961, the appellant applied to the Board to obtain permission to plug back the well to complete it for the taking of production from the Cardium Sand. This application was approved on March 30, subject to a condition with respect to a spacing unit requirement.\nOn April 1, 1961, the well was ready for fracturing treatment designed to open up the producing formation so that the well would be in a position to produce commercial quantities of oil. The appellant did not, at that time, bring to the well location the necessary heavy equipment required for that purpose because, on March 17, a road ban had been imposed by the municipality in which the well was located, which ban continued until May 11. After the termination of the road ban, the equipment was brought to the well site and, in the result, production of oil from the well was obtained from the Cardium Sand between June 26, 1961, and July 6, 1961. The appellant was compelled to cease production by order of the Board because the taking of such production was in breach of the condition which had been imposed when approval had been given for the plugging back of the well.\nIn an action in which the appellant sought a declaration that the lease was valid and subsisting, the trial judge held that the lease was still subsisting. This decision was reversed on appeal by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, one member of the Court dissenting. From that judgment an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe habendum clause granted a primary term of 10 years, which was to be extended if production of any of the substances had been obtained during that period, for so long as such production continued beyond the 10-year term. However, no production had been obtained prior to the expiration of the 10-year primary term. At the end of that period it could not be said that any of the substances \"are being produced.\" Under those circumstances, the lease expired on May 10, 1961, and there was nothing in the provisions of the lease which enabled it to be revived after it had terminated. It was, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the interruption of the operations which were in fact being carried on by the appellant was or was not the result of causes beyond its control.\nThe paragraph of the lease imposing a drilling commitment did not modify in any way the terms of the habendum clause. That clause specifically defined the period during which the lessee was entitled to exercise its rights respecting the land, including the right to drill. The drilling commitment did not create any overriding right to drill and to continue drilling operations after the 10-year term. On the contrary, it imposed a duty to drill within the specified period. The lessee deferred the performance of its drilling obligation to the last months of the 10-year term at its own risk. If it failed to be in production before that term expired, then the habendum clause came into play and the lease automatically terminated at the end of the primary term.\nShell Oil Co. v. Gunderson, [1960] S.C.R. 424, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, reversing a judgment of McLaurin C.J.T.D. Appeal dismissed. J. M. Robertson, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. B. Gill, for the defendants, respondents, O. G. Kininmonth and L. W. Kininmonth.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The matter in issue in this appeal is the interpretation of a petroleum and natural gas lease, dated May 11, 1951, made by James Kininmonth, as lessor, and Douglas M. Machon, as lessee, in respect of the south half of Section 26, Township 27, Range 2, West of the 5th Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, which will be hereinafter referred to as \"the land.\" The respondents Orvilla Gertrude Kininmonth and Leonard Wickson Kininmonth are the successors in title of the lessor. The respondent company claims an interest in the land under a royalty trust agreement made by it with the lessor. The appellant is the assignee of the lessee's interest under the lease.\nAfter describing the land, the lease went on to provide that the lessor:\nDoth Hereby Grant and Lease unto the Lessee the said Petroleum, Natural Gas and Related Hydrocarbons with the exclusive right and privilege to prospect and drill for, remove, store and dispose of, the said substances, and for the said purposes, so far as the Lessor has the right so to grant, to enter upon the said lands and use and occupy so much thereof as may be necessary or convenient for any or all of the said purposes or operations incidental thereto, or associated therewith, including drilling for producing, treating, processing and transporting the said substances.\nTo Have and Enjoy the same for the term of ..10.. years from the date hereof, and so long thereafter as the said substances or any of them are being produced from the said lands, subject to the sooner termination of the said term as hereinafter provided.\nProvided that if operations for the drilling of a well are not commenced on the said lands within One (1) year from the date hereof, this lease shall thereupon terminate and be at an end, unless the Lessee shall have paid or tendered to the Lessor the sum of \u2026Three hundred twenty \u201400\/100\u2014 ($..320.00..) Dollars, as rental, which payment shall confer the privilege of deferring the commencement of drilling operations for a period of One (1) year, and that, in like manner and upon like payments or tenders, the commencement of drilling operations shall be further deferred for like periods successively;\nProvided Further that if at any time during the said \u2026 10\u2026 year term and prior to the discovery of production on the said lands, the Lessee shall drill a dry well or wells thereon, or if at any time during such term and after the discovery of production on the said lands such production shall cease, then this lease shall terminate on the next ensuing anniversary date hereof unless further operations for the recovery of the said substances from the said lands shall have been commenced or unless the Lessee shall have paid or tendered the said rental, in which latter event the immediately preceding proviso hereof governing the payment of the said rental and effect thereof, shall be deemed to have continued in force; And Further Always Provided that if at any time after the expiration of the said \u202610\u2026 year term the said substances are not being produced on the said lands and the Lessee is then engaged in drilling or working operations thereon, this Lease shall remain in force so long as such operations are prosecuted, and if they result in the production of the said substances or any of them, so long thereafter as the said substances or any of them are produced from the said lands, provided that if drilling, working or production operations are interrupted or suspended as the result of any cause whatsoever beyond the Lessee's control, other than the Lessee's lack of funds, the time of such interruption or suspension shall not be counted against the Lessee, anything hereinbefore contained or implied to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe appellant availed itself of the right to postpone from year to year its drilling commitment by the payment of the stipulated delay rentals. During the tenth year of the lease, on February 24, 1961, the appellant applied to the Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board for a licence to drill a well on legal subdivision 8 of the land to produce oil from the Jumping Pound Sandstone. A licence was granted by the Board on February 27. The spacing unit prescribed by the Drilling & Production Regulations under The Oil and Gas Conservation Act, 1957 (Alta.), c. 63, for the geological formation in question, was 80 acres.\nThe appellant commenced to drill a well on March 21, 1961, and reached the formation in question on March 27. The Jumping Pound Sand was dry, but crude oil had been encountered at a lesser depth in the Cardium Sand formation. The evidence indicates that the finding of oil in that formation was a reasonable probability in the light of development which had occurred in the area in which the land is located. The discovery of oil in the Jumping Pound Sand was much more uncertain.\nThe Alberta Oil and Gas Conservation Board had, on April 27, 1960, by Order SU 172, prescribed a spacing unit for a well drilled in a defined area, in which the land was situated, to obtain oil production from the Cardium Sand, of one half section of land comprising the east half or the west half of a section. As the land consisted of the south half of a section it did not constitute a spacing unit within that Order for the drilling of a well to the Cardium Sand, or for the production of oil therefrom.\nOn March 29, 1961, the appellant applied to the Board to obtain permission to plug back the well to complete it for the taking of production from the Cardium Sand. This application was approved by the Board on March 30, but subject to the express condition that \"This well shall not be produced as a Cardium Oil well until the licensee has indicated to the Board that he has the right to produce from the entire spacing unit.\"\nOn April 1, 1961, the well was ready for fracturing treatment designed to open up the producing formation so that the well would be in a position to produce commercial quantities of oil from the Cardium Sand. The appellant did not, at that time, bring to the well location the necessary heavy equipment required for that purpose because, on March 17, a road ban had been imposed by the municipality in which the well was located, which ban continued until May 11.\nAfter the termination of the road ban, the equipment was brought to the well site and, in the result, production of oil from the well was obtained from the Cardium Sand between June 26, 1961, and July 6, 1961. The appellant was compelled to cease production by order of the Board because the taking of such production was in breach of the condition which had been imposed when approval had been given for the plugging back of the well.\nOn June 1, 1961, Order No. SU 172 was superseded by Order No. SU 185, but the provision as to required spacing units was similar to that which had been contained in the earlier Order.\nVarious efforts were made by the appellant, which it is unnecessary to describe in detail, to put itself into a position whereby it could lawfully produce oil from the well from the Cardium Sand, but, up to the time of the trial of this action, which commenced on September 24, 1962, these had been unsuccessful.\nA caveat had been filed by the appellant, under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 170, to protect its interest under the lease. The respondents gave the form of notice prescribed in that Act, whereby the caveat ceases to have effect after the expiration of 60 days next ensuing the date of the notice, unless proceedings are commenced by the caveator on the caveat. Following receipt of this notice and prior to the expiration of the 60 day period, the appellant commenced this action, seeking a declaration that the lease was valid and subsisting. The question in issue was as to whether the petroleum and natural gas lease still subsists, or whether it terminated at the end of the 10-year primary term.\nThe learned trial judge held that the lease was still subsisting. This decision was reversed, on appeal, by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Macdonald J.A. dissenting2. From that judgment the present appeal has been brought.\nI construe the five paragraphs which were cited earlier to provide as follows:\nThe first paragraph defines the rights granted by the lease in respect of the land. In particular, it gives to the lessee the right to drill for petroleum, natural gas and related hydrocarbons, which will be referred to hereafter, as they were in the lease, as \"the substances.\"\nThe second paragraph is the habendum clause. It defines the term during which the lessee may enjoy the rights which had been granted to it in the first paragraph. The term is \"10 years from the date hereof, and so long thereafter as the said substances or any of them are being produced from the said lands.\" I interpret this paragraph as granting a primary term of 10 years, which is to be extended if production of any of the substances has been obtained during that period, for so long as such production continues beyond the 10-year term. At the end of the 10-year term the lease is extended if any of the substances \"are being produced.\"\nThe third paragraph obligates the lessee to commence drilling a well within one year from the date of the lease. This obligation may, however, be postponed from year to year by payment of delay rentals. Failure to commence drilling as required, unless the stipulated payments to postpone drilling are made, results in the termination of the lease within the 10-year period.\nThe fourth paragraph deals with the situation which occurs if the lessee, during the primary term, before production has been discovered, drills a dry well; or if, during the primary term, production has been discovered, but ceases.\nThe fifth paragraph commences with the words \"if at any time after the expiration of the said 10 year term the said substances are not being produced on the said lands.\" The habendum clause spoke of a 10-year term \"and so long there- after as the said substances or any of them are being produced.\" When the two expressions \"are being produced\" and \"are not being produced\" are read together, it is my opinion that this fifth paragraph is obviously designed to deal with the situation which occurs if the primary term has been extended by production from the land and then such production ceases. Without the fifth paragraph, the lease would automatically terminate upon the cessation of production. This paragraph, however, prevents that termination occurring if, when such production ceases, the lessee is then engaged in drilling or working operations on the land, or so long as such operations are prosecuted. If such operations result in further production, the lease continues during such production.\nI cannot construe the paragraph as meaning that, even though no production has been obtained within the 10-year primary term, the lessee may thereafter carry on drilling operations on the land which, if successful, will then serve to extend the lease for a further period during the continuance of such production.\nThe latter part of the fifth paragraph covers the situation which may occur if drilling, working or production operations are interrupted or suspended by causes beyond the lessee's control. In my opinion this portion of the paragraph only comes into play if the lease has already been extended beyond the 10-year primary term, as a result of production, and then such production ceases.\nIn the present case no production had been obtained prior to the expiration of the 10-year primary term. At the end of that period it could not be said that any of the substances \"are being produced.\" Under those circumstances, in my opinion, the lease expired on May 10, 1961, and there is nothing in the provisions of the lease which enabled it to be revived after it had terminated. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider whether the interruption of the operations which were in fact being carried on by the appellant was or was not the result of causes beyond its control.\nThe views which I have expressed regarding the meaning and effect of the provisions of the lease under consideration are in accordance with what was stated in relation to similar provisions contained in the petroleum and natural gas lease which was under consideration in this Court in the case of Shell Oil Company v. Gunderson3. At p. 429 it was said:\nDrilling operations, in order to be effective to continue the lease in force beyond the five-year term, would have to be of the kind defined in the proviso to the habendum clause, which has been previously quoted. That proviso refers to drilling operations \"after the expiration of the five-year term\". The proviso takes effect only if the lease has been extended as a result of production and if, when production ceases, the lessee is then engaged in drilling operations.\nThe contention of the appellant is that it had the right to commence drilling at any time within the final year of the 10-year term and that it must be inferred that the lease contemplated that, if it did commence drilling within such time, it would then have the right to complete its drilling operations and to take production from the well drilled after the end of the 10-year period. The appellant further contends that it did commence drilling operations within the 10-year period and was only precluded from continuing them by reason of their interruption by causes beyond the appellant's control.\nThe appellant's argument involves the proposition that the drilling obligation imposed upon the lessee, coupled with the lessee's right to postpone the commencement of drilling by payment of delay rentals, has the effect of modifying the habendum clause to the extent that the lease is extended beyond the 10-year term if drilling of a well is commenced within that period and thereafter continued and completed.\nI do not construe the paragraph which imposes the drilling commitment as modifying in any way the terms of the habendum clause. That clause specifically defined the period during which the lessee was entitled to exercise its rights respecting the land, including the right to drill. The drilling commitment did not create any overriding right to drill and to continue drilling operations after the 10-year term. On the contrary, it imposed a duty to drill within the specified period. The fact that the lessee was under a contractual obligation to commence the drilling of a well, in this case, in the tenth year of the term of the lease did not have the effect of enabling him to defer the commencement of drilling until practically the end of the 10-year term and then to claim, as a right, an extension of the term during such time as it might take to complete the drilling of the well. In my view the lessee deferred the performance of its drilling obligation to the last months of the 10-year term at its own risk. If it failed to be in production before that term expired, then the habendum clause came into play and the lease automatically terminated at the end of the primary term.\nThe appellant cited American authorities, some of which were the basis for the reasons for the dissenting opinion of Macdonald J.A. in the Appellate Division. He cited a summary of the effect of the cases on which he relied, which is contained in certain \"Discussion Notes\" found in 17 Oil & Gas Reporter at p. 785:\nWhere a lease contains an habendum clause providing that the lease shall be for a fixed term and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced, and such lease also contains a drilling clause which provides that the lease will terminate unless a well is commenced on or before a certain date or payment made of delay rentals, there is division of authority as to the effect of a well commenced prior to the termination of the primary term and completed as a producing well after the primary term. A series of cases in Oklahoma makes it clear that Oklahoma follows the view that the lessee under such a lease has the right to complete such well and that the lease will remain effective during drilling operations in good faith after the primary term.\nIn particular he cited a portion of the judgment of Lewis J., delivering the judgment of the Court, in Moncrief v. Pasotex Petroleum Company4:\nThe right to commence a well during the primary term carries with it, by necessary legal implication, the right to complete the well after expiration of the primary term unless negatived by contract terms or loss by abandonment. Simons v. McDaniel [7 P.2d 419].\nIt may be noted that in Summers' \"The Law of Oil & Gas\", Permanent ed., vol. 2, the learned author deals with the interpretation of the habendum clause in a petroleum and natural gas lease in c. 10. In particular, in ss. 292 to 301 in that chapter, he refers, on various occasions, to the general rule that production within the definite term is a condition precedent to the extension of the lease beyond that term. He refers, with apparent disapproval, to the fact that courts in some states have created exceptions to the general rule and refers in this regard, among other cases, to the case of Simons v. McDaniel, the case which was relied upon by Lewis J. in the passage from his judgment previously quoted.\nHowever, irrespective of what construction may have been placed by courts upon other leases, the essential task in the present case is to construe the terms of the lease which is in question. For the reasons already given, it is my view that there is no provision in it to enable the extension of its term beyond 10 years, save only by the production of one of the substances from the land within and continuing beyond that period. Such production did not occur in the present case and, accordingly, in my opinion, the lease terminated at the end of its primary term.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondents, O.

The fire which spread to the premises of the three plaintiffs was started when the defendant Bense, acting in the course of his employment as a mechanic of the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 and while draining a gasoline tank of an automobile preparatory to the removal of the tank, bumped into a light cord. This resulted in the bulb on the extension cord falling; combustion occurred and the fire commenced. The defendants pleaded the provisions of The Accidental Fires Act. The actions were dismissed by the trial judge and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeals should be allowed.\nIn the course of draining the gasoline, the defendant Bense failed to act with the very great care required from the dangerous operation in which he was engaged. The acts of negligence individually were of a very small degree, but that combination of acts resulted in the damage occurring to the plaintiffs\u2019 properties and resulted from the fact that the operation in which the defendant Bense was engaged was one where any small piece of negligence might have disastrous effects.\nThe defendant Beaupr\u00e9 was responsible in law for the acts of negligence of the defendant Bense, and the defence of The Accidental Fires Act did not apply. The provisions of that Act did not extend to fires which were the result of negligence.\nDonoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562; United Motors Service, Inc. v. Hutson et al., [1937] S.C.R. 294; Read v. J. Lyons & Co. Ltd., [1947] A.C. 156; Dokuchia v. Domansch, [1945] O.R. 141; Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd., [1947] O.R. 585, affirmed [1948] O.R. 311 (Ont. C.A.), [1949] 2 D.L.R. 461 (S.C.C.), referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of Aylen J. Appeal allowed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., O.F. Howe, Q.C., and R.J. Rolls, for the plaintiffs, appellants. C.F. MacMillan, Q.C., and Roydon A. Hughes, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dated January 14, 1963, whereby that Court affirmed the judgment of Aylen J. dated December 8, 1961. By the latter judgment, Aylen J. dismissed three actions which were tried together. In these actions the owners and occupants of premises surrounding those occupied by the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 and in which the defendant Bense was employed by the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 claimed damages for destruction of the properties owned or occupied by them through a fire which commenced in the premises of the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 and spread to the premises which they owned or occupied on Kent and Queen Streets, in Ottawa.\nIn this Court arguments were made on alternative bases of negligence, nuisance and liability under Rylands v. Fletcher[1], In addition, in their factum, the appellants had advanced the principle of res ipsa loquitur, although in argument counsel for the appellants agreed it was not necessary to rely upon that principle since all of the facts had been demonstrated accurately at the trial.\nI have come to the conclusion that the judgment of this Court may be based upon the ground of negligence only and it is, therefore, not necessary to consider the alternative grounds of liability under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, and of nuisance. Indeed, when one makes a detailed analysis of the proceedings at trial, it is apparent that the basis of negligence alone was there considered.\nThe fire which spread to the premises of the three plaintiffs was started when the defendant Bense, acting in the course of his employment as a mechanic of the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 and while draining a gasoline tank of an automobile preparatory to the removal of the tank, bumped into a light cord. This resulted in the bulb on the extension cord falling; combustion occurred and the fire commenced. With respect, I have come to the conclusion that the trial judge dismissed the action and the Court of Appeal affirmed that dismissal by the application to the circumstances, which shall be detailed hereafter, of the wrong standard of care. The operation of draining gasoline from the tank of an automobile was stated throughout the trial to be a dangerous one and the appeal in this Court was argued upon the basis common to both appellant and respondent, that the operation was dangerous and that care was required. This may best be illustrated by quoting the evidence of Hugh Edward Thompson, the expert witness called for the defendants, who said:\nI would say, Mr. Rowe, it is dangerous to handle gasoline under any circumstances. The very nature of the material is inherently dangerous. The precaution and protection depends on the care of the operator.\nThe standard of care under such circumstances has been put in a dictum of Lord MacMillan in Donoghue v. Stevenson[2].\nI may observe that it seems to me inaccurate to describe the case of dangerous things as an exception to the principle that no one but a party to a contract can sue on that contract. I rather regard this type of case as a special instance of negligence where the law exacts a degree of diligence so stringent as to amount practically to a guarantee of safety.\n(The italics are mine.)\nThis dictum has been cited on many occasions as giving the standard of care required of one when handling a dangerous thing or carrying out a dangerous operation. In Hutson et al. v. United Motor Service Ltd.[3], Middleton J.A. said at p. 230:\nGasoline is a dangerous substance. Gasoline vapour is far more dangerous, and when it is exposed to contact with a flame or spark an explosion is inevitable. The care necessary in such cases is \u201cconsummate care\u201d and as Pollock on Tort, 13th ed., p. 518, says: \u201cIt is doubtful whether even this be strong enough. At least, we do not know of any English case of this kind (not falling under some recognized head of exception) where unsuccessful diligence on the defendant\u2019s part was held to exonerate him.\u201d\nBoth of the other members of the Court agreed with the standard of care outlined by Middleton J.A. in the quotation above. The judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case was affirmed in this Court[4]. At p. 301, Kerwin J., (as he then was) said:\nIt is true that these witnesses testified that, where it was required to clean oil and grease from such floors, it was customary to use gasoline and scrapers and brushes followed by an application of some cleaning substance, the whole washed off with water. But the evidence falls short of proving that it was the usual practice to clean such an area in the elapsed time under the conditions that existed that day. In Read v. J. Lyons & Co. Ltd.[5], Lord MacMillan said at p. 171:\nIn the first place, the expression \u201cstrict liability\u201d, though borrowed from authority, is ambiguous. If it means the absolute liability of an insurer irrespective of negligence then the answer in my opinion must be in the negative. If it means that an exacting standard of care is incumbent on manufacturers of explosive shells to prevent the occurrence of accidents causing personal injury I should answer the question in the affirmative, but this will not avail the appellant.\nAnd at p. 172, the learned law Lord continued:\nI think that he succeeded in showing that in the case of dangerous things and operations the law has recognized that a special responsibility exists to take care. But I do not think that it has ever been laid down that there is absolute liability apart from negligence where persons are injured in consequence of the use of such things or the conduct of such operations. In truth it is a matter of degree. Every activity in which man engages is fraught with some possible element of danger to others. Experience shows that even from acts apparently innocuous injury to others may result. The more dangerous the act the greater is the care that must be taken in performing it. This relates itself to the principle in the modern law of torts that liability exists only for consequences which a reasonable man would have foreseen. One who engages in obviously dangerous operations must be taken to know that if he does not take special precautions injury to others may very well result.\n(The italics are mine.)\nAnd at p. 173:\nStrict liability, if you will, is imposed upon him in the sense that he must exercise a high degree of care, but that is all.\nIn Dokuchia v. Domansch[6], Laidlaw J.A. said, at p. 145:\nThe undertaking of putting gasoline from a can into the carburetor of a defective engine was proposed by the defendant, and the law subjects him to strict responsibility for all mischief resulting therefrom.\nTherefore, to determine these actions, it is the duty of the Court to apply to the facts which were found in the trial Court the very high standard of care to which I referred above.\nThe defendant Walter Bense, who had been employed by the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 for only about two months, was, on February 16, 1958, instructed by his foreman to remove a gas tank from a 1951 Oldsmobile automobile. He drove this automobile over top of a pit, then taking two five-gallon gasoline cans, he carried the same to the edge of the pit, left one sitting on the edge of the pit, and descended into the pit bringing with him the other gasoline can. In order to provide himself with illumination, Bense had attached an extension cord to a plug some six to eight yards away and brought with him into the pit an electric lamp at the end of this extension cord. The electric lamp was set in a fixture which had a rubber handle some one foot long and the bulb was protected by a guard which appears to have been solid on its back face but which had wire mesh, the wires being about one inch apart, on the front face. At the top of this housing or guard was an ordinary hook and Bense hung that hook over a wire cable at the rear of the automobile which would appear, from the rather indefinite evidence, to be the wire running to the tail light of the automobile and which wire, at the place where Bense hung the hook, was said by him, after some hesitation, to run horizontally. It should be noted that Bense had not tested the automobile or looked at the gauge to determine the amount of gasoline in the tank. As it happened, the amount in the tank was less than five gallons and this failure to check is not relevant to any thing which actually occurred in the disaster but does indicate the standard of care which Bense exercised throughout the operation. Bense removed the cap, placed a large funnel in the mouth of the gasoline can, and then held the gasoline tank with the funnel protruding from its top against his stomach beneath a one\u2011quarter inch opening in the bottom of the gasoline tank on the automobile. He unplugged that one-quarter inch opening so that the gasoline ran from the tank into the funnel and then into the gasoline can. There was much discussion during the trial as to the exact distance between the opening in the bottom of the gasoline tank and the top of the funnel sitting in the can, and it was finally determined that that distance was about one foot. In my view of what occurred, the evidence is not important at any rate because there seems to have been little indication of any large amount of vapour lying in the bottom of this repair pit. It must, of course, be understood that gasoline vapour is much heavier than air and one would expect it to have dropped to the bottom of the pit but, of course, in a considerable building and with the doors being on some occasions opened, there may easily have been sufficient draught to have carried the gasoline vapour away. In my opinion, it was not vapour caused by evaporation as the gasoline flowed from the tank into the funnel which caused the catastrophe. When the gasoline can had been about three-quarters filled, it was apparent that the gasoline tank was well-nigh empty and only a few drips remained. This occurred at what Bense swore was, according to his watch, two minutes to twelve. The gasoline can was, of course, heavy by this time\u2014a five gallon can three-quarters filled would be heavy\u2014and therefore he lowered it from the position in which he held it up opposite his chest or stomach to the floor of the pit, leaving the funnel in it and leaving a few drops falling from the tank. Those drops would have had to fall about six feet and in my opinion it is the combustion of those drops or the vapour from them which caused the conflagration. They were only a few, but there can be no surety that the drops coming down that far would even hit the funnel, and, in fact, it would seem that some must have been on the top of the tank or even on its sides. At any rate, those drops of gasoline falling about that six-feet distance would result in a considerably more rapid evaporation than the gasoline which had been drained from the tank in a steady flow and fell only about one foot to sixteen inches before striking the funnel and running into the can. Moreover, such evaporation would occur below the level of the pit wall so the vapour could not be dissipated. When this dripping had ceased, which was evidently after only moments and after only a few drops had fallen, Bense inserted a plug in the bottom of the tank and turned it tight and then removed the funnel from the top of the gas can as it stood on the floor of the repair pit and put that funnel into an orifice at the side of the pit, then put the cap on the gasoline can. It is probable again, as the trial judge pointed out, that a few drops from the funnel ran onto the top of the gasoline can during this operation. It should be noted that it would have taken only a second to have swabbed the top of that gasoline tank as Bense capped it and every mechanic has in his coveralls someplace a cloth which he could use for such purpose.\nThroughout this operation, the lamp hung by its hook from the wire cable beneath the automobile. It is true that counsel for the defendant asked Bense in the examination-in-chief this question:\nQ. And that light would be where, if it was three or four feet back from the tank? A. Yes. But shortly thereafter, the trial judge put to the witness these questions and received these answers:\nHis Lordship: Q. Witness, that lamp has a handle at the bottom of it? A. Yes.\nQ. You see? Now, how far was that handle from your left shoulder? A. I think maybe one and a half feet.\nQ. Pardon? A. One and a half feet. Maybe two feet. I have place to walk. I cannot hit the light.\nIt would seem, however, that is exactly what Bense did, for he picked up the five-gallon gasoline can three-quarters full with his right hand and then turned to his left in order to climb the wooden ladder which stood in the rear corner of the pit. That lamp fell, and on examination-in-chief, the defendant Bense gave this evidence thereon:\nMr. Hughes: Q. Now, would you come back here, please? Thank you, Mr. Bense. Do you know what caused the extension lamp which was hooked on the cable to fall? What caused it to fall? A. I feel nothing, sir, but I think it was my shoulder.\nQ. You think it was your shoulder? Your left shoulder? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. And your left shoulder coming in contact with what? A. I think with the underside from the light here.\nQ. With the underside of the light which\u2014A. Was hanging.\nQ. \u201cthe underside\u201d he means by that below the handle. A. By that place.\nQ. Below the rubber handle on the light? A. Yes.\nQ. You think your shoulder must have touched that? A. Yes.\nIt must be remembered that the extension lamp from the end of its heavy rubber handle to the top of the hook was a solid and inflexible unit. It would seem, therefore, that it must have occurred when the defendant Bense\u2019s shoulder touched the end of the handle. Upon examination for discovery, the defendant Bense described the hanging of that light on the cable and said: \u201cand I tried it to see if it was steady enough\u201d. It would appear from what occurred that in fact the light was not hung in a place where it would be secure, as the small movement of the defendant Bense\u2019s shoulder striking one end of the lamp handle must have dislodged the hook from the wire cable, a cable which was said to be about half-an-inch in diameter. The lamp fell and a metallic sound occurred followed by a sound which the defendant Bense described as a \u201cpoof\u201d, which would, of course indicate a very minor explosion or combustion of the gasoline vapour which was around the can. The actual extension lamp with all the other exhibits seemed to have disappeared during the course of a reconstruction at the Carleton County Courthouse and we are not able to inspect it. It would appear, however, to have been a standard type of an approved extension cord used in such occasions as the repair of automobiles. It was, in addition to the guard, furnished with a heavy duty electric light bulb, and the evidence given by various witnesses was that that bulb did not ordinarily break when the lamp fell. However, the witnesses added that such bulbs being glass do break and have broken on other occasions. The opinion that the bulb broke when the spout of the gasoline can, a spout of about three inches in length, pierced the space between two of the wire guards so that it came into direct contact with the glass bulb, would seem to be an accurate opinion. I am of the view that nothing particularly hinges on the type of equipment and that it was quite a proper type of equipment to use under the circumstances if it had been properly used.\nI have come to the conclusion, however, that the use of the equipment by the defendant Bense failed to attain the very high standard of care required by his dangerous operations. In the first place, Bense, in my opinion, hung that lamp in a rather insecure fashion. Hyman Hershorn was called for the defendants and gave evidence that in his automobile repair shop they removed about fifteen or twenty gasoline tanks from automobiles each week. He was asked what was liable to make such an extension lamp fall and his answer was \u201can insecure place\u201d. He was then asked the following question:\nQ. There is some reference to a cable underneath this motor car. I don\u2019t know yet what the cable was doing there. Perhaps that will appear in the evidence but there are lots of places underneath a car to hook a lamp to? A. There is what they call cross-bars across. There is a cross member in the car and there is also there a brake cable usually for the emergency brake.\nIt would seem such a cross-member or a much heavier cable than the one used, as for instance a brake cable, would have been a much more secure place to hang the extension lamp. I find that to hang it as insecurely as it must have been hung under these circumstances was an act of negligence.\nSecondly, to lower the gasoline can to the floor of the pit and permit the drops to fall some six feet from the bottom of the car to the funnel as it sat on the top of the can or perhaps to the top of the can apart from the funnel, was an act of negligence, in view of the rapid vaporization of the small drops of gasoline.\nThirdly, to so remove the funnel from the top of the gasoline can as it sat on the floor of the pit as to permit the droplets which remained in the funnel to fall upon the top of the can is, in my opinion, an act of negligence.\nFourthly, having permitted the drops to fall the six feet from the opening in the gasoline tank to the top of the can and also to fall from the funnel to the can when the funnel was removed, to fail to wipe off the can immediately was again an act of negligence.\nFifthly, Bense\u2019s failure to move the lamp back from its insecure hanging place to a safe position on the border of the pit before he attempted to move around in the confined space and carrying the heavy can was, in view of the grave danger of fire, an act of negligence.\nFinally, having failed to remove the lamp from its insecure hanging place the defendant Bense was negligent in that he permitted himself to bump into the vulnerable, hanging lamp and cause the lamp to fall, the cord pulling the lamp so that it struck the top of the gasoline can.\nIn all of these circumstances, I find that the defendant Bense failed to act with the very great care required from the dangerous operation in which he was engaged. It is true the acts individually are of a very small degree, but that combination of acts resulted in the damage occurring to the plaintiffs\u2019 properties and resulted from the fact that the operation in which the defendant Bense was engaged was one where any small piece of negligence might have disastrous effects.\nI am further of the opinion that the above acts of negligence are covered by subparas. (a) and (b) of para. 4 of the statement of claim common to the three actions in which the plaintiffs set out the acts of negligence. Those paragraphs appear as follows:\n4. The Plaintiff says that the Defendants were negligent in that:\na) they failed to take adequate precautions to secure the said light and prevent it from falling and breaking and thereby causing a dangerous condition to arise. b) the Defendant Bense did not exercise care in moving about the area where the light was suspended.\nThe defendants plead the provisions of The Accidental Fires Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 3. Section 1 of that Act reads as follows:\n1. No action shall be brought against any person in whose house or building or on whose land any fire accidentally begins, nor shall any recompense be made by him for any damage suffered thereby; but no contract or agreement made between landlord and tenant shall be hereby defeated or made void.\nIn United Motors Service Inc. v. Hutson et al., supra, Kerwin J., as he then was, said at p. 302:\nMany years ago it was decided that this expression did not include a fire caused by negligence, Filliter v. Phippard (1847), 11 Q.B. 347, and this decision has been followed ever since. For two examples in this Court see Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. Phelps (1884), 14 Can. S.C.R. 132, and Port Coquitlam v. Wilson, [1923] S.C.R. 235.\nIn Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd.[7], Schroeder J. said at p. 603:\nCounsel for the defendant argues that the fire might have been due to pure accident, and that under the provisions of The Accidental Fires Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 161, there would be no liability on the defendant. That contention is entirely devoid of merit, in my opinion, since it is abundantly clear upon the evidence that the fire did not \u201caccidentally begin\u201d within the meaning of that Act as explained by numerous authorities. It would be quite superfluous to quote authorities upon the point, now so well established, that a fire cannot be said to begin accidentally if it is the result of negligence, or that \u201caccidental\u201d in the statute means \u201cby mere chance\u201d, or \u201cincapable of being traced to any cause\u201d, as opposed to the negligence of either servants or masters, rather than accidental in contradistinction to wilful.\nAn appeal from that judgment was dismissed both in the Court of Appeal for Ontario and in this Court.\nHaving found that the defendant Bense was guilty of acts of negligence for which the defendant Beaupr\u00e9 is responsible in law, I therefore must find that the defence of The Accidental Fires Act does not apply.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the three appeals with costs throughout, and give judgment in favour of the appellants in each of the three actions with a reference in each to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa to assess the damages. The costs of such reference should be determined by the Supreme Court of Ontario upon application by either party.\nAppeals allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Howe, Howe & Rowe, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Hughes, Laishley & Mullen, Ottawa.\n[1] (1868), L.R. 3 H.L. 330.\n[2] [1932] A.C. 562 at 611.\n[3] [1936] O.R. 225.\n[4] [1937] S.C.R. 294.\n[5] [1947] A.C. 156.\n[6] [1945] O.R. 141.\n[7] [1947] O.R. 585.\n",

A.H. Rushforth & Co., [1964] S.C.R. 459\nDate: 1964-04-28\nLouis N. Sukloff (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nA.H. Rushforth & Company Limited, Rest Plan Properties Limited, Guaranty Trust Company of Canada, and J.S. Whitehead, Trustee of the Estate of A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited and Rest Plan Properties Limited (Defendants) Respondents.\n1963: October 7, 8, 9; 1964: April 28.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nBankruptcy\u2014Money advanced for operations of companies in consideration of share in profits\u2014Subsequent bankruptcies of companies\u2014Loan claim\u2014Security obtained for part of advance by way of equitable assignment\u2014Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, s. 98\u2014The Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 288, s. 4.\nA scheme to finance the acquisition and resale of apartment house properties consisted in obtaining options on such properties and the promotion of syndicates to acquire them, the purchase money to be raised by the sale by one R or his company of units in the syndicates, which were secured under the provisions of deeds of trust pursuant to which a trust company was to carry out the purchase on behalf of each syndicate, pay the expenses and arrange for the reimbursement of the amount of any deposits which had been paid in consideration of obtaining the options.\nThe plaintiff S advanced moneys to R Co. and R P Co. under an agreement the terms of which were put in writing in a letter dated July 31, 1958. The letter was signed by R, as president of R Co., and stated that after the payment of the sums advanced by S and expenses, all profits were to be divided equally between S and R. By the latter part of October, neither of two proposed property purchases had been completed and, more money being required, S advanced a further sum of $5,000 to R Co. and R P Co. on October 31, 1958, under the terms of a written agreement entered into between him and the two companies and bearing that date.\nAfter reciting that S had paid to the two companies under terms of the agreement of July 31, 1958, a sum of $45,000 of which $35,000 \u201cis represented by preferred shares in Rest Plan Properties Limited\u201d, and that the companies required an additional $5,000, this agreement provided, inter alia, for the repayment of $35,000 on the closing of the purchase of either of the two properties, which sum was to be paid out of moneys being disbursed by the G Trust Co. to R P Co. under the terms of its trust agreements with respect to the said properties. The balance of $15,000 was to be paid on the closing of the purchase of the remaining property which sum was to be disbursed by the trust company as aforesaid. On the same date, R P Co. gave a written direction to the trust company to pay S the sum of $35,000 from the moneys due on the closing of either purchase. It later purported to revoke this direction. The purchase of one of the properties was completed and after payment of the purchase price there remained in the hands of the trust company a sum of $55,000 to be paid to the person or persons entitled thereto.\nS brought action for recovery of $50,000 in December 1958, but in March 1960 R Co. and R P Co. made assignments in bankruptcy. S was granted leave to continue the action and the trustee in bankruptcy was added as a party defendant. The action was dismissed at trial and an appeal from the trial judgment was also dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe two agreements of July 31 and October 31, 1958, taken together with the assignment to the trust company of October 31, constituted a valid equitable assignment of a future chose in action which was so assigned for the express purpose of providing S with security for the advance by way of loan which he made to the defendant companies. The provisions of s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act and s. 4 of The Partnerships Act had no application to that part of the advance secured by this assignment. Badeley v. Consolidated Bank (1888), 38 Ch. D. 238, applied.\nThere was no validity in the plea that the assignment was void as constituting a fraudulent preference.\nS was entitled to be paid $35,000 from the fund held by the trust company, and as to the $5,000 advanced on October 31, 1958, he was entitled to rank pari passu with the general creditors because at the time of that advance no stipulation was made for him to share in the profits of the company. As to the balance of the claim, S was postponed to the general creditors under s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. Appeal allowed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and D.J. Wright for the defendants, respondents: A.H. Rushforth & Co. Ltd., Rest Plan Properties Ltd., and J.S. Whitehead. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from a judgment rendered at trial by Spence J. whereby he had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for the recovery of $50,000 allegedly loaned to A.H. Rushforth and Company Limited, (hereinafter referred to as the Rushforth Company) and Rest Plan Properties Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cRest Plan\u201d) which the appellant claims to have been secured as a first lien on certain moneys lodged with the Guaranty Trust Company of Canada, in the course of providing the necessary financing for the purchase of two apartment houses in the City of Toronto.\nThe circumstances giving rise to this litigation may be summarized as follows:\nIn the summer of 1958 the appellant Sukloff entered into an arrangement with one A.H. Rushforth and the Rushforth Company (of which Rushforth and his appointees were the sole shareholders) to finance the acquisition and resale of apartment house properties in the City of Toronto. The scheme consisted in obtaining options on such properties and the promotion of syndicates to acquire them, the purchase money to be raised by the sale by A.H. Rushforth or his company of units in the syndicates, which were secured under the provisions of deeds of trust pursuant to which the Guaranty Trust Company of Canada was to carry out the purchase on behalf of each syndicate, pay the expenses including a commission to Rushforth and arrange for the reimbursement of the amount of any deposits which had been paid in consideration of obtaining the options.\nIn June 1958, Rushforth engaged in the promotion of two particular syndicates known as \u201cPark Lane Apartments\u201d and \u201cCliffview Apartments\u201d, Sukloff advancing the money required for the deposits on the options and for preliminary expenses. The agreement under which the advances were made was originally oral but was subsequently reduced to writing in a letter dated July 31, 1958, which was drafted by Sukloff. As I have said, deposits on the options for the Cliffview and Park Lane properties of $10,000 and $25,000 respectively were made with moneys provided by Sukloff. The letter of July 31 reads as follows:\nMr. Louis Sukloff,\n157 Old Forest Hill Road,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Sukloff,\nIn consideration of your having advanced the capital necessary for the operations of A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited, A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited agrees as follows:\n(1) After payment of all legitimate obligations and expenses incurred in the normal course of its business the Company shall reimburse the whole amount or such amount as may conveniently be available to L.N. Sukloff with interest at 10%.\n(2) In addition the Company shall cause to be issued to any Trustee nominated by L.N. Sukloff, 50% of the shares of A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited and or such other companies as may be formed or controlled by A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited and such issue shall be made as and when required by L.N. Sukloff. It being the intention that all profits after payment of the sums advanced by L.N. Sukloff and legitimate expenses as aforesaid be divided equally between L.N. Sukloff and A.H. Rushforth.\n(3) The said Trustee shall retain the shares of L.N. Sukloff in trust for L.N. Sukloff\u2014subject to such disposition of them as L.N. Sukloff may direct.\n(4) Neither L.N. Sukloff nor A.H. Rushforth agree either directly or indirectly to purchase any property or engage in any similar activities without first giving A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited the right of first refusal. In the event of any dispute arising between L.N. Sukloff and A.H. Rushforth which cannot be resolved between the parties the matter shall be referred to arbitration.\n(5) It is acknowledged that the sums advanced as aforesaid to date is:\nJune 17, 1958:\n$ 1,000.00\nJune 23, 1958:\n3,500.00\nJuly 23, 1958:\n15,000.00\nJuly 27, 1958:\n5,500.00\n$ 25,000.00\n(6) Any other or further sums will be acknowledged by A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited by separate receipt.\nYours very truly,\n(sgd) A.H. Rushforth\nA.H. Rushforth Pres.\nAt that time advances of $25,000 had been made by Sukloff and, in fact, a further advance of $20,000 was made on the following day, August 1, 1958, and a receipt for that amount endorsed on the letter of July 31st.\nApparently, in order to comply with requirements of the Ontario Securities Commission, a company, Rest Plan Properties Limited, was incorporated on August 6, 1958, and organized on August 8, 1958. It is clear from the record that the sole business of this company was to acquire the two options on the Cliffview and Park Lane properties and to transfer them to the syndicate, the Commission apparently taking the position that this should not be done in the name of the Rushforth Company, the promoter of the two syndicates.\nBy the latter part of October, neither of the property purchases had been completed and, more money being required, Sukloff advanced a further sum of $5,000 to the Rushforth Company and Rest Plan Company on October 31, 1958, under the terms of a written agreement entered into between him and the said two companies and bearing that date.\nAfter reciting that he, Sukloff, had paid to the two companies under terms of the agreement of July 31, 1958, a sum of $45,000 of which $35,000 \u201cis represented by preferred shares in Rest Plan Properties Limited\u201d, and that the said two companies required \u201can additional sum of $5,000 to continue the sale of Units of Participation\u201d in Cliffview and Park Lane, this agreement provided\u2014\nNow THEREFORE in consideration of the advance of Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) by the party of the First Part to the Companies of the Second Part, other valuable consideration, and the mutual considerations herein appearing, the parties hereto agree as follows:\u2014\n1. The Companies of the Second Part acknowledge receipt from the Party of the First Part of the sum of $50,000.00 being the sum of Forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000.00) already advanced as referred to above and the sum of Five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) being advanced on the signing of this agreement and undertaking to repay same on the times as set out below along with interest at ten per cent (10%) per annum on the amount or amounts outstanding from time to time.\n2. The Companies of the Second Part agree to repay to the Party of the First Part the sum of Thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) on the closing of the purchase of either the said Cliffview property or the said Park Lane property whichever shall occur first, which sum is to be paid out of the moneys being disbursed by Guaranty Trust Company of Canada to Rest Plan Properties Limited under the terms of its Trust Agreements with respect to the said properties.\n3. The Companies of the Second Part agree to repay to the Party of the First Part the balance of Fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) plus interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum on the full amount advanced as aforesaid on the closing of the purchase of the Cliffview property or the Park Lane property, whichever shall second occur, which sum is to be disbursed by the Guaranty Trust Company of Canada as aforesaid.\n4. In the event that either or both the purchase of the Cliffview property and Park Lane property are not closed then the Companies of the Second Part covenant and agree to repay the said sum of Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) as soon as funds are available it being understood that if the said purchases are not closed as aforesaid and if either or both the deposits paid out therein are returned, then the said deposits in full will be paid over to the Party of the First Part, forthwith but if the Thirty five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) is paid by the Companies of the Second Part under Clause 2 hereof then the payment of moneys as provided under this Clause 4 shall not apply.\n5. The Payment by the Companies of the Second Part to the Party of the First Part of the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) under this agreement shall constitute redemption by Rest Plan Properties Limited of its outstanding preference shares in the name of the Party of the First Part.\n6. On receipt by the Party of the First Part of the return of the full amount of capital invested namely Fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), plus interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum as aforesaid the Party of the First Part will surrender to the Companies of the Second Part all rights and title he may have to interests in the Companies of the Second Part under the terms of the agreement as set out in the letter dated July 31, 1958 as aforesaid and to release the Companies of the Second Part from all claims, costs, damages and liabilities arising from the said agreement other than the return of the capital and interest as aforesaid and to transfer to A.H. Rushforth all outstanding shares in the Companies of the Second Part.\n7. In conclusion of the covenants herein set out the Companies of the Second Part and their Directors shall be absolved entirely of any further responsibility or liability to the said Party of the First Part in connection herewith.\n8. This agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators and\/or assigns respectively.\nOn the same date, October 31, 1958, the Rest Plan Company gave a written direction to the trust company to pay to Sukloff \u201cthe sum of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) from the moneys due to us on the closing of the purchase of either Cliffview Apartments, Pell Street, Scarborough, or Park Lane Apartments, 110 St. Clair Avenue West, Toronto, whichever occurs the first\u201d. It later purported to revoke this direction.\nThe purchase of the Cliffview property was never completed but that of the Park Lane property was completed on December 19, 1958, and after payment of the purchase price there remained in the hands of the trust company a sum of $55,000 to be paid to the person or persons entitled thereto.\nSukloff\u2019s contention is that under the agreement of October 31,1958, and the direction given by Rest Plan and Rushforth companies to Guaranty Trust bearing the same date, he had acquired by way of equitable assignment a first lien on the said fund of $55,000 held by the Guaranty Trust Company to the extent of $35,000 with interest at 5% from December 19, 1958. The existence and enforceability of such charge or lien is the principal question at issue on this appeal.\nThis action was commenced by writ of summons dated December 29, 1958, but in the month of March, 1960, both the Rushforth and Rest Plan Companies made assignments for the benefit of their creditors under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, and J.S. Whitehead having been appointed trustee of their estates, leave was granted to continue the action and the said J.S. Whitehead as such trustee was added as a party defendant. The plaintiff also claims that he is entitled to rank as a creditor in the bankruptcy of the two defendant companies for the sum of $15,000 plus interest.\nThe trustee raised the following, amongst other, defences:\n1. That the sums claimed were advances for the purpose of carrying on a business and as such were contributions to capital and could not be recovered until the trade creditors had been paid in full and in fact that the plaintiff and the two defendant companies were partners;\n2. That either Rest Plan was insolvent at all material times since the execution of the agreement of October 31 or the redemption of its preferred shares pursuant to para. 5 of that agreement would have rendered it insolvent and accordingly the redemption was prohibited pursuant to s. 27(12) of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71.\n3. That the agreement and the direction to Guaranty Trust Company of October 31 were void pursuant to the provisions of s. 2 of The Fraudulent Conveyances Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 148;\n4. That the plaintiff, Sukloff, is not entitled to recover anything in respect of advances made by him until the claims of all other creditors of the bankrupt companies have been satisfied, and in this regard the trustee relies upon the provisions of s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, and ss. 3 and 4 of The Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 288.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Spence J. made the express finding that although it was intended that Sukloff and A.H. Rushforth should be partners, the appellant never entered into any such relationship with either of the two limited companies, and that his relationship with these companies was confined to that of a lender or financier who had a right to share in the profits, if any, of the undertakings of these companies. I am satisfied that this is the proper conclusion on the evidence, but the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal took the view that the relationship was one to which s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act and s. 4 of The Partnerships Act were directly applicable so as to postpone the claim of the appellant to the rights of the trade creditors of the companies. Section 98 of the Bankruptcy Act reads as follows:\nWhere a lender advances money to a borrower engaged or about to engage in trade or business under a contract with the borrower that the lender\u2026shall receive a share of the profits arising from carrying on the trade or business and the borrower subsequently becomes bankrupt the lender of the money is not entitled to recover anything in respect of the loan until the claims of all other creditors of the borrower have been satisfied.\nSection 4 of The Partnerships Act is to the same effect containing as it does, the provision that:\n\u2026the lender of the loan is not entitled to recover anything in respect of his loan. until the claims of the other creditors of the borrower\u2026for valuable consideration in money or money\u2019s worth, are satisfied.\nThese statutes appear to find their origins in \u201cAn Act to amend the Law of Partnership\u201d (frequently referred to as Bovill\u2019s Act) passed in England in 1865 as c. 86 of 28-29 Victoria. By s. 5 of that Act it is provided:\nIn the event of any such Trader as aforesaid being adjudged a Bankrupt, or taking the Benefit of any Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors, or entering into an Arrangement to pay his Creditors less than Twenty Shillings in the Pound\u2026the Lender of any such Loan as aforesaid shall not be entitled to recover any Portion of his Principal, or of the Profits or Interest payable in respect of such Loan\u2026until the Claims of the other Creditors of the said Trader for valuable Consideration in Money or Money\u2019s Worth, have been satisfied.\nLaidlaw J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal in this case, expressed the view that the moneys advanced by the appellant were not intended to be a mere loan of money, but rather that they were a contribution to the capital of a business enterprise in which the appellant had a personal and business interest, and in this regard he relied upon the decision of Rommer J. in In re Meade[2], in which the Court of Appeal in England followed the case of In re Beale[3]. In re Meade was a case in which a woman who was living with the debtor Meade as his wife, entered into a riding academy business with him and furnished him with the money to buy the riding academy and much of the equipment. The intention was that the two persons concerned should live together on the property and operate the business together living on the proceeds thereof. Laidlaw J.A. cites this case as authority for the proposition that:\nWhere a person has authorized the employment of his assets in a business he cannot prove in competition with the creditors of the business in respect of the assets so authorized to be employed.\nIn my opinion, the key to the decision in the Meade case appears to be furnished by the following comment on the appellant\u2019s argument which occurs towards the end of Mr. Justice Rommer\u2019s judgment where he says:\nThe truth of the matter is that the whole foundation of Mr. Davies\u2019 argument is undermined by the realization that the moneys which the appellant advanced did not constitute, and were never intended to constitute, a loan at all. They represented her contribution to the capital of a business enterprise in which she plainly had an interest herself; and in my judgment she is no more entitled, as against the ordinary creditors of the business, to prove in respect of her contribution than the proprietor is entitled to prove in respect of his.\nIn Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3d ed., vol. 2 at p. 495, the cases of Meade and Beale are cited as authority for the proposition that:\nIf a person advances money to another not by way of loan but as a contribution to the capital of a business carried on for their joint benefit, the person who has made the advance, even though he is not a partner in the business and has received no share of the profits as such, is debarred from proving in the bankruptcy of the recipient of the money in competition with the creditors of the business.\nAs I have indicated, I do not construe Mr. Sukloff\u2019s role as that of one who was supplying capital for a business carried on for the joint benefit of himself and the two limited companies. On the other hand, effect must be given to the terms of the assignment of October 31, 1958, which was addressed Guaranty Trust Company and reads as follows:\nWe A.H. Rushforth & Company Limited and Rest Plan Properties Limited hereby authorize and direct you to pay to the order of Louis N. Sukloff, 157 Old Forest Hill Road, Toronto, the sum of Thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00) from the moneys due to us on the closing of the purchase of either Cliffview Apartments, Pell Street, Scarborough or Park Lane Apartments, 110 St. Clair Avenue West, Toronto, whichever occurs the first and this shall be your good and sufficient authority for so doing. The evidence does not satisfy me that the companies were insolvent at the time when this assignment was given and it appears to me to constitute valid security for part of the advance made by the appellant.\nIn the course of the argument before this Court, counsel for the appellant made reference to the case of Badeley v. Consolidated Bank[4], which, as I understand it, was not drawn to the attention of either of the Courts below. That was a case in which the plaintiff advanced money to a contractor to enable him to carry out a contract with a railway company for the construction of a railroad and the parties executed a deed by which the contractor assigned to the plaintiff all his machinery, plant, etc., and all shares and debentures he might receive from the company to secure the repayment of the loan. The deed also provided that the plaintiff should receive 10 per cent interest on his money and 10 per cent of the net profits. Having held that the plaintiff and the railway company were not partners in the undertaking, Cotton L.J., commenting on the provisions of s. 5 of Bovill\u2019s Act, had this to say:\nMr. Wallis says the Plaintiff is here seeking to recover within the meaning of the section. In my opinion he is not seeking to recover any principal or interest. These words must mean, recover as against the property of the debtor not comprised in the security. If there is a security then insisting upon that security is not recovering principal and interest from the debtor. It may enable him ultimately to get it; but insisting upon the security and realizing the security, or, in my opinion, taking any proceedings which are necessary in order to recover that which is comprised in the security, cannot be said to be recovering principal or interest within the meaning of that section. In my opinion, that section only means that the lender shall not come in and rank with other creditors in the bankruptcy independently of any security he has in respect of the principal, interest or profits. He is not in any way prevented from insisting upon his security\u2026\nIt appears to me that Badeley\u2019s case provides a very close analogy to the present circumstances and that the reasoning advanced by the Court of Appeal in England in that case in relation to Bovill\u2019s Act applies with equal force to the provisions of s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act and s. 4 of The Partnerships Act. It is, however, argued on behalf of the respondent that the principle of Badeley\u2019s case does not apply where the security is taken, as were the equitable assignments in this case, after the original loan. I can see nothing in either Badeley\u2019s case or in Ex parte Sheil[5] to limit their application to cases in which the taking of security is contemporaneous with the making of an advance, and in any event, the present case is marked by the fact that a further advance of $5,000 was made at the time of the taking of the security on October 31, 1958.\nThe two agreements of July 31 and October 31, 1958, taken together with the direction addressed to the Guaranty Trust Company on October 31, in my opinion constitute a valid equitable assignment of a future chose in action which was so assigned for the express purpose of providing the plaintiff with security for the advance by way of loan which he made to the Rushforth and Rest Plan Companies, nor do I think that there is any validity in the plea that the assignment was void as constituting a fraudulent preference.\nThe agreement of October 31 states that $35,000 of the loan \u201cis represented by preference shares in Rest Plan Properties Limited\u2026\u201d and it is contended that payment of this amount to the plaintiff would constitute a redemption of its preference shares by the company, and that such a transaction would contravene the provisions of s. 27(12) of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, which provides that:\n(12) Preference shares shall not be redeemed or purchased for cancellation by the company if the company is insolvent or if the redemption or purchase would render the company insolvent.\nIt appears to me that the preference shares in question were issued to Sukloff as additional security for his loan, and it is apparent from the provisions of para. 6 of the agreement of October 31, that they were to be surrendered upon payment of the $50,000 which Sukloff had advanced.\nThe purchase of the Park Lane property was completed on December 19, 1958, and on the principle that equity regards that to be done which ought to have been done, it appears to me that the rights of parties are to be considered as if the shares had been redeemed on that date. This being the case, it is clear that in seeking to invoke the provisions of s. 27(12) of The Corporations Act, the defendants assume the burden of proving that the Rest Plan Company was insolvent at that date, or that the redemption of their shares would have rendered it insolvent, and I am not satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to discharge this burden.\nIn view of all the above, I have formed the opinion that the appellant is entitled to be paid $35,000 from the fund now held by the Guaranty Trust Company, and that as to the $5,000 advanced on October 31, 1958, he is entitled to rank pari passu with the general creditors because at the time of that advance no stipulation was made for him to share in the profits of the company. As to the balance of his claim, I think that he is postponed to the general creditors having regard to the terms of the agreement and to the provisions of s. 98 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nI would accordingly allow this appeal and direct that the plaintiff should have judgment against the Guaranty Trust Company of Canada in the sum of $35,000 with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum from December 19, 1958, and that it be declared that the plaintiff is entitled to rank as an ordinary creditor in the bankruptcy of the two respondent companies in the amount of $5,000.\nThe appellant should have his costs as against the Rushforth and Rest Plan Companies, but there should be no costs against Guaranty Trust Company of Canada which played the role of a stakeholder throughout the proceedings.\n[Editorial note:\u2014On a motion to vary the minutes of the above judgment, the hearing of which was commenced on June 8, 1964, and adjourned to June 15, 1964, the following judgment was delivered on June 29, 1964.]\nThe formal judgment of this Court delivered on April 28, 1964, is amended to read as follows:\n\u201cThe appeal is allowed, the judgments in the Courts below are set aside and it is directed that judgment be entered providing that the appellant do recover from the respondent, Guaranty Trust Company of Canada the sum of $35,000 with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum from December 19, 1958, and declaring that the appellant is entitled to rank as an ordinary creditor in the bankruptcy of the respondent companies, A.H. Rushforth & Company, Limited and Rest Plan Properties Limited for the amount of $5,000 with interest at 5 per cent per annum from October 21, 1958. The appellant shall recover his costs throughout from J.S. Whitehead, Trustee of the estate of A.H. Rushforth and Company Limited and Rest Plan Properties Limited. The costs of the respondent Guaranty Trust Company of Canada of the trial of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court shall be paid out of the fund in its hands and it is declared to be entitled to a lien therefor on that fund.\u201d\nThere will be no order as to the costs of this application.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Allen, Hunter, Campbell & Regan, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents, A.H.

There was evidence that on the day in question the brothers had been drinking and had quarrelled over a girl. The appellant obtained a gun from a friend, waited sometime for his brother to come out of the house and shot and killed him. The Court of Appeal having directed a new trial, the Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the questions (1) as to whether the trial judge erred in failing to point out to the jury that deliberation might have been negatived by provocation and drunkenness; and (2) as to whether the jury should have been instructed respecting the rule in Hodge's case.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The charge of the trial judge was defective in the failure to bring the questions of provocation and drunkenness to the attention of the jury upon the issue of planning and deliberation. In determining whether the accused committed the crime of capital murder, the jury should have available and should be directed to consider all the circumstances including not only the evidence of the accused actions but of his condition, his state of mind as affected by either real or even imagined insults and provoking actions of the victim and by the accused consumption of alcohol. This is a finding of fact. The jury should have been instructed upon provocation and drunkenness when the trial judge was dealing with murder, whether capital or non-capital, under s. 201 of the Code. Then, with clear indication that he was passing on to the other and important matter of the additional ingredient needed to establish capital murder, the trial judge should have brought the jury's attention to all relevant evidence to determine whether the murder was planned and deliberate. Such a procedure is necessary to illustrate to the jury the absolute necessity of considering the evidence firstly upon the issue of intent and the ameliorating provision as to provocation and then again, only if they find against the accused on the first issue, upon the issue of planning and deliberation. It could not be said, despite other evidence pointing strongly to the conclusion that the murder was planned and deliberate, that the jury might not at least have found a reasonable doubt that the accused might have acted in a frenzy and in such a highly emotional state influenced by intoxication so that it would not be planned and deliberate on his part.\nEven though the evidence in respect of the issue of planning and deliberation was circumstantial, the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case. In that case the direction was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who had committed the crime. The rule is concerned with evidence as to the commission of an act. These instructions did not apply and were never intended to apply to the issue here. The task of a jury which is required to consider whether a murder is capital or not, is entirely different. Before it is called upon to determine the issue of planning and deliberation, it must already have reached the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused has committed murder. It is then called upon to decide whether the murder was planned and deliberate and not whether the accused committed the act. It must consider the whole of the evidence in relation to the issue of planning and deliberation. The charge to be given by the judge to the jury with respect to this issue is that it must consider all the evidence before it, aided by his instruction as to what evidence is indicative of planning and deliberation and what indicates the contrary, including circumstances and conditions affecting the capacity and ability to plan and deliberate. Having weighed the evidence, the jury can only reach a verdict of capital murder if satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was planned and deliberate.\nPer Cartwright J.: The jury should have been instructed on the issue of planning and deliberation in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case. Having reached the conclusion that the accused was guilty of murder, the jury was then called upon to inquire whether the murder was planned and deliberate. There was ample evidence to support findings by the jury that the murder was planned and deliberate; but all of this evidence was circumstantial. Whether a murder is planned and whether it is deliberate are both questions of fact which involve an inquiry into the state of mind of the accused at the relevant time. The key word in the rule in Hodge's case is \"rational\". The jury could not find a verdict of capital murder unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion from the facts established by the whole of the evidence was that the killing was planned and deliberate.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], directing a new trial on a charge of capital murder. Appeal dismissed.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJohn E. Spencer, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] pronounced on November 7, 1963, allowing an appeal from the conviction by the Honourable Mr. Justice MacLean on September 6, 1963, upon the findings of a jury. The accused was convicted of capital murder contra the Criminal Code, s. 202A(2) (a). The Court of Appeal of British Columbia directed a new trial.\nThe appeal was by leave granted by this Court on December 9, 1963, upon the following questions:\n(a) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in holding that the Learned Trial Judge should have told the jury that even if they rejected provocation as a defence to murder generally it was open to them to consider provocation as negativing deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital murder?\n(b) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in holding that the Learned Trial Judge should have told the jury that they might consider evidence of the Respondent's drinking as showing that his passions had been inflamed by alcohol and therefore had a bearing on the important element of deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital murder and in failing to point out to the jury that deliberation might be negatived by drunkenness falling short of incapacity to form the intent to kill?\n(c) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in holding that the Learned Trial Judge should have charged the jury on the rules relating to circumstantial evidence as set out in Hodge's case (1883) 168 E.R. 1186?\nWhittaker J.A., with whom Davey and Sheppard JJ.A. agreed, gave reasons for allowing the appeal from the conviction upon the basis that the trial judge in his charge failed to direct the jury properly upon the issue of whether the murder had been \"planned and deliberate\" as those words are used in s. 202A(2) (a). Tysoe J.A. also delivered reasons for judgment in which he came to the same conclusion as Whittaker J.A. upon that issue but added that the charge of the learned trial judge was defective in that it did not contain the appropriate instruction upon circumstantial evidence as outlined in Hodge's case[3]. Sheppard J.A. disagreed with the latter conclusion and Whittaker J.A. did not deem it necessary to express any view thereon.\nIt must be realized that the learned trial judge did not have the advantage of the reasons for judgment of this Court in More v. The Queen[4], only delivered on July 23, 1963, and first reported in October 1963, when he charged the jury at this trial on September 6,1963. In the More case, this Court dealt with the circumstance that the evidence of two doctors as to the mental condition of the accused, which stopped far short of diagnosing him as insane within the meaning of s. 16(2) of the Criminal Code, was to all intent and purpose removed from the consideration of the jury by the trial judge in his charge. Cartwright J. said at p. 534:\nThe evidence of the two doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether the accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury in deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger, which so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the intentional act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. The question is one of fact and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused at the moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it, in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well cause them to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse rather than by consideration. On this question the accused was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.\nIn a judgment of Ritchie J. in Regina v. McMartin[5] (delivered at the same time as are the reasons of the Court in this appeal), he said at p. 13:\nIn my opinion, without the evidence of the appellant's mental history and condition, it cannot be said that all the circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was planned and deliberate have been passed upon by a jury, and I would accordingly allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial.\nI am of the opinion that the judgments in these two cases have as their ratio decidendi the principle that in determining whether the accused committed the crime of capital murder in that it was \"planned and deliberate on the part of such person\" the jury should have available and should be directed to consider all the circumstances including not only the evidence of the accused's actions but of his condition, his state of mind as affected by either real or even imagined insults and provoking actions of the victim and by the accused's consumption of alcohol. There is no doubt this is a finding of fact. The questions which the jury must decide and decide beyond reasonable doubt before they may convict the accused of capital murder under the relevant subsection, section 202A(2) (a), are: Was the murder which he committed planned and was it deliberate? I separate the jury's problem in that form because I am in complete agreement with Whittaker J.A. when he said: \"It is possible to imagine a murder to some degree planned and yet not deliberate.\" Therefore, to determine whether the charge to the jury delivered by the learned trial judge was adequate in submitting to them the issue of planning and deliberation the charge must be examined with some care.\nIt should be stated at once that the charge so far as it dealt with provocation under s. 203 and with drunkenness as it affects murder under the doctrine in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[6] was, with respect, excellent. That, however, I believe, is not sufficient. The jury should have been instructed upon those topics when the trial judge was dealing with murder, whether capital or non-capital, under s. 201. Then, with clear indication that he was passing on to the other and important matter of the additional ingredient needed to establish capital murder under s. 202A(2) (a), the learned trial judge should have brought the jury's attention to all relevant evidence to determine whether the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused, and therefore, capital murder. I am the first to agree that such a charge is difficult, onerous and may be, unless great care is exercised, somewhat repetitive, and no attempt should be made to force charges to the jury into an inflexible mould, yet I believe some such procedure is necessary to illustrate to the jury the absolute necessity of considering the evidence firstly upon the issue of intent and the ameliorating provision as to provocation and then again, only if they find against the accused on the first issue, upon the issue of planning and deliberation. I adopt upon this latter issue the statement of Tysoe J.A. in his reasons:\nOur concern is with quite a different matter, namely, the effect of the drinking of the appellant and of the deceased's provocative conduct on the mind and mental processes of the appellant in his then condition in relation to the issue of planning and deliberation on his part.\nIt might be preferable, in discussing insults and the accused's state of mind as they affected deliberation, to avoid the use of the word \"provocation\" as that word would, in the mind of the jury, be associated with the exact technical sense in which the word is utilized in s. 203. Such circumstances have a broader and less exact scope in the determination of whether the murder was deliberate.\nIt is true that the learned trial judge in the charge, after defining \"planned\" and \"deliberate\", said:\nNow these two words must be read together, the meaning of one colours the meaning of the other, planned and deliberate. The circumstances must be such that there was time for the conception of a plan to deliberately kill, and it is for you to say whether in the circumstances of the case there was such time.\nPlanned and deliberate conceives a killing not done under the stress of sudden passion or sudden emotion. Therefore before the accused can be found guilty of capital murder the Crown must not only prove that the accused is guilty of murder, as I have defined and explained it to you already, but must further prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate on his part.\nAnd shortly thereafter in reciting the various actions of the accused which the jury could consider in determining whether the murder were planned and deliberate, he said:\nNow there was an argument between Harvey and the accused in the kitchen with regard to Corinne.\nI am of the opinion that this reference to the conduct of the victim upon the issue of whether the murder was deliberate on the part of the accused is too slight under the circumstances and I subscribe to the opinion of Whittaker J.A. when he said:\nThe jury were not told that even if they rejected provocation as a defence to murder generally, it was open to them to consider provocation as negativing deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital. I think this should have been put to them divorced from the somewhat complicated provisions of the Code which deal with provocation reducing murder to manslaughter.\nThe learned trial judge, as I have said, adequately instructed the jury on the issue of drunkenness as it affected the question of intent under s. 201 but again I am in agreement with Whittaker J.A. when he said:\nThe learned Judge was, of course, dealing with drunkenness as a defence to murder generally, but it was not anywhere suggested in the charge that the jury might consider the evidence of drink as showing that appellant's passions had been inflamed by alcohol and, therefore, having a bearing on the important element of deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital. Nor was it pointed out that deliberation might be negatived by drunkenness falling short of incapacity to form the intent to kill, if the jury thought such a finding supported by the evidence.\nI have, therefore, concluded that the charge of the learned trial judge was defective in the failure to bring these elements to the attention of the jury upon the issue of planning and deliberation and I cannot say, despite other evidence pointing strongly to the conclusion that the murder was planned and deliberate, that the jury might not at least have found a reasonable doubt that the accused might have acted in a frenzy and in such a highly emotional state influenced by intoxication so that it would not be planned and deliberate on his part. I therefore would answer both questions (a) and (b) in the order granting leave to appeal in the negative.\nIn the Court below, three of the five judges considered the question as to whether, in respect of the issue of planning and deliberation, the jury should have been charged in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case[7]. Tysoe J.A., with whom Bird J.A. concurred, was of the opinion that, since the evidence on this issue was circumstantial, the jury should have been so charged. Sheppard J.A. took the view that the evidence in respect of the issue was direct, and it was, therefore, unnecessary so to charge the jury. No opinion was expressed by the other two members of the Court.\nThe issue is an important one. Planning and deliberation involve the exercise of mental processes. Because of that, in almost every case where a jury is required to reach a conclusion as to whether or not a murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused, it must reach a conclusion on the basis of evidence which is circumstantial. Does the fact that evidence is circumstantial necessarily require that an instruction be given to the jury in accordance with that which was given in Hodge's case? To answer this question it is desirable to recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge's case. The report states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.\nBaron Alderson told the jury that the case was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, \"not only that those circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person\".\nIt is quite clear that this direction was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who had committed the crime. A murder had been committed. There was some circumstantial evidence which implicated the accused. One of the tasks of the jury was to decide whether the accused was the man who had perpetrated the crime. The direction given by Baron Alderson was to instruct the jury as to how far the evidence must go in order to warrant a decision that the accused was the person who had \"committed the act\".\nThe rule in Hodge's case was stated in the same way, in this Court, by Chief Justice Duff in Comba v. The King[8], and it has been referred to in several other decisions of this Court. By its own terms, however, the rule is concerned with evidence as to the commission of an act. In my opinion, that limitation is a proper one. A criminal charge is laid as a result of the commission of a certain act or certain acts. If the evidence against the accused is circumstantial in character, then a jury should only find him guilty in respect of those acts if consistent with his having committed them and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that he did.\nThe task of a jury which is required to consider whether a murder is capital or not, is entirely different. Before it is ever called upon to determine the issue of planning and deliberation it must already have reached the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused has committed murder. What it is now called upon to decide is not whether the accused committed the act, but whether the murder, of which he is guilty, was planned and deliberate on his part. The pattern of evidence which it must now consider is not a series of facts, which, in order to establish guilt, must lead to a single conclusion. The jury is now concerned with the mental processes of a person who has committed a crime. In relation to that crime it has to consider his actions, his conduct, his statements, and his capacity and ability to plan and deliberate. It must consider the whole of the evidence in relation to the issue of planning and deliberation. In nearly every case some of this evidence may indicate planning and deliberation and some may indicate the contrary. The jury must weigh all of this evidence and arrive at a conclusion.\nWith respect to this issue, in my opinion, the charge to be given by the judge to the jury is that it must consider all of the evidence before it, aided by his instruction as to that evidence which is indicative of planning and deliberation and that, including circumstances and conditions affecting the capacity and ability to plan and deliberate, which indicates the contrary, and that, having weighed the evidence, it can only reach a verdict of capital murder if satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder committed by the accused was planned and also was deliberate on his part.\nThis does not, in the slightest degree, reduce the onus of proof which rests upon the Crown in criminal cases and does not substitute any other rule. The direction in Hodge's case did not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct from the intent which accompanied that act. The first element, assuming every circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable of proof to a demonstration. The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth of the accused himself, could never be so proved. The circumstances which establish the former not only can be, but must be consistent with each other, as otherwise a reasonable doubt on the issue arises. The circumstances which establish the latter, being evidence personal to one individual, will seldom, if ever, be wholly consistent with only one conclusion as to his mental state and yet the weight of evidence on the issue may be such as to satisfy the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, as to the guilty intent of the accused. The instruction of Baron Alderson in Hodge's case does not apply and was never intended to apply to an issue of this kind.\nFor the reasons which I have outlined, I am of the opinion that Tysoe J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, was in error in the view which he expressed in his reasons and I would answer question (c) in the affirmative. However, being of the opinion that questions (a) and (b) should be answered in the negative, I would dismiss the appeal.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The questions on which leave to appeal was granted are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence, which I have had the advantage of reading.\nI agree with the view which he expresses as to the manner in which it will generally be advisable for a trial judge to instruct the jury in regard to the proper way in which to deal with the question whether a murder, which they find was committed by the accused, was \"planned and deliberate\".\nThe appeal can succeed only if we give an affirmative answer to all three of the questions on which leave to appeal has been granted.\nI do not find it necessary to express a final opinion on questions (a) and (b). The defects in the charge which are said to require a negative answer to these questions are the alleged failure of the learned trial judge to call to the attention of the jury the possible effect of the evidence as to drunkenness and provocation on the questions, (i) whether the accused was capable of planning and of deliberate action, (ii) whether he did in fact plan, and (iii) whether his action in firing the fatal shot was in fact a deliberate one.\nIt is true that the judge did not direct the jury specifically in relation to the possible effect of the evidence as to drunkenness and provocation on the answers they should make to these questions although he had dealt adequately with that evidence in discussing the differences between murder and manslaughter. On the other hand he directed the jury clearly on the meaning of the words \"planned and deliberate\" and emphasized the onus lying on the Crown to prove both planning and deliberate action beyond a reasonable doubt. The reasons of the members of this Court in More v. The Queen[9], referred to in the reasons of my brother Spence, must be read in the light of the peculiar facts of that particular case, in which the accused had given evidence to the effect that over the course of some days he had contemplated taking the lives of his wife and himself and had made preparations to do this, but that, at the last moment, while still in a state of indecision and distress, he had fired the fatal shot without conscious volition and without realizing that he was doing so.\nI incline to the view that the absence of any evidence similar to that given in More v. The Queen differentiates that case from the case at bar; but, as already indicated, I do not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion on questions (a) and (b). The reason for this is that, in my opinion, question (c) should be answered in the negative.\nIn considering question (c), it is to be assumed that the jury have reached the conclusion that the accused caused the death of his victim, that he intended to cause his death, that the circumstances were not such as to reduce the offence to manslaughter and that, consequently, the accused is guilty of murder. It is only when the jury have reached this conclusion that it becomes necessary for them to proceed to the further inquiry whether the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused.\nAs there is to be a new trial in the case at bar it is desirable to say no more about the evidence than is necessary to make clear the reasons for decision. It is, I think, sufficient to say in this case that there was ample evidence to support findings by the jury that the murder was planned on the part of the accused and that his act in firing the fatal shot was deliberate, that is to say was considered rather than impulsive; but it is clear that all of this evidence was circumstantial.\nIt is equally clear that the questions whether the murder was planned and whether it was the deliberate act of the accused are both questions of fact, the solution of which involves an inquiry into the state of mind of the accused at the relevant time. In Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[10], Bowen L.J. said:\nThere must be a misstatement of an existing fact: but the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else.\nIn Clayton v. Ramsden[11], Lord Wright said:\nStates of mind are capable of proof like other matters of fact.\nIn Lizotte v. The Queen[12], there is the following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court:\nHodge's case was a case where all the evidence against the accused was circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is not necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as well as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.\nThere is no doubt that an affirmative finding of fact that the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused is essential to a conviction of capital murder where, as in this case, the charge is based on s. 202A(2) (a) of the Criminal Code.\nIt is argued, however, that although all the evidence put forward to support that essential finding of fact is circumstantial it is unnecessary and indeed, if I have understood the argument correctly, undesirable for the trial judge to instruct the jury on this issue in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case[13].\nThe substance of that rule is that, in a criminal case, where proof of any issue of fact essential to the case of the Crown consists of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the judge to instruct the jury that before they can find the accused guilty they must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with an affirmative finding on the issue so sought to be proved but that the circumstances are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. In my opinion this rule is one not merely of prudent practice but of positive law.\nI do not pause to examine the long line of cases in which the rule is formulated because, apart altogether from those authorities, the rule appears to me to follow inevitably as a corollary of the rule that the jury must not convict unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\nIn the case at bar, for example, no one would question the assertion that the jury must not convict the accused of capital murder unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his act in firing the fatal shot was deliberate in the sense of being considered rather than impulsive. Suppose that the jury had returned a special verdict in the following words:\u2014\"We are all satisfied that the prisoner is guilty of murder; as to whether he is guilty of capital murder we are all satisfied that the circumstances which we find proved are consistent with the view that the prisoner's act in firing was deliberate and that it is highly probable that it was deliberate but we are all also of opinion that those circumstances are not rationally inconsistent with the view that his act was impulsive and not deliberate\". I think it clear that on such a verdict the Court could record a conviction of murder only and not a conviction of capital murder.\nThe key word in the rule in Hodge's case is \"rational\". How, it may be asked, can the proof of circumstances which are rationally consistent with the innocence of the accused establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt? How can the proof of circumstances rationally consistent with the act of the accused having been impulsive rather than considered establish beyond reasonable doubt that his act was deliberate?\nIn the case of a charge of capital murder based on s. 202A(2) (a) of the Criminal Code the Crown is called upon, as a condition precedent to the finding of a verdict of guilty, to prove a matter of fact which from its nature will frequently be susceptible of proof only by circumstantial evidence and which will often, to use the words of Bowen L.J., be \"very difficult to prove\". But the consideration that proof of a matter of fact which Parliament has seen fit to require will often be difficult does not permit the Court to modify the long established rules as to the standard of proof in criminal cases and to substitute the rule applicable in civil cases that issues may be decided upon the balance of probabilities.\nIn regard to question (c), I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Tysoe J.A. For the above reasons I would answer question (c) on which leave to appeal was granted in the negative and would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G. L.

Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 202A(2) (a), 589(1)(b).\nThe appellant was convicted on a charge of capital murder of his common-law wife. He did not testify. The evidence for the Crown was that he had quarrelled with his wife after she returned to their house at 1:30 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 1962. When the children left for school at 8:15 a.m., the wife was alive. Sometime after 9 a.m. the appellant was seen at the back of his house with an axe; about a minute and a half later he was at his front gate and on his way to telephone the police. When the police arrived, the wife was dead with severe lacerations on the right side of the face and head. There was no evidence of any persons being in the house between 8:15 am. and 9:30 a.m. other than the appellant and his wife. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction and refused an application by the appellant to introduce fresh evidence before it as to his mental condition at the time of the crime. On appeal to this Court the Crown was called upon to answer only the grounds (1) as to whether the trial judge should have granted a defence motion for an adjournment in order for it to obtain and introduce further medical evidence; and (2) as to whether the defence motion before the Court of Appeal to adduce fresh evidence should have been granted.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The application for an adjournment of the trial appeared to have been directed to the issue of insanity which was not pleaded at the trial. The question of whether or not an adjournment\nis to be granted rests in the discretion of the judge who is trying the case, and the affidavit filed at the hearing of this appeal did not contain sufficient information as to the circumstances under which this application was made to justify the conclusion that there was any error in principle in refusing the adjournment. The proposed evidence, which the defence sought to introduce in the Court of Appeal, was not directed towards proving that the appellant was legally insane at the time of the crime, but rather towards showing that a psychiatric examination after the trial had disclosed that he had long been suffering from a disorder of the mind which manifested itself in impulsive, unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, and that his long history of mental disorder was a relevant circumstance proper to be considered, together with all the other circumstances disclosed in the evidence, in determining whether or not the murder was planned and deliberate on his part. It is recognized that special grounds must be shown in order to justify the Court of Appeal in exercising the power conferred upon it by s. 589(1) of the Criminal Code. The evidence tendered on such an application was not to be judged and rejected on the ground that it did not disprove the verdict as found by the jury, or that it failed to discharge the burden of proving that the appellant was incapable of planning and deliberation or that it did not rebut inferences which appeared to have been drawn by the jury. It was enough if the proposed evidence was of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury, R. v. Buckle, 94 C.C.C. 84, referred to. Under the present circumstances it could not be said that the conduct of the appellant's counsel indicated lack of reasonable diligence to obtain such evidence before the trial. The evidence in question, like that in Regina v. More, [19631 S.C.R. 522, might have caused the jury to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by a sudden impulse rather than by consideration. It should have been admitted by the Court of Appeal. Without the evi\u00addence of the appellant's mental history and condition, it could not be said that all the circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was planned and deliberate have been passed upon by a jury.\nCARTWRIGHT J. agrees subject to a reservation regarding the applicability of the rule in Hodge's case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia', affirming the conviction of the appellant for capital murder and refusing leave to introduce further evidence. Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nH. A. D. Oliver, for the appellant.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was deliv\u00adered by\nRITCHIE J.:-This is an appeal from a judgment of th( Court of Appeal of British Columbia[1] by which that Court with Davey J.A. dissenting, affirmed the conviction of the appellant for the capital murder of Celestine Bob and unanimously refused an application made on his behalf to introduce further evidence before it as to his mental condi\u00adtion at the time of the crime.\nThe appellant did not testify and no evidence was intro\u00adduced on his behalf at the trial so that the jury's verdict was of necessity based on the account given by the various Crown witnesses of the circumstances surrounding the killing.\nThis account disclosed that at about 1:30 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 1962, Celestine Bob returned to the house near the settlement of Lillooet, B.C., where she and the appellant had been living with their two children as man and wife for a number of years; she was accompanied by a man named Stavast who appears to have given her a lift in his car and who came into the house for half an hour and had a glass of beer and a discussion or argument with the appellant about \"work\". Marilyn Bob, a 14-year old child, testified that after Stavast had left she heard the appellant and her mother \"arguing about how come that man took her home\", but there is no evidence of any further incident until after the two children left for school at 8:15, at which time they both say that their mother was alive and the little boy, Percy Bob, says that he saw her waving to them when they were waiting for the school bus. Sometime after 9 a.m., a man named Whitney, who was walking along the road behind and to one side of the McMartin house, noticed the appellant at the back of his house pick up an axe and knock a piece of wood from its blade, and about a minute and a half later he encountered the appellant at his front gate; he was then breathing heavily and asked Whitney to come with him to the shoemaker's who appears to have had the only telephone in the immediate vicinity. On arriving at the shoemaker's, the appellant telephoned to the police at Lillooet saying, in part, \"Come down as quick as possible and you'll find out for yourself\". As a result, Corporal Chiunyk of the R.C.M. Police drove at once to the shoe-maker's and accompanied the appellant to his house where he was shown the dead body of Celestine Bob with severe lacerations on the right side of her face and head, and he then noticed an axe in a box in the corner of the same room. The appellant declined to say anything until he saw his lawyer and when the Corporal told him that he would have to take him into custody he replied, \"I am prepared\". At the trial Dr. Clark testified that it was very likely that the deceased had died as a result of blows from the axe found in the room and that she had probably been hit when asleep.\nFor the purpose of this case the relevant definition of capital murder is that contained in s. 202A(2) (a) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n(2) Murder is capital murder, in respect of any person, where (a) it is planned and deliberate on the part of such person, .. .\nIn More v. The Queen[2], Cartwright J. commented on these provisions as follows:\nThe evidence that the murder was planned was very strong, but, as was properly pointed out to the jury by the learned trial judge, they could not find the accused guilty of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the murder was planned but also that it was deliberate. The learned trial Judge also rightly instructed the jury that the word \"deliberate\", as used in s. 202A(2)(a), means \"con\u00adsidered, not impulsive\".\nOther meanings of the adjective given in the Oxford Dictionary are \"not hasty in decision\", \"slow in deciding\" and \"intentional\". The word as used in the subsection cannot have simply the meaning \"intentional\" because it is only if the accused's act was intentional that he can be guilty of murder and the subsection is creating an additional ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused being convicted of capital murder.\nIn dissenting from the opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, Davey J.A., would have ordered a new trial on the ground that, in light of the addresses of counsel, the charge of the learned trial judge might have caused the jurors to interpret the word \"delib\u00aderate\" as meaning \"intentional\" and that they might thus have failed to apply the proper test in determining whether the murder was \"planned and deliberate\" within the mean\u00ading of those words as they are used in the above Section. Mr. Justice Davey was also of opinion that the trial judge had erred in his directions to the jury as to the evidence of deliberation.\nCounsel for the appellant adopted this reasoning of Davey J.A. and contended also that the trial judge erred in relating the evidence of the witness Whitney to the day of the crime as that witness had been unable to state the day of the week or month on which the events he described took place. In this Court, however, it was only considered necessary to call upon the respondent's counsel in respect of the 6th and 12th grounds of appeal, and as I am unable to find any errors of substance in the charge of the learned trial judge, I propose to limit myself to a consideration of the issues raised by these grounds which are set out in the notice of appeal as follows:\nThe Court of Appeal failed to hold that the learned trial judge erred in failing to grant defence counsel's motion for an adjournment to enable the defence to obtain and introduce further medical evidence.\n12. The Court of Appeal erred in refusing to grant the appellant's motion to adduce fresh evidence before it.\nThe record of proceedings as contained in the Case on appeal in this Court makes no reference whatever to defence counsel's motion for an adjournment, and the only source of information as to what material the learned trial judge had before him on that motion is contained in an affidavit of David Moffett which was filed at the hearing of this appeal and which appears to have been used in support of the application to adduce fresh evidence which was made to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.\nThis affidavit stated that before the preliminary hearing Mr. Moffett, who represented the appellant in the lower courts, suspected that the accused might be suffering from mental illness and might have been legally insane at the time of committing the offence, and that he asked the presiding magistrate for directions as to the obtaining of a psychiatric report and wrote to the Attorney-General of British Colum\u00adbia requesting an examination of the accused to find out if he were medically fit to stand trial or mentally ill at the time of the commission of the offence. The last two paragraphs of this affidavit read as follows :\nThat in due course I was advised and verily believed that the accused had been examined by Dr. J. W. Thomas and I was not then aware that Dr. Thomas' terms of reference did not include any examination of the accused with a view to ascertaining his sanity or insanity at the time of the commission of the offence.\nThat shortly before the date of Trial I became aware of the contents of Dr. Thomas' medical report and thereupon applied to the learned presiding Judge at the Quennel assizes, the Honourable Mr. Justice Ruttan, for an adjournment to enable a further psychiatric examination to be carried out, which application was refused by the said learned presiding Judge. The question of whether or not an adjournment is to be granted rests in the discretion of the judge who is trying the case, and the Moffett affidavit does not, in my opinion, contain sufficient information as to the circumstances under which this application was made to justify the conclusion that there was any error in principle in refusing the adjournment.\nThis application, like that which had earlier been made to the Attorney-General, appears to have been directed to the issue of insanity which was not pleaded at the trial, not-withstanding the fact that according to the report made to the Court of Appeal by Ruttan J. the psychiatrist, Dr. J. W. Thomas, was in the court throughout the proceedings and was not called by either the Crown or the defence. It is diffi\u00adcult to understand what material defence counsel was able to put before the trial judge on this issue, particularly in light of the fact that medical evidence ultimately obtained for the defence did not bear on the question of insanity at all.\nThe appellant's motion for an order granting leave to call fresh evidence at the hearing of the appeal stands, however, on a very different footing. The proposed evidence was not directed towards proving that the appellant was legally insane at the time of the crime, but rather towards showing that a psychiatric examination after the trial had disclosed that he had long been suffering from a disorder of the mind which manifested itself in impulsive, unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, and that his long history of mental disorder was a relevant circumstance proper to be con\u00adsidered, together with all the other circumstances disclosed in the evidence, in determining whether or not the murder was planned and deliberate on his part.\nIn addition to the affidavit of Mr. Moffett, to which refer\u00adence has been made, this application was supported by the evidence of Dr. Gould and Dr. Tyhurst and by an affidavit of the appellant which disclosed that Dr. Tyhurst first examined him after his conviction and concluded by saying:\nI am advised by my legal advisers and verily believe that had the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst and Dr. Gould been introduced at my trial it might reasonably have induced the jury to change its view regarding my guilt. The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to admit fresh evidence is to be found in s. 589(1) (b) of the Criminal Code which reads, in part, as follows:\n589. (1) For the purposes of an appeal under this Part the court of appeal may, where it considers it in the interest of justice,\n(b) order any witness who would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was called at the trial, (1) to attend and be examined before the court of appeal .. .\nIt is clearly not in the interests of justice that this privilege should be extended to an appellant as a matter of course, and although the rules applicable to introducing fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal in a civil case do not apply with the same force to criminal matters, it is nevertheless recognized that special grounds must be shown in order to justify the Court in exercising the power con\u00adferred upon it by s. 589(1).\nOne of the grounds advanced by Sheppard J.A. for reject\u00ading the proposed evidence in the present case was that it had not been shown that the diligence required by R. v. Martin[3], had been exercised in obtaining it at or before the trial. In R. v. Martin, supra, Bird J.A. who delivered the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia said, in regard to the evidence sought to be intro\u00adduced in that case:\nNo effort was then made to procure McLeod's attendance at the trial, nor was application made for an adjournment on account of his absence.\nIn these circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the defence elected to proceed to trial without that evidence. Indeed, I understood counsel for appellant to concede before us that such was the case.\nThe Court of Criminal Appeal in England refused such an application in what appears to me to be a parallel case, viz., Rex v. Weisz, (1920) 15 Cr. App. R. 85, wherein the Earl of Reading, C.J. said: \"The appellant's legal advisers knew the case they would have to meet, and no application was made to adjourn the trial ... The policy was deliberate of resting the defence upon the evidence of the accused ... and no precedent could be cited for calling a fresh witness in those circumstances\".\nMore recently, Bird J.A. speaking on behalf of the same Court in R. v. Lalcatos[4] appears to have adopted the follow\u00ading interpretation of the requirements stated in Rex v. Martin, supra:\n.. that before fresh evidence will be admitted by this Court, it must be shown: (a) At the time of the trial the accused (appellant) either was not aware of the evidence proposed to be adduced or if he then had knowledge of it that all reasonable diligence had been exercised at or before the trial to adduce that evidence; (b) That the evidence if adduced might reasonably have induced the trial tribunal to change its view of the guilt of the accused.\nIt appears that in the present case, Dr. Tyhurst knew nothing of the matter until after the trial and although it may be said that further efforts could have been made before the trial to find out whether the evidence he would be able to give after examination might be relevant to the issue of planning and deliberation, it must at the same time be remembered that the provisions of s. 202A(2) (a) only became law in July, 1961, that the case of Regina v. More, supra, had not been decided at the time of the preliminary hearing and the trial in October and November of 1962, and that counsel then acting for the appellant apparently did not appreciate the full significance of psychiatric evidence on the issue of planning and deliberation. I am not prepared to say that this indicated lack of reasonable diligence on his part.\nFurthermore, unlike the case of Rex v. Martin, supra and Rex v. Weisz[5], in the present case efforts were made to obtain a psychiatric report from the Attorney-General and a motion for an adjournment was made to the trial judge for the same purpose. It is true that Ruttan J. exercised his discre\u00adtion by refusing the appellant's application, but this does not detract from the fact that an effort was made.\nIn all the circumstances, if the evidence is considered to be of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of the jury, I do not think it should be excluded on the ground that reasonable diligence was not exercised to obtain it at or before the trial.\nHaving heard the evidence which was sought to be intro\u00adduced in the present case, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's application, the majority of the Court (Bird, Davey and Tysoe JJ.A.) resting their judgment on the ground expressed by Davey J.A. in the concluding paragraph of his reasons for judgment in the following terms:\nI would dismiss the motion for leave to introduce evidence of appel\u00adlant's alleged mental disorder, because appellant relates it to no incident proximate in time to the killing that could be said to rebut any inference of deliberation by showing that the killing was the result of sudden passion or emotion aroused in a disordered mind by the incident. As has been indicated, the evidence thus rejected by the Court of Appeal included that of Dr. Tyhurst, the Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Vancouver General Hospital and the Shaughnessy Veterans Hospital, who testi\u00adfied that the appellant had been a patient in the psychiatric division of two hospitals as well as having been admitted to one mental hospital in Alberta, and that his family history was very disordered, his mother having committed suicide and family members having been in mental hospitals. This witness went on to express the following conclusion which he had reached after spending a good deal of time with the appellant:\nIt is my conclusion that he is a very unstable paranoid individual, who has a lifelong history of personal instability, who responds impulsively and against his best interests on slight provocation, and sometimes on none at all, actually, because of his suspiciousness; that he is unpredictable and, I would say, dangerous, actually.\nIn rejecting this evidence because it could not be related to any incident proximate in time to the killing which might have aroused sudden passion or emotion in a disordered mind, the Court of Appeal appears to me to have left out of account the fact that the very evidence which was so rejected was to the effect that the disorder in the mind of the appellant was such that he sometimes acted impulsively, unpredictably and dangerously with no provocation at all.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal also appear to have considered it to be a necessary condition for the admissibility of this evidence that it should be such as to \"rebut any inference of deliberation\" by showing affirmatively that the killing was the result of sudden passion or emotion. This thinking is also reflected in the reasons for judgment of Sheppard J.A. who said:\nThere is no evidence that the accused was in fact provoked, and in any event, there was ample time between 2:00 a.m, and 9:00 a.m. for any pas\u00adsion to have cooled\nAs the result, there is no evidence for the accused that the recurring paranoic condition referred to by Dr. Tyhurst was operating to any extent at the time of the murder, and in any event, assuming the condition had recurred, such condition does not preclude the accused taking life by a murder planned and deliberate. Hence the evidence does not disprove the verdict as found by the jury. Wilson J.A. expressed himself even more forcibly in the same vein saying:\nThe attempt here is, with the flimsiest evidence of provocation, to prove that this man was incapable of planning and deliberation ...\nand later in his reasons:\nFurther, I do not think the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst establishes that this man was incapable of planning and deliberation, however unreasonable the result of such planning and deliberation might appear to the reasonable man. I have no hesitation in rejecting this evidence.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the evi\u00addence tendered by the appellant on such an application as this is not to be judged and rejected on the ground that it \"does not disprove the verdict as found by the jury\" or that it fails to discharge the burden of proving that the appellant was incapable of planning and deliberation, or that it does not rebut inferences which appear to have been drawn by the jury. It is enough, in my view, if the proposed evidence is of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury.\nI would respectfully adopt the following views expressed on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia by Sloan C.J.B.C. in R. v. Buckle[6], where he said :\nIn my opinion the rule to be applied in criminal cases in relation to the introduction of fresh evidence and consequential relief which may be granted by the Court, is wider in its discretionary scope than that applied by the Court in civil appeals. If the newly-discovered evidence is in its nature conclusive, then the Court of Appeal, in both civil and criminal cases, may itself finally deal with the matter ... If, on the other hand, in a criminal case, the new evidence does not exert such a compelling influence, but is however of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury, then, in my opinion, the Court may admit that evidence and direct a new trial, so that such evidence might be added to the scale and weighed by the trial tribunal in the light of all the facts.\nIt is to be noted that the reasons of Sloan C.J.B.C. in R. v. Buckle, supra, were expressly adopted on behalf of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia by Bird J.A. in the recent case of R. v. Lakatos, at page 391.\nThe bearing of psychiatric evidence on the question of whether or not a murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused was considered by this Court in More v. R., supra, where Cartwright J., speaking of the medical evidence there tendered, said at p. 534:\nThe evidence of the two doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether the accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury in deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger, which so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the intentional act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. The question is one of fact and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused at the moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it, in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well cause them to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse rather than by consideration. On this question the accused was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.\nIn deciding whether or not the evidence sought to be introduced in the present case falls within the same cate\u00adgory, it appears to me to be helpful to consider that evidence in light of the charge of the learned trial judge.\nAs has been indicated, the evidence identifying the appel\u00adlant with the killing was entirely circumstantial and in this regard Ruttan J. properly instructed the jury as to the rule in Hodges case[7]. In dealing with the additional question of whether or not the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the appellant, he made the following comment:\nAs a final conclusion from circumstantial evidence the Crown asks you to find that not only did the accused commit this murder, but that the accused did it by planned and deliberate actions. I shall explain to you in a moment the significance of that last submission; briefly I will say that the ingredient of planning and deliberate action makes a difference between a capital murder and a non-capital murder.\nAnd later in the same paragraph he said:\nI should point out to you, I think it was Crown counsel suggested it was a deliberate action because there were no less than six wounds found by the doctor. There were four lacerations on one side in the same wound area and one below and one on the other side of the face. Well, here is an illustration of two conclusions you may draw from the same circumstances, because that might indicate to you that the deed was committed in a frenzy and in a highly emotional state, delivering six blows where one would do, which might suggest to you that it wasn't planned, or deliberate. I just suggest this to you to illustrate the circumstantial evidence that is so significant and important in this case, and that you must consider in draw\u00ading your conclusions.\nAs I understand this part of the charge, the learned trial judge was indicating to the jury that the circumstances were not only consistent with the act having been planned\nand deliberate on the part of the appellant, but were also consistent with the deed having been committed \"in a frenzy and in a highly emotional state ... which might suggest .. . that it was not planned or deliberate\". He was thus not telling the jury that because the circumstances were con\u00adsistent with lack of planning and deliberation they must of necessity acquit the appellant, but rather that the circum\u00adstances were consistent with two alternative interpretations which must be weighed in the balance before a verdict could be reached. There was, in my view, no error in this direction.\nUnder all the circumstances, it appears to me that the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst, like that of the doctors in More v. R., supra might have caused the jury \"to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse rather than by consideration\".\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst should have been admitted by the Court of Appeal in accordance with the practice outlined by Sloan C.J.B.C. in R. v. Buckle. I do not, however, consider that there was any error in rejecting the evidence of Dr. Gould which does not appear to me to bear upon the question here at issue.\nIt is not suggested that the evidence in this case did not amply support the verdict of the jury. There are many cir\u00adcumstances in addition to the way the blows were delivered which are consistent with the murder having been planned and deliberate, but the question raised by this appeal is whether, if the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst had been before them, the jury would inevitably have reached the conclusion which they did.\nIn my opinion, without the evidence of the appellant's mental history and condition, it cannot be said that all the circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was planned and deliberate have been passed upon by a jury, and I would accordingly allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:-I concur in the disposition of this appeal proposed by my brother Ritchie and I agree with his reasons subject to one reservation.\nAfter quoting certain passages from the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury my brother Ritchie says:\nAs I understand this part of the charge, the learned trial judge was indicating to the jury that the circumstances were not only consistent with\nthe act having been planned and deliberate on the part of the appellant, but were also consistent with the deed having been committed \"in a frenzy and in a highly emotional state ... which might suggest ... that it was not planned or deliberate\". He was thus not telling the jury that because the circumstances were consistent with lack of planning and deliberation they 'must of necessity acquit the appellant, but rather that the circumstances were consistent with two alternative interpretations which must be weighed in the balance before a verdict could be reached. There was, in my view, no erorr in this direction.\nFor the reasons given by me in the case of The Queen v. David Mitchell[8], judgment in which is being given at the same time as in this case, I am of opinion that where the evidence relevant to the issue whether or not a murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused is entirely circumstantial it is necessary for the trial judge to charge the jury on that issue in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case[9]. In so far as the passage quoted from the reasons of my brother Ritchie indicates a different view I am unable to agree with it.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Oliver, Millar & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

The Board ordered that she be reinstated in her employment. A motion to quash the order having been dismissed, the employer appealed. The Court of Appeal in allowing the appeal held that because the complainant exercised managerial functions, she was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the protection of s. 65 of the Act and that in her case the Board had no jurisdiction.\nHeld (Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.:\nThe appeal could succeed only if the Act could be construed as giving the Board power, in appropriate circumstances, to compel the continuation of the employment not only of all persons who were \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of that term as defined in the Act but also of all persons exercising managerial functions. Such a construction would be at variance with the purposes which appeared from reading the Act as a whole, and would involve giving a forced meaning to the words which the Legislature had employed. The Board having found that the appellant was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the Act at any time material to the application, it followed that the rights accorded to \u201cany employee\u201d under s. 65(5) were denied to her, so that if this Court were to restore the order of the Board it would be restoring an order which could not be enforced by the appellant in the manner provided by s. 65(5) for the enforcement of such a determination. It was unreasonable to suppose the Legislature to have intended that the benefits conferred by s. 65(4) were to be enjoyed by a class of persons who were plainly excluded from the right to enforce those benefits in accordance with s. 65(5), and when s. 65 was read against the background of the Act as a whole, it was apparent that the provisions of subs. (4) did not clothe the Board with any authority or jurisdiction to reinstate a person such as the appellant, who the Board itself had found had been exercising \u201cmanagerial functions\u201d and who was thus not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of s. 65(5) or any other section of the Act.\nSection 80 of the Act did not prevent the quashing of the decision of the Board. The effect of this section, if it received the construction most favourable to the appellant, was to oust the jurisdiction of the superior Courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which was made in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature; within the ambit of those powers it might err in fact or in law; but the section did not mean that if the Board purported to make an order which, on the true construction of the Act, it had no jurisdiction to make the person affected thereby was left without a remedy. The extent of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction was fixed by the statute which created it and could not be enlarged by a mistaken view entertained by the Board as to the meaning of that statute.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: There was error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in its restriction of the rights conferred under the Act to those who were employees within the meaning of the Act. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in ss. 50 and 65 included one who exercised managerial functions. The appellant was a person within the meaning of s. 50(a) and was entitled to its protection. Likewise, the appellant was a person whom the Board could order to be reinstated in employment pursuant to the provisions of s. 65(4).\nAs to the matter of certiorari, the Board\u2019s right to entertain the application was unquestionable. It related to the subject-matter which was given to the Board for decision, and its decision was reasonably capable of reference to the power given to it. Section 80 prevented a decision of this kind from being quashed on certiorari because the reviewing tribunal may choose to call what it finds to be error a jurisdictional defect. If there was error (and there was a conflict of opinion here) it was in the exercise of the function exclusively assigned to the Board by the legislation, and within that area, even if mistakes were made, s. 80 prevented judicial review.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The appellant had a right to obtain a decision of the Board. The word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 50 and s. 65(4) should not be limited to mean only \u201cemployees\u201d as described in s. 1(3)(b). Those who were entitled to complain and obtain a hearing by the Board under s. 65(4) were of a broader class than those who could enforce the resultant determination by court order under s. 65(5). Other means of enforcement were available, such as commencement of action in the ordinary fashion. However, as to the right of a Court to consider the application for certiorari, the Board was nowhere given exclusive jurisdiction to determine for itself the meaning to be attributed to s. 50 or to s. 65 and, of course, the Board could not by an erroneous interpretation of any section or sections of the Act confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it otherwise would not have. Certiorari still lay, despite s. 80, if the inferior tribunal gave itself jurisdiction by a wrong decision in law.\nAlso, the factum filed on behalf of the Board made no reference to the propriety of the respondents proceeding by way of certiorari and counsel for the Board in his argument made no submission in reference to certiorari. Moreover, the factum of the appellant did not refer at all to the provisions of s. 80 and although counsel for the appellant who submitted argument on the issue of the right to certiorari did cite the section he based his whole argument upon the proposition that certiorari only lay if there was error on the face of the record\u2014not that certiorari proceedings, even if there were utter lack of jurisdiction in the inferior tribunal, were excluded. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for this Court to take such a position in this case.\n[In re Ontario Labour Relations Bd., Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87 v.

Appeal dismissed, Abbott, Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and John Sopinka, for the appellant.\nD.K. Laidlaw, for the respondent, Associated Medical Services, Incorporated.\nH.L. Morphy, for the respondents, Ontario Labour Relations Board and A.M. Brunskill.\nTaschereau C.J. and Martland and Hall JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and statutory provisions and the course of this litigation in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brothers Judson and Spence. All parties argued the appeal on the assumption that the findings of fact made by the Board must be accepted.\nThe appellant was discharged on February 2, 1961, on the ground that she was engaging in union activities on company premises during working hours. The Board found that her dismissal was unjustified and ordered that she be reinstated forthwith in employment with the respondent. The Board made the following finding as to the appellant\u2019s status:\nThere can be no question but that on and after February 28, 1960, Mrs. Jarvis exercised functions which viewed in their entirety were functions which the Board has uniformly characterized as managerial in nature. If the issue as to the status of Mrs. Jarvis had arisen in these proceedings for the first time, I would have no hesitation whatever in finding that in my opinion at the material times in so far as the present proceeding is concerned, Mrs. Jarvis was exercising managerial functions and that she was therefore a person deemed not to be an employee under the terms of sec. 1(3)(b) of the Act.\nThe question calling for determination is whether, under The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d, the Board had jurisdiction to order the reinstatement of the appellant who at the time of her discharge had for almost a year ceased, for the purposes of the Act, to be an employee of the respondent.\nIt appears to me that the appeal can succeed only if we are able to construe the Act as giving the Board power, in appropriate circumstances, to compel the continuation of the employment not only of all persons who are \u201cemployees\u201d within the meaning of that term as defined in the Act but also of all persons exercising managerial functions.\nIn my opinion such a construction would be at variance with the purposes which appear from reading the Act as a whole, and would involve giving a forced meaning to the words which the Legislature has employed.\nI find myself so fully in accord with the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal[2], delivered by Aylesworth J.A., that I wish simply to adopt those reasons in their entirety. In particular, I find unanswerable the reasoning in the following passage where, after quoting the wording of ss. 50 and 65 of the Act, the learned Justice of Appeal continued:\nUpon the facts as found by the board, the complainant \u201cfor the purposes of this Act\u201d was not an employee; hence if complainant comes within the purview of sec. 50 she must be included in the term \u201cperson\u201d as used therein. I do not think the term can be given so broad a meaning.\nIn clause (a) the pertinent prohibition is against refusal to employ or to continue to employ a \u201cperson\u201d \u201cbecause the person was or is a member of a trade union or was or is exercising any other rights under this Act.\u201d In clause (b) the prohibition is against imposing or seeking to impose certain conditions of employment against \u201can employee or a person seeking employment\u201d and in clause (c) the prohibition is against compelling an \u201cemployee\u201d to do or refrain from doing certain things. To employ or to continue to employ a person is for the purposes of the Act, to cause a person to become an employee or to continue a person as an employee. The section refers to two classes of individuals\u2014a person who seeks employment i.e., who seeks to become an employee and a person who already is an employee. This meaning of the word is quite in keeping with the general object and purpose of the Act; on the other hand it is neither logical or necessary to construe \u201cperson\u201d as it appears in this section as applying to anyone other than an individual seeking to become an employee or who already is an employee and we are told in plain terms by sec. 1(3)(b) of the Act that someone working in a managerial capacity is not, for the purposes of the Act to be considered an employee.\nThe same reasoning applies to the provisions of sec. 65; in clauses (1) and (4) thereof \u201cperson\u201d is used in exactly the same connotation as in sec. 50; clause (1) envisions a complaint that a person has been refused employment, i.e. has been thwarted in an attempt to become an employee or has been discharged, i.e. denied continuation in the role of employee. Clause (4) contemplates that the board, where a complaint has not been settled \u201cmay inquire into the complaint\u201d and if it is satisfied \u201cthat the person has been refused employment\u201d (or)... \u201cdischarged...it shall determine the action... to be taken by the employer...with respect to the employment of such person which...may...include reinstatement in employment.\u201d Again the section is dealing with the same two classes of individuals\u2014the person who is seeking to become an employee and the person who is an employee. In both instances it is \u201cemployment\u201d which is spoken of and it is the refusal or termination of employment i.e. the withholding or termination for certain reasons of the role of \u201cemployee\u201d which is the subject-matter of the board\u2019s inquiry. Since for the purposes of the Act, the complainant is not deemed to be an employee, it is difficult to appreciate how it can be held that under sec. 65 her duties in a managerial capacity are to be included in the term \u201cemployment\u201d. As in sec. 50, so in sec. 65 it is illogical and unrealistic that \u201cemployment\u201d should be given any wider or other meaning than referring to work as an \u201cemployee\u201d or that \u201cperson\u201d should be construed as including anyone other than one seeking to become an employee; if any wider meaning is given either to person or to employment the language used is given a laboured and unnecessary meaning and one which does not further the general object and purposes of the legislation. Once the board determined, as it had the right to determine, that the complainant was a person deemed not to be an employee for the purposes of the Act it had ipso facto, demonstrated its lack of jurisdiction to proceed further with the complaint. The remedy, if any, of the complainant lies in another forum. My entire agreement with the reasons of Aylesworth J.A. includes, of course, the adoption of his statement:\n...it is trite to observe that the Board cannot by an erroneous interpretation of any section or sections of the Act confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it otherwise would not have.\nHowever, in view of what is said by my brother Judson as to s. 80 of the Act, I wish to add a few words as to why, in my opinion, that section does not prevent the quashing of the decision of the Board in this case.\nThe effect of this section, if it receives the construction most favourable to the appellant, is to oust the jurisdiction of the superior Courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which is made in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature; within the ambit of those powers it may err in fact or in law; but I cannot take the section to mean that if the Board purports to make an order which, on the true construction of the Act, it has no jurisdiction to make the person affected thereby is left without a remedy; indeed, in L\u2019Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. Labour Relations Board[3], Rinfret C.J. explicitly rejected such a suggestion. The extent of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is fixed by the statute which creates it and cannot be enlarged by a mistaken view entertained by the Board as to the meaning of that statute. The governing principle was succinctly stated by my brother Fauteux in In re Ontario Labour Relations Board, Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87 v. Globe Printing Co.[4] at p. 41:\nThe authorities are clear that jurisdiction cannot be obtained nor can it be declined as a result of a misinterpretation of the law, and that in both cases the controlling power of superior Courts obtains, notwithstanding the existence in the Act of a no certiorari clause.\nThis was the rule applied by the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. What is complained of by the respondent is not that the Board has been induced by errors of fact or law, or by both, to make an order in the exercise of its statutory jurisdiction, but rather that it has purported to make an order which the Act has not empowered it to make at all.\nSince writing the above I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Ritchie and I agree with them. I would dismiss the appeal but would make no order as to costs.\nTaschereau C.J. and Martland and Hall JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal have been fully set out by other members of the Court and it would be superfluous for me to reiterate them.\nI agree with the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright and would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by him, but as there are other reasons which lead me to the same conclusion, I am prompted to make brief reference to them.\nThe appellant\u2019s argument rests upon the proposition that although, by reason of the provisions of s. 1 (3)(b), a \u201cperson\u201d who \u201cin the opinion of the Board exercises managerial functions\u201d is not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, such person is nevertheless to be included in the category of individuals with respect to whose employment by the employer the Board is authorized to make a determination under s. 65(4) of the said Act.\nIt was pointed out by counsel for the appellant that \u201cthe Court must have regard to the statute as a whole\u201d and he contended that when this was done it became apparent that in the sections of the Act dealing with collective bargaining, the legal subjects and objects are employers, employees, employers\u2019 organizations and trade unions, whereas in the sections dealing with freedom to join and participate in the activities of trade unions and with unfair practices, the legal subjects and objects are employers, employees, trade unions, employers\u2019 organizations and \u201cpersons\u201d.\nDealing specifically with s. 65, the appellant\u2019s counsel submitted that \u201cif the legislature intended the benefits of s. 65 of the Act to be restricted to employees it would have used the term \u2018employee\u2019 and not \u2018person\u2019.\u201d\nIt is upon this foundation that the appellant seeks to obtain an order setting aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring the determination of the Ontario Labour Relations Board dated April 27, 1961. It occurs to me that this argument loses much of its force when s. 65 itself is read as a whole and consideration is given to the provisions for enforcement of the Board\u2019s determination which are contained in subs. 5 thereof. Section 65 (4) and (5) read as follows:\n(4) Where the field officer is unable to effect a settlement of the matter complained of, the Board may inquire into the complaint and, if it is satisfied that the person has been refused employment, discharged, discriminated against, threatened, coerced, intimidated or otherwise dealt with contrary to this Act, it shall determine the action, if any, to be taken by the employer and the trade union or either of them with respect to the employment of such person, which, in its discretion, may, notwithstanding the provisions of a collective agreement, include reinstatement in employment with or without compensation by the employer and the trade union or either of them for loss of earnings and other employment benefits and the employer and the trade union shall do or abstain from doing anything required of them by the determination.\n(5) Where the employer or the trade union has failed to comply with any of the terms of the determination, any employer, trade union or employee affected by the determination may, after the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the release of the determination or the date provided in the determination for compliance, whichever is later, notify the Board of such failure, and thereupon the Board shall file in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court a copy of the determination, exclusive of the reasons therefor, in the prescribed form, whereupon the determination shall be entered in the same way as a judgment or order of that court and is enforceable as such.\nThe only mention of this latter subsection in the tribunals below is to be found in the opinion of the chairman of the Ontario Labour Relations Board who had occasion to say:\nIt may be that the complainant, having regard to my finding as to her status, may encounter difficulty in enforcing any determination that the Board might make concerning her employment if she should seek enforcement under subsection 5 of section 65. However, we are not called upon at this stage to deal with that problem. It may not be amiss to point out here that, prior to the coming into force of the 1960 amendments to The Labour Relations Act, the relief afforded to a complainant under the counterpart of section 65 of the Act was not enforceable as a judgment or order of the Supreme Court.\nThe effect of the chairman\u2019s \u201cfinding as to her status\u201d (with which the majority of the Board agreed) is that the appellant exercised managerial functions at all times material to this complaint and that she was therefore expressly excluded from the status of an \u201cemployee\u201d as that word is used in The Labour Relations Act.\nThese proceedings were initiated by a personal letter signed by Barbara Jarvis and addressed to the Ontario Labour Relations Board which bore the following heading:\nREQUEST FOR REINSTATEMENT UNDER SECTION 65 OF THE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT FOR UNFAIR DISCHARGE FOR ALLEGED UNION ACTIVITY... As I have indicated, I agree with the view that the \u201creinstatement in employment\u201d which the Board, in its discretion is entitled to include in \u201cthe determination\u201d made by it under the authority of s. 65(4) is a \u201creinstatement in employment\u201d as an \u201cemployee\u201d. An \u201cemployee\u201d who has been \u201cdismissed by his employer contrary to the provisions of the Act or to any collective agreement\u201d is not deemed to have ceased to be an \u201cemployee\u201d by reason only of his ceasing to work for his employer on account of such dismissal (see s. 1(2)) and such \u201cemployee\u201d is therefore entitled to apply for reinstatement under s. 65(4) and to proceed to the enforcement of the Board\u2019s determination in accordance with s. 65(5), but the same considerations do not, in my opinion, apply to one who was not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the Act at the time of her dismissal.\nThe Board having found that the appellant was not such an \u201cemployee\u201d at any time material to this application it follows, in my view, that the rights accorded to \u201cany employee\u201d under s. 65(5) are denied to her, so that if this Court were to comply with the request made by counsel for the appellant and were to restore the order of the Ontario Labour Relations Board dated April 27, 1961, it would be restoring an order which could not be enforced by the appellant in the manner provided by s. 65(5) for the enforcement of such a determination.\nIt appears to me to be unreasonable to suppose the Legislature to have intended that the benefits conferred by subs. (4) of s. 65 were to be enjoyed by a class of persons who are plainly excluded from the right to enforce those benefits in accordance with subs. (5) of the same section, and when s. 65 is read against the background of The Labour Relations Act as a whole, I am satisfied, for the reasons stated by Cartwright J. and by Aylesworth J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal, that the provisions of s. 65(4) do not clothe the Labour Relations Board with any authority or jurisdiction to reinstate a person such as Mrs. Jarvis, who the Board itself has found to have been exercising \u201cmanagerial functions\u201d and who was thus not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of s. 65(5) or any other section of the Act.\nAs I have indicated, I would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Cartwright. FAUTEUX J.: For the reasons given by my brothers Cartwright and Ritchie, I would dismiss the appeal but make no order as to costs.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting): I have had an opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Judson, with which I am in respectful agreement. I desire to add only a brief comment with respect to s. 80 of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202.\nThe primary purpose of The Labour Relations Act is to promote harmonious industrial relations within the province. A board such as the Labour Relations Board, experienced in the field of labour management relations, representing both organized employers, organized labour, and the public, and presided over by a legally trained chairman, ought to be at least as competent and as well suited to determine questions arising in the course of the administration of the Act as a Superior Court judge.\nIn enacting s. 80, the Legislature has recognized that fact and has indicated in the clearest possible language that the workings of the Board are not to be unnecessarily impeded by legal technicalities. The duty of the Courts is to apply that section, not to attempt to circumvent it.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Judson.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The judgment under appeal quashes a decision of the Ontario Labour Relations Board, which ordered the respondent, Associated Medical Services, Incorporated, to reinstate the appellant, Barbara Jarvis, in her employment. She had made a complaint to the Board that she had been discharged because she was a member of a labour union. The Board acted under s. 65 of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, in ordering her reinstatement. The judgment of the Court of Appeal holds that because Mrs. Jarvis exercised managerial functions, she was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the protection of s. 65 of the Act and that in her case the Board had no jurisdiction. With respect, I think that there was error in this conclusion.\nMrs. Jarvis was a member of the Office Employees International Union, Local 131. In December 1959, this union filed an application for certification as the bargaining agent of the employees of the respondent. At this time Mrs. Jarvis was employed as a clerk. In February 1960, she was promoted to the position of railway claims supervisor. In October 1960, the Labour Relations Board certified the union. At this time Mrs. Jarvis, according to the subsequent opinion of the Board, was exercising managerial functions. She was discharged from her employment in February 1961 and applied promptly for reinstatement under s. 65 of the Act. The Board ordered her reinstatement in June 1961.\nThe Board found that she had been dismissed for union activity, that she was a member of the union, Local 131, to the knowledge of the managing director of the respondent, that the union activity for which she was dismissed did not conflict with her duty to her employer, and that although her duties were managerial in nature and she was therefore a person deemed not to be an employee as defined by s. 1(3)(b) of the Act, nevertheless, she was a person entitled to the rights given under s. 65 of the Act.\nThis is the decision that was quashed by the Court of Appeal on what was, in my respectful opinion, an unduly narrow and erroneous construction of the statute.\nSection 1(3)(b) reads:\n1. (3) For the purposes of this Act, no person shall be deemed to be an employee,\n(b) who, in the opinion of the Board, exercises managerial functions or is employed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to labour relations.\nThe result of this section is that in the sections of the Act which deal with bargaining rights and collective bargaining (the legal subjects and objects being employers, employees, employers\u2019 organizations and trade unions), a person exercising managerial functions cannot be included within the bargaining unit. On the other hand, in the sections of the Act which deal with freedom to join and participate in the activities of trade unions and with unfair practices, the legal subjects and objects are employers, employees, trade unions, employers\u2019 organizations and persons. For example, s. 3 of the Act provides that every person is free to join a trade union of his own choice and to participate in its lawful activities. This right is not limited to employees as defined by the Act, that is, to the exclusion of a person exercising managerial functions. Thus, a person who is not an employee as defined by the Act because of these managerial functions, is still a person and is amenable to the obligations of the Act and entitled to its protection. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in ss. 50 and 65 includes one who exercises managerial functions. Section 50(a) reads:\n50. No employer, employers\u2019 organization or person acting on behalf of an employer or an employers\u2019 organization,\n(a) shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person, or discriminate against a person in regard to employment or any term or condition of employment because the person was or is a member of a trade union or was or is exercising any other rights under this Act.\nMrs. Jarvis is a person within the meaning of that section and is entitled to its protection. Likewise, Mrs. Jarvis. is a person whom the Board can order to be reinstated in employment pursuant to the provisions of s. 65(4), which reads:\n65. (4) Where the field officer is unable to effect a settlement of the matter complained of, the Board may inquire into the complaint and, if it is satisfied that the person has been refused employment, discharged, discriminated against, threatened, coerced, intimidated or otherwise dealt with contrary to this Act, it shall determine the action, if any, to be taken by the employer and the trade union or either of them with respect to the employment of such person, which, in its discretion, may, notwithstanding the provisions of a collective agreement, include reinstatement in employment with or without compensation by the employer and the trade union or either of them for loss of earnings and other employment benefits, and the employer and the trade union shall do or abstain from doing anything required of them by the determination.\nThe error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal is in its restriction of the rights conferred under this Act to those who are employees within the meaning of the Act. There is sound reason for the exclusion of employees exercising managerial functions from the bargaining unit but there is no such reason for the exclusion of these persons from the protection of the Act if they are members of a trade union and are discriminated against for union activity. There are many cases where a person exercising minor managerial functions retains union membership either by choice or compulsion.\nTherefore, solely as a matter of statutory construction, I would hold that there was error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal and affirm the judgment of Parker J., who heard the original motion to quash and whose reasons for judgment are summarized in the following extract:\nA perusal of the Act indicates that in the sections dealing with bargaining rights the term used is employees, but in the sections dealing with freedom to join and participate in the activities of trade unions the term used is persons. Section 65 refers to persons and, in my opinion, gives the Board power to consider an application such as this. The findings of fact made by the Board in this case were properly within its jurisdiction.\nSo far I have dealt with the matter as one of construction. Now that it appears that this order of the Board is going to be quashed on the ground of excess of jurisdiction, I wish to say something about the privative clause in the Act. The Board was authorized to embark upon an inquiry whether this person was discharged contrary to the provisions of the Act. This was the issue to be decided and the Board\u2019s decision, to the extent that it is based on evidence, cannot be questioned on certiorari. It is now said that this decision cannot apply to Mrs. Jarvis because of the question of interpretation which I have discussed above. The Board put one interpretation on the word \u201cperson\u201d to include Mrs. Jarvis and the Court of Appeal another. Which one is right does not matter. If the Board made a mistake, it is not deprived of jurisdiction. It makes a mistake, as many tribunals do, in the course of doing what it is told to do. This kind of mistake is not reviewable on certiorari.\nIn enacting s. 80 of The Labour Relations Act the Legislature has recognized that decisions made by the Board may involve what are looked upon by a Court as jurisdictional errors. The Legislature has said that it prefers to have these errors stand rather than have the decisions quashed on certiorari.\nThe quashing of this decision amounts to a disregard of the provisions of s. 80 of the Act, which reads:\n80. No decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court, and no order shall be made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain the Board or any of its proceedings.\nIt seems to me that the Court of Appeal in this case ignored its own decision in Re Ontario Labour Relations Board, Bradley et al. v. Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd.[5], and the decisions of this Court in Labour Relations Board et al. v. Traders\u2019 Service Ltd.[6]; Farrell, et al. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board[7], and Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. v. O\u2019Krane[8]. What is taken to be an error in law becomes a jurisdictional defect and so within the scope of judicial review. In all these cases at least one Court had found error in law and founded a jurisdictional defect on that finding. It does not matter what the error in law was. It was called jurisdiction. In Bradley and Traders\u2019 Service, it was the composition of the bargaining unit. In Farrell, it was whether there was an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. In Alcyon, it was whether the case was one where the right to bring an action was taken away by the statute. These cases have this common feature, that in the first instance the Court found error in law and founded a jurisdictional defect on that conclusion. But if the Legislature takes away the remedy of certiorari, it must be dealing with this so-called jurisdictional error, for the correction of jurisdictional error is the only purpose of certiorari.\nThe Board is being told by the decision under appeal that it should have split its inquiry into two parts and that having found that Mrs. Jarvis was employed in a managerial capacity, it should have stopped at that point. But the Board had also found that Mrs. Jarvis was a person who was dismissed for union activity. I do not think that a decision ordering reinstatement does involve an excess of jurisdiction. The right to entertain the application is unquestionable. It relates to the subject-matter which is given to the Board for decision, and its decision is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to it. Section 80 prevents a decision of this kind from being quashed on certiorari because the reviewing tribunal may choose to call what it finds to be error a jurisdictional defect. If there is error (and there is a conflict of opinion here) it is within the exercise of the function exclusively assigned to the Board by the legislation, and within that area, even if mistakes are made, s. 80 prevents judicial review.\nIn stating the matter in this way I am doing no more than repeating what has often been said before and most recently by McRuer C.J.H.C., in Regina v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex p. Taylor[9]. I do, however, wish to refer to and to adopt the statement of Dixon J. in The King v. Hickman, Ex p. Fox and Clinton[10], as summarizing the attitude of the High Court of Australia to this problem. The particular regulation is expressed in a manner that has grown familiar. Both under Commonwealth law, and in jurisdictions where there is a unitary constitution, the interpretation of provisions of the general nature of reg. 17 is well established. They are not interpreted as meaning to set at large the courts or other judicial bodies to whose decision they relate. Such a clause is interpreted as meaning that no decision which is in fact given by the body concerned shall be invalidated on the ground that it has not conformed to the requirements governing its proceedings or the exercise of its authority or has not confined its acts within the limits laid down by the instrument giving it authority, provided always that its decision is a bona fide attempt to exercise its power, that it relates to the subject matter of the legislation, and that it is reasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body.\nI do not think that the decisions of this Court in In re Labour Relations Board; Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87 v. Globe Printing Co.[11] and L\u2019Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. Labour Relations Board[12] touch the present case. In the Globe case the union filed a number of membership cards. Counsel for the employer was not permitted by the Board to see these cards or to cross-examine on whether persons who were said to be members had, in fact, resigned. Nevertheless, the Board certified the union and based its decision on the cards. This Court held that there was a refusal of admissible evidence and that this refusal was of such a serious nature that the Board had not undertaken any task that the Act assigned to it. Its duty was to hold a hearing to determine whether the applicant represented the necessary percentage of employees and not merely to count cards. It never conducted such a hearing and its decision was a nullity. I have deliberately avoided the use of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d but what the Board did may actually be called a refusal of jurisdiction because it never attempted to do what it was told to do.\nL\u2019Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. Labour Relations Board held that decertification without notice was bad as being a violation of natural justice even though s. 41 of the Act did not then require it. There was no clear expression of any legislative intention that the Board could act without the necessity of hearing the person affected. This case belongs to a long line of cases which hold that a violation of natural justice is a ground for quashing an administrative decision. Ridge v. Baldwin et al.[13] is perhaps the most recent example. I would allow the appeal with costs throughout against the respondent, Associated Medical Services, Incorporated. There should be no order for costs against the Ontario Labour Relations Board.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting): This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[14] which allowed an appeal from Parker J. and quashed a decision of the Ontario Labour Relations Board. That Board had considered the complaint of the appellant made as to a breach by the respondents of the provisions of s. 50 of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, and exercising jurisdiction which it believed it had under the provisions of s. 65 of that statute, had directed her re-employment by the respondent.\nMrs. Jarvis was a member of the Office Employees International Union, Local 131. In December 1959, this union filed an application for certification as the bargaining agent of the employees of the respondent. At this time Mrs. Jarvis was employed as a clerk. In February 1960, she was promoted to the position of railway claims supervisor. In October 1960, the Labour Relations Board certified the union. At this time Mrs. Jarvis, according to the subsequent opinion of the Board, was exercising managerial functions. She was discharged from her employment in February 1961 and applied promptly for reinstatement under s. 65 of the Act. The Board ordered her reinstatement in June 1961.\nThe Board found that she had been dismissed for union activity, that she was a member of the union, Local 131, to the knowledge of the managing director of the respondent, that the union activity for which she was dismissed did not conflict with her duty to her employer, and that although her duties were managerial in nature and she was therefore a person deemed not to be an employee as defined by s. 1(3)(b) of the Act, nevertheless, she was a person entitled to the rights given under s. 65 of the Act.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario quashed the decision of the Labour Relations Board being of the view that the appellant because she exercised managerial functions, as found by the Board, did not have available to her the provisions of ss. 50 and 65 of The Labour Relations Act. These sections are as follows:\n50. No employer, employers\u2019 organization or person acting on behalf of an employer or an employers\u2019 organization,\n(a) shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person, or discriminate against a person in regard to employment or any term or condition of employment because the person was or is a member of a trade union or was or is exercising any other rights under this Act;\n(b) shall impose any condition in a contract of employment or propose the imposition of any condition in a contract of employment that seeks to restrain an employee or a person seeking employment from becoming a member of a trade union or exercising any other rights under this Act; or\n(c) shall seek by threat of dismissal, or by any other kind of threat, or by the imposition of a pecuniary or other penalty, or by any other means to compel an employee to become or refrain from becoming or to continue to be or to cease to be a member or officer or representative of a trade union or to exercise any other rights under this Act.\n* * *\n65. (1) The Board may authorize a field officer to inquire into a complaint that a person has been refused employment, discharged, discriminated against, threatened, coerced, intimidated or otherwise dealt with contrary to this Act.\n(2) The field officer shall forthwith inquire into the complaint and endeavour to effect a settlement of the matter complained of.\n(3) The field officer shall report the results of his inquiry and endeavours to the Board.\n(4) Where the field officer is unable to effect a settlement of the matter complained of, the Board may inquire into the complaint and, if it is satisfied that the person has been refused employment, discharged, discriminated against, threatened, coerced, intimidated or otherwise dealt with contrary to this Act, it shall determine the action, if any, to be taken by the employer and the trade union or either of them with respect to the employment of such person, which, in its discretion, may, notwithstanding the provisions of a collective agreement, include reinstatement in employment with or without compensation by the employer and the trade union or either of them for loss of earnings and other employment benefits and the employer and the trade union shall do or abstain from doing anything required of them by the determination.\n(5) Where the employer or the trade union has failed to comply with any of the terms of the determination, any employer, trade union or employee affected by the determination may, after the expiration of fourteen days from the date of the release of the determination or the date provided in the determination for compliance, whichever is later, notify the Board of such failure, and thereupon the Board shall file in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court a copy of the determination, exclusive of the reasons therefor, in the prescribed form, whereupon the determination shall be entered in the same way as a judgment or order of that court and is enforceable as such. It is to be noted that in s. 50(a) the employer is prohibited from refusing to employ or continue to employ or discriminate against any person. And in s. 65(4) the Board is empowered to direct that the employer shall rehire the person. Section 1(3), para. (b) of The Labour Relations Act provides:\n(3) For the purposes of this Act, no person shall be deemed to be an employee,\n(b) who, in the opinion of the Board, exercises managerial functions or is employed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to labour relations.\nIt is the submission of the respondent, however, and such a view was adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that it was the intent of the Legislature to grant the protection of s. 50 only to those who were \u201cemployees\u201d or perhaps also to those who sought to be employees and those who had been employees prior to discharge. Therefore, it was submitted, when, by virtue of the provisions of s. 1 particularly subs. (3), para, (b), the appellant, having assumed managerial functions, ceased to be such an \u201cemployee\u201d she no longer had available to her the protection of s. 50.\nThis construction of the statute entails the limitation of the word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 50, and also s. 65, to a compass much narrower than the ordinary meaning of the word.\nThe Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines \u201cperson\u201d, inter alia, as \u201can individual human being; a man, woman, or child\u201d and certainly that is the ordinary use of this most common English word.\nCraies on Statute Law, 6th ed., p. 162, puts the cardinal rule on interpretation of words in a statute in this fashion \u201cThe first rule is that general statutes will, prima facie, be presumed to use words in their popular sense\u201d, quoting Lord Esher M.R., in Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Society v. Carter[15] at p. 448. Such a view was approved in Ontario in Composers, Authors and Publishers Association of Canada, Ltd. v. Associated Broadcasting Co. Ltd. et al.[16] at p. 111.\nThe word \u201cperson\u201d is used in a very large number of sections in The Labour Relations Act, many of which I shall deal with hereafter. In Re National Savings Bank Association[17], Turner L.J. said at pp. 549\u201150:\nI do not consider that it would be at all consistent with the law or with the course of this court to put a different construction upon the same word in different parts of an Act of Parliament without finding some very clear reason for doing so...\nIt is true that the learned Justice on Appeal was there dealing with a technical word \u201ccontributory\u201d while here the respondent seeks to put a restricted meaning on a very ordinary word \u201cperson\u201d but I am of the opinion the same principle applies. It would appear therefore we must turn to The Labour Relations Act to determine whether the word \u201cperson\u201d, in these two sections, may bear a meaning restricted to those who may be of a sort described as \u201cemployees\u201d, former \u201cemployees\u201d or prospective \u201cemployees\u201d as that word is itself limited by s. 1(3)(b).\nSection 3 provides:\n3. Every person is free to join an employers\u2019 organization of his own choice and to participate in its lawful activities.\nAnd counsel for the appellant submits that \u201cperson\u201d in this section must mean \u201canyone\u201d. This section illustrates the principle that any word in a statute must be interpreted in accordance with the context: Colquhoun v. Brooks[18]. Although in s. 3 the word \u201cperson\u201d could not be considered to be limited to \u201cemployees\u201d, former \u201cemployees\u201d or prospective \u201cemployees\u201d, neither could it, in the light of s. 10 and s. 48 include an \u201cemployer\u201d or any \u201cperson acting on behalf of an employer or employers\u2019 organization\u201d. Section 3 is therefore an illustration of the use of the word \u201cperson\u201d in a sense limited to exclude some of those who might fall within the word \u201canyone\u201d.\nSimilarly, the word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 4 must be interpreted in the light of s. 49 to exclude a trade union or a \u201cperson acting on behalf of a trade union\u201d.\nIn s. 6(2), the word \u201cperson\u201d may well be taken to mean \u201canyone\u201d who falls within the descriptive words which follow the use of that word.\nIn s. 9 again, exactly the same interpretation must be given to \u201cperson\u201d. In s. 16(a), it is provided that the Minister may call upon each party to recommend a \u201cperson\u201d to be a member of the conciliation board. I find it significant that in the sections prior to this dealing with certification of a bargaining agent and negotiation of a collective agreement, the word \u201cperson\u201d had been used only with a descriptive addendum while in s. 16 the general word appears because, I believe, it was the intent of the section to permit the union to recommend someone who was not a member or an \u201cemployee\u201d and to permit the employer to recommend someone not one of its officials. Indeed, it is the course which must be adopted\u2014see s. 17\u2014in itself an example of where the words \u201cno person\u201d would only mean \u201cno one\u201d.\nThe word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 19 bears the same limitation as in s, 16.\nIn s. 21, the word \u201cperson\u201d is used in the general sense, i.e., anyone authorized to administer oats. And again, in s. 28(d) and (e), and s. 34(9)(d) and (e) the word \u201cperson\u201d could only mean \u201canyone\u201d.\nIn s. 38, the word \u201cperson\u201d again must mean \u201canyone\u201d and the limiting description following it \u201cwho was a member of the employees\u2019 organization...\u201d illustrates that the word is used generally and indeed with the exact opposite meaning to that attributed to it by the respondent in considering ss. 50 and 65.\nSection 47 would seem to use the word \u201cperson\u201d to contrast with \u201ctrade union\u201d so as to include within the meaning of the word both an employer and an \u201cemployee\u201d but it is difficult to understand how the word could be used with a more general application than that.\nSections 48 and 49 both employ the word \u201cperson\u201d followed by a limiting phrase and it would appear that the word so used in that section is of general meaning subject only to the limiting phrase which follows.\nThis partial survey of the various sections of the statute has demonstrated that the word \u201cperson\u201d is used sometimes in the widest general sense, sometimes in a sense limited by a phrase which follows and sometimes limited by the provisions of other sections of the statute.\nWhen we turn to s. 50, we see that the word \u201cperson\u201d appears in the first line and I believe all would agree that there the word means \u201canyone\u201d subject to the limiting phrase which follows, i.e. \u201cacting on behalf of an employer or employees\u2019 organization\u201d. It is the respondent\u2019s submission that the word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 50(a) is limited to \u201cemployee\u201d not because of any limiting phrase which follows nor because of the limiting effect of any provisions but because of the policy of the statute in dealing with two classes, i.e. employers and \u201cemployees\u201d, the members of those two classes being separated by the provisions of s. 1(3)(b). I am unable to agree that such a policy must be taken from the statute. I agree with counsel for the appellant that when dealing with collective bargaining and particularly the composition of the bargaining unit the legislator has been accurate in his use of the word \u201cemployee\u201d while elsewhere he has used the word \u201cperson\u201d either generally or limited in one of the two fashions I have described.\nIn s. 50(a) it would seem that no limitation of the general meaning of the word need be implied. It may be contrasted with such provisions as s. 37 which make the collective bargaining agreement bind only those named with exactness. Section 50, on the other hand, may well be designed to protect a broader group than \u201cemployees\u201d. In the present case, we are concerned with one who has ceased to be an \u201cemployee\u201d because of the provisions of s. 1(3)(b). We might as easily be concerned with one excluded from that class by the provisions of s. 1(3)(a). Many large corporations employ professional engineers in considerable numbers. These men may well be, almost invariably are members of a professional association. Were such an organization capable of being a \u201ctrade union\u201d as defined in s. 1(1)(j) then an engineer might well be discharged by an employer who disliked the activities of such an organization. There seems to be no reason why such engineer should not have the protection of s. 50.\nIt must be remembered that many servants of large corporations in the ordinary course of promotions attain positions which result in their exclusion from the class of \u201cemployees\u201d under the provisions of s. 1(3)(b). It is quite proper that these servants, foremen, supervisors and the like should be excluded from the advantage of membership in the bargaining unit. It is much more difficult to understand why they should not be protected from unfair labour practices. Counsel for the respondent points out that the appellant acting in her capacity as railway claims supervisor might have \u201chired or fired\u201d others and have involved the respondent in a proceeding under s. 50 by such action. Counsel argues that the appellant cannot be entitled to the protection of s. 50 when by her action she might involve her employer in a complaint under that very section. Again I am unable to understand how such a position is fatal to the appellant. There appears to be no sound reason why one should be deprived of the protection against unfair labour practices simply because, acting for her employer, she might on other occasions engage in those same unfair labour practices.\nI have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Ritchie and I therefore find it necessary to deal with the view expressed as to the effect of s. 65(5) of The Labour Relations Act. The subsection provides for the enforcement of the determination made by the Labour Relations Board under the powers conferred upon it in s. 65(4) of the statute, and it permits \u201cany employer, trade union or employee affected by the determination\u201d to cause the Board to file in the office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court a copy of the determination and provides that such determination shall be entered as a judgment or order of the Court and is enforceable as such. It is my brother Ritchie\u2019s view that when those who are given by this subsection the right to have the Board\u2019s determination enforced as a court order are limited to the three classes whose names I have italicized above, it is proper to interpret the word \u201cperson\u201d in subs. (4) of s. 65 in the same limited fashion. An analysis of the legislative history of the section would appear appropriate. In the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1950, c. 194, s. 57(1) provided:\n57. (1) The Minister may appoint a conciliation officer to inquire into any complaint that any person has been refused employment, discharged, discriminated against, threatened, coerced, intimidated or otherwise dealt with contrary to this Act. (The italics are my own.)\nSection 58(3) provided:\n58. (3) The commissioner shall give the parties full opportunity to present evidence and to make submissions and if he finds that the complaint is supported by the evidence he shall recommend to the Minister the course that ought to be taken with respect to the complaint, which may include reinstatement with or without compensation for loss of earnings and other benefits. And subs. (5) provided:\n(5) The Minister shall issue whatever order he deems necessary to carry the recommendations of the commissioner into effect and the order shall be final and shall be complied with in accordance with its terms.\nThe statute contained no provisions whatsoever for the enforcement of the order of the Minister as a court order. In 1960, The Labour Relations Act was very largely amended by the Statutes of Ontario 1960, c. 54, and by s. 30 of that statute ss. 57 and 58 as they existed in the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1950 as amended, were repealed and new sections substituted therefor. Section 57(4) and (5) are the exact verbatim counterpart of the present s. 64(4) and (5).\nSection 1(3)(b) existed in exactly the same form and as the same numbered section in the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1950, c. 194.\nIt would appear therefore that in the predecessor section to s. 65(4) of the present statute, i.e., s. 58(3) of R.S.O. 1950, c. 194, the Legislature used the word \u201cparties\u201d but in the section empowering the Minister to inquire into a complaint, i.e., s. 57(1) of the 1950 statute, the Legislature used the same word \u201cperson\u201d used in the present s. 65(4). When the Legislature then, in 1960, re-enacted in much more detailed terms those provisions, it chose in the then section 57(4) (now s. 65(4)) to repeat the use of the same word \u201cperson\u201d but when it added in subs. (5) the power to obtain enforcement of the determination by court order it limited those who could take advantage of that right to those within the classes mentioned, i.e., \u201cemployer, trade union or employee\u201d.\nIt is my view that if the Legislature, when enacting in much greater detail the provisions which had appeared as s. 57 and s. 58 in the 1950 statute, had intended to limit the right to make a complaint and obtain a hearing to employers, trade unions and employees, it would have used those words in subs. (4) as it did when it provided for the enforcement by registration as a court order in subs. (5), and its failure to use the three words chosen rather than the one general word indicates that those who were entitled to complain and obtain a hearing were a broader class than those who could enforce the resultant determination by court order. I do not think, that this Court need speculate as to the reason for such limitation of those who could so enforce. There may well have been a decision of policy involved and such a view was expressed by counsel for the Ontario Labour Relations Board in argument in this Court as to the Board\u2019s view of the importance of retaining the broader interpretation of the word \u201cperson\u201d. Of course, other means of enforcement are available, such as commencement of action in the ordinary fashion. Those permitted to apply for registration as a court order are limited and in my view s. 64(5) does not provide a complete code of enforcement as was the view of Gale J, in Tyrrell v. Consumers\u2019 Gas Company[19], in reference to the provisions of s. 34(9) of the statute.\nI am not ready to agree that the order which the Board might make under subs. (4) and which could \u201cinclude reinstatement in employment with or without compensation by the employer\u201d is limited to permitting an order for reinstatement as an \u201cemployee\u201d in the sense limited by s. 1(3)(b) of the statute. That section limits the word \u201cemployee\u201d but neither \u201cemployed\u201d or \u201cemployment\u201d are defined in the statute or limited in any way and I have already cited authority for the proposition that they should be given their ordinary grammatical meaning. In my view, therefore, it would be quite possible for the Board to make an order for the reinstatement of a servant of an employer in his or her work, whether that servant be \u201cemployee\u201d in the limited sense or not. For these reasons, I cannot find that the provisions of s. 65(5) aid in the limiting interpretation of the word \u201cperson\u201d appearing in s. 64(4) as urged by the respondent Associated Medical Services Inc.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the word \u201cperson\u201d in s. 50 and s. 65(4) should not be limited to mean only \u201cemployees\u201d as described in s. 1(3)(b).\nSince writing the above, I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Judson. As will be seen, I am in substantial agreement with his view of the applicant\u2019s right to obtain a decision of the Board. I must, however, express a different opinion as to the right of a court to consider the application for certiorari preferring to adopt that of Aylesworth J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said:\nThe board, however, is nowhere given exclusive jurisdiction to determine for itself the meaning to be attributed to sec. 50 or to sec. 65 and, of course, it is trite to observe that the board cannot by an erroneous interpretation of any section or sections of the Act, confer upon itself a jurisdiction which it otherwise would not have.\nMy brother Judson cited, inter alia, the following decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of this Court: Re Ontario Labour Relations Board, Bradley et al. v. Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd.[20]; Labour Relations Board et al. v. Traders\u2019 Service Ltd.[21]; Farrell et al. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board[22], and Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. v. O\u2019Krane[23].\nI have carefully considered each of those cases and am of the opinion that in each of them the Court refused the certiorari because it found there had been no exercise of function in excess of jurisdiction, or refusal to accept jurisdiction, by the lower Court rather than on any view that the Court was, even by a privative provision, as stringent as s. 80 of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, prohibited from inquiry whether there had been any such excess of jurisdiction or refusal to accept the same even if such excess consisted only of an interpretation of the provisions granting such jurisdiction to cover a broader field than, in the opinion of the Court, it should cover.\nIn Re Ontario Labour Relations Board, Bradley et al. v. Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd., supra, Roach J.A. dealt with an application for certiorari in reference to a matter where exactly the same privative clause appeared in the statute as the then s. 69 of R.S.O. 1950, c. 194. The learned justice in appeal, at p. 325 O.R., quoted Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan[24] at p. 443, and the first two lines of the quotation are most significant:\nThere must, of course, be certain conditions on which the right of every tribunal of limited jurisdiction to exercise that jurisdiction depends.\nAfter canvassing the whole question in considerable detail, Roach J.A. determined that, when the Board made findings that certain servants of the respondent exercised \u201cmanage- rial functions\u201d or were \u201cemployed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to labour relations\u201d and certain others were not of such class, the Board was acting exactly within the jurisdiction specifically and exclusively conferred upon it by the statute and not upon any collateral matter. Roach J.A., therefore, concluded at p. 336:\nIn my opinion, the Board in the instant case acted within the limits of jurisdiction and its decision is not reviewable by the Court and the order of Mr. Justice Wells should be varied so to declare.\nIt should be noted that the action, superficially much similar to the present one, is in truth essentially different. In that case as in this the Board had determined that certain servants carried on managerial functions. In that case, however, it was sought to contest such a decision in the Court. In this case, such a decision was accepted but the applicant applied to the Court for certiorari on the basis of such a decision, then by interpretation of s. 50 and s. 65 of the present statue the Board has no jurisdiction to make the order subject to complaint in such proceeding.\nThe question in that case was as to the constitution of a bargaining unit. The statute provides that the bargaining unit shall be of \u201cemployees\u201d (ss. 6 and 7 of R.S.O. 1950, c. 194) and no question of any alleged excess of jurisdiction by incorrect interpretation of any word of the statute arose. In my opinion, it is implicit in the reasons of Roach J.A. that if such excess of jurisdiction had been found he would have been of the opinion that certiorari lay despite the privative clause.\nIn Re Labour Relations Board et al. v. Traders\u2019 Service Ltd., supra, the Court held that the Board made a finding of fact within the exact power granted by the statute which provided that such finding was to be final and conclusive. At p. 678, Judson J. said:\nThe matter therefore was solely within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and is not open to judicial review.\nAgain, in Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. v. O\u2019Krane, supra, this Court determined that the Board made a finding that the defendant company was not an employer in an industry within the scope of Part I of the Workmen\u2019s. Compensation Act of British Columbia. That finding the Court determined was one which the Board had power to make by the express provisions of the statute. Therefore, Judson J. said at p. 302:\nI would dismiss the appeal but on the grounds given by the learned trial judge and the minority opinion in the Court of Appeal, namely, that these two matters were conclusively determined by the Board and that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction in these matters whether before or after the institution of an action.\nIn Farrell v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, supra, this Court held that the Board in determining that a workman\u2019s death occurred through natural causes had exercised a jurisdiction granted expressly to the Board in Part I of the statute. Therefore, Judson J. said at pp. 50-51:\nI agree with the majority reasons of the Court of Appeal that the Board\u2019s return, consisting of the application and its decision, was a proper one, that there was no error in law on the face of the record, and that there was error in compelling the Board to supplement its return in the absence of any question going to jurisdiction.\nThe issue here is a very simple one\u2014whether there was an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. This issue is unquestionably within the jurisdiction of the Board under Part I of the Act and even if there was error, whether in law or fact, it was made within the exercise of the jurisdiction and is not open to any judicial review, including certiorari. Section 76(1) of the Act, R.S.C. 1948, c. 370, provides:\n76. (1) The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear, and determine all matters and questions of fact and law arising under this Part, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any Court, and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition, or other process or proceeding in any Court or be removable by certiorari or otherwise into any Court; and without restricting the generality of the foregoing the Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear, and determine:\n(a) The question whether an injury has arisen out of or in the course of an employment within the scope of this Part.\nWith some diffidence in view of the fact that the judgment of the Court in the last three decisions quoted above were written by my brother Judson, I express the view that it is implicit in each of them that had the Court found there had been excess of jurisdiction by the Board in question then even strict terms of such a provision as the present s. 80 of The Labour Relations Act would not have barred the Court\u2019s quashing the decision on a certiorari application. I am of the opinion that the problem of jurisdiction is a real problem. There is a valid distinction between the attempt of a superior Court to inquire into the manner in which the inferior tribunal has discharged its duty within its admitted jurisdiction, where the superior Court is barred despite its view that the inferior tribunal has committed errors in findings of fact or even of law, and the review by a superior Court to determine whether the inferior tribunal has acted beyond the jurisdiction granted to it by the statute and therefore without jurisdiction. In my view, this distinction is not touched by the judgment of Dixon J. in The King v. Hickman[25], as an action by the inferior tribunal whereby it had interpreted the powers granted to it in broader terms than the Court thought proper would not be \u201creasonably capable of reference to the power given to the body\u201d (p. 615).\nIn Regina v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex. p. Taylor[26], McRuer C.J. refused a certiorari application. That decision was later affirmed on appeal and leave to appeal to this Court was refused by this Court on February 3, 1964. McRuer C.J.H.C. said, at p. 179 of the Ontario Reports:\nMy conclusion is that the sections of the Labour Relations Act in question are constitutional and I do not think it was beyond the powers of the Legislature to clothe the Labour Relations Board with jurisdiction to make decisions of law incidental to its administrative duties. Obviously the Board must decide many incidental questions of law in the performance of its administrative functions but in saying this I do not wish it to be taken that I think that the Board has power to make decisions in law with respect to collateral matters, which may not be reviewed on certiorari. In other words, it cannot give itself jurisdiction by wrong decisions in law.\nexpressing in the words last quoted my view that certiorari still lies if the inferior tribunal gave itself jurisdiction by a wrong decision in law.\nI have read with interest the views of the learned author of the article appearing in The University of Queensland Law Journal, vol. 1, no. 2, p. 39, that any check of the purported exercise of jurisdiction by such inferior tribunals should be left to the legislative authority which created it. Until the relevant legislative enactment expressly prohibits the superior Court\u2019s investigation of whether the inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction and so acted beyond any power granted it by the Legislature, I conceive it the duty of the superior Court to the litigant to exercise such function. Any legislative correction, no matter how efficient its operation in the future, will not restore to the particular litigant his right taken from him by the unauthorized and illegal action of the inferior tribunal.\nThere is a further matter which should be noted. Both the appellant Jarvis and the Ontario Labour Relations Board filed factums in this Court in which each sought to uphold the decision of the Board which granted relief to the appellant Jarvis. The factum filed on behalf of the Board made no reference to the propriety of the respondents proceeding by way of certiorari and counsel for the Board opened his oral submission by the unequivocal statement that he supported counsel for the appellant in his argument as to the interpretation of the statute but made no submission in reference to certiorari. If the Board in question does not wish to lay claims to such a drastic immunity from judicial review as is implicit in the reasons of my brother Judson, should this Court confer it unasked?\nMoreover, the factum of the appellant does not refer at all to the provisions of s. 80 of The Labour Relations Act and although the counsel for the appellant who submitted argument on the issue of the right to certiorari did cite the section he based his whole argument upon the proposition that certiorari only lay if there was error on the face of the record\u2014not that certiorari proceedings, even if there were utter lack of jurisdiction in the inferior tribunal, were excluded. Again, I do not think it would be appropriate therefore for this Court to take such a position in this case.\nIn the result, for the reasons outlined in the earlier part of this judgment, I would allow the appeal with costs against the respondent Associated Medical Services. There should be no costs for or against the respondent Labour Relations Board.\nAppeal dismissed, ABBOTT, JUDSON and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Calvin, Mackenzie, Williston & Swackhamer, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Associated Medical Services, Incorporated: Miller, Thompson, Hicks, Sedgewick, Lewis & Healy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents, The Ontario Labour Relations Board and A.M.

Royal Trust Co., [1964] S.C.R. 526\nDate: 1964-05-11\nThe Corporation of the City of Ottawa (Respondent) Appellant;\nand\nThe Royal Trust Company, City Centre Development (Ottawa) Limited, Kenson Construction Limited, Freedman Realty Company Limited, Pinecrest Investments (Ottawa) Limited, Rideau Terrace Apartment Ltd. and Shirden Investments Limited (Applicants) Respondents.\n1964: March 17, 18; 1964: May 11.\nPresent: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTaxation\u2014City by-law imposing special charge upon owners of high-rise or other buildings\u2014Validity of by-law\u2014The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61 (Ont.), c. 120, s. 4\nThe City of Ottawa under s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61 enacted a by-law for the imposition of a special charge upon the owners of high-rise or other buildings to pay for part of the cost of providing additional sanitary and storm sewer and water capacity which would not otherwise have been required except for the heavy load such buildings impose or may impose on the city\u2019s sewer or water system or both. In the case of a residential building or the residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, the charge, after crediting an exemption of two dwelling units, was $125 for each unit; in the case of a non\u2011residential building or the non-residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, the charge, after crediting an exemption of 1,500 square feet, was 17 cents for each square foot of floor space.\nAn application to quash the by-law having been dismissed in the first instance, the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal where it was held that the by-law was invalid. The Court of Appeal concluded that s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61 authorized the enactment of a by-law only if an actual or estimated expenditure for a particular utility was dealt with and only if a charge for an actual or estimated expenditure capable of being revised by the Court of Revision was being dealt with. In addition, the Court of Appeal found that the by-law was bad for discrimination on four grounds, viz., (1) the levy was imposed on owners of buildings which may be such as not to require any expenditure for additional utility capacity; (2) the levy was not upon the kind of buildings or classes thereof described in the enabling Act but was a levy made generally with respect to all new construction; (3) there was discrimination between buildings in the same class, and (4) the city classified buildings as residential and non\u2011residential or combined residential and non-residential. Held (Spence J., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The Court of Appeal was in error in holding that s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960\u201161 did no more than authorize what may be described as a local improvement by-law for an actual work in construction or in contemplation. The appeal provisions in subs. (4) did not justify a finding that the by-law must be a by-law contemplated by The Local Improvement Act. Also, there was no ground for the application of any principle of strict construction whether arising from a private Act or a taxing Act to support any holding that this by-law was bad. The scheme and purpose of the legislation were clear. The carrying out of the scheme and purpose by means of the by-law was no more than was authorized by the legislation.\nWith respect to the findings that the by-law was bad for discrimination on four grounds the following rulings were made: (1) The first finding seemed to imply that it is the duty of the city to assess in some way before enacting the by-law the actual gallonage of water consumed or likely to be consumed and the gallonage and time factors of the run-off for storm and sanitary sewers before it can act at all. The city, instead, classified the buildings to be taxed as residential and non-residential and mixed, and made elaborate provision for a levy on that basis. (2) The levy was not on new construction but on new construction of the classes mentioned, i.e., over 1,500 square feet and two dwelling units, because these classes might require additional capacity. (3) Adding to an existing building in such a way as to bring it within the terms of the legislation and by-law for the purpose of the exemption and a levy on the new construction on that basis was not discrimination. (4) The classification of buildings as residential and non-residential or combined residential and non-residential was well within the broad terms of the enabling statute and there was nothing arbitrary, unjust or partial in drawing such a distinction.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The principle of strict construction of a public Act and a taxing Act applied to The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61. Section 4 of the Act contemplated not the general levy on all new construction, which was in fact the essence of the by-law under attack, but rather a by-law passed for any particular area with a specific problem which may be surveyed in view of present new construction or contemplated new construction. The by\u2011law in question, therefore, was ultra vires as going beyond the power granted by the enabling statute.\nAs to the allegations of discrimination made by the respondents some of which were accepted and some rejected in the Court of Appeal, there was discrimination only in the provision in the last sentence of s. 3(2) of the by-law which removes the two-dwelling unit or 1,500 square feet of non-residential space from the exemption in the case of enlarged buildings. The last words of s. 3(2) form no part of the main structure of the by-law but contain only a provision as to a minor detail of the scheme. Were it possible to hold the by-law valid apart from the final words of s. 3(2), those words should be severed. However, as the whole scheme of the by-law goes beyond the power granted by s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960\u201161, it is invalid in toto.\n[The King v. Crabbs, [1934] S.C.R. 523; Cartwright v.

Aylen J., in the first instance, had affirmed this by-law. The statutory basis for the by-law is The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61 (Ont.), c. 120, s. 4, by which the City of Ottawa, subject to the prior approval of the Ontario Municipal Board, was granted jurisdiction to enact by-laws concerning buildings constructed or enlarged after May 2, 1960. The legislation authorizes by-laws for the imposition of a special charge or charges upon the owners of high-rise or other buildings as defined by the by-law or any class or classes of such buildings that impose or may impose a heavy load on the city\u2019s sewer or water system or both.\nPursuant to the legislation, the City of Ottawa submitted a draft by-law to the Ontario Municipal Board. After hearing interested parties, the Board, on December 17, 1962; gave a decision which authorized the enactment of a by-law in the form submitted but with a variation in the quantum of the charges. By-law 449-62 was then enacted on December 21, 1962. Subsequently, on January 7, 1963, by-law 3-63 was enacted setting forth methods for payment of the charges. This by-law had not received the prior approval of the Ontario Municipal Board. It was quashed by Aylen J. as being discriminatory and there was no appeal from that judgment to the Ontario Court of Appeal. We are, therefore, concerned only with by\u2011law 449-62. It is necessary to set out the authorizing legislation and the by-law in full:\nCity of Ottawa Act\nStatutes of Ontario, 9-10 Elizabeth II\nc. 120, s. 4\n4. (1) Subject to the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board first being obtained, the council of the Corporation may pass by-laws for imposing upon the owners of high-rise or other buildings, as defined by the by-law, for the erection or enlargement of which a building permit was or is issued subsequent to the 2nd day of May, 1960, or of any class or classes of such buildings, that impose or may impose a heavy load on the sewer system or water system, or both, by reason of which expenditures are or may be required to provide additional sanitary or storm sewer or water supply capacity, which, in the opinion of the council, would not otherwise be required, a special charge or charges over and above all other rates and charges to pay for all or part of the cost of providing the additional capacity.\n(2) The proceeds of the charge or charges authorized by subsection 1 shall be used for the purpose therein referred to and not otherwise.\n(3) Any charge or charges imposed under subsection 1 are a lien upon the land on which the building is erected and may be collected in the same manner and with the same remedies as provided by The Assessment Act for the collection of real property taxes.\n(4) There shall be an appeal to the court of revision of the City of Ottawa from any charge or charges authorized by subsection 1 and the provisions with respect to appeals to the court of revision and section 51 of The Local Improvement Act apply mutatis mutandis.\n(5) This section does not apply to single-family, double or duplex buildings.\nBY-LAW 449-62\nA by-law of The Corporation of the City of Ottawa for the imposition of a special capital charge respecting sewerage and water supply.\nWHEREAS all residential buildings in the City of Ottawa not being a single family building, a double building or a duplex building, all nonresidential buildings in the City of Ottawa having more than 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and all combined residential and non-residential buildings having more than two dwelling units or more than 1,500 square feet of gross floor area erected or enlarged pursuant to a building permit issued subsequent to the 2nd day of May, 1960 may impose a heavy load on the sewer system or water system of the Corporation or both by reason of which expenditures may be required to provide additional sanitary or storm sewer or water supply capacity which in the opinion of the Council would not otherwise be required;\nAND WHEREAS it is expedient to impose a special charge upon the owners of the above mentioned buildings subject to the exceptions hereinafter set forth, to pay for part of the cost of providing the additional capacity;\nAND WHEREAS the Council is by section 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, with the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board, authorized to enact as hereinafter set forth;\nAND WHEREAS the Ontario Municipal Board has by its order dated the 17th day of December, 1962 approved of this by-law; Therefore the Council of The Corporation of the City of Ottawa enacts as follows:\n1. In this by-law,\n(a) \u201ccombined residential and non-residential building\u201d means a building containing\n(i) a dwelling unit or dwelling units and\n(ii) space devoted to other purposes which space is not accessory to a dwelling unit or dwelling units only;\n(b) \u201cdwelling unit\u201d means one room or two or more rooms connected together or having access one to another intended for use as a separate unit in the same building and constituting an independent housekeeping unit for residential occupancy;\n(c) \u201cgross floor area\u201d means the total floor area obtained by adding together the area contained within the perimeter of the exterior of the building at each floor level;\n(d) \u201cnon-residential building\u201d means a building containing no dwelling units;\n(e) \u201cresidential building\u201d means a building containing only\n(i) a dwelling unit or dwelling units or\n(ii) a dwelling unit or dwelling units and space accessory to such use only.\n2. It is the opinion of the Council that all residential buildings in the City of Ottawa not being a single family building, a double building or a duplex building, all non\u2011residential buildings in the City of Ottawa having more than 1,500 square feet of gross floor area and all combined residential and non-residential buildings having more than two dwelling units or more than 1,500 square feet of gross floor area erected or enlarged pursuant to a building permit issued subsequent to the 2nd day of May, 1960 may impose a heavy load on the sewer system or water system of the Corporation or both by reason of which expenditures may be required to provide additional sanitary or storm sewer or water supply capacity which would not otherwise be required.\n3. (1) Subject to subsections 2 and 3 and to section 5 the following charges are hereby imposed upon the owner of every building in the City of Ottawa for the erection or enlargement of which a building permit was or is issued subsequent to the 2nd day of May, 1960:\n(a) in the case of a residential building or the residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, a charge of $125.00 for each dwelling unit the creation of which is authorized by the permit,\n(b) in the case of a non-residential building or the non-residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, a charge of 17 cents for each square foot of gross floor area the creation of which is authorized by the permit.\n(2) In calculating the charge under subsection (1) each residential building or residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building shall be credited with an exemption of two dwelling units and each non-residential building or non-residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building shall be credited with an exemption of 1,500 square feet and in applying such exemption dwelling units and floor area created pursuant to a building permit issued on or before the 2nd day of May, 1960 shall be counted. (3) In calculating the charge under subsection (1) in respect of a combined residential and non-residential building, that part of each floor used for dwelling units only shall be excluded from the gross floor area of the building.\n4. (1) All charges imposed under this by-law shall be calculated by the Building Inspector of the Corporation at the time of issuance of the building permit or, in the case of building permits issued prior to the date of enactment of this by-law, forthwith after such date and the Building Inspector shall certify the amount of the charge to the Treasurer of the Corporation.\n(2) The Treasurer shall\n(a) prepare a special roll showing\n(i) the name of the owner\n(ii) a description of the land on which the building is erected or enlarged and\n(iii) the amount of the charge imposed under section 3,\n(b) send a notice to the owner at least fifteen days before the next sitting of the Court of Revision at which an appeal from the charge may be heard, setting out the information contained on the roll prepared under clause (a) and also the time and place of the said sitting of the Court of Revision.\n(3) The charges imposed by this by-law are a lien upon the land on which the building is erected and shall be collected by the Treasurer in the same manner and with the same remedies as provided by The Assessment Act for the collection of real property taxes.\n5. This by-law shall not apply to\n(a) any building used for educational, religious or charitable purposes which is entitled to exemption from\n(i) all kinds of municipal taxation, or\n(ii) all kinds of municipal taxation other than school taxes or local improvement rates or both school taxes and local improvement rates,\n(b) a building on a lot or block in respect of which lot or block a charge was imposed on or after the 21st day of June, 1961 as a condition of the approval of a plan of subdivision, pursuant to the resolution of the Council of the said date,\n(c) any single family, double building or duplex building.\nGIVEN under the corporate seal of the City of Ottawa this 21st day of December, 1962.\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61 authorized the enactment of a by-law only if an actual or estimated expenditure for a particular utility was dealt with and only if a charge for an actual or estimated expenditure capable of being revised by the Court of Revision was being dealt with. The basis for this conclusion was subs. (4) of s. 4, which provides for appeals to the Court of Revision and makes the provisions of s. 51 of The Local Improvement Act apply mutatis mutandis. The ratio of the judgment of the Court of Appeal on this point is set out in the following extract from the reasons of Aylesworth J.A.:\nSubsection (4) of section 4 of the Act provides for an appeal to the Court of Revision from any charge authorized by subsection (1) and makes applicable to such appeal, mutatis mutandis, the provisions with respect to appeals to the Court of Revision and section 51 of the Local Improvement Act. Section 51(3) of the Local Improvement Act provides that the Judge on an appeal to him has the like jurisdiction and powers as are conferred on the Court of Revision by section 47. Section 47(1) provides inter alia that the Court of Revision has jurisdiction \u201cto review the proposed special assessment and to correct the same\u2026 in all cases as to the actual cost of the work.\u201d Upon a consideration of subsections (1) and (4) of the City of Ottawa Act under review and of the provisions of the Local Improvement Act imported into the special act and made applicable mutatis mutandis to the disposition of the appeals provided for by subsection (4), I am impelled to the conclusion that the special Act in contemplating the levy of the special charge or charges authorizes such charges only with respect to some actual work in construction or contemplation to provide for an additional capacity in the utilities; that the money expended or to be expended in connection therewith has been calculated or at least estimated and that such additional capacity in the opinion of the council \u201cwould not otherwise be required\u201d. It seems to me clear that to hold otherwise would be to render abortive or very nearly so, the protection afforded the taxpayer under subsection (4); unless the charge is made with respect to the actual work in construction or contemplation, the cost of which has been ascertained or at least estimated, the taxpayer in prosecuting an appeal with respect to the charge would be precluded from any effectual complaint to the Judge on the ground that the same was excessive or oppressive or on any ground involving a consideration of \u201cthe cost of the work.\u201d\nI think that there was error in holding that the new legislation did no more than authorize what may be described as a local improvement by-law for an actual work in construction or in contemplation. The appeal provisions in subs. (4) do not justify a finding that the by-law must be a by-law contemplated by The Local Improvement Act.\nThe Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 223, provides legislation by which public works of all kinds may be undertaken. There are two methods of financing under The Local Improvement Act, a special rate per foot frontage provided for by s. 20, or an area charge provided for in s. 67(1). The Local Improvement Act, of course, contemplates the existence of a specific scheme with all its incidental details of cost for which a charge is to be made. Section 4 of The City of Ottawa Act does not authorize this kind of by-law at all and without the importation of the appeal provisions in subs. (4) of s. 4, the Court of Appeal could never have reached the conclusion that it did. Section 4 is dealing with a situation where new construction imposes or may impose a heavy load on public utilities. It provides for charges that are or may be required. By-law 449-62 recognizes that in areas of the city not recently sub-divided, a sewer and water system of sufficient capacity to allow the use or erection and use of non\u2011residential buildings with 1,500 square feet of gross floor area or residential buildings with two dwelling units should be provided for out of ordinary revenue. Expenditures to provide for this capacity and its maintenance are recognized as normal while the erection of large buildings may require expenditures to provide additional capacity which would not otherwise be required. The purpose of the levy is clearly set forth in subs. (2) of the legislation: \u201cThe proceeds of the charge or charges authorized by subsection (1) should be used for the purpose therein referred to and not otherwise.\u201d They are not to be applied in reduction of general rates or to provide for normal expenditures but to provide increased capacity in the system needed for new construction after May 2, 1960, which would not otherwise be required.\nThe interpretation placed upon The City of Ottawa Act by the Court of Appeal would render it ineffectual. The statute authorizes the imposition of charges against owners of buildings erected or enlarged after May 2, 1960 and only against such people. The Local Improvement Act cannot and was not meant to operate under such legislation and it is error to import into the new legislation the provisions of The Local Improvement Act because of the provisions for appeal contained in subs. (4) of the legislation. Subsection (4) of s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, having created the right of appeal, refers to the provisions of The Local Improvement Act as a shorthand method of providing the necessary procedural regulations and in order to provide for appeals to the County Judge and the Court of Appeal. Those provisions are to be applied mutatis mutandis and the section does not provide that these provisions are to be applied verbatim to a new Local Improvement Act. The question whether or not by-law 449-62 is intra vires depends upon a consideration of The City of Ottawa Act alone and the by-law, and it is error to hold that this kind of reference to appeal provisions colours the whole scheme of the legislation and contemplates the specific scheme and the specific modes of financing provided for in The Local Improvement Act.\nThe Court of Appeal also says that this legislation must be strictly construed against the city because it is a private Act and a taxing Act. The principles have often been stated. Those who promote a private Act ought to see that the powers they wish to obtain are plainly expressed. Those who seek to tax must point to clear, unambiguous words which impose the tax. If these are not to be found or where the meaning of the statute is in doubt, there is no tax. I am using my own words but I do not wish to be taken in any way as departing from the usual formulae.\nThe cases cited in support of these principles are many. Up to 1934 there is a representative collection of them relating to taxing Acts in a judgment of this Court in The King v. Crabbs[2], which was concerned with sales tax under the Special War Revenue Act.\nOn the other hand, in Cartwright v. City of Toronto[3], in dealing with tax sales and validating legislation, Duff J. said:\nOn the merits of the case I think all the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant are disposed of by the decision of the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. Russell ([1908] A.C. 493). I see no reason to doubt that the passages of the judgment at page 501 form a part of the ratio decidendi. The effect of these passages, in my judgment, is to explode the notion which appears to have been founded on some decisions of this court, that statutes of this character are subject to some special canon of construction based, apparently, upon the presumption that all such statutes are prima facie monstrous. The effect of the judgment of the Judicial Committee is that particular provision in such statutes must be construed according to the usual rule, that is to say, with reasonable regard to the manifest object of them as disclosed by the enactment as a whole.\nThis principle was applied in Palmolive Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[4], also concerned with sales tax and the Special War Revenue Act, as was Crabbs, and in Langdon v. Holtyrex Gold Mines Ltd.[5], where the problem was the same as in Cartwright v. Toronto and Toronto v. Russell.\nI do not think that these two lines of authority are saying exactly the same thing. The apparent diversity does suggest the need for emphasis on the problem before the legislature and the means adopted to solve it, and all the more so where the problem is new in municipal development. This legislation applies only to certain kinds of buildings for which a building permit is issued after May 2, 1960. The buildings may be of two classes: those that impose and those that may impose a heavy load on public utilities and which require or may require additional expenditures. This is not a situation apt to be dealt with by local improvement legislation. If it were, why would existing legislation not be adequate? The extensions are to be provided by those who make them necessary and not by the taxpayers at large as a bonus to a certain type of building operation.\nThe legislation itself exempts single family, double or duplex buildings. The by-law carries this out. Both are saying that the public utilities which the city has or which it would normally construct would be adequate for such buildings. Over and above this, whatever capacity is required or may be required is called for by a building in excess of these limits. The by-law provides for two classes of building to be subject to the special charges:\n(a) in the case of a residential building or the residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, a charge of $125.00 for each dwelling unit the creation of which is authorized by the permit,\n(b) in the case of a non-residential building or the non-residential part of a combined residential and non-residential building, a charge of 17 cents for each square foot of gross floor area the creation of which is authorized by the permit.\nSubsection (2) of s. 3 gives each of these classes of building a certain exemption which makes it clear that it is excess capacity that is being taxed. Broadly speaking, the classification is between residential and non-residential building. Residential building is taxed on a unit basis ($125 for each dwelling unit), non-residential building on floor space (17 cents per square foot). I agree with Aylen J. that the City Council had the right to draw this distinction between residential and non-residential building; that this distinction is valid and does not give rise to discrimination.\nSubsection (3) of s. 3 is merely a mode of calculating the charge under subs. (1) in respect of combined residential and non-residential building. You deduct the floor space used for dwelling units only and the rest is non-residential floor area.\nThe by-law is, of necessity, a detailed document but it does not lack in clarity. I can see no ground for the applica- tion of any principle of strict construction whether arising from a private Act or a taxing Act to support any holding that this by-law is bad. To me the scheme and purpose of the legislation are clear. The carrying out of the scheme and purpose by means of the by-law is no more than is authorized by the legislation.\nSo far I have only dealt with the decision of the Court of Appeal in quashing the by-law because the levy was not imposed with respect to any planned expenditure for additional capacity with an ascertained or estimated cost. The Court of Appeal, however, went on to find that the by-law was bad for discrimination on four grounds.\nThe first of these grounds was that the levy is imposed on owners of buildings which may be such as not to require any expenditure for additional utility capacity. This is stated in the following extract from the reasons of the Court of Appeal:\n...Under this charging section therefore, a levy is made upon the owner of a building erected after the effective date which in fact may replace an existing building and be of such construction, extent and use as not only not to \u201cimpose a heavy load\u201d upon the utilities but not to require any expenditures to provide any additional utility capacity whatsoever.\nThis conclusion is based upon a number of hypothetical cases put to the Court by counsel for the respondents. He quoted, for example, the possibility of the demolition of an old tenement building housing several families and its replacement by a warehouse building on one floor having only one or two employees. I doubt whether this kind of illustration is an aid to interpretation unless all the relevant facts are in evidence. There was no evidence called in this litigation. The evidence was entirely affidavit evidence which was merely put in to show that the respondents had an interest in attacking the by-law. Further, the probabilities do not stop with the hypothetical case. It ignores entirely the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in The City of Ottawa Act. There are all kinds of probabilities that this kind of building may be put to another use which may call for additional requirements.\nThis finding seems to imply that it is the duty of the city to assess in some way before enacting the by-law the actual gallonage of water consumed or likely to be consumed and the gallonage and time factors of the run-off for storm and sanitary sewers before it can act at all. The city, instead, classified the buildings to be taxed as residential and non-residential and mixed, and made elaborate provision for a levy on that basis.\nThe second ground on which the Court of Appeal found discrimination is set out in the following extract:\nIn pith and substance the levy is not upon the kind of buildings or classes thereof described in the enabling Act but is a levy made generally with respect to all new construction. Upon both these grounds, section 3 of the by-law is invalid.\nThe error here is that the levy is not on new construction but on new construction of the classes mentioned, i.e., over 1,500 square feet and two dwelling units, because these classes may require additional capacity.\nThe third finding of the Court of Appeal was that there was discrimination between buildings in the same class. This is expressed in the following extract from the reasons dealing with s. 3(2) of the by-law:\nAgain it is said that Section 3(2) of the by-law is discriminatory in that, although the special charge is levied upon owners of buildings erected or enlarged after the effective date, the owner of a building which is enlarged is discriminated against in comparison with the owner of a building which is newly erected in its entirety since the former is not granted an area or unit exemption in calculation of the tax which is received by the latter. I agree that the discrimination exists and if it exists it is a discrimination as between buildings in the same class, something not permitted by the enabling Act.\nI take this to mean that when a building is extended, it is considered as a whole and the exemptions apply when the exemptions are determined. The exemptions may come out of the old construction and not necessarily out of the new construction. Take the case of an old residential building existing before the effective date. As it stands, it is not subject to this by\u2011law. Any enlargement will have to be of such a character as to bring it within the legislation and the by-law but once this happens, there is no reason to restrict the operation of the exemption only to the enlargement. Enlargement brings a building within the scope of the bylaw just as much as new erection.\nThere is a rational basis for the enactment of the by-law in its form as it stands. Adding to an existing building in such a way as to bring it within the terms of the legislation and by-law for the purpose of the exemption and a levy on the new construction on that basis is not discrimination. Section 3(2) of the by-law recognizes that if a lot is now vacant a new building thereon should not pay the special charge except in excess of occupation space for either two families or 1,500 square feet of commercial space. In enlargements of old buildings the by-law recognizes the same basic exemption but if the land is already consuming municipal services to the extent of 1,500 square feet of commercial space or two families, it recognizes that any additional construction will require expenditures on the sewer or water system.\nFinally, discrimination is found in the fact that the city classified buildings as residential and non-residential or combined residential and non-residential. I agree with Aylen J. on this point that the distinction was a natural and sensible one and well within the broad terms of the enabling statute and that there was nothing arbitrary, unjust or partial in drawing such a distinction.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Aylen J. which dismissed the motion to quash by-law 449-62.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the City of Ottawa from the order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] dated July 2, 1963. In that judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed an appeal by the respondents from the order of the late Mr. Justice Aylen dated March 19, 1963. In the latter judgment, Mr. Justice Aylen had dismissed an application by the respondents herein to quash by-law 449-62 of the City of Ottawa. The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, being chapter 120 of the Statutes of that year provided in s. 4:\n4. (1) Subject to the approval of the Ontario Municipal Board first being obtained, the council of the Corporation may pass by-laws for imposing upon the owners of high-rise or other buildings, as defined by the by-law, for the erection or enlargement of which a building permit was or is issued subsequent to the 2nd day of May, 1960, or of any class or classes of such buildings, that impose or may impose a heavy load on the sewer system or water system, or both, by reason of which expenditures are or may be required to provide additional sanitary or storm sewer or water supply capacity, which, in the opinion of the council, would not otherwise be required, a special charge or charges over and above all other rates and charges to pay for all or part of the cost of providing the additional capacity. (2) The proceeds of the charge or charges authorized by subsection 1 shall be used for the purpose therein referred to and not otherwise.\n(3) Any charge or charges imposed under subsection 1 are a lien upon the land on which the building is erected and may be collected in the same manner and with the same remedies as provided by The Assessment Act for the collection of real property taxes.\n(4) There shall be an appeal to the court of revision of the City of Ottawa from any charge or charges authorized by subsection 1 and the provisions with respect to appeals to the court of revision and section 51 of The Local Improvement Act apply mutatis mutandis.\n(5) This section does not apply to single-family, double or duplex buildings.\nA draft by-law of the Corporation of the City of Ottawa, numbered 449-62, was submitted to the Municipal Board in accordance with the provisions of the said s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act and after a hearing on December 17, 1962, the Municipal Board gave reasons for authorizing the enactment of the by-law in the form submitted but with a variation in the quantum of the charges. Subsequently, on December 21, 1962, by-law 449-62 was enacted by the Corporation of the City of Ottawa. Before this Court, there were two main attacks levelled at the validity of the by-law. Firstly, that the whole scheme of the by-law was not in accordance with the provisions of the enabling statute as that enabling statute contemplated a building which had been or was about to be built and which would or might add a heavy load on the water or sewage system by reason of which expenditures were or may be required to provide the additional capacity, and that additional expenditure would, in the opinion of council, not otherwise be required, while it is submitted that what was enacted as by-law 449\u201162 was, in fact, with narrow exemptions, a general levy on all new construction irrespective of whether it will add a heavy load to the water or sewage facilities and irrespective of whether such heavy load will require expenditures not otherwise necessary. Secondly, that even if the scheme of the by-law were within the enabling legislation, it is bad as discriminatory in five different instances, and that the by-law being the embodiment of a scheme and that scheme having been approved by the Municipal Board, it is not possible to sever the alleged discriminatory portions of the by-law and to declare in favour of the validity of the truncated remainder.\nTo deal first with the allegation that the by-law is ultra vires in that it goes beyond the legislation permitted by the enabling statute, one must determine what general canons of construction are to be applied to the by-law and to the statute. Firstly, it is noted that c. 120 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1960-61, is in fact a private Act. It is so listed in the table of contents at p. viii of the index and the statute itself shows that it was enacted after a petition by the Corporation of the City of Ottawa. Lord Esher said in Altrincham Union Assessment Committee v. Cheshire Lines Committee[7], at p. 602:\nNow it is quite true that there is some difference between a private Act of Parliament and a public one, but the only difference which I am aware of is as to the strictness of the construction to be given to it, when there is any doubt as to the meaning. In the case of a public Act you construe it keeping in view the fact that it must be taken to have been passed for the public advantage, and you apply certain fixed canons to its construction. In the case of a private Act, which is obtained by persons for their own benefit, you construe more strictly provisions which they allege to be in their favour, because the persons who obtain a private Act ought to take care, that it is so worded that that which they desire to obtain for themselves is plainly stated in it. But, when the construction is perfectly clear there is no difference between the modes of construing a private Act and a public Act\u2026\nIt is true that in North London Ry. Co. v. Metropolitan Board of Works[8], Sir W. Page Wood V.C., said at p. 413:\n...and they point to the acts which regulate the taking of land by private companies to show that it is not in the course of the Legislature to give such powers without providing protection for the land owners. To this argument it is competent for the Defendants to reply, that the policy of Acts for the regulation of private companies is not necessarily applicable to an Act like this, the purpose of which is a great public benefit to the whole community.\nThat statement was made in reference to a statute which permitted the Metropolitan Board of Works to execute public works without first acquiring title to the land. I am of the opinion that it is not applicable to the situation in the present action. In Quinton v. Corporation of Bristol[9], at p. 532, Sir R. Malins, V.C., expressed a similar view as to a statute which permitted the City of Bristol to expropriate property in order to widen streets and held that it permitted the taking of a whole property and not the half or less which was actually required within the limits of the proposed street. So far as the present case is concerned, I am of the opinion that Lord Esher\u2019s statement sets a proper standard for the construction of the statute and indeed of the by-law passed by virtue of the statute. Again, the statute and the by-law is a taxing statute. The statute in fact only authorized the tax while the by-law purports to assess such tax but the principle of construction, it is suggested, applies to the enabling statute to determine whether or not it authorizes the tax as set out in the by-law. If there is any ambiguity then the interpretation must be the one more favourable to the taxpayer: Partington v. Attorney-General[10] at p. 122, per Lord Cairns:\n...because, as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there is admissible in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nIn City of Ottawa v. Egan[11], Idington J., at p. 308, quoted Lord Cairns in Cox v. Rabbits[12], at p. 478, to the same effect. And in Montreal Light Heat and Power Consolidated v. City of Westmount[13], Anglin C.J., at p. 519, adopted the citation I have made from the Partington case, as did Hughes J. in The King v. Crabbs[14], at p. 525. Counsel for the appellant cited Langdon v. Holtyrex Gold Mines Ltd.[15], Palmolive Manufacturing Co. v. The King[16], and Northern Broadcasting Co. v. District of Mountjoy[17]. I have considered these cases and they do not cut down the validity of the principle enunciated by Lord Cairns in the Partington case which, in my opinion, still applies to s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61.\nIt is appropriate at this time to consider the problem which the statute and the by-law passed in virtue thereof attempt to deal with. The City of Ottawa was faced with a problem of urban core renewal. Land in an area no longer attractive to single-family residences was being developed for high-rise office and apartment buildings. In addition, the 50 to 60-year old water mains and sewers were wearing out. This is a problem common to every city in North America and particularly to the older cities in Ontario. If what Ottawa seeks to do by the by\u2011law as distinguished from what, in my opinion, it was empowered to do by the statute were a solution accepted by the legislature, then one would have expected it to have been the subject of a general amendment to The Local Improvement Act and other provincial statutes, whereby such a capital levy on new construction would have been permitted in all cases. Surely, therefore, the legislature acted on the City of Ottawa\u2019s petition only to permit the municipality to lay a special rate or rates when it would not otherwise be required.\nThe submission by counsel for the appellant that such a type of by-law would only apply on the first building erected thereunder cannot be supported. Were certain areas in the City of Ottawa surveyed by the proper authorities and it was determined that in the next \u201cx\u201d years the erection of high-rise buildings would require larger mains at a certain cost, larger sanitary sewers at a certain additional cost, and larger pumping stations and increased treatment plants at a further cost, and that of the total cost a certain per cent would be attributable not to replacement but to the additions caused by such new construction, this cost would then be distributed over new building in the area as it would occur during those years in an acceptable formula. The last words of subs. (1) of s. 4 of the statute, \u201cto pay for all or part of the cost of providing the additional capacity\u201d are the key (the italics are my own). Such a scheme would contemplate a calculation or estimation of the actual or potential increased load even if such calculations were an approximation only. On the other hand, the present by-law assesses a building built in 1962 despite the fact that it might be right over a large new trunk sewer and alongside a new water main, both constructed in 1958 and at that time prudently constructed of a size much larger than required, so that in fact the 1962 construction of the building entailed no additional load on either water or sewer facilities which would require additional expenditure. The additional expenditure had already been made and I can find no implication in the statute that the City of Ottawa is entitled to recoup itself for past expenditures in renewal or extension of services. It is true that in such a scheme there may be examples of such accidental discrimination as has been pointed out by counsel for the appellants in reference to the present by-law. In my opinion, such discrimination would have to be considered necessary and reasonable when the statute contemplates and permits a rate assessed on a building which is merely proposed.\nA consideration of s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, in my opinion, demonstrates that it has in view a by-law applicable to specific areas and schemes rather than a charge on all new construction subject to the slight exemptions.\nFirstly, it should be noted that the opinion of council in the statute is confined to one element only, and that is whether the expenditures required for the additional capacity would or would not be otherwise required. Therefore, the other elements set out in the statute, (1) whether the buildings impose or may impose a heavy load, and (2) whether by reason of the heavy load additional capacity is required, are not by the statute left to the opinion of council and there must be some adjudication thereon. Such adjudication may be by the Municipal Board or by the Court of Revision, more probably by the former. This by-law has already been approved by the Municipal Board but it could not have considered those two elements, for the determination of the first element implies that the Board had to know the buildings which were or were to be built before it could determine if those buildings imposed or might impose a heavy load. By-law 449-62 in paragraph (2) purports to transfer the opinion to cover all of the elements and so, in my view, exceeds the statutory power granted.\nSecondly, s. 4(2) of the statute provides that the proceeds shall be used for the purpose set out in subs. (1) and not otherwise. Yet by-law 449-62 makes no provision for segregation of the fund nor for its disbursement in accordance with the provisions of s. 4(1), that is to pay all or part of the cost of providing the additional capacity. In fact, apart from the declaration in para. (2), no mention is made of cost. One asks oneself how, under this by-law, can it be determined what amount is to be paid out of the proceeds of the fund for the new sewer on any particular street.\nThirdly, s. 4(4) of the statute provides:\n(4) There shall be an appeal to the court of revision of the City of Ottawa from any charge or charges authorized by subsection 1 and the provisions with respect to appeals to the court of revision and section 51 of the Local Improvement Act apply mutatis mutandis.\nCounsel for the appellants argue that one must look at s. 4 and determine how it shall be interpreted and only then look at The Local Improvement Act to determine how the statute must be applied in so far as procedure is concerned. I cannot accept that method of construction; subs. (4) is part of the special Act and any light its provisions cast on the meaning of subs. (1) is available to aid in its interpretation and it should be so utilized. Counsel for the appellant submits that subs. (4) is only \u201ca shorthand method of providing the necessary procedural regulations in order to provide for appeals to the County Judge and the Court of Appeal\u201d, but a consideration of subs. (4) demonstrates that it discharges a much more important task. It provides an appeal to the Court of Revision and then sets out the provisions with respect to appeals thereto and further appeals and includes s. 51 of The Local Improvement Act, with the direction that the provisions of the latter statute shall apply only mutatis mutandis. One of the provisions with respect to the Court of Revision is s. 47 of The Local Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 223. That section is as follows:\n47. (1) The court of revision has jurisdiction and power to review the proposed special assessment and to correct the same as to all or any of the following matters:\n(a) where the owners\u2019 portion of the cost is to be specially assessed against the land abutting directly on the work,\n(i) the names of the owners of the lots,\n(ii) the frontage or other measurements of the lots,\n(iii) the amount of the reduction to be made under section 28 in respect of any lot,\n(iv) the lots which, but for section 62, would be exempt from special assessment,\n(v) the lifetime of the work,\n(vi) the rate per foot with which any lot is to be specially assessed, and\n(vii) the exemption or amount of reduction to be made under section 30 in respect of any lot;\n(b) where part of the owners\u2019 portion of the cost is to be specially assessed on land not abutting directly on the work, in addition to the matters mentioned in clause a, as to the lots other than those abutting directly on the work which are or will be immediately benefited by it, and as to the special assessment which such lots should respectively bear;\n(c) in all cases as to the actual cost of the work.\n(2) The court of revision does not have jurisdiction or authority to review or to alter the proportions of the cost of the work that the lands to be specially assessed and the corporations are respectively to bear according to the provisions of the by-law for undertaking the work.\nIt will be seen that in both clauses (a) and (c) of the said section the Court of Revision is permitted to make adjustments having in view a specific work and after ascertaining the exact nature and cost of the work. Counsel for the appellant argues that this type of provision is obviously inapplicable to the present case and insists the provisions of The Local Improvement Act are to apply only mutatis mutandis and that therefore this section cannot be used to restrictively interpret s. 4(1) of The City of Ottawa Act. But surely mutatis mutandis means \u201cwith necessary changes in matters of detail\u201d and the proper interpretation is not to ignore the provisions of s. 47 of The Local Improvement Act such as found in clause (c) of subs. (1) \u201cin all cases as to the actual cost of the work\u201d but to interpret the mutatis mutandis direction of s. 4(4) as providing that the Court of Revision may consider the estimated cost of all the work required in addition to that which would otherwise be required. In my view, to confine s. 4(4) to limit the provisions as to appeal to the Court of Revision and further appeals therefrom to merely the formal and mechanical matters such as the name of the owners or the size of the lots would be to improperly limit the application of the subsection. I have, therefore, concluded that s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, contemplates not the general levy on all new construction, which is in fact the essence of the by-law under attack, but rather a by-law passed for any particular area with a specific problem which may be surveyed in view of present new construction or contemplated new construction, and that therefore by-law 449-62 is ultra vires as going beyond the power granted by the enabling statute.\nCounsel for the respondents also submits that by-law 449-62 is invalid in that it is in many instances discriminatory. Firstly, counsel for the respondents had made no attempt to attack by-law 449-62 on the basis that it is unreasonable as distinguished from discriminatory despite the fact that s. 242(2) of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 249, which provides that a by-law passed by the council in the exercise of any of its powers conferred by that Act could not be found to be unreasonable applies by its very terms only to by-laws passed by virtue of The Municipal Act while this by-law was passed by virtue of the powers conferred by The City of Ottawa Act. Lord Russell C. J., when purporting to define \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in a by-law in Kruse v. Johnson[18], at p. 99, defined, in my view, \u201cdiscrimination\u201d when he said:\nBut unreasonable in what sense? If for instance they were found to be partial and unequal in their operation as between different classes; if they were manifestly unjust; if they disclosed bad faith; if they involved such oppressive or gratuitous interference with the rights of those subject to them as could find no justification in the minds of reasonable men, the Court might well say, \u201cParliament never intended to give authority to make such rules; they are unreasonable and ultra vires\u201d.\nAgain, in City of Montreal v. Beauvais[19], Duff J., as he then was, at p. 216 described such a by-law as \u201cso unreasonable, unfair or oppressive as to be on any fair construction an abuse of the power\u201d. The invalidity of discriminatory by-laws has frequently been declared in this Court and in the Province of Ontario: City of Hamilton v. Hamilton Distillery Co.[20]; Carleton Woollen Co. v. Town of Wood-stock[21]; Forst v. City of Toronto[22], and Re S.S. Kresge Co. Ltd. v. City of Windsor et al.[23]\nIt is, however, well settled law that a court, when considering the validity of subordinate legislation such as a by-law and finding two possible interpretations, one of which would result in the invalidity of the by-law as discriminatory and one of which would result in its being found valid, should choose the latter: Kruse v. Johnson, supra; City of Toronto et al. v. Outdoor Neon Displays Ltd.[24], per Cartwright J. at p. 313. Applying those statements of the relevant principles I proceed to consider the allegations of discrimination made by the respondents some of which were accepted and some rejected in the Court of Appeal.\n(1) In fixing rates differently based for residential and non-residential buildings, and in fixing one rate for all sizes of residential buildings:\nSection 4(1) of the statute authorized the council to pass by-laws for imposing on the owners of high-rise or other buildings, or of any class or classes of such buildings, a special charge or charges. The statute therefore gives the council power to set up classes of buildings and to apply appropriate rates to such classes. The council set up, so far as this allegation of discrimination is concerned, three classes, residential, non-residential and combined residential and non-residential, and defined them in s. 1 of the by-law. The council also set different rates for the classes of residential and non-residential accommodation. It may well be that the result is that the owner of a residential building pays exactly the same rate per square foot as the owner of a non-residential building only when each dwelling unit contains exactly 735.3 square feet but it would appear, nevertheless, that council honestly exercised their judgment in determining that the amount of $150 (varied by the Municipal Board to $125) represented a fair approximation of some undetermined, or at any rate unstated, part of the cost of the required additional capacity of sewers and water supply, and that the council similarly exercised its judgment as to the non-residential rate. To quote again Lord Russell C. J. in Kruse v. Johnson, supra, at p. 100:\nSurely it is not too much to say that in matters which directly and mainly concern the people of the county, who have the right to choose whom they think best fitted to represent them in their local government bodies, such representatives may be trusted to understand their own requirements better than judges.\nI realize, of course, that the oft-quoted statement was said in relation to a by-law prohibiting playing music or singing in the streets. However, as was said by counsel for the appellant during the argument in this Court, any by-law is bound to be \u201cmildly discriminatory\u201d. The test of discrimination, if any, is whether it were reasonably necessary. Again, to apply the test of Duff J. in Montreal v. Beauvais, supra:\nThe by-law in fixing the two general rates was not, in my opinion, so unreasonable, unfair or oppressive as to be on any fair construction an abuse of the powers of council.\n(2) The alleged discrimination against the enlargement of buildings contained in the final words of subs. (2) of s. 3 of the by-law \u201cand in applying such exemption dwelling units and floor area created pursuant to a building permit issued on or before the 2nd day of May, 1960, shall be counted\u201d:\nIt would appear that if one owner builds a new building containing twelve units then he is required to pay, allowing the exemption of two-dwelling units, ten times $125 or $1,250, while another owner who builds a new wing to an existing building containing twelve units exactly similar would be required to pay twelve times $125 or $1,450. Counsel for the appellant submits that this provision is rational and in fact that its omission would be discriminatory, for the owner of a newly-built building had not before utilized the municipal services beyond the basic extent of two-dwelling units or thirteen hundred feet commercial space, and so would be entitled to that exemption while the owner of the enlarged building had already the use of the services to at least the extent of that basic exemption. This argument presupposes that in the case of the new building as distinguished from the enlarged one it was built on land utilized prior to its construction to an extent less than the basic exemption and that no additional lands are used in the enlargement, that is, that the enlargement consists of adding additional storeys, a most unusual situation. In my opinion, the reasonable and necessary discrimination would be more properly attained if the provision had been omitted from the by-law. The provision as it stands would appear to be so unreasonable, unfair and oppressive as to be an abuse of the power although, in my opinion, it is not an important one.\n(3) The alleged discrimination in s. 3(3) of the by-law by the requirement that in combined residential and norv-residential buildings that part of each floor \u201cused for dwelling purposes only\u201d shall be excluded from the gross floor area of the building:\nIt is true that if this provision were interpreted so that corridors, elevator shafts, laundries, garage space, etc., were to be held to be space not \u201cused for dwelling units\u201d then the owner of a combined building would pay a much larger sum than the owner of a residential building of comparable size. Counsel for the appellant, however, does not seek to have the provision so interpreted. It must be noted that the words in the subsection are \u201cused for dwelling units only\u201d and not such words as \u201ccontained within the walls of dwelling units\u201d, and one may well say a corridor, for instance, is \u201cused for dwelling units\u201d. In view of the authorities I have cited above, it would appear that this is a case where the Court should so interpret the provisions of the by-law as to remove any invalidity resulting from discrimination, and I do so. (4) Re alleged discrimination by exemption of subdivision charge areas:\nSection 5 of by-law 449-62 exempts certain properties from the operation of the by-law. Subsection (c) thereof exempts single-family and double or duplex buildings, and therefore simply repeats the exemption in s. 4(5) of the statute. Section (a) provides exemption for charitable educational institutions, and is again a repetition of other provincial legislation. Subsection (b), however, exempts:\n(b) a building on a lot or block in respect of which lot or block a charge was imposed on or after the 21st day of June, 1961, as a condition of the approval of a plan of subdivision, pursuant to the resolution of the Council of the said date\nBy a resolution of Council passed on June 21, 1961, a series of charges on subdivisions recommended for approval after January 16, 1961, were set. The charges include $1,200 per acre plus $100 per unit to an amount of not less than $1,500 for multiple dwellings and $1,200 per acre for non-residential buildings. Under this schedule, a 10-apartment building built on an acre of ground subdivided after January 1, 1961, would pay a subdivison charge of $1,200 plus ten times $100 or $2,200. A 10-unit apartment building under by-law 449-62 apart from the exemption set out as not within the exemption of subdivision charge areas, would pay eight times $125 or $1,000, and a building on one acre of land under the by-law would have to have at least sixty dwelling units before the special rates set out in by-law 449-62 would exceed the subdivision charges. However commercial or non-residential buildings, to use the terminology of the subdivision resolution and the by-law, respectively, do exhibit what might well be regarded as discrimination. An acre of land for commercial purposes is subject to a charge under the subdivison resolution of $1,200 whether it were occupied by a parking lot or a multi-storey office building, while the same one acre of land under the by-law, if completely covered by a one-floor non-residential building containing say 40,000 square feet after allowing for walls, would pay a charge under by-law 449-62 of $6,800 and each floor would add a like amount to the charge. Aylesworth J.A., in the Court of Appeal, considered this allegation of discrimination and pointed out that under the statute the council were empowered to set up classes and affix rates. In my view, that power does permit council to reasonably differentiate between various buildings and so long as it does so reasonably the different rates assigned to the different classes cannot be found to be discrimination. What s. 5(d) has done in effect is to divide each class into two sub-classes, dependent on whether the land on which the building was erected was or was not subject to the subdivision charge. It may well be that the result is favourable to the owner who has erected on land subject to the subdivision charge a large non-residential building, if any such example exists, unless that owner in the subdivision agreement also was required to instal services such as sewers and water mains at a very considerable cost.\nI have come to the conclusion that the differentiation, having regard to the existence of the subdivision charges, is a reasonable one and the fact that there may occur examples of inequality is merely an example of the approximate equality which must result in order to avoid discrimination.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that I have found discrimination only in the provision in the last sentence of s. 3(2) of the by-law which removes the two-dwelling unit or 1,500 square feet of non-residential space from the exemption in the case of enlarged buildings. The problem therefore arises whether such a provision may be severed from the by-law. By the provision of s. 4(1) of the statute, the by-law must be approved by the Municipal Board and it has been so approved. That approval, of course, does not in any way validate a by-law which is ultra vires or discriminatory: Re Casa Loma[25]; R. ex rel. St. Jean v. Knott[26], per Rose C.J.H.C. at pp. 434 and 435.\nIt has been said that where a by-law must be approved by the Municipal Board then it is approved as a whole and the Court could not declare in favour of the validity of a by-law so approved unless it was ready to find it valid in toto: City of Chatham v. Sisters of St. Joseph et al.[27], per Robertson C.J.O. at p. 554; Re Wilmot et al. and City of Kingston[28]. Both of these decisions were in reference to s. 406 subs. (4) of The Municipal Act which then read:\nNo part of any by-law passed under this section and approved by the Municipal Board shall be repealed or amended without approval of the Municipal Board. Robertson C.J.O. observed that the council cannot amend it without the Board\u2019s approval, yet in effect that is what the Court would do if it should hold part of the by-law to be invalid and other parts of it to be valid and in force.\nSection 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, the enabling legislation here, simply provides:\nSubject to the approval of the Municipal Board first being obtained, the council of the Corporation may pass by-laws\u2026\nand no counterpart of the subsection of The Municipal Act, then in effect, quoted above appears in the statute, nor so far as I have been able to ascertain, in any other statutory provision applicable to this case. Moreover, as Kerwin J., as he then was, pointed out in Village of Long Branch v. Hogle[29], at pp. 559-60, the statement by Robertson C.J.O. in Chatham v. Sisters of St. Joseph was obiter with which he did not agree and its approval by Laidlaw J.A. in Wilmot v. City of Kingston, supra, at p. 448, was also obiter, and that Robertson C.J.O. continued:\nThese by-laws for imposing building restrictions usually set up a scheme which is designed and adopted as a whole and, quite apart from the question of the approval of the Municipal Board, it is from the very nature of the by-law a delicate operation for the court to sever one part of such a by-law from the rest with any assurance that what is left of it sets forth any scheme that the council had put in operation.\nKerwin J. adopted those remarks and found that the invalid part of the by-law in Long Branch v. Hogle was merely an additional penalty and so severable and with that view Rand J. concurred. Kellock J. found that the penalty section did not require approval by the Municipal Board and so that body\u2019s approval of the by-law did not prevent the penalty section being severed therefrom. Applying this principle, in my view, the Court should hold that even if the statute contained such a provision as to the approval of the Board as that quoted from The Municipal Act which it does not, it may in proper circumstances sever the invalid provision in the by-law. In the present case, the last words of s. 3(2) of by-law 449-62 form no part of the main structure of the by-law but contain only a provision as to a minor detail of the scheme. Were it possible to hold by-law 449-62 valid apart from the final words of s. 3(2) thereof, I would have no hesitation in severing them. However, in view of my opinion that the whole scheme of the said by-law goes beyond the power granted by s. 4 of The City of Ottawa Act, 1960-61, I am of the opinion that it is invalid in toto.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.V.

By way of an aggressive intervention, the Royal Trust also asked for the nullity of the by-law in respect of certain other lots in the same zone and, subsidiarily, that it be declared that it had an acquired right in the commercial and industrial use of such lots and that the said by-law could not affect that use. The only industrial activity which had been carried on in recent years within that zone was a modest lumber business on part of the property in which the Royal Trust was interested. This had ceased three years prior to the adoption of the by-law. No complaint was made against the adoption of the by-law until some ten years after it had been in affect. The trial judge quashed the by-law in so far as the properties in question were concerned on the ground that it constituted a discriminatory, unjust and abusive exercise of the discretion conferred by the statute. That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The municipality appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the action and the intervention dismissed.\nIt is well established that the supervisory powers of the Superior Court under art. 50 of the Cole of Civil Procedure over the acts of municipal councils are only to be exercised under exceptional circumstances. The Court could not merely substitute its opinion for that of the municipal authority. In order to declare null the by-law, the Court must find that, as to the lots in question, there had been discrimination and an abuse of power equivalent to fraud which had caused a flagrant injustice. Admittedly any zoning by-law is discriminatory. The burden of proving fraud or abuse of power was upon the plaintiff, and no such fraud or abuse of power by the municipality has been established.\nAs to the subsidiary argument that the intervenant had an acquired right in the commercial and industrial use of lots held by it and that the by-law could not affect such use, it could not succeed. The by-law provided for the protection of non-conforming use of land at the time it came into force, but if that use was discontinued it could not be resumed at a later date. Consequently, since acquired rights of the intervenant to the commercial or industrial use of these lots, if such existed at the time the by-law came into force, were protected, it was not necessary to intervene in the present action in order to protect them.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Miquelon J. Appeal allowed.\nJean Turgeon, Q.C., and Jacques Drouin, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nFran\u00e7ois de B. Gravel, for the plaintiff, respondent, Sun Oil Co.\nMaurice Gagn\u00e9, Q.C., for the intervenant, respondent, Royal Trust Co.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench2 affirming a judgment of the Superior Court which maintained (1) an action by the respondent Sun Oil Company Limited against appellant declaring illegal, null and void a general zoning by-law of appellant municipality in so far as it concerns beach lot No. 286\u20131 of the Parish of St. Colomban de Sillery, in which respondent Sun Oil claimed an interest and (2) the intervention of the respondent The Royal Trust Company es qualit\u00e9, asking similar conclusions in respect of certain other beach lots in the same area.\nThe relevant facts are not now in dispute. They are fully set out in the judgments below and for the purpose of this appeal can be summarized as follows.\nIn 1949, under the terms of its charter, and in particular the provisions of s. 20 of 11 Geo. VI, c. 90, the appellant adopted a comprehensive zoning by-law No. 267, dividing the whole of the municipality into twenty-four zones. The municipality is situated on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River immediately to the west of the city of Quebec and is largely residential in character, most of the residential area being north of a cliff which borders the river. At the bottom of this cliff is a strip of land running the full extent of the frontage of the municipality, varying in depth from about 100 feet to 500 feet, with the tracks of the Canadian National Railway running quite close to the shore. Beyond these river-front properties there are beach lots extending to low-water mark which are in large part covered twice daily by the tide.\nPrior to the enactment of by-law No. 267, industrial operations had been carried on at various points along these river-front lots and in the alleged interest of preserving the residential character of the city, the by-law classified those sections as industrial where such activities were then being carried on, but the other portions were classified as generally residential allowing various accessory service activities such as grocery stores, service stations, and the like. This resulted in the establishment along the river front of six separate zones, three of which were industrial and three, including the area under consideration, residential.\nThe zone which contains the properties in which the respondents are interested\u2014designated Zone CX\u2014is classed as residential and is some 2800 feet long. The zones to the east and west of Zone CX are classed as industrial and contain a number of oil storage tanks. There are no oil storage tanks in Zone CX and, apart from the railway tracks, the only industrial activity which had been carried on in recent years within that zone, was a modest lumber business on part of the property in which the respondent The Royal Trust Company is interested. This had ceased in 1946 prior to the adoption of the zoning by-law. While these beach lots appear at one time to have been commercially exploited they had not been put to any use for some time prior to the enactment of the zoning by-law. As Montgomery J. has pointed out, if the by-law was valid when enacted, it cannot be rendered invalid by changes in the economic situation that subsequently occurred.\nNo complaint was made by the respondents or the owners of other properties concerned against the adoption of by-law No. 267 until some ten years after it had been in effect. No proceedings were taken by any ratepayer under arts. 411 et seq. of The Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, within the delay provided by the statute, to quash the zoning by-law either in whole or in part.\nThe present proceedings arose out of a desire by the respondent, Sun Oil Company Limited, to construct an oil storage plant and marine terminal on the westerly of the two beach lots in Zone CX, namely lot No. 286\u20131, having a superficial area of 1,075,000 square feet. It had entered into an undertaking, on September 13, 1958, to purchase the said lot from the then owner, the mise-en-cause Bushenbaum, for the sum of $50,000 provided it could obtain the necessary permits and licenses to construct such a plant. Bushenbaum had purchased the property for $15,000 in 1953, over three years after the enactment of the zoning by-law.\nOn March 31, 1958, the Sun Oil Company Limited also made an offer to the other respondent, The Royal Trust Company, to purchase the other half of the beach lot area, lot No. 270\u20132 having an approximate superficial area of 900,000 square feet\u2014and three other lots to the north of the railroad, namely Nos. 270\u20131, 271 and 273, as well as three deep-water lots, for the sum of $150,000, under a similar condition that they could build thereon an oil storage plant.\nApplications for permits were made to the appellant municipality and refused by reason of the provisions of its by-law No. 267. The Sun Oil's offer to The Royal Trust Company expired, but its interest in Lot No. 286\u20131, owned by Bushenbaum, persists, and on January 9, 1959, Sun Oil took the present action to have the by-law declared null and void in so far as Lot No. 286\u20131 was concerned.\nThe respondent, The Royal Trust Company, as the testamentary executor of the Estate of the late Dame Margaret Alleyn, widow of the late Hon. John Sharpies, the owner of lots 270\u20131, 270\u20132, 271, 272 and 273, by its aggressive intervention also asked that the zoning by-law be declared null and void in so far as the said five lots were concerned and, subsidiarily, that it be declared that it had an acquired right in the commercial and industrial use of such lots, and that the said by-law could not affect that use.\nThe learned trial judge maintained both the main action and the intervention, held that the zoning by-law constituted, in respect of the beach lots 286\u20131, 270\u20131, 270\u20132 and 273, a discriminatory, unjust and abusive exercise of the discretion conferred by the statute, and he quashed the by-law in so far as those properties are concerned. That judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, Hyde and Montgomery JJ. dissenting.\nThe action and the intervention are based on art. 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads:\nArt. 50. Excepting the Court of King's Bench, the Courts within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Quebec, and bodies politic and corporate within the Province are subject to the supervision and reforming power of the Superior Court, in such manner and form as by law provided, save in matters declared by law to be of the exclusive competency of such courts, or of anyone of the latter, and save in cases where the jurisdiction resulting from this article is excluded by some provision of a general or special law.\nIt is well established that the supervisory powers of the Superior Court under that article over the acts of municipal councils and other like bodies, are only to be exercised under exceptional circumstances. The Court cannot merely substitute its opinion for that of the municipal authority. The relevant principles were succinctly stated by Pratte J. in La Corporation de St. Joseph de Beauce v. Lessard3:\nLe champ d'application de l'art. 50 C.P. a \u00e9t\u00e9 si souvent explor\u00e9 qu'il serait fastidieux de passer en revue les nombreux arr\u00eats auxquels il a donn\u00e9 lieu et qui en ont fix\u00e9 les limites. Rappelons seulement que, suivant une jurisprudence constante, il y a lieu \u00e0 l'action de l'art. 50 C.P., \u00e0 l'encontre des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s municipaux, dans le cas d'exc\u00e8s de pouvoirs, dans le cas de fraude, et aussi lorsqu'une violation de la loi ou un abus de pouvoir \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 fraude a pour effet une injustice flagrante.\nApplying these principles to the present case, in order to declare null the decision taken by the appellant as expressed in its by-law No. 267, the court must find that, as to the lots in which the respondents are concerned, there had been discrimination and an abuse of power equivalent to fraud which had caused a flagrant injustice.\nAdmittedly any zoning by-law is discriminatory in the sense that it forbids the construction of certain types of buildings, or the carrying on of certain activities in a zoned area, and permits others. That result flows from the exercise of the statutory authority to enact zoning by-laws in the public interest. As my brother Judson stated in Township of Scarborough v. Bondi4:\nThe mere delimitation of the boundaries of the area affected by such a by-law involves an element of discrimination. On one side of an arbitrary line, an owner may be prevented from doing something with his property which another owner, on the other side of the line, with a property which corresponds in all respects except location, is free to do.\nSimilarly in Canadian Petrofina Limited v. Martin and City of St. Lambert5, my brother Fauteux after discussing the decision of the Privy Council in City of Toronto v. Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools of Toronto6, said at p. 458:\nWhat was then said by Lord Cave may be stated concisely as follows, for the purpose of this case. The whole object and purpose of a zoning statutory power is to empower the municipal authority to put restrictions, in the general public interest, upon the right which a land owner, unless and until the power is implemented, would otherwise have to erect upon his land such buildings as he thinks proper. Hence the status of land owner cannot per se affect the operation of a by-law implementing the statutory power without defeating the statutory power itself. Prior to the passing of such a by-law the proprietary rights of a land owner are then insecure in the sense that they are exposed to any restrictions which the city acting within its statutory power may impose.\nThe burden of proving fraud or abuse of power was upon the respondents, and for the reasons which they have given I share the view expressed by Hyde and Montgomery JJ. that no such fraud or abuse of power by the municipal council of appellant municipality has been established. As a subsidiary argument counsel for the respondent, The Royal Trust Company, submitted that it had an acquired right in the commercial and industrial use of the lots held by it and that the zoning by-law could not affect such use. This argument was based primarily upon a text of by-law No. 267 containing in s. 73 a definition of \"use\", which in the French version reads:\nUSAGE.\u2014L'objet pour lequel un terrain, un b\u00e2timent, une structure ou ses d\u00e9pendances sont employ\u00e9s, occup\u00e9s ou destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9s ou occup\u00e9s.\nIn referring to this definition Hyde J. cited a text which did not include the words \"un terrain\", and this difference was pointed out by my brother Fauteux at the hearing before us. It is now conceded that the official text of the by-law does not contain the words \"un terrain\" in s. 73.\nThe words \"destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9s ou occup\u00e9s\", in s. 73, clearly refer to a building in course of construction but not yet completed. This interpretation is consistent with the terms of s. 351 of the by-law. That section provides that a building, which at the coming into force of the by-law, is used or destined to be used for a purpose prohibited under the by-law, shall not be enlarged, rebuilt or structurally altered unless thereafter it is used for a permitted purpose.\nNon-conforming use of land at the time the zoning by-law came into force is protected under s. 352, but if that use is discontinued it may not be resumed at a later date. Acquired rights of The Royal Trust Company to the commercial or industrial use of the beach lots, if such existed at the time the by-law came into force, are protected under s. 352. It was not necessary to intervene in the present action in order to protect them.\nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as for those of Hyde and Montgomery JJ., with which I am in respectful agreement I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action and the intervention. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: J.

Of the three men involved in the robbery, two wore masks and one was disguised in a Santa Claus suit. One of the masked men was, by his own admission, one Fournel, who testified on behalf of the Crown and who identified the appellant as the man dressed as Santa Claus. The accused submitted a defence of alibi. The conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

In the course of a fight with the victim, the appellant was knocked down or fell down and his head struck the pavement. The victim had started to walk away when the appellant, having regained his feet, followed him and stabbed him fatally with a knife. Some of the witnesses observed that when the appellant got up he staggered and appeared to be dazed. The appellant advanced the defence of automation. This defence was supported by a psychiatrist who had not examined the appellant until more than three months after the incident but who had attended his trial and listened to all the evidence as to the appellant\u2019s head injury and his behaviour immediately after receiving it. The expert was not asked hypothetical questions but on the contrary was invited to express his opinion based on the evidence which he had heard. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that this evidence was inadmissible and should not have been accepted by the trial judge even though no objections were taken by the Crown at the trial. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of acquittal restored.\nProvided that the questions are so phrased as to make clear what the evidence is on which an expert is being asked to found his conclusion, the failure to put such questions in hypothetical form does not of itself make the answers inadmissible. It is within the competence of the trial judge in any case to insist upon the foundation for the expert\u2019s opinion being laid by way of hypothetical question if he feels this to be the best way in which he can be assured of the matter being fully understood by the jury, but this does not mean that the judge is necessarily precluded from permitting the expert\u2019s answer to go before the jury if the nature and foundation of his opinion have been clearly indicated by other means. In the present case there was no difficulty in concluding that the psychiatrist was proceeding on the hypothesis that the appellant\u2019s blow on the head and his conduct after receiving it were as described by the uncontradicted evidence of the Crown witnesses, and that his condition as to amnesia, headaches and other symptoms was the condition which the appellant himself described. Where the evidence is open to the construction that the premises upon which the expert\u2019s opinion is based were clearly presented to the jury, a Court of Appeal should be hesitant to interfere with the ruling made by the trial judge as to the admissibility of that opinion. All those concerned with the conduct of this trial were satisfied that a proper basis had been laid for the admission of the doctor\u2019s opinion. Under these circumstances a Court of Appeal should, before excluding an expert\u2019s opinion, be able to make a clear finding that there was no material before the jury to enable it to determine whether his conclusions were properly founded or not. Such a finding was not justified in the present case. The trial judge was justified in proceeding on the assumption that the hypothesis on which the psychiatrist based his opinion had been made clear to the jury and he was accordingly justified in admitting the evidence of that opinion and commenting on it as he did.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside a verdict of acquittal on a charge of non-capital murder and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nA. Maloney, Q.C., for the appellant,\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought pursuant to s. 597 (2) of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 setting aside the verdict of a jury which had acquitted the present appellant of the non-capital murder of one Hairedin Gafi and directing that there be a new trial on the ground that certain evidence given by a psychiatrist who was called by the defence was inadmissible and that the trial judge was in error in accepting it and dealing with it as he did.\nAt the trial a number of Crown witnesses testified that they were present on Dundas Street in the City of Toronto on the afternoon of June 6, 1963, and there watched the course of a fight between Gafi and the appellant which culminated in the appellant stabbing Gafi fatally in the neck. Although the stories of the eye witnesses differ as to the details of the affray, it is clear that blows were exchanged between the two men, that the appellant was knocked down or fell down striking his head forcibly on the pavement and that Gafi had started to walk away when the appellant, having regained his feet, followed him and pulled out a knife with which he delivered the fatal blow. Two of the onlookers observed that when the appellant got up he staggered and appeared to be dazed, and one police officer also commented on his apparently dazed condition, but the other witnesses to the fight made no observation in this regard.\nThe defence advanced at the trial on behalf of the appellant was that the blows to his head sustained when it struck the sidewalk had the effect of depriving him of all voluntary control over his actions so that he acted as an automaton for a period which included the time when he stabbed Gafi, and that he was therefore not legally responsible for his actions at that time. This defence was supported by the evidence of Dr. Ronald Stokes, a psychiatrist and an Assistant to the Director of the Forensic Clinic at the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital, who had not examined the appellant until more than three months after the incident but who had attended his trial and listened to all the evidence as to the appellant\u2019s head injury and his behaviour immediately after receiving it.\nThe reasons for the Court of Appeal rejecting this evidence as inadmissible are well summarized in the decision rendered on behalf of that Court by Porter C.J.O. in which he said:\nCounsel for the accused did not follow the established practice of putting to the expert witness a hypothetical question upon which he could properly base an expert opinion, but asked the expert questions concerning his view of evidence given by witnesses. Dr. Stokes, in fact was improperly permitted to express an opinion based on his own assessment of the evidence. No objections were taken by counsel for the Crown to this evidence, and the trial judge raised no objections, and admitted the evidence without question or argument. In his charge the trial judge discussed this evidence and treated it as if it had been properly admitted, and suggested that the jury should give it a good deal of consideration. Indeed, the evidence of Dr. Stokes was the only evidence that in any way touched upon the subject of automation.\nand he continued:\n\u2026I am of the opinion that the evidence as presented by Dr. Stokes was inadmissible and the learned trial judge was in error in accepting it and dealing with it in his charge in the way that he did.\nThe question of whether or not an accused person was in a state of automatism so as not to be legally responsible at the time when he committed the acts with which he is charged, is a question of fact, and indeed may be the most vital question of fact in a criminal case, and it is because the opinion of an expert witness on such a question can serve only to confuse the issue unless the proven facts upon which it is based have been clearly indicated to the jury that the practice has grown up of requiring counsel, when seeking such an opinion, to state those facts in the form of a hypothetical question. In cases where the expert has been present throughout the trial and there is conflict between the witnesses, it is obviously unsatisfactory to ask him to express an opinion based upon the evidence which he has heard because the answer to such a question involves the expert in having to resolve the conflict in accordance with his own view of the credibility of the witnesses and the jury has no way of knowing upon what evidence he based his opinion. Where, however, there is no conflict in the evidence, the same difficulty does not necessarily arise and different considerations may therefore apply.\nIn M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case[2], certain questions were put by the House of Lords to the judges of England and amongst these was the following:\nCan a medical man conversant with the disease of insanity, who never saw the prisoner previously to the trial, but who was present during the whole trial and the examination of all the witnesses, be asked his opinion as to the state of the prisoner\u2019s mind at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, or his opinion whether the prisoner was conscious at the time of doing the act that he was acting contrary to the law, or whether he was labouring under any and what delusion at the time?\nThis question, which appears to me to be singularly apt to the present circumstances, was answered by Tindal C.J., as follows:\nIn answer thereto, we state to your Lordships, that we think the medical man, under the circumstances supposed, cannot in strictness be asked his opinion in the terms above stated, because each of those questions involves the determination of the truth of the facts deposed to, which it is for the jury to decide, and the questions are not mere questions upon a matter of science, in which case such evidence is admissible. But where the facts are admitted or not disputed, and the question becomes substantially one of science only, it may be convenient to allow the question to be put in that general form, though the same cannot be insisted on as a matter of right.\nIn answer to the same question, Mr. Justice Maule, who expressed a separate opinion, indicated what in my view is the true reason for excluding such a question when he said:\nSupposing there is nothing else in the state of the trial to make the questions suggested proper to be asked and answered, except that the witness had been present and heard the evidence; it is to be considered whether that is enough to sustain the question. In principle it is open to this objection, that as the opinion of the witness is founded on those conclusions of fact which he forms from the evidence, and as it does not appear what those conclusions are, it may be that the evidence he gives is on such an assumption of facts as makes it irrelevant to the inquiry.\nIn Regina v. Francis[3], the very question which had been asked of the judges in the M\u2019Naghten Case was considered by Baron Alderson and Cresswell J. Baron Alderson was of opinion that the question should not be put at all and that the decision in M\u2019Naghton\u2019s Case was wrong; but Cresswell J., although apparently concurring in the result, is reported to have observed that the answer in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case went no further than deciding \u201cthat the question could not be put as a matter of right\u201d. This latter view appears to be shared by leading text writers. (See Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed., para. 1298, and Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, 2nd ed., para. 149, Note 3 at page 452.\nThe case of R. v. Holmes,[4] is illustrative of the fact that the opinion of experts on the very question at issue can be elicited without the aid of a hypothetical question if the basis for the opinion is made apparent to the jury. In that case the expert who had examined the accused before the trial was questioned as to his opinion based on his behaviour after the alleged murder had been committed. The manner in which the evidence was introduced and the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England are well described in the reasons for judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., at page 324 where he said:\nIn the present case the appellant, after a savage attack on the murdered person, went to a police station, gave himself up, said he was giving himself up for murder, and gave a detailed account of what he had done and how he had done it. A medical witness who was called for the defence, was asked in cross-examination:\nYou remember that I asked you the question whether the accused\u2019s conduct immediately after this incident would indicate to you that he knew the nature of the act that he was committing and your reply was \u2018Yes\u2019. That is so, is it not? A.\u2014Yes. Q.\u2014Would his conduct immediately after indicate equally that he knew his conduct was contrary to the law of the land. A.\u2014Yes.\nCounsel for the appellant has submitted that those questions were inadmissible. Whatever fine distinctions may have been drawn in days before or soon after M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, we can only say that no member of the court has ever heard an objection being taken to such questions as those. Moreover, if the objection prevailed, it would, as it seems to us, put an insuperable difficulty in the way of the defence whenever they were trying to establish insanity. For instance, if a medical witness could not be asked whether the defendant\u2019s conduct immediately after the act in respect of which he was charged indicated that he knew his conduct was contrary to the law of the land, the doctor being prepared to answer \u201cNo\u201d, it would be a great hardship on the defendant who was setting up a plea of insanity if the doctor was not to be allowed to answer that question. It seems to the court that that is essentially a question that may be asked and answered.\nIn commenting on what he described as \u201cthe orthodox and accepted theory of the hypothetical question in our law\u201d, the learned editor of Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., summarized the matter in para. 672 at page 793 in the following language:\nThe key to the situation, in short, is that there may be two distinct subjects of testimony,\u2014premises, and inferences or conclusions; that the latter involves necessarily a consideration of the former; and that the tribunal must be furnished with the means of rejecting the latter if upon consultation they determine to reject the former, i.e. of distinguishing conclusions properly founded from conclusions improperly founded.\nProvided that the questions are so phrased as to make clear what the evidence is on which an expert is being asked to found his conclusion, the failure of counsel to put such questions in hypothetical form does not of itself make the answers inadmissible. It is within the competence of the trial judge in any case to insist upon the foundation for the expert opinion being laid by way of hypothetical question if he feels this to be the best way in which he can be assured of the matter being fully understood by the jury, but this does not, in my opinion, mean that the judge is necessarily precluded in the exercise of his discretion in the conduct of the trial from permitting the expert\u2019s answer to go before the jury if the nature and foundation of his opinion has been clearly indicated by other means.\nIn the present case there does not appear to me to be any difficulty in concluding that in giving his opinion Dr. Stokes was proceeding on the hypothesis that the appellant\u2019s blow on the head and his conduct after receiving it were as described by the uncontradicted evidence of Crown witnesses, and that his condition as to amnesia, headaches and other symptoms was the condition which he himself described.\nAs he was required to do, the learned trial judge made it clear to the jury that they were not bound to accept the evidence upon which the doctor based his opinion or the opinion itself when he said: \u201cYou may accept or reject the evidence of any witness in whole or in part and that applies to the experts\u2014in this case the doctor\u2014as it does to all other evidence\u201d.\nIf the jury disbelieved Bleta\u2019s story of amnesia and headaches, it would undoubtedly affect the weight which they attached to Dr. Stokes\u2019 evidence, but the possibility of this happening does not, in my view, in any way affect the admissibility of that evidence.\nIn the same way the evidence of Dr. Golab, who saw the appellant some five and a half hours after the fight and pronounced him to be then quite normal and well-oriented, might well have been viewed as substantially weakening the force of Dr. Stokes\u2019 opinion, based as it was in such a large degree upon hypotheses rather than personal examination, but this would reflect on the reliability rather than the admissibility of the Stokes evidence.\nAs has been indicated, the decision as to whether a sufficient basis has been laid for the admission of an expert opinion rests in each case in the discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which is dependant upon many factors, all of which may not be fully appreciated by a court of appeal which is confined to the printed record of the proceedings in its reconstruction of the atmosphere existing at the trial. For this reason, in cases where the evidence is open to the construction that the premises upon which the expert opinion is based were clearly presented to the jury, a court of appeal should, in my opinion, be hesitant to interfere with the ruling made by the trial judge as to the admissibility of that opinion. It is particularly noteworthy that in the present case Crown counsel not only took no objection to the admissibility of the evidence, but without framing a hypothetical question of any kind himself, elicited a much more detailed opinion from the doctor than had theretofore been given as to the nature of the appellant\u2019s injury. This appears to me to be clear confirmation of the fact that all those concerned with the conduct of the trial who saw and heard the witnesses were satisfied that a proper basis had been laid for the admission of the doctor\u2019s opinion. Under these circumstances it seems to me that, before excluding an expert\u2019s opinion, a court of appeal should be able to make a clear finding that there was no material before the jury to enable it to determine whether his conclusions were properly founded or not. I do not, with respect, consider that such a finding is justified in the present case.\nIn instructing the jury the learned trial judge, as I have pointed out, told them that they were free to reject the evidence of the doctor in whole or in part, he indicated to them that the doctor\u2019s opinion was based on the evidence of the appellant\u2019s amnesia and the blow to his head, he reviewed the evidence as to his staggering and dazed condition and concluded by saying:\nOn the issue of automatism I come now to the important evidence of Dr. Ronald Stokes. He is an experienced psychologist, he examined the accused and heard all of the important evidence at this trial. His evidence is not contradicted and while you may still refuse to accept it you should most certainly give it a good deal of consideration. The considered opinion of Dr. Stokes in this case is that the accused was so affected by the blow on the head that he suffered a brain injury temporary in nature but which caused amnesia, which is a loss of memory, and which in turn makes it impossible for him to give anyone an accurate account of what happened although he may attempt to do so, as he did.\nLater in his charge, the learned trial judge continued:\n\u2026the doctor says that the actions of the accused when he stabbed the deceased were purely automatic and without any volition on the part of the accused. He was, in fact, in the condition of a sleep walker or an epileptic. During this seizure, and since he had been in a fight, he automatically continued it. If you accept that evidence, then as I have told you, the law is that the accused is not guilty of anything.\nDr. Stokes considered all of the circumstances and the actions of the accused both before and after his arrest and gives as his opinion, and without doubt on his part, that this is a true case of automatism. It is for you to decide whether the evidence of Dr. Stokes should be accepted or rejected.\nWith the greatest respect for the views expressed by The Court of Appeal for Ontario, I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge was justified in proceeding on the assumption that the hypothesis on which Dr. Stokes based his opinion had been made clear to the jury and that he was accordingly also justified in admitting the evidence of that opinion and commenting on it as he did.\nIn view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to consider the other points raised in support of this appeal.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the verdict of the jury acquitting the accused and the order of the learned trial judge made pursuant thereto.\nAppeal allowed and verdict of acquittal restored.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Moloney & Hees, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

The appellant school board acquired a school site in March of 1959 and built on it a one\u2011room school which came into use in December 1959. In December 1961 the board ceased to use the building as a school. From that date the building remained vacant and was not used for any purpose. On July 31, 1962, the respondent township entered the lands and building on the collector\u2019s roll as having ceased to be exempt from taxation for the balance of the year 1962, and further, assessed the lands and building for the year 1963 as taxable property.\nAn application was made by the board to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order declaring that the lands in question were exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of The Assessment Act. The Chief Justice of the High Court made this declaration. His judgment was reversed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. An appeal was then brought to this Court pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (JUDSON J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Hall and Spence JJ.: The appellant\u2019s lands, although unoccupied, were exempted from taxation by the plain words of clause 9 of s. 4 of The Assessment Act, it not having been shown that it was \u201cotherwise provided in this or any other Act\u201d. The circumstance that, because the condition prescribed as to use had not been fulfilled, the wording of clause 4 was not apt to entitle the appellant to exemption under that clause fell short of providing that it shall not be entitled to exemption under the plain words of clause 9, the application of which depends on ownership and not upon use.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: Paragraph 9 of s. 4 of The Assessment Act was amended in 1962 by the addition of the words \u201cand except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act\u201d. Exemption was thus given to the property of a school board except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act. This put the two assessments with which this appeal was concerned under para. 4 of s. 4, as that was the only possible reference to anything otherwise provided in this Act.\nThe result was that para. 9 does not operate to confer exemption in two cases: (a) Where public utility commissions and municipal parking authorities are concerned. These are subject to s. 43 of the Act; (b) Where the case falls within para. 4 of s. 4 for there it is otherwise provided. Therefore, under para. 4 of s. 4, if buildings and grounds cease to be used and occupied as a school, they lose their exemption.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nD.F. McDonald, Q.C., and J.W. Morden, for the appellant.\nH. Turkstra, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by CARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014There is no dispute as to the facts out of which this appeal arises.\nIn March 1959, the appellant purchased the lands which the respondent seeks to tax and later in that year erected thereon a one-room school for the teaching of all eight grades of elementary education. Until December 1961, the lands and building were used and occupied by the appellant as a school. On the last-mentioned date the teacher employed at the school left the appellant\u2019s employment and the students of the school were transferred elsewhere. Since then the school has remained closed and the lands and building have not been used for any purpose. They are not leased to anyone but continue in the appellant\u2019s ownership.\nThe respondent has taken the necessary steps to assess and tax these lands if, on the true construction of The Assessment Act, they are liable to taxation.\nThe appellant applied by originating notice to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order declaring that the lands in question were exempt from taxation. The motion was heard by McRuer C.J.H.C. who made the order asked for without recorded reasons.\nThe Court of Appeal1, by a majority, reversed this order and directed that the originating motion be dismissed with costs throughout. Kelly J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal with costs.\nThe appellant appeals to this Court pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal. The operative part of the order granting leave reads as follows:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER that leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the Order of this Court made on June 5th, 1963, be and the same is hereby given on condition that, regardless of the outcome of the said appeal, no costs of the said appeal shall be awarded against the Respondent, The Corporation of the Township of Seneca.\nIn this Court, for the first time, counsel for the respondent sought to raise the objection that the proceedings were not properly commenced by way of originating notice. The Court over\u2011ruled this objection at the hearing, being of opinion that the case falls within the terms of R. 612(1)(b) reading as follows:\n612(1) Where the rights of the parties depend,\u2026\n(b) upon undisputed facts and the proper inference from such facts, such rights may be determined upon originating notice. The relevant provisions of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, as amended, in force at the time at which the rights of the parties are to be determined, are as follows:\n4. All real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation, subject to the following exemptions from taxation:...\n4. The buildings and grounds of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of a university, high school, public or separate school, whether vested in a trustee or otherwise, so long as such buildings and grounds are actually used and occupied by such institution, but not if otherwise occupied.\n(a) The exemption from taxation under this paragraph does not apply to lands rented or leased to an educational institution mentioned in this paragraph by any person other than another such institution.\n* * *\n9. Subject to section 43 and except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act, the property belonging to any county or municipality or vested in or controlled by any public commission or local board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act, including a municipal parking authority, wherever situate and whether occupied for the purposes thereof or unoccupied but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee.\nThe wording of clause 4 of the exemptions has remained unaltered for some years but clause 9 has recently been twice amended.\nIn R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, it read as follows:\n9. Subject to section 43, the property belonging to any county or municipality or vested in or controlled by any public commission, including a municipal parking authority, wherever situate and whether occupied for the purposes thereof or unoccupied but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee.\nBy s. 1(2) of c. 4 of the 1960-61 Statutes, the words \u201cor local board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act\u201d were inserted after the word \u201ccommission\u201d; and by s. 1 of c. 6 of the 1961-62 Statutes the words \u201cand except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act\u201d were inserted after \u201c43\u201d.\nIt is common ground that the appellant is a \u201clocal board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act\u201d; the lands sought to be taxed are vested in and controlled by it and therefore, although unoccupied, are exempted from taxation by the plain words of clause 9 unless it can be shewn that it is \u201cotherwise provided in this or any other Act\u201d. Counsel for the respondent submits that it is otherwise provided by clause 4 of the exemptions; this submission found favour with the majority in the Court of Appeal but I am unable to agree with it. The words of clause 4 of the exemptions do not impose taxation on anything, they prescribe an exemption from taxation of buildings and grounds conditional upon their being used and occupied for certain educational purposes; their application depends primarily on use rather than ownership. The words which impose taxation are the opening words of s. 4 which have already been quoted: \u201cAll real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation subject to the following exemptions from taxation:\u201d When the section is read as a whole it is clear that these opening words impose taxation only upon such real property in Ontario as does not fall within any of the eighteen exempting clauses; they do not impose it on the appellant\u2019s lands because those lands are exempt by the words of clause 9. The circumstance that, because the condition prescribed as to use has not been fulfilled, the wording of clause 4 is not apt to entitle the appellant to exemption under that clause appears to me to fall short of providing that it shall not be entitled to exemption under the plain words of clause 9, the application of which depends on ownership and not upon use.\nFor these reasons I have reached the conclusion that clause 9 of the exemptions governs this case as it has not been shewn that it is otherwise provided in The Assessment Act or in any other Act.\nI would allow the appeal, restore the order of McRuer C.J.H.C. and direct that the appellant recover its costs in the Court of Appeal from the respondent; in view of the terms of the order granting leave to appeal I would make no order as to costs in this Court.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant trustees acquired a school site in March of 1959 and built on it a one-room school which came into use in December 1959. In December 1961 they ceased to use the building as a school. From that date the building remained vacant and was not used for any purpose. On July 31, 1962, the respondent township entered the lands and building on the collector\u2019s roll as having ceased to be exempt from taxation for the balance of the year 1962, and further, assessed the lands and building for the year 1963 as taxable property. In these proceedings the trustees are claiming a declaration that the land and premises are not liable to assessment and taxation. The Chief Justice of the High Court made this declaration. His judgment was reversed on appeal, Kelly J.A. dissenting. The appeal comes to this Court pursuant to leave granted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.\nSection 4 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, provides as follows: \u201cAll real property in Ontario is liable to assessment and taxation, subject to the following exemptions from taxation:\u201d Then follow 18 paragraphs setting out the exemptions. The first one that requires consideration is para. 4, which reads:\n4. The buildings and grounds of and attached to or otherwise bona fide used in connection with and for the purposes of a university, high school, public or separate school, whether vested in a trustee or otherwise, so long as such buildings and grounds are actually used and occupied by such institution, but not if otherwise occupied.\nIt is common ground that but for an amendment made to a subsequent paragraph in 1961, the case would fall to be decided under this paragraph and that the taxes for the year 1962, based upon the additional assessment of July 31, 1962, would be payable, and also for the year 1963.\nHowever, the trustees contend that an amendment to para. 9 of s. 4 enacted in the year 1961 produces a different result. Subsection 9, as amended by 1960-61 (Ont.), c. 4, s. 1, reads:\n9. Subject to section 43, the property belonging to any county or municipality or vested in or controlled by any public commission or local board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act, including a municipal parking authority, wherever situate and whether occupied for the purposes thereof or unoccupied but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee.\nThe amendment enacted by this legislation was the addition of the underlined words \u201cor local board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act\u201d. The Department of Municipal Affairs Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 98, s. 1(d) includes a school board in the definition of \u201clocal board\u201d. Therefore, immediately following this amendment we have one paragraph of the exemptions saying that this school is not exempt from assessment and taxation because it is no longer used as a school, and another section saying that property belonging to a school board is exempt from taxation. The following year para. 9 was further amended by 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 6, s. 1. It now reads:\n9. Subject to section 43 and except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act, the property belonging to any county or municipality or vested in or controlled by any public commission or local board as defined by The Department of Municipal Affairs Act, including a municipal parking authority, wherever situate and whether occupied for the purposes thereof or unoccupied but not when occupied by a tenant or lessee.\nThe amendment was in the addition of the words \u201cand except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act\u201d. The 1962 amendment came into force on April 18, 1962, a date prior to either of the two assessments with which we are concerned in this appeal.\nThe question for determination is, what did the Legislature do when it gave exemption to the property of a school board except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act? I agree with the majority opinion in the Court of Appeal that this puts these assessments under para. 4 of s. 4. That is the only possible reference to anything otherwise provided in the Act. The result is that\nParagraph 9 does not operate to confer exemption in two cases:\n(a) Where public ultility commissions and municipal parking authorities are concerned. These are subject to s. 43 of the Act;\n(b) Where the case falls within para. 4 of s. 4 for there it is otherwise provided.\nTherefore if buildings and grounds cease to be used and occupied as a school, they lose their exemption.\nI would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by Aylesworth J.A. There should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McKenna & Whelan, Hamilton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Herman Turkstra, Hamilton.\n[1] [1963] 2 O.R. 439, 40 D.L.R.

The accounts of the accident that the two parties gave at the trial were diametrically opposed to one another. The trial judge accepted the plaintiff's evidence and rejected that of the defendant. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial; the Court refused to follow the findings of fact made by the trial judge and it was held that he was wrong in rejecting the evidence of an independent witness. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThere was evidence to support the trial judge's findings that the defendant was on the wrong side of the road just prior to the impact and that the effective cause of the accident was the negligence of the defendant. An examination of the evidence of the independent witness showed that the trial judge was correct in placing little reliance on it.\nIf the judges of an appellate Court cannot be satisfied that the trial judge, with the advantage of having heard and tried the ease, was plainly wrong in his findings of fact, then it is their duty to defer to his judgment. In the present case it could not be said that the trial judge was plainly wrong in his findings of fact. Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways Co., [1919] S.C. (H.L.) 35, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, allowing an appeal from Greschuk J. Appeal allowed.\nJohn Bassie, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 allow- ing an appeal with costs and directing a new trial in respect of a judgment by Greschuk J. in which he had awarded the appellant damages in the sum of $32,967.40 for injuries received and damages sustained as a result of a collision of two motor vehicles, one being driven by the appellant and the other by the respondent.\nThe collision occurred at about 3:45 a.m. on September 3, 1961. Prior to the impact the appellant had been driving in an easterly direction on Highway 16 some 30 miles west of Edmonton in the Province of Alberta. The respondent was driving in a westerly direction on the same highway and they met on a stretch of road just after the appellant's motor vehicle had come out of a slight curve. Highway 16 at this point was 46 feet in width. There were two driving lanes each 13 feet 6 inches in width and on the outside of each of the driving lanes there were parking lanes marked by continuous orange lines.\nThe evidence of the appellant was that he was driving at about 45-50 miles an hour on his own side of the road (the south side) and as he emerged from the curve he became aware that the respondent's vehicle, whose headlights he had previously seen, was coming towards him on the south side. He said it continued on this course until it was directly in front of him, and, in order to avoid a head-on collision, he swung to his left across to the north side of the road. He continued that at this same moment the respondent swung his vehicle to the right and onto the north side of the road and this brought the two vehicles into collision at an angle on the north side of the centre line.\nThe respondent's evidence was that he was driving at about 50 miles an hour on his own side of the road (the north side) and that the appellant emerged from the curve on the north side of the centre line and that the appellant maintained his course on the north side. The respondent further testified that at the time of the impact which he says was virtually head-on, his vehicle was straddling the orange line which was the dividing line between the north lane proper and the parking lane on the north side of the road. He continued that he was endeavouring to get on the north shoulder to avoid the collision which he knew was imminent when he saw that the appellant was maintaining his course in the north lane. These two stories were diametrically opposed to one another. Both could not be true. The learned trial judge had the responsibility of determining which story should be accepted. He believed the appellant. He was impressed with the manner in which the appellant gave his evidence and he found that the appellant's evidence was in harmony and in accordance with the balance of probabilities in the case. He did not accept the evidence of the respondent and found that the respondent was in the south lane a second or so and for some time before the impact occurred. He stated that the evidence of the respondent did not impress him while, on the other hand, he found that the appellant gave his evidence in a truthful and straightforward manner.\nThe Court of Appeal refused to follow the findings of fact made by Greschuk J., and after an analysis of the evidence, concluded that the respondent's version of the collision was the more likely one. Johnson J.A., with whom Porter J.A. concurred, held that the learned trial judge should not have rejected the evidence of one Royce who had testified that the appellant had overtaken him about two minutes prior to the collision, and that at that time the appellant was going in excess of 60 miles an hour. An examination of Royce's evidence leaves me with the view that the learned trial judge was correct in placing little reliance on Royce's evidence. The man told two different stories, first, that he was travelling well within the speed limit which was 50 miles an hour when overtaken by the appellant, and then that he was travelling over the speed limit when overtaken. The learned trial judge had this witness before him and the opportunity to weigh at first hand the effect of Royce's contradictory testimony. It cannot be said that the learned trial judge could not reasonably have come to the conclusion that he did in respect of Royce. There was evidence upon which the learned trial judge could find, as he did find, that the respondent was on the south side of the road just prior to the impact; that the appellant went over to the north side at the last moment and in an attempt to avoid a head-on collision and that the effective cause of the collision was the negligence of the respondent in maintaining his position on the south side of the road until so close to the oncoming vehicle of the appellant that a collision became inevitable. This is a case where the statement of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways Co., Ltd.3, at p. 37:\nIn my opinion, the duty of an appellate Court in those circumstances is for each Judge of it to put to himself, as I now do in this case, the question, Am I\u2014who sit here without those advantages, sometimes broad and sometimes subtle, which are the privilege of the Judge who heard and tried the case\u2014in a position, not having those privileges, to come to a clear conclusion that the Judge who had them was plainly wrong? If I cannot be satisfied in my own mind that the Judge with those privileges was plainly wrong, then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to his judgment.\nis particularly apt.\nI do not think it can be said here that Greschuk J. was plainly wrong in his findings of fact. There was no cross-appeal as to damages. Counsel for the respondent did not ask that the amount awarded be disturbed. I would accordingly allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bassie, Kempo, Hochachka & Shewchuk, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\n1 (1964), 47 W.W.R. 684.\n2 (1964), 47 W.W.R. 684.\n3 [1919] S.C.

In the Court of first instance judgment was given in favour of the various plaintiffs; an appeal from that judgment was allowed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, one member of the Court dissenting. The only point at issue on the appeal to the Appellate Division and on the subsequent appeal to this Court was whether possession of the defendant's vehicle had been acquired by the driver H with the implied consent of the defendant so as to make him liable for H's negligence pursuant to s. 130 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 356. The trial judge was of the opinion that the question of implied consent must be approached from the point of view of the driver, that is whether the driver under all the circumstances would be justified in deeming that he had an implied consent to drive. The Appellate Division criticized this test; the test to be applied was whether the driver had in fact acquired possession of the vehicle with the implied consent of the owner, irrespective of what the driver deemed to have been the situation.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nA consideration of all the evidence led to the conclusion that the trial judge did not clearly draw the wrong inferences or act upon an erroneous principle of law. Accordingly, the trial judge's finding that the driver H had the implied consent of the owner to drive the vehicle in question should not be reversed.\nThe Appellate Division placed too narrow an interpretation on the trial judge's test of implied consent. What the trial judge did was put to himself the question whether all the circumstances were such as would show that the person who was driving had the implied consent of the owner and therefore whether he would have been justified in deeming that he had such consent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain J. holding the owner of a motor vehicle liable for the negligence of the driver. Appeal allowed.\nB. W. Stringam and S. Denecky, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nH. S. Prowse, for the defendant, respondent, Humphrey.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSpence J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 dated August 27, 1963. By that judgment, the majority of the Court (Porter J.A. dissenting) allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Milvain dated January 29, 1963, by which judgment the learned trial judge had given awards in favour of the various plaintiffs in sums totalling $59,686.28. The judgment, however, in favour of the plaintiff Glen Sillito alone exceeded the sum of $10,000. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was made on behalf of all the appellants and by the order of the Chief Justice of this Court of December 5, 1963, such application was directed to come on before the Court immediately preceding the hearing of the appeal of Glen Sillito. Upon the said appeal being called for hearing in this Court, leave to appeal was granted to all the applicants. The only appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was by the defendant Archibald Ashton Humphrey, and the only point at issue upon that appeal or in this Court was whether possession of the appellant's vehicle had been acquired by the driver Harvie, who was killed in the accident which gave rise to the action, with the implied consent of the appellant Humphrey so as to make him liable for Harvie's negligence pursuant to s. 130 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1955 c. 356.\nIn his reasons for judgment, the learned trial judge had said:\nIt is my conception of the meaning of that statute that in dealing with the implied consent it means that one must approach the problem in a somewhat subjective fashion from the point of view of the person who was driving. That is to say whether under all of the circumstances the person, who was driving, would have been justified in deeming that he had an implied consent to drive.\nBoth the judgment of the majority of the Court given by the Chief Justice of Alberta and the dissenting judgment of Porter J.A. criticize this test, adopting the language of McBride J.A. in Stene and Lakeman Construction v. Evans and Thibault3, at p. 600:\nThe test is not the knowledge or belief of the driver for the time being as to who is the true owner [in that case] but lies in the facts and circumstances under which possession was handed over to the true owner, in this case Evans.\nI am of the view that the learned Justices of Appeal interpreted too narrowly the words of the learned trial judge and when he said:\nThat is to say whether under all of the circumstances the person who is driving would have been justified in deeming that he had an implied consent to drive.\nWhat the learned trial judge was doing was putting to himself the question whether all the circumstances were such as would show that the person who was driving had the implied consent of the owner and therefore, of course, whether he would have been justified in deeming that he had such consent. In fact, the learned trial judge did examine with very considerable detail all of the circumstances which go to show whether the driver Harvie had the implied consent of the owner Humphrey to drive the vehicle in question. He had the great additional advantage that he watched the witnesses as they were giving evidence and was able to appreciate the fine nuances of their testimony which cannot be reflected in any printed record. I accept the propositions put by counsel for the appellants in this Court that his finding should not be reversed unless the inferences which he drew were clearly wrong or that he acted on some incorrect principle of law. After having carefully considered all of the evidence, I find that I am in agreement with the view of Porter J.A. that the learned trial judge did not clearly draw the wrong inferences or act upon an erroneous principle of law.\nThe learned trial judge found, as a fact, in these terms:\nNow, the evidence makes it clear that there was a very close and friendly relationship between Humphrey and the deceased Harvie. Harvie was a young man who visited Humphrey on many occasions, and had done so over a number of years. In fact the knowledge one of the other went back into the days of Harvie being but a child, and therefore extended over something in the neighbourhood of 20 years. The evidence makes it clear that on many occasions in the past Harvie had driven Humphrey's car on occasions when Humphrey was with him and on occasions when Harvie was driving it by himself, and in the absence of Humphrey. That comes clear from the evidence of so many people, Cpl. Gingara had seen him driving on at least a couple of occasions, and the O'Hara's, the Darragh's, Netty Harvie, Pete Harvie's father, had all seen Pete Harvie on different occasions driving the car.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge was justified in making that finding of fact from the evidence.\nThe evidence reveals that Harvie, on the day preceding the accident, had come from the home of one Darragh for whom he was working about 200 yards away, to Humphrey's place and had learned that Humphrey's vehicle, which was later involved in the accident, was in bad mechanical condition and that he had worked on Humphrey's car substantially the whole of that day, Friday. This entailed driving into Milk River, a distance of some 25 miles, in his own, Harvie's, car. That Friday evening, Harvie then took Humphrey's car without letting Humphrey know that he was doing so and drove into the village of Coutts, a distance of 20 miles. He returned to Humphrey's farm with his sister, Nettie M. Harvie, and another girl with him, and at that time in the presence of these two young ladies there was no reference by Humphrey to the taking of the car. On the other hand, the conversation seemed to be a pleasant one and Humphrey loaned to Harvie for Harvie's automobile so that his sister could return to the village, not only gasoline but a spare tire.\nOn Humphrey's evidence, after Miss Harvie had left with her friend, he said to the late Peter Harvie:\nI just told him that he shouldn't have taken my car like that, without letting me know.\nThe learned trial judge comments:\nNow that is a very different thing to saying \"You know very well that you have no right to take my car. You were wrong in taking my car. I forbid you from taking my car.\" \"But you were wrong in taking it without telling me.\" Those are words which carry a natural implication when one views a friendly relationship between these two people that \"had you asked me I would have let you have it\".\nThat the remonstrance was mild indeed seems to be demonstrated by the fact that the late Peter Harvie stayed that night in the home of the defendant Humphrey rather than returning the 200 yards to the residence of his employer Darragh, where, of course, all his belongings were. And further, that in the morning when the late Harvie and the defendant Humphrey discovered that two of the tires on Humphrey's automobile were deflated, he, Harvie, walked to Darragh's, borrowed Darragh's car then drove a mile and a half to another friend's to obtain a tire pump, returned, pumped up both tires and then took the pump back to the lender. Thereafter he and the defendant Humphrey drove into the village of Coutts, from there to Milk River and back to the farm. During the time that the two were away, they also stopped to pick up the mail at the post office, pick up a spare tire, go to the bank and to a beverage room. During the whole of this trip, it would appear that the late Harvie drove the automobile and Humphrey rode with him. According to Humphrey's evidence, they returned to his home at about a quarter to one o'clock in the afternoon. Porter J.A., when giving judgment in the Appellate Division, was of the opinion that it must have been some time later than this, an opinion which seems to have considerable weight under the circumstances. While the two were returning from the village in Humphrey's car, a conversation took place and I quote from the evidence:\nQ. Was there any discussion between you and Harvie on the way out from town?\nA. Well, Pete wanted to go to Lethbridge to a dance that night.\nQ. And why did he tell you about it?\nA. Well, the car was in, his car was in Coutts, and it wasn't running, and he wanted me to go with him to the dance in Lethbridge.\nQ. He wanted you to go with him?\nA. Yes.\nQ. To a dance in Lethbridge?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you had been to a dance before with him?\nA. Yes, a week or two before.\nQ. And what did you have to say about going to a dance in Lethbridge on September, on September 16th, 1961?\nA. I said I didn't dance anyway, and the car has gone far enough for one day, and I told him I definitely wasn't going out with the car any more that day.\nUpon their return to the defendant Humphrey's home, Humphrey went in to get dinner, the late Harvie came in and sat in a chair and said nothing. Humphrey proceeded to get dinner about half ready and at that time the late Harvie stood up and walked out and shut the door. When Humphrey had dinner ready, he went outside to see where the late Harvie was and both Harvie and the car had disappeared.\nAs I have said, the defendant Humphrey swore this was about 1:00 p.m.\nJames Dunlop Harvie, the father of the late Peter Harvie, appears to have been the next witness to see the late Peter Harvie and swore that he met him on the road to Coutts between 2:30 and 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that day, and at a point of about 5 or 6 miles outside of Coutts. Coutts is 20 miles from the defendant Humphrey's farm and it is 10 miles from Coutts to Milk River.\nWilliam Oswold, a garageman in Milk River, swore that the late Peter Harvie brought the Humphrey car into his garage around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and there had three tires repaired. There were nails in two of the three tires. The late Peter Harvie charged the repair bill to the defendant Humphrey, although Oswold had not, up to the date of the trial, rendered any account.\nJohn Darragh, the then employer of the late Peter Harvie and the neighbour of the defendant Humphrey, saw the late Peter Harvie at 5:00 o'clock in Milk River at the garage where the tires were repaired, and had certain conversation with him. He later saw Harvie leave Milk River headed toward Coutts at 6:35 p.m.\nBoth the learned trial judge and Porter J.A. in the Court of Appeal considered that the conversation between Darragh and the late Peter Harvie was not evidence against Humphrey. Much of the argument in this Court was devoted to considering that question. I find it unnecessary to decide the question and it is my intention to ignore that conversation in coming to my conclusion.\nThe accident which gave rise to this action occurred a very few moments after the witness Darragh had seen the late Peter Harvie depart from Milk River. It occurred on the northerly limits of the village of Coutts some 10 miles south of Milk River. Cpl. Gingara of the R.C.M.P. investigated the accident and gave evidence that he arrived at the scene at a few minutes after 6:45 p.m. when the cars were still on the highway and the occupants of the plaintiff Sillito's vehicle were still in it. On those facts, the learned trial judge found in these words:\nThis is a fair assumption. Harvie may well have looked out and seen these tires were going flat again, got in the car and drove off. Now at the moment that he did so I am sure that Harvie would quite properly feel that Mr. Humphrey, regardless of what he may have said in the reprimand, would not object to the car being taken by him, Harvie, so that Harvie, in my view, at the moment that he took the car was entitled to assume that he was doing so with the implied consent of Humphrey. I find that was taken under those circumstances, and that therefore Mr. Humphrey as owner of the motor car is rendered liable.\nThe Chief Justice of Alberta in giving the majority judgment for the Appellate Division said:\nIf the owner of a vehicle who has theretofore impliedly consented to a friend acquiring possession of the vehicle revokes the implied consent by reprimanding the friend for having taken the car without his permission and giving what I consider to be a direction to the friend that the car is not to be used by the friend again on a specific day, the owner in my view cannot be taken to have impliedly consented because he did not remove the keys from the car. That he did by his statements on Friday evening and Saturday morning revoke any implied consent theretofore granted, at least to use the car on the day just referred to, is in my view clear.\nOn the other hand, Porter J.A., in his dissenting judgment, said:\nIt is clear from the quoted evidence of Humphrey that Harvie did not contemplate going to the dance in Humphrey's car unless Humphrey went along because Humphrey's refusal was: \"I told him I definitely wasn't going out with the car any more that day\".\nWith all respect, I am of the opinion that Porter J.A. made a more accurate appraisal of the exact words used by the defendant Humphrey in giving his evidence and of the import thereof. It would appear that the late Harvie did not request leave to take from Humphrey the latter's car to go to the dance that Saturday night but rather requested Humphrey to go to the dance with him, Harvie, in Humphrey's car, and that it was not contemplated by either party that Harvie could take the vehicle to go to the dance without Humphrey. It should be noted that the dance was to take place in Lethbridge some 85 miles away from Humphrey's farm. Had Humphrey believed that Harvie had taken the vehicle to go to that dance then Humphrey would not have expected Harvie to return until very late at night. Yet Humphrey swore on examination, and repeated in cross-examination, that he expected Harvie to return to the farm at any time. In cross-examination, Humphrey swore \"I thought sure that he would be back. I didn't know just where he went.\" There may well be significance in the fact that the defendant Humphrey, when he visited the Darragh place, always removed the keys from his car before entering Darragh's home but on arriving back at his own home on the Saturday morning after the conversation in the automobile with the late Harvie in reference to the dance in Lethbridge, he left the keys in the car neither removing them himself nor asking the late Harvie to do so for him.\nUpon this evidence, Porter J. A. concluded:\nIt seems clear that the sole purpose of Harvie's trip to town that afternoon was to have these tires repaired for Humphrey \u2026\nIt seems clear to me that the course of conduct between these two men was such that there was an implied consent by Humphrey to the use by Harvie of his car. This implied consent, of course, could be terminated or denied in specific instances. The appellant relies on the two instances as having revoked any consent express or implied, namely, the mild reprimand for having taken the car on Friday night without asking for it, and the evidence about Humphrey's refusal to go with Harvie to the dance in Lethbridge in Humphrey's car. The latter incident cannot be taken as having anything to do with consent or lack of consent to the use by Harvie of Humphrey's car because Harvie did not then ask for the car, nor, indeed, did Humphrey refuse it to him. Harvie was not using the car on Saturday to go to the dance in Lethbridge, some 80 miles in the opposite direction from that in which he was travelling at the time of the accident. Was the reprimand on the Friday night sufficient to terminate a consent which, in my judgment, had prevailed to that time?\nContemplate the scene at Humphrey's place on Saturday morning\u2014flat tires, no pump, Humphrey's feet preventing him from walking any distance, Harvie's car gone from the farm, Harvie under a duty to return to work at Darragh's. Looking at the state of Humphrey's mind, the only possible solution to his helpless isolation was to send Harvie to town to get the tires fixed. It seems to me that consent can be implied because it is clear that had it been sought it would have been granted as a matter of course. In my opinion the facts and circumstances surrounding the use by Harvie of Humphrey's car on this and other occasions imply consent by Humphrey.\nI am of the opinion that Porter J.A. drew the proper inferences from the evidence and proceeded upon the proper principles of law. I am therefore of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored with costs to the appellants throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Virtue, Russell, Morgan, Virtue & Morrison, Lethbridge; and Stringam, Steele & Denecky, Lethbridge.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Humphrey: Rice, Paterson, Prowse, MacLean, Yanosik & Jacobson, Lethbridge.\n1 (1963), 43 W.W.R. 625, 41 D.L.R.

Limited (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nFranki of Canada Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1964: May 5; 1964: June 10.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContracts\u2014Delay in completion of main contract resulting from performance by subcontractor\u2014Claim for damages against subcontractor\u2014Assessment of damages.\nThe plaintiff took a contract from the Government of Canada to construct a building and employed the defendant to drive the piles. The work done by the defendant was rejected and had to be done again, with the result that there was 4\u00be months\u2019 delay in the completion of the main contract. The plaintiff sued the defendant for damages. Liability having been established, the trial judge referred the assessment of damages to the local master. The latter assessed the damages at $99,598.13 and itemized them under 13 heads. A judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario confirmed the report; the defendant appealed two items, namely overhead and plant. The Court of Appeal reduced the amount allowed for overhead from $16,909.33 to $3,692.10 and that for plant from $7,539.91 to $1,256.66. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Curiam: The plaintiff\u2019s contention that it should be compensated on a commercial rental basis for the plant and equipment during the period of tie-up was rejected. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Court of Appeal was correct in treating the plaintiff\u2019s plant as a nonprofit-earning asset during this period.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Hall and Spence JJ.: The Court of Appeal seemed to have cut out $2,802 per month for 4\u00be months allowed in the overhead and allowed 4.99 per cent on the amount of additional out-of-pocket costs incurred by the plaintiff. In essence, therefore, the Court of Appeal had disallowed any compensation in overhead for the 4\u00be months\u2019 delay. This was not a proper deduction. During the 4\u00be months the overhead costs were continuing to run but the plaintiff was obtaining no revenue from which to defray the overhead costs. The allowance of 4.99 per cent on the direct cost was not a compensation for this delay but was an allowance of the same percentage rate on an item which would not normally have been in the year\u2019s operation. Therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in taking this amount ($13,309.50) from the master\u2019s assessment.\nPer Judson J. dissenting: Although delay resulting from the performance by a subcontractor may well cause loss to the main contractor, such loss of profit arising from inability to accept or to move on to another contract, nothing of that kind was alleged or proved here. Further, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff stayed in business solely for the business of completing this delayed job or with existing overhead made necessary during the period of delay. In the absence of any evidence to support such a claim, the Court of Appeal was right in disallowing the sum of $13,309.50 in the overhead.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from an order of Aylen J. which confirmed a report of the Local Master at Ottawa. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.\nI. Goldsmith and Miss Rose-Marie Perry, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nK.E. Eaton and J.H. Konst, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson and I shall refrain from repeating the statement of facts except insofar as it is concerned with the question of overhead. I am in agreement with my brother Judson\u2019s view as to plant, but I feel that I have come to another conclusion in reference to overhead.\nThe Master assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at a total of $99,598.13 which total included the amount of $16,909.33 for overhead and $7,539.91 for plant. The Master in his reasons for judgment stated:\n7. The method of calculating overhead as advanced by the plaintiff was a proper basis for so doing.\nThe plaintiff contended that overhead was a continuing expense and that as long as one was working on the job overhead was being incurred. He took the figures for the two years over which this job ran, on a percentage basis for the year\u2019s operation of the business and averaged them, arriving at a figure of 4.99%. No definition of overhead was supplied to me. The defendant contended that overhead was part of the contract and once you put in a figure for overhead it never changed, no matter how long you were engaged on the job. It follows that the longer the job takes the more overhead that is incurred. Accordingly I found the plaintiff\u2019s method of calculating overhead a proper one.\nThe amount for plant was arrived at by taking the value of the equipment and buildings tied up on the job for the delay period, at the rate of 5% per month. Counsel for the defendant cited a number of cases on this type of thing, but in my opinion these all referred to the rate to be charged for materials and labour actually expended on a job and not for equipment and buildings tied up on the job. The defendant (here appellant) appealed to a single judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario from the assessment of the Master and that appeal was dismissed by Aylen J. on February 22, 1963. The defendant (here respondent) further appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal by its judgment dated September 10, 1963, allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment reducing the amount allowed for overhead from $16,909.33 to $3,692.10 and reducing the amount allowed for plant from $7,539.91 to $1,256.66. Neither Aylen J. nor the Court of Appeal gave any reasons in writing for their decision and the lack of these reasons has considerably increased the difficulty of the task facing this Court.\nOVERHEAD\nIt would appear, however, and counsel are agreed, that the judgment of the Master for overhead is composed of two items, firstly, 4.99 per cent of the sum of $72,171.06, being the additional out-of-pocket costs incurred by the appellant (plaintiff), equals $3,601.33, plus $2,802 per month for 4\u00be months equals $13,309.50, totalling $16,909.33 (the $1.50 error is unexplained). The 4.99 per cent used as the factor for the overhead was the average of the actual overhead taken as a percentage of direct cost for the fiscal year ending April 3, 1960 (3.35 per cent), and for the fiscal year ending April 3, 1961 (6.64 per cent). The period of 4\u00be months was the additional time required for the completion of the contract due to the failure of the subcontractors (the defendants, respondents) to perform their part thereof.\nThe Court of Appeal seemed to have cut out the $2,802 per month for 4\u00be months allowed in the overhead and allowed 4.99 per cent figuring it on $73,990.56 as the Court increased the direct cost by addition of $1,819.50 \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d.\nIn essence, therefore, the Court of Appeal has disallowed any compensation in overhead for the 4\u00be months\u2019 delay. I have considered the argument made by counsel and I have read the cases cited and I am of the opinion that this is not a proper deduction. The overhead in a year is figured as a percentage of the direct cost and then that percentage is assigned to the direct cost of each individual job. When the job here in question occupied 4\u00be months more of the plain- tiff\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) time then during that 4\u00be months the overhead costs were continuing to run but it was obtaining no revenue from which to defray the overhead costs. The allowance of 4.99 per cent on the extra direct cost is not a compensation for this delay but is an allowance of the same percentage rate on an item which would not normally have been in the year\u2019s operations, and I am therefore of the opinion that the Court of Appeal erred in taking this amount from the Master\u2019s assessment.\nCounsel for the respondent during the argument mentioned a series of calculations which did not appear in the factum. Counsel were permitted additional time to put those calculations in writing and additional time to reply thereto.\nI have perused both the additional figures supplied by the respondent and the appellant\u2019s reply, and I am convinced that the appellant has properly explained the examples submitted by the respondent. Indeed, I agree with the counsel for the appellant that the figures submitted by the respondent have confirmed the respondent\u2019s argument that the 4\u00be month\u2019s delay when, of course, the plaintiff company could not devote its enterprise to other undertakings but when its fixed costs kept running, is largely responsible for the unproductive fiscal year ending on April 3, 1961, and for the very large increase in the percentage of its overhead to direct costs in that year as compared to the previous year.\nI would therefore allow this appeal and increase the amount of the award by $13,309.50. The appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court and of the order of Stewart J. There will be no costs of the appeal to Aylen J. or in the Court of Appeal. There is, of course, no variation in the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014Shore & Horwitz Construction Co. Limited took a contract from the Government of Canada to construct a building in the City of Ottawa for a total contract price of $724,300, the contract to be completed within one year. They employed Franki of Canada Limited to do the pile driving at a price of $57,500, to be completed within 22 days. The piles driven by Franki were totally rejected by inspectors appointed by the Government of Canada. The result of this was that the piles had to be driven again, the whole structure had to be shifted by five feet and there was 4\u00be months\u2019 delay in the completion of the main contract. Shore & Horwitz sued Franki for damages. They established liability and the trial judge referred the assessment of damages to the Local Master at Ottawa. The two relevant paragraphs in the order of reference are:\nTHIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the said Local Master shall assess the loss that the Plaintiff has suffered by reason of the failure of the Defendant to perform the contract referred to in the Statement of Claim and by reason of the failure of the Defendant to complete the work referred to in the letter from the Defendant to the Plaintiff, dated September 15, 1959 (filed as exhibit 1), within twenty-two days.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the said Local Master shall not assess any amount for profit, but shall assess overhead on a proper basis.\nThe Local Master assessed the damages at $99,598.13 and itemized them under 13 heads. Aylen J. confirmed the report and Franki appealed on two items:\n(a) OVERHEAD, $16,909.33\nThe Local Master allowed the sum of $16,909.33 for overhead. Without giving reasons, the Court of Appeal reduced this item to $3,692.10. In spite of the lack of reasons, it is not difficult to trace the principles on which the Court acted. The sum of $3,692.10 was an allowance of 4.99 per cent on $73,990, which was the actual cost of certain additional construction which Shore & Horwitz did and for which Franki was to pay.\nThe disallowed sum of $13,309.50 is claimed by Shore & Horwitz for the delay. They say that when they took the contract, their overhead was established at $2,802 per month for a twelve month period of performance and that because Franki delayed the performance of the contract for a period of 4\u00be months, Franki must pay for that period of delay at the rate originally established of $2,802 per month. This is the sole basis of the claim. Delay resulting from the performance by a subcontractor may well cause loss to the main contractor, such loss of profit arising from inability to accept or to move on to another contract. Nothing of that kind is alleged or proved here. Further, there is no suggestion that Shore & Horwitz stayed in business solely for the purpose of completing this delayed job or with existing overhead made necessary during the period of delay. In the absence of any evidence to support such a claim, the Court of Appeal was right in disallowing the sum of $13,309.50.\n(b) PLANT\nThe Court of Appeal, also without giving reasons, reduced this item from $7,539.91 to $1,256.66. However, there is no dispute that the sum of $1,256.66 was arrived at by giving an allowance at the rate of 10 per cent per annum for a period of 4\u00be months on the value of the plant tied up during this period. This plant consisted of\nTemporary buildings....................................\n$ 3,000\nConstruction equipment..............................\n26,250\nTools..............................................................\n2,497\n$ 31,747\nShore & Horwitz contend that they should be compensated on a commercial rental basis for this plant and equipment which was tied up too long. The Local Master accepted this and allowed them 5 per cent per month for the period of 4\u00be months on the above valuation. It should be made clear that this was an idle plant, not in use on the job and, of course, not capable of profitable use until moved to another job. If Shore & Horwitz thought that they should have compensation on the basis that this was a profit-making asset during the period of the tie-up, they should have given evidence that there was profitable work for this asset to do elsewhere. I think that the Court of Appeal was right in treating this as a non-profit-earning asset during the period of 4\u00be months. The allowance of 10 per cent per annum on the valuation was generous.\nThere is a well established distinction between compensation for loss of use when the property is profit-earning and non-profit-earning: Mayne & McGregor on Damages, 12th ed., pp. 578-590; Street, Principles of the Law of Damages, pp. 203-210. I adopt the statement of Street at p. 207 as a compendious summary:\nWhere the court is not satisfied that a profit would ensue, the plaintiff is reverted to the method for compensating loss of non-profit-earning vessels, i.e., interest, depreciation and maintenance. This rule (and presumably the rest) applies to other forms of property such as contractors\u2019 road-excavating plant [Sunley & Co. Ltd. v. Cunard White Star Ltd., [1940] 1 K.B. 740] and (in Scotland, at least) lorries [Galbraith\u2019s Stores, Ltd. v. Glasgow Corporation, 1958 S.L.T. (Sh. Ct.) 47].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Horwitz, Kertzer & Perry, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n",

Une partie de ce magasin se trouve sur un terrain qui n'appartient pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, mais il a fait l'objet d'une convention entre The Quebec Railway Light and Power Company et Dame Albina Laurendeau-Plourde le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1949.\nEn 1957 est intervenu l'acte de vente invoqu\u00e9 par la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e en vertu duquel cette derni\u00e8re a achet\u00e9 de Canadian National Railway Company une bande de terrain d'une largeur de 50 pieds, le long de la voie ferr\u00e9e.

Certes vous daignerez la lire avec soin.\nVeuillez nous avertir de vos intentions avant le premier jour de d\u00e9cembre 1959 afin qu'en cas de refus \u00e0 vous conformer aux conditions relatives surtout \u00e0 la vente des objets de pi\u00e9t\u00e9 et des souvenirs dont l'achat sert de droit d'admission \u00e0 visiter le Cyclorama, nous puissions vous signifier officiellement avant le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1959 que nous ne renouvellerons plus le bail vous permettant d'occuper le dit terrain en question par un bout de votre magasin.\nVeuillez nous croire bien v\u00f4tre en J M J A\nL'administration locale des\nR\u00e9demptoristes de Ste-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9.\nPar C.E.M.\n(Note \u00e0 l'encre):\nUne copie fut envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la dite Cie\nle 25 sept. 1959 par lettre enregistr\u00e9e.\nL'appelante n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette lettre, et le 30 novembre 1959, elle recevait un avis des procureurs de l'intim\u00e9e l'avisant que le bail ne serait pas renouvel\u00e9 \u00e0 son expiration le 9 mars 1960. Cet avis adress\u00e9 par les procureurs de l'intim\u00e9e ayant aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9, la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e intenta des proc\u00e9dures en expulsion.\nLes conclusions de son action sont \u00e0 l'effet de confirmer l'expiration et le non-renouvellement du bail intervenu le 23 avril 1953 entre Canadian National Railway Company et Dame Albina Laurendeau-Plourde, renouvel\u00e9 dans le contrat de vente intervenu le 25 mars 1957 entre la demanderesse et la Compagnie de Chemins de Fer Nationaux du Canada, et c\u00e9d\u00e9 post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. L'action demande de plus que par jugement \u00e0 intervenir, il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de quitter les lieux lou\u00e9s et de d\u00e9molir les immeubles qu'elle y a \u00e9rig\u00e9s. Il est aussi demand\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par la d\u00e9fenderesse de se conformer au jugement \u00e0 intervenir dans un d\u00e9lai de trente jours, la demanderesse soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e seule et unique propri\u00e9taire des immeubles construits sur les terrains lou\u00e9s.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le Juge Miquelon, a rejet\u00e9 cette action avec d\u00e9pens, mais son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel2 qui a maintenu l'action de la demanderesse, M. le Juge en chef Tremblay et M. le Juge Choquette ayant enregistr\u00e9 leurs dissidences. Je partage enti\u00e8rement les vues de M. le Juge en chef et de M. le Juge Choquette. Je crois en effet que la question du bail \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par cette Cour dans la cause de Consumers Cordage Co. Ltd. v. St-Gabriel Land & Hydraulic Co. Ltd.3. Je suis \u00e9galement d'avis que M. le Juge Choquette a raison quand il dit:\nNotons que la d\u00e9fenderesse nie l'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 9 de la d\u00e9claration et qu'elle plaide sp\u00e9cialement ce qui suit:\n16. La demanderesse n'a jamais fait signifier, ni donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse un avis de r\u00e9siliation et d'ailleurs la demanderesse n'a pas droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation du bail existant entre les parties;\n17. Le pr\u00e9tendu avis de non-renouvellement du bail en date du 30 novembre 1959 et sign\u00e9 par les avocats Laplante, Gagn\u00e9, Trotier, Letarte et Brown est ill\u00e9gal, informe, non autoris\u00e9, nul et sans effet;\n18. Ce pr\u00e9tendu avis est invalide et nul et ne saurait mettre fin au bail sus-mentionn\u00e9.\nLa clause 7 stipule que l'avis pr\u00e9vu doit indiquer \u00abthe intention of the Lessor so to resume possession of the said premises and to terminate this lease \u2026\u00bb et qu'il doit \u00eatre au moins sign\u00e9 comme suit: \u00aband that every notice to be given by the Lessor \u2026 shall be sufficient if signed by the Vice-President or General Manager of the Lessor, without the seal of the Lessor \u2026\u00bb\nLa lettre P-4 ne fait qu'aviser la d\u00e9fenderesse que son bail \u00abne sera pas renouvel\u00e9 \u00e0 son expiration le 9 mars 1960\u00bb. Ni la lettre ni l'action ne font valoir l'intention de la demanderesse de reprendre possession des lieux et de terminer le bail; selon tous les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la demande, l'avis de non-renouvellement s'identifie avec le pr\u00e9tendu refus de la d\u00e9fenderesse de se conformer \u00e0 la condition relative \u00e0 l'usage des lieux lou\u00e9s. De plus, cet avis n'est sign\u00e9 ni par le Pr\u00e9sident ni par le G\u00e9rant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Corporation demanderesse (ou par celui ou ceux qui en remplissent aujourd'hui les fonctions). Bien plus, ce n'est pas la demanderesse qui a autoris\u00e9 l'envoi de cet avis, mais deux membres de son Conseil d'administration ne formant pas quorum. Voici ce que dit \u00e0 ce sujet le R\u00e9v. P\u00e8re Rondeau:\npp. 123-124:\nR. Voici, le trente novembre au soir, n'est-ce pas, nous avons re\u00e7u un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de Me Letarte et comme il n'y avait que deux directeurs \u00e0 la maison ne formant pas quorum, et qu'il fallait prendre une d\u00e9cision rapide, alors, le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend P\u00e8re Blanchet et moi-m\u00eame sommes deux directeurs de la Corporation \u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nR. \u2026 alors, nous avons autoris\u00e9 monsieur Letarte \u00e0 prendre toutes les directives et toutes les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires.\nLe t\u00e9moin venait de dire ce qui suit:\npp. 122-123:\nQ. Voulez-vous regarder, mon P\u00e8re, au livre des minutes et nous dire si ant\u00e9rieurement au trente (30) novembre mil neuf cent cinquante-neuf (1959), la Corporation demanderesse que vous repr\u00e9sentez a pass\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution pour faire donner un avis de r\u00e9siliation \u00e0 la Corporation d\u00e9fenderesse?\nR. Non.\nQ. Il n'y en a pas?\nR. Non.\nEnfin, je ne puis comprendre, comme d'ailleurs M. le Juge en chef Tremblay l'a dit dans son jugement, que l'acte du 25 mars 1957 stipule que \u00abledit bail se continuera d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e \u2026 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit annul\u00e9 par un avis \u00e9crit du locataire au locateur\u00bb, et que les parties aient \u00e9galement convenu que le bail puisse aussi se terminer par un avis du locateur.\nPour terminer, je crois que les mots que l'on trouve dans le contrat \u00abdont l'achat sert de droit d'admission \u00e0 visiter le Cyclorama\u00bb n'ont pas l'effet de poser une condition \u00e0 la continuation du bail.\nJe suis d'avis de maintenir le pr\u00e9sent appel et de rejeter l'action avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nAppel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de la d\u00e9fenderesse, appelante: L.

L'employ\u00e9 se dirigeait alors vers un h\u00f4tel pour y prendre son repas du soir. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que cet employ\u00e9 cumulait les fonctions de camionneur, garde-chasse, garde-p\u00eache et garde-feu. Il logeait dans un \u00e9tablissement du gouvernement situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e du Parc National. Il lui \u00e9tait loisible de prendre et il prenait habituellement ses repas, qui \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re, \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel en question situ\u00e9 \u00e0 un mille de son \u00e9tablissement. Il pouvait utiliser le camion pour s'y rendre plut\u00f4t que d'y aller \u00e0 pied comme cela lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait en disponibilit\u00e9 vingt-quatre heures par jour pour r\u00e9pondre aux appels de son sup\u00e9rieur, advenant un incendie ou la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une patrouille en for\u00eat. Le soir de l'accident il venait de terminer son travail. L'action fut maintenue par le juge au proc\u00e8s. La Cour d'Appel jugea que l'employ\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 et rejeta l'action. De l\u00e0 le pourvoi devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa question de savoir si, au moment o\u00f9 un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 cause un fait dommageable, il est dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9 en est une dont la d\u00e9termination d\u00e9pend des circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque cas. Rien dans la preuve n'indique que c'\u00e9tait pour revenir plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 son poste que l'employ\u00e9 se servait du camion pour aller prendre ses repas. L'usage qu'il en avait \u00e9tait de l'accommodation. De plus il n'avait pas re\u00e7u d'ordre d'aller souper \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel, ni de prendre le camion pour s'y rendre, ni de faire ce trajet rapidement, ni d'\u00eatre de retour \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re \u00e0 une heure d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Le fait qu'il devait \u00eatre en disponibilit\u00e9 vingt-quatre heures par jour n'implique pas qu'il \u00e9tait vingt-quatre heures par jour dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 et qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas loisible de vaquer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s personnelles, telles que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aller prendre ses repas. Au moment de l'accident, il n'\u00e9tait donc pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. APPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nPierre C\u00f4t\u00e9 et Charles Tremblay, pour le demandeur, appelant.\nPierre de Grandpr\u00e9 et Pierre Marseille, pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLe Juge Fauteux:\u2014Le 21 juin 1958, un samedi soir, vers 7:45 heures, une automobile appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant et par lui conduite sur le boulevard Talbot, en direction sudnord, soit vers Chicoutimi, vint en collision avec un camion, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re des Terres et For\u00eats et alors conduit en direction nord-sud, par un employ\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re, Marcellin Lachance. Cette collision se produisit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s en face de l'h\u00f4tel Trahan, sis \u00e0 l'est du boulevard, o\u00f9 Lachance se dirigeait pour y prendre son repas du soir. Dans le r\u00e9sultat, l'appelant et son \u00e9pouse qui l'accompagnait furent gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9s et leur automobile virtuellement d\u00e9truite.\nTremblay, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de chef de la communaut\u00e9, s'adressa \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 la reine aux droits de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour obtenir le paiement de tous les dommages encourus. Au soutien de sa demande, il all\u00e9gua particuli\u00e8rement que cet accident \u00e9tait exclusivement imputable \u00e0 Lachance et que celui-ci \u00e9tait alors dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. Ni\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9, ces pr\u00e9tentions furent accueillies par le Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui fit droit \u00e0 la demande de Tremblay.\nCe jugement fut port\u00e9 en appel et infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime. La Cour du banc de la reine2 jugea qu'en allant prendre son repas du soir, Lachance faisait exclusivement son affaire et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. Ceci \u00e9tant d\u00e9cisif du litige, la Cour n'eut pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer si Lachance avait commis une faute causant, ou contribuant \u00e0 causer, l'accident. De l\u00e0 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour. Dans ses raisons de jugement, le Juge en chef de la Cour du banc de la reine dispose de certains points pr\u00e9liminaires soulev\u00e9s en appel par Tremblay et subs\u00e9quemment abandonn\u00e9s par celui-ci \u00e0 l'audition devant nous. Sur le motif principal de la d\u00e9cision, M. le Juge en chef ainsi que M. le Juge Hyde concourent dans l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par M. le Juge Rivard.\nLa question de savoir si, au moment o\u00f9 un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 cause un fait dommageable, il est dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9, au sens que cette expression doit recevoir suivant le Droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec, en est une dont la d\u00e9termination d\u00e9pend \u00e9videmment des circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque cause o\u00f9 la question se pr\u00e9sente. Dans des notes tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9es, M. le Juge Rivard fait une revue compl\u00e8te des faits et du droit. Je r\u00e9sume:\u2014 Lachance, employ\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re, cumulait les fonctions de camionneur, garde-chasse, garde-p\u00eache et garde-feu. Il logeait dans un \u00e9tablissement du gouvernement de la province, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re de Stoneham, \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e du Parc National. Il lui \u00e9tait loisible de prendre et il prenait habituellement ses repas, qui \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re, \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel Trahan sis \u00e0 un mille de cet \u00e9tablissement. Il pouvait utiliser le camion pour se rendre \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel Trahan plut\u00f4t que d'y aller \u00e0 pied comme cela lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9. Aux termes de son engagement, il \u00e9tait en disponibilit\u00e9 vingt-quatre heures par jour pour r\u00e9pondre aux appels que Genest, son sup\u00e9rieur, pouvait lui adresser au poste de Stoneham, advenant un incendie ou la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une patrouille en for\u00eat. Ceci ne veut pas dire, cependant, comme l'a pr\u00e9tendu le procureur de l'appelant en invoquant un extrait du t\u00e9moignage de Lachance, que ce dernier devait se tenir vingt-quatre heures par jour \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re de Stoneham. En t\u00e9moignent le fait m\u00eame qu'il devait s'en absenter pour aller prendre ses repas et l'emploi qu'il fit de tout son temps le jour m\u00eame de l'accident. Presque toute la journ\u00e9e, ce jour-l\u00e0, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du poste o\u00f9, en principe, on pouvait le rejoindre. Il avait utilis\u00e9 le camion dans l'avant-midi pour transporter du gravier et, dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi, pour ravitailler diff\u00e9rents postes de garde-feu dans le Parc National. Vers les six heures et demie, il est sorti du bois et est revenu \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re. Son travail \u00e9tait termin\u00e9. Voici d'ailleurs comment lui-m\u00eame s'en exprime:\nQ. Vous avez expliqu\u00e9 que vous \u00eates sorti du bois, si vous voulez, je pr\u00e9sume que ce chemin-l\u00e0 est dans le bois, quand vous allez porter aux postes de garde-feu, vous \u00eates sorti vers les sept heures moins le quart, six heures et demie?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Vous avez expliqu\u00e9 que vous vous \u00e9tiez en venu \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re de Stoneham et que vous vous \u00e9tiez rapport\u00e9 l\u00e0, c'est l\u00e0 que vous aviez un poste o\u00f9 vous deviez vous rapporter?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Et l\u00e0 \u00e0 cet endroit-l\u00e0, \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re de Stoneham, je comprends que votre travail \u00e9tait fini, l\u00e0, vous n'aviez pas d'autre travail \u00e0 faire le soir?\nR. Non, on \u00e9tait juste disponible.\nQ. Mais est-ce que l'on vous a dit: \u00abVous allez faire ci et \u00e7a?\u00bb\nR. Non, monsieur.\nQ. Vous n'aviez rien \u00e0 faire?\nR. Rien.\nQ. Vous \u00eates donc all\u00e9 souper, n'est-ce pas?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nL'appelant a soumis qu'en utilisant le camion pour aller prendre son repas, Lachance pouvait revenir plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 son poste et qu'il agissait ainsi plus ad\u00e9quatement dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de son patron; il en d\u00e9duit qu'il \u00e9tait alors dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. Au regard des circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, cette pr\u00e9tention ne peut \u00eatre retenue. Rien n'indique, en effet, que c'est pour revenir plus t\u00f4t au poste de Stoneham que Lachance se servait du camion pour aller prendre ses repas. L'usage qu'il en avait \u00e9tait de l'accommodation. De plus, comme le signale M. le Juge Rivard, Lachance n'avait pas re\u00e7u d'ordre d'aller souper \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel Trahan, ni de prendre le camion pour s'y rendre, ni faire se trajet rapidement, ni \u00eatre de retour \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re \u00e0 une heure d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Le fait qu'il devait \u00eatre en disponibilit\u00e9 vingt-quatre heures par jour pour r\u00e9pondre aux appels que pouvait lui faire Genest, advenant la d\u00e9claration d'un incendie ou la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une patrouille en for\u00eat, n'implique pas qu'il \u00e9tait vingt-quatre heures par jour dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 et qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas loisible de vaquer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s personnelles\u2014telle la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'aller prendre ses repas\u2014n'entrant pas dans la sph\u00e8re des fonctions \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution desquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\nEn droit et sur la port\u00e9e de l'art. 1054, M. le Juge Rivard r\u00e9f\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement aux arr\u00eats de Curley v.

The only eyewitness to the accident was the defendant, and his account of what happened was vague and confused. Having refused to accept the defendant's evidence, the trial judge relied upon inferences drawn from the circumstances and upon theories advanced by two expert witnesses. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had not satisfied the burden of proof which was hers and consequently set aside the judgment. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright and Spence JJ.: The duty of the Appeal Court was to consider whether the trial judge, who had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, had come to a conclusion which could not have been reached by a reasonable man. In civil proceedings, the party who has the burden of proof is not called upon to establish his allegations so rigorously as to leave no room for doubt. It is sufficient if he has produced such a preponderance of evidence as to show that the conclusion he sought to establish was the most probable of the possible views of the facts. In this case, the trial judge who had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses and who carefully considered all the evidence, including the direct evidence of the defendant, the evidence as to the circumstances, and the opinion of the experts, had weighed the probabilities and had come to a conclusion which was a reasonable one.\nPer Fauteux and Abbott JJ., dissenting: Where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a Court of first instance, and a first Court of Appeal has reversed that judgment, a second Court of Appeal should interfere with the judgment on the first appeal only if clearly satisfied that it was erroneous. This the appellant has failed to do.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judg- ment of Lizotte J. Appeal allowed, Fauteux and Abbott JJ, dissenting.\nPerrault Casgrain, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJacques de Billy, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSpence J.:\u2014In this case two actions were tried together; the action of Provencher v. Lavoie and the present action. Lizotte J. gave reasons in very considerable detail in the Provencher v. Lavoie action. In that action, Provencher as plaintiff had the onus and Lizotte J. said in the course of his judgment:\nD'ailleurs, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le poids de la preuve \u00e9tait \u00e0 la charge du demandeur, qui n'a certainement pas support\u00e9 son fardeau.\nLizotte J. then then turned to give judgment in the action of Ratte v. Provencher, the subject of this appeal. The largest part of his brief reasons therein are concerned with the quantum of damages but the learned trial judge did say:\nPour les raisons donn\u00e9es et les motifs exprim\u00e9s par le jugement dans la cause 18,503 C.S.R. Th\u00e9odore Provencher vs Les H\u00e9ritiers collectivement de feu Blaise Lavoie, la Cour en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9fendeur est responsable des dommages \u00e9prouv\u00e9s par la demanderesse.\nThen, lest it be thought that the learned trial judge had failed to note that the onus had shifted in this action to the present appellant, he continued:\nIl est vrai qu'ici le poids de la preuve est d\u00e9plac\u00e9, mais la Cour est convaincue que la preuve faite est amplement suffisante pour tenir le d\u00e9fendeur responsable.\nThereby demonstrating that in the paragraph first quoted the learned trial judge had relied on Provencher's failure to discharge the onus in the action in which he was plaintiff as only one of the reasons for dismissing the action and that he was of the opinion that the appellant, here Ratt\u00e9, in her action, had discharged this burden. There had been only one eye-witness to the accident which caused the death of the late Lavoie, the defendant Provencher. The learned trial judge, after carefully reviewing the latter's evidence and quoting from it extensively, came to the conclusion that he could accept it only in so far as it established Provencher's nervousness, vagueness of memory and inability to explain. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that at a critical time in the accident,\nA ce moment, il avait perdu le contr\u00f4le de sa voiture et m\u00eame semble-t-il le contr\u00f4le de son esprit.\na definite finding of an act of negligence on Provencher's part. In so proceeding, the learned trial judge was taking advantage of the opportunity to hear and consider the witnesses and decide on the credibility of their evidence.\nThe learned trial judge then turned to the two remaining parts of the evidence, i.e., the testimony of witnesses as to their investigations on the scene and the area surrounding it as well as the vehicles, and secondly, evidence given by the experts, Dr. Gravel and Mr. Royer, for the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)2 appears to proceed on the basis that neither of these witnesses having given evidence from their own observation but merely from what they had learned, and their evidence concerning inferences from such facts and the theories they developed from them, the Court in Appeal was as well qualified to decide whether it would accept such theories as was the learned trial judge. The effect of the two written judgments in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) would seem to be summarized in the statement of Montgomery J.:\nThe burden of proof was upon Respondent, and while it may well be that the learned trial judge was correct in dismissing Appellant's action, where the burden of proof was upon him, I am of the opinion that Respondent's action should have been dismissed for lack of sufficient proof that some fault of Appellant caused Lavoie's automobile to strike the guard rail.\nI have come to the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Queen's Bench is in error for these reasons:\nFirstly, the learned trial judge heard much evidence of the facts in addition to the expert testimony, weighed it and assessed both its credibility and its probative value. Some of the facts, the learned trial judge regarded as most important; for example, the evidence of the various witnesses as to Provencher's speed when passing through the Village of Ste. Angele. It should be noted they not only gave evidence as to Provencher's speed but also that they noticed no automobile resembling that driven by the late Lavoie following Provencher shortly behind him. Therefore, in all probability, and that is sufficient at any rate in a civil action, Lavoie's vehicle was in front of Provencher's and could not have been attempting to pass Provencher's at the time of the accident. Again, the learned trial judge was called upon to consider the evidence of Constable Levesque as given at the trial in reference to the tire marks crossing the centre line of the road, south of the scene of the impact, and to contrast it with the constable's different evidence at the coroner's inquest. Indeed, the evidence of the defendant Provencher given at trial also differed from his evidence at the coroner's inquest. Much of the evidence at trial as to circumstances was such that it could only be appreciated and assessed properly by the trial judge who heard it and his finding thereon should not be interfered with.\nIt is most significant to me that the learned trial judge first cited and analyzed this evidence as to circumstances in his reasons, only then turned to the consideration of the evidence given by the expert witnesses and concluded that the theory of Dr. Gravel coincided exactly with his own view as to what occurred. I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge would have arrived at the same conclusion if he had not had the advantage of Dr. Gravel's evidence.\nSecondly, one of the expert witnesses, Dr. Gravel, whose theories were accepted by the learned trial judge, had made five different inspections of the scene of the accident. The first of these was on the 14th or 15th of October 1955, only about two weeks after the accident, when he had the opportunity to personally observe many of the signs of the accident at the site and to inspect both vehicles at a nearby garage. Dr. Gravel was therefore in a position to give evidence upon what he actually had seen himself and to use his accurate first-hand knowledge of these observations to evolve his theory. Mr. Royer, the expert witness called by the defendant, on the other hand, went to the bridge site but he could not say when and the learned trial judge found:\nSur ce pont, on lui a dit qu'il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 un accident, mais il n'a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 aucun vestige, aucune trace, n'a pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 de plan, ni pris de mesures, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'a fait le docteur Gravel.\nIt would appear that Mr. Royer never inspected the vehicles. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the learned trial judge preferred to accept the evidence of Dr. Gravel whose testimony he described in these words:\nLa cour doit admettre qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vivement impressionn\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moignage de cet expert qui n'affirme que ce qu'il peut jurer, qui est bien prudent dans ses r\u00e9ponses, qui semble ne montrer aucun z\u00e8le, qui poss\u00e8de certainement une belle intelligence et exprime son opinion que sur ce qu'il a pu constater lui-m\u00eame en examinant les traces, les vestiges, etc.\nAs an illustration of the much more convincing character of the evidence of Dr. Gravel, there may be considered the critical issue of whether Provencher overtook the late Lavoie from the rear and in a delayed attempt to avoid his vehicle by turning out and passing it to the left struck the left rear corner of that vehicle or, whether on the other hand, the late Lavoie overtook and passed Provencher's truck, and in passing him or turning in to the right thereby clipped the left front corner of the Provencher truck with the right rear fender or bumper of his own vehicle. Upon that issue, Dr. Gravel gave evidence after inspecting both vehicles and determining in his opinion that the impact on the left rear corner of the Plymouth, the late Lavoie's automobile, was a heavy one. On either the theory advanced by Dr. Gravel or that advanced by Mr. Royer there had been no other heavy impact directly on the rear left corner of the Lavoie vehicle. Mr. Royer, on the other hand, merely from an inspection of the photograph, exhibit D-2, gave as his opinion that the impact on the left rear corner of the Lavoie automobile was too light to have driven it into the bridge pillar. Again, Mr. Royer refused to accept Dr. Gravel's theory that the impression of the front of the Provencher truck on the right side of the Lavoie automobile was made when the latter swung in an arc to the left after its right front corner had been driven into the pillar by the impact of the truck upon its left rear corner. Mr. Royer was of the opinion that if the impact had been in that fashion the Provencher truck would have continued past the Lavoie automobile on its left and never had an opportunity to mark the right side of the vehicle. It would seem highly unlikely that the Provencher truck could possibly have squeezed past the left side of the Lavoie car on that bridge in the fraction of a second available after the car was driven forward into the pillar and before it pivoted to the left in the direct path of the truck.\nThese illustrations I have cited, and they may be multiplied, to demonstrate that the learned trial judge had a perfectly sound basis for accepting the explanation of Dr. Gravel. Indeed when, as he stated, the learned trial judge had, apart from Dr. Gravel's opinion, come to the same conclusion such considerations must have influenced him.\nIt is true that the evidence adduced by the appellant was far from complete and irrefutable. As I have noted above, Montgomery J. in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) found it did not discharge the onus on the plaintiff.\nHyde J., in the same court, said:\nMuch in the reconstruction by Dr. Gravel may be sound but it does not satisfy me on the vital question in this case. I feel in no way bound to accept it because the Court below did.\nIn my view, with respect, the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) applied to the proof a standard beyond that required in a civil action. That standard would seem to be exactly the same in civil actions in Quebec as it is in common law jurisdictions and was put simply and clearly by Duff J., as he then was, in Clark v. The King3:\nBroadly speaking, in civil proceedings the burden of proof being upon a party to establish a given allegation of fact, the party on whom the burden lies is not called upon to establish his allegation in a fashion so rigorous as to leave no room for doubt in the mind of the tribunal with whom the decision rests. It is, generally speaking, sufficient if he has produced such a preponderance of evidence as to shew that the conclusion he seeks to establish is substantially the most probable of the possible views of the facts.\nIn Rousseau v. Bennett4, the present Chief Justice of this Court, said at p. 92:\nMais la preuve peut \u00e9tablir des pr\u00e9somptions de faits et l'article 1242 du Code Civil nous dit comment elles doivent \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9es. Cet article se lit ainsi:\u2014\n\u00abLes pr\u00e9somptions qui ne sont pas \u00e9tablies par la loi sont abandonn\u00e9es \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion et au jugement du tribunal.\u00bb\nCe que la loi a voulu c'est que ces pr\u00e9somptions soient laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge qui voit et entend les t\u00e9moins, et pour qu'une Cour d'Appel intervienne dans l'exercice de cette discr\u00e9tion, il faut n\u00e9cessairement trouver une erreur de la part du juge au proc\u00e8s, erreur qu'on ne trouve pas dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\nL'honorable Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a jug\u00e9 suivant la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, ce qui est la preuve requise en mati\u00e8re civile, et je crois que le jugement de la Cour d'Appel est erron\u00e9 en droit quand cette derni\u00e8re conclut qu'il n'y a pas de pr\u00e9somption tellement forte qu'elle exclut toute autre possibilit\u00e9. Ce n'est pas ce que la loi requiert. Il y a une distinction fondamentale qu'il faut faire entre le droit criminel et le droit civil. En mati\u00e8re criminelle, la Couronne doit toujours prouver la culpabilit\u00e9 de l'accus\u00e9 au del\u00e0 d'un doute raisonnable. En mati\u00e8re civile, la balance des probabilit\u00e9s est le facteur d\u00e9cisif.\n* * *\nLes tribunaux doivent souvent agir en pesant les probabilit\u00e9s. Pratiquement rien ne peut \u00eatre math\u00e9matiquement prouv\u00e9. (J\u00e9r\u00f4me v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America ((1939) 6 Ins. L.R. 59 at 60), Richard Evans & Co. Ltd. v. Astley ((1911) A.C. 674 at 678), New York Life Insurance Co. v. Schlitt ((1945) S.C.R. 289 at 300), Doe D. Devine v. Wilson (10 Moore P.C. 502 at 532)).\nIn Champagne v. Labrie5, Rivard J. said at p. 487:\nLes pr\u00e9somptions qui r\u00e9sultent des faits sont laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion et \u00e0 son jugement (C.C., art. 1238, 1242).\nIl n'est pas besoin de rappeler que notre Code civil n'impose pas au tribunal les directives que prescrit le Code Napol\u00e9on dans l'exercice de la discr\u00e9tion que la loi lui laisse en cette mati\u00e8re (Code Napol\u00e9on, art. 1353).\n* * *\nJe crois que le premier juge en appr\u00e9ciant cette preuve de circonstances a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 suivant la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et qu'il n'y a pas lieu pour cette Cour d'intervenir sur ce point.\nTo balance these probabilities, the trial judge may draw-inferences: Simpson v. London, Midland and Scottish Rlwy. Co.6, per Viscount Dunedin at p. 357. The duty of the appellate court was put by Davis J. in Danley v. C.P.R.7, quoting Lord Shaw in Kerr v. Ayr Steam Shipping Co. Ltd.8:\nis a very different, a strikingly different, one. It is to consider whether the arbitrator appointed to be the judge of the facts and having the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, has come to a conclusion, which conclusion could not have been reached by a reasonable man.\nFor the reasons which I have outlined, I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge who had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses and who carefully considered all the evidence, including the direct evidence of the respondent, the evidence as to the circumstances, and the opinion of the experts, has weighed the probabilities and has come to a conclusion which is a reasonable one. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of Lizotte J.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014This action arose out of a collision between two automobiles which occurred on September 30, 1955, in which the driver of one of the vehicles, the husband of the appellant, was killed. The facts are fully set out in the judgments below and in the reasons of my brother Spence, which I have had the advantage of considering.\nThe only surviving witness of the accident was the respondent Provencher, the driver of one of the cars involved. The learned trial judge found his evidence vague and confusing as to what happened at the time of the collision and refused to accept it. In maintaining the appellant's action therefore, he relied upon inferences drawn from the circumstances surrounding the accident and upon theories as to how it happened, advanced by two expert witnesses. That judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench.9\nThe burden of proving negligence was upon the appellant, and the learned judges in the Court below refused to accept the inferences made by the learned trial judge as to the manner in which the accident occurred.\nIt is well settled, of course, that where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a court of first instance, and a first court of appeal has reversed that judgment, a second court of appeal should interfere with the judgment on the first appeal only if clearly satisfied that it is erroneous. Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Company10; Pelletier v. Shykofsky11.\nThe appellant has failed to satisfy me that the judgment of the Court below is erroneous and I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Casgrain & Casgrain, Rimouski.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Gagnon, de Billy, Cantin & Dionne, Quebec.\n1 [1961] Que.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1964: June 1; 1964: June 29.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION.\nContracts\u2014Acceptance\u2014Letter proposing terms for rental of tug\u2014Verbal arrangements made for services and at rates set out in letter\u2014Continuation of services beyond expressed period\u2014Whether agreement implied from defendant's acquiescence.\nThe defendant operated an oil refinery at Saint John, New Brunswick, and required tugs to guide incoming tankers into the harbour. The plaintiff company claimed that a letter sent by it to Kent Lines Ltd., a shipping firm which was owned or controlled by the same interests as the defendant, contained the terms under which the plaintiff's tug Ocean Rockswift was made available for use by the defendant. There was no written acceptance of this offer, but it was not disputed that the defendant made verbal arrangements for the rental of the tug for a period of one month commencing June 13, 1961, for the services and at the rates set out in the letter, nor was it disputed that this arrangement was expressly extended twice, each time for a period of two weeks. Although no formal authorization was made for any further extension, the services of the tug continued to be employed by the defendant, and, apart from a complaint about handling charges, the defendant gave no indication to the plaintiff as to any change in the arrangements for the tug's employment or the per diem charges being made for its services until late in February 1962. The plaintiff's monthly invoices since July 1961 remained unpaid and the defendant denied liability for all charges after the middle of August in that year.\nThe plaintiff sued for services rendered and was successful at trial. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal and varied the trial judge's assessment of the plaintiff's damages by reducing considerably the amount thereof on the ground that the liability of the defendant for the rental of the plaintiff's tug on a stand-by basis was limited to the period extending from June 12 to December 15, 1961 (the end of the port summer season) instead of continuing on the same basis until February 28, 1962, as found by the trial judge. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored; the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defendant must be taken to have known that the tug was being kept standing by for its use until the end of February 1962, and that the plaintiff expected to be paid for this special service at the per diem rate specified in the monthly invoices. The matter drifted from day to day without any move being made on the defendant's behalf to either dispense with the services or complain about the charge. It was not unreasonable to draw the conclusion from this course of conduct that the defendant was accepting the continuing special services on the proposed terms. The contract was concluded by the defendant's own acquiescence.\nThe test of whether conduct, unaccompanied by any verbal or written undertaking, can constitute an acceptance of an offer so as to bind the acceptor to the fulfilment of the contract is an objective and not a subjective one; the intention to be attributed to a man is always that which his conduct bears when reasonably construed, and not that which was present in his own mind. However, mere failure to disown responsibility to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.

Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed. Paul Barry, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nA. B. Gilbert, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick whereby that Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of Anglin J., rendered at trial, and varied his assessment of the appellant's damages by reducing the amount thereof from $79,639 to $49,944, on the ground that the liability of the respondent for the rental of the appellant's tug on a \"stand-by\" basis was limited to a period extending from June 12 to December 15, 1961, instead of continuing on the same basis until February 28, 1962, as found by the learned trial judge.\nSince early in 1960, the respondent has operated an oil refinery bordering on the harbour of Saint John, New Brunswick, at Courtenay Bay, and as a necessary incident of this operation it is supplied with crude oil brought by large tankers which are owned or chartered by the California Shipping Company, a corporation with its head office in the United States of America, which was, at all times material hereto, represented at Saint John by Kent Lines Limited, a shipping firm which was owned or controlled by the same interests as the respondent company.\nIt was important to the respondent that tugs should be available when required to guide the incoming tankers into the harbour as any delay whilst they waited in the harbour approaches involved demurrage charges and to meet this situation, Mr. K. C. Irving, the chairman of the board of directors of the respondent company and president of Kent Lines Limited, had one of the other companies in which he was interested purchase tugs to do this work. Unfortunately, however, from the time when the large tankers first started servicing the refinery in April 1960, up to and including the date of the trial, difficulty was encountered in having these tugs used by the Saint John Harbour pilots and it accordingly became necessary to employ the services of the appellant's tug boats which were the only other such boats available in the harbour. On March 24, 1961, no firm arrangements having been made as to the employment of these tugs by the respondent during the forthcoming months, the Saint John Tug Boat Company Limited wrote to Kent Lines Limited in the following terms:\nDear Sirs:\nThis is to advise you that unless some special arrangement is made, on and after early in April when the winter port season closes here, we will only have two tug boats available for assisting in docking and undocking ships in St. John Harbour.\nIf we do not hear from you we will assume that you are making arrangements elsewhere for any additional tugs that you may require.\nOn the same day, C. N. Wilson, the president of the appellant company, wrote to Mr. Irving, in part, as follows:\nMy dear Kenneth:\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter which we are sending to Kent Line Ltd. concerning tug services in St. John Harbour this coming summer.\n* * *\nWe do appreciate the work we have received from Kent Line Ltd. and thought it was only fair to advise both them and you of our plans for this coming summer. If more than two tugs are required from us during the coming season, we feel that we could arrange to provide them if we are advised to this effect now. However special rates will need to be agreed upon as it would be absolutely impossible for us to provide them at the present tariff rates.\nThis was followed by a letter of March 27 addressed to Kent Lines Limited which was also brought to the attention of K. C. Irving and which is now claimed as containing the terms under which the appellant's tug Ocean Rockswift was made available to the respondent during the period covered by the statement of claim. That letter reads:\nGentlemen:\nWith further reference to our letter of the 24th inst. and our telephone conversation of this morning, we would say that as it looks now, we will probably be keeping available for assisting in docking and undocking ships in St. John Harbour this coming summer, the tugs \"OCEAN HAWK 11\", 900 h.p. Diesel; and the \"OCEAN WEKA\", 400 h.p. Diesel.\nWe could make either the tug \"OCEAN ROCKSWIFT\", Steam, 1,000 h.p. and\/or the tug \"OCEAN OSPREY\", Steam, 1,000 h.p. available for your large tankers at a cost per day each of $450.00. This of course would take in Sundays and holidays as well as the ordinary working day and would be for all days during the month regardless of whether the tug was working or not.\nIf at any time, more than two tugs were required and the \"ROCKSWIFT\" and\/or the \"OSPREY\" were used on work other than large tankers, we would give you credit at the tariff rate on the earnings of this tug, less 10% for handling.\nAs we have other enquiries concerning the \"OCEAN OSPREY\" and the \"OCEAN ROCKSWIFT\", we would appreciate your early decision as to whether or not the above is of interest to you.\nThere was no written acceptance of this offer, but it is not disputed that the respondent made verbal arrangements for the rental of the Ocean Rockswift for a period of one month commencing June 13, 1961, for the services and at the rates set out in the letter of March 27, nor is it disputed that this arrangement was expressly extended twice, each time for a period of two weeks, and it appears to be agreed also that these extensions were intended to cover the time until the arrival of an Irving tug which was expected to be available sometime in the month of August. There is evidence also that Mr. L. L. Henning, the president of the respondent company, was succeeded in this position by a Mr. W. R. Forsythe in August 1961, and that before leaving Saint John he had told the president of the appellant company \"that he should for any further extensions contact Mr. Forsythe\". Neither Mr. Forsythe nor any other officer of the respondent formally authorized any further extension of the agreement, but the services of the Ocean Rockswift continued to be employed by the respondent until late in February 1962, and accounts for these services were rendered by the appellant to the respondent each month, up to and including February 28, 1962. Each of these accounts carried the heading: \"To Rental 'Ocean Rockswift' As Per our letter of March 27th, 1961\" and disclosed that the rental was $450 per day \"Less Credit Note Attached\".\nThe effect of this method of billing was that the respondent company was charged $450 per day for the privilege of having this tug \"standing by\" and that the normal tariff rate paid by other companies for the tug's services was deducted from the $450, but this deduction was reduced by 10 per cent to defray the appellant's \"handling charges\". The way this worked out in respect of the larger tankers which were escorted to the refinery was that the normal tariff rate for each such tanker was paid by Kent Lines Limited, and this amount was duly deducted from the $450 daily \"stand-by\" charge which was billed to the respondent. When the respondent found that the appellant was deduct- ing the 10 per cent for handling charges in respect of these tankers, it protested and in giving judgment at the trial the learned trial judge, in my opinion quite rightly, excluded this charge in respect of such tankers from the total bill.\nThere does not appear to have been any difference in the use which the respondent made of the Ocean Rockswift after July 31, 1961, nor, apart from its complaint about the 10 per cent handling charge, did the respondent give any indication to the appellant as to any change in the arrangements for the tug's employment or the per diem charges being made for its services until late in February 1962, but all the appellant's invoices for the services of the tug since July 1961, remain unpaid, and the respondent now denies liability for all charges after the middle of August in that year.\nIn finding the respondent liable for payment of these invoices up to and including February 28 (less the 10 per cent adjustment above referred to) the learned trial judge stated:\nAlthough the plaintiff over the period in question was pressing Mr. Forsythe for payment, there was no written or verbal notification to it that the defendant refused to accept liability as invoiced for the rental of the Rockswift. Even in the latter part of February, 1962, when Mr. Forsythe was invited by Mr. Keith Wilson \"to take her off charter\", Mr. Forsythe said he would have to talk to Mr. Irving first.\nI find that the defendant knew that the Ocean Rockswift continued after August 1, 1961, in commission on call to assist and did assist the large tankers during the period in question, and that the plaintiff expected payment on a rental basis for its being kept in commission. The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed. It had and took the benefit of such stand-by service and the probable avoidance of demurrage charges.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Appeal Division, Chief Justice McNair, after quoting at length from the letter of March 24, 1961, went on to say:\nIt is abundantly clear, that, throughout their negotiations the parties contemplated the special arrangements for the services of the Ocean Rockswift on a stand-by footing was to meet conditions at the port during its summer season when tugs available in the harbour would be at a minimum. Such arrangement had no relation to the port's winter season when quite different conditions as to tug availability would prevail.\nIt follows that the plaintiff is entitled to recover under the special contract for the period from June 12 to December 15, 1961, both dates inclusive. It was contended by way of cross-appeal that the contract for hire of the tug came to an end on August 15, this being the expiry date of the second extension of the 30-day period for which it had originally been hired on June 12. In the alternative, respondent's counsel based the cross-appeal on the contention that the hiring was for the \"summer\" as a season of the year and therefore came to an end on September 21, 1961. In the further alternative, it was contended that as found by the Appeal Division, the arrangement contemplated by the parties could not be construed as extending the period of hire after the end of the \"port summer season\" (i.e. December 15, 1961).\nThese submissions are based in large degree on the wording of the third paragraph of the statement of claim and the particulars thereof which were furnished pursuant to demand. Paragraph 3 of the statement of claim reads as follows:\nThe Plaintiff Company offered to provide tug services on certain terms and conditions which terms and conditions were accepted by the Defendant Company.\nThe particulars of this paragraph contain the following statements:\nThe \"terms and conditions\" referred to in the Statement of Claim herein are set forth in a letter to Kent Lines Limited dated March 27, 1961, from the Plaintiff, which letter was the result of a telephone conversation with Kent Lines Limited following letters of March 24, 1961 to K. C. Irving and Kent Lines Limited. On April 1, 1961, K. C. Irving acknowledged receipt of these various letters.\nThe acceptance of the offer of March 27, 1961, by the Defendant was made by Mr. Henning, an officer of the Defendant Company, on or about June 12, 1961, in a telephone conversation with Keith M. Wilson, a senior managing officer of the Plaintiff. \"The terms of the said offer were told to Henning and were accepted by Henning\".\nThe conclusion which is advanced on behalf of the respondent in reliance on these particulars, is summarized in the following paragraphs taken from the factum filed on its behalf:\nIt is clear from the above that the Appellant's claim was upon an express contract based upon the letters which refer to \"this coming summer\" and not upon an implied contract as held by the trial judge.\nIt is respectfully submitted that the judgment of the learned trial judge cannot be supported because he purports to imply a contract to February 28, 1962 notwithstanding the use of the word \"summer\" as a limitation (by the appellant) to the hiring. There was an express contract only and no contract existed beyond the summer. The contract accepted by Mr. Henning on June 12, 1961, which is recited in the particulars was not a contract for \"this coming summer\" but one for a period of thirty days on the \"terms and conditions\" as to the nature and costs of services which are set forth in the letter of March 27, and in my view the reference in the particulars to the \"terms and conditions\" set forth in that letter is to be similarly construed not as incorporating in the pleadings a contract for rental during \"this coming summer\", but rather as alleging that the appellant offered to provide the tug's services during the months specified in the statement of claim for the same purpose and at the same per diem rate as it had been theretofore employed.\nIf it were assumed, as respondent's counsel contends, that it was the intention and understanding of both parties that the offer of hire should come to an end on August 15, 1961, or that its life was in any event limited to September 21 of that year, then it would appear to follow that in making the \"stand-by\" services of the tug available after that date the appellant was making a new offer and the invoices make it clear that it was an offer for the same services at the same rate. The same considerations would apply with equal force to the services rendered after December 15 if it were assumed, as the Appeal Division found, that the original offer did not extend beyond that date.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal is whether or not the respondent's course of conduct during the months in question constituted a continuing acceptance of these offers so as to give rise to a binding contract to pay for the \"stand-by\" services of the tug at the rate specified in the invoices furnished by the appellant.\nThe test of whether conduct, unaccompanied by any verbal or written undertaking, can constitute an acceptance of an offer so as to bind the acceptor to the fulfilment of the contract, is made the subject of comment in Anson on Contracts, 21st ed., p. 28, where it is said:\nThe test of such a contract is an objective and not a subjective one, that is to say, the intention which the law will attribute to a man is always that which his conduct bears when reasonably construed, and not that which was present in his own mind. So if A allows B to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that B meant to do the work for nothing, A will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; the permission to do it, or the acquiescence in its being done, constitutes the acceptance. In this connection reference is frequently made to the following statement contained in the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Smith v. Hughes2, which I adopt as a proper test under the present circumstances:\nIf, whatever a man's real intention may be he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was consenting to the terms proposed by the other party and that other party upon that belief enters into a contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.\nThe American authorities on the same subject are well summarized in Williston on Contracts, 3rd ed., vol. I, para. 91A where it is said:\nSilence may be so deceptive that it may become necessary for one who receives beneficial services to speak in order to escape the inference of a promise to pay for them. It is immaterial in this connection whether the services are requested and the silence relates merely to an undertaking to pay for them, or whether the services are rendered without a preliminary request but with knowledge on the part of the person receiving them that they are rendered with the expectation of payment. In either case, the ordinary implication is that the services are to be paid for at their fair value, or at the offered price, if that is known to the offeree before he accepts them.\nIt must be appreciated that mere failure to disown responsibilty to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has had the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\nAs was observed by Bowen L.J., in Falcke v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Company3:\nLiabilities are not to be forced upon people behind their backs any more than you can confer a benefit upon a man against his will.\nLike the learned trial judge, however, I would adopt the following excerpt from Smith's Leading Cases, 13th ed. at p. 156 where it is said:\nBut if a person knows that the consideration is being rendered for his benefit with an expectation that he will pay for it, then if he acquiesces in its being done, taking the benefit of it when done, he will be taken impliedly to have requested its being done: and that will import a promise to pay for it. In the present case the ordinary tariff rates for the tug's normal services were being paid by Kent Lines Limited, a company closely associated with the respondent, and it is perhaps for this reason that, in the absence of any formal agreement fixing any additional rate, the respondent took no steps to either pay for or dispense with the \"stand-by\" services which continued to be rendered for its benefit until February 1962.\nThe matter was put clearly and frankly by Mr. K. C. Irving himself when he was asked:\nIf there was a misunderstanding, it could have been cleared right up in September, couldn't it?\nand he replied:\nWell it seemed so obvious to me, yes, that there was no arrangement \u2026 Mr. Forsythe it came to his attention, and he just thought there was no agreement \u2026 He had no record of anything and he just\u2014I don't know how it drifted or what happened.\nNeither the absence of an express agreement nor the fact that the respondent did not consider itself liable to pay for the \"stand-by\" services after July 31 can, however, be treated as determining the issue raised by this appeal. The question is not whether the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent under the terms of an express or recorded agreement, but rather whether an agreement is to be implied from the respondent's acquiescence in the tug's services being supplied for its benefit during the period for which the claim is now made.\nIn my view the respondent must be taken to have known that the Ocean Rockswift was being kept \"standing by\" for its use until the end of February 1962, and to have known also that the appellant expected to be paid for this special service at the per diem rate specified in the monthly invoices which were furnished to it, but the matter drifted from day to day without any move being made on the respondent's behalf to either dispense with the service or complain about the charge. I do not think it was unreasonable to draw the conclusion from this course of conduct that the respondent was accepting the continuing special services on the terms proposed in the March letters and the appellant is accordingly entitled to recover the sums charged in the invoices up to and including the month of February 1962 (subject to the adjustment as to handling charges) as being money due pursuant to a contract which was concluded by the respondent's own acquiescence.\nFor these reasons I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellant will have its costs of the appeal in this Court and in the Appeal Division. The cross-appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored with costs; cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: J. Paul Barry, Saint John.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gilbert, McGloan & Gillis, Saint John.\n2 (1871), L.R. 6 Q.B. 597 at 607.\n3 (1886), 34 Ch. D. 234 at 248.\n",

On November 16, 1961, two medical practitioners certified that the appellant was mentally ill and a proper person to be confined in an Ontario Hospital; he was confined continuously thereafter as a certificated patient pursuant to the provisions of The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 236. The appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus, and following the trial of an issue, he was found to be mentally ill and dangerous to be at large. The trial judge having decided that his confinement was according to law dismissed his application. An appeal from the trial judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe magistrate derived the power to make the order requiring the superintendent of the hospital to admit and detain the appellant from s. 524(1a) of the Criminal Code; the terms of s. 38 of The Mental Hospitals Act obligated the superintendent to admit the appellant. The appellant \u201cwas admitted under section 38\u201d within the meaning of that expression as used in s. 27 of the Act, the section under which the respondent sought to support the confinement of the appellant.\nThe Mental Hospitals Act was legislation in relation to the subject-matter described in head 7 of s. 92 of the British North America Act and not in relation to criminal procedure. The relevant provisions of the Code and those of the Act were complementary to, and not in conflict with, each other. Accordingly, the relevant sections of The Mental Hospitals Act were intra vires of the Legislature.

Cormack, Q.C., and E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.\nT.D. MacDonald, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Canada.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, made on September 16, 1963, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. pronounced on December 17, 1962, following the trial of an issue, finding the appellant mentally ill and dangerous to be at large, dismissing his application for a writ of habeas corpus and deciding that his confinement was according to law.\nThe appellant is a farmer; prior to his confinement he resided on a farm in the Township of Euphrasia in the County of Grey. On October 18, 1961, the appellant appeared before His Worship Magistrate Stewart at Meaford. The appellant at that time was in custody charged with the following offences: (i) that on August 28, 1961, he did without lawful excuse point a firearm at George Seabrook contrary to s. 86 of the Criminal Code; (ii) that on August 28, 1961, he did wilfully and without legal justification commit damage to certain personal property under the value of $50 belonging to Stuart Howey, to wit: an automobile tire contrary to s. 373(1) of the Criminal Code; (iii) that on August 28, 1961, he did strike George Seabrook with his arm and thereby commit a common assault contrary to s. 231(1) of the Criminal Code; (iv) that on September 18, 1961, he did unlawfully assault W.J.E. Ferguson a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 232(2)(a) of the Criminal Code; (v) that on September 18, 1961, he did unlawfully and wilfully obstruct W.J.E. Ferguson, a peace officer in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 110(a) of the Criminal Code; and (vi) that on September 10, 1961, he did unlawfully drive a motor vehicle upon a highway carelessly contrary to s. 60 of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. All of these offences were charged as having been committed in the Township of Euphrasia.\nOn each of the informations relating to the first five of the charges set out in the preceding paragraph there appears the following endorsement:\nOctober 18, 1961.\nAfter hearing medical evidence of Dr. M.D. Tuchtie, Dr. Ronald E. Stokes, Dr. J. Moldofsky, and Dr. Alex. S. Szatmari, and at the request of the Crown Attorney, I remand Fred Fawcett for 30 days to The Ontario Hospital at Penetanguishene, Ontario, for observation and treatment, under the authority vested in me under Section 451-c(al) C.C.C., until Nov. 17\/61 at 10 a.m.\n(Sgd.) Alan S. Stewart\nP.M.\nSection 451(c) of the Criminal Code deals with the powers of a justice holding a preliminary inquiry, and was not the appropriate section as the appellant was before Magistrate Stewart not for preliminary inquiry but for trial. On October 18, 1961, the learned magistrate signed a warrant of remand in accordance with section 524(1a) of the Criminal Code, which so far as relevant provides:\n(1a) A court, judge or magistrate may, at any time before verdict or sentence, when of the opinion, supported by the evidence of at least one duly qualified medical practitioner, that there is reason to believe that\n(a) an accused is mentally ill,\u2026\nremand the accused, by order in writing, to such custody as the court, judge or magistrate directs for observation for a period not exceeding thirty days.\nThis warrant of remand was in respect of the charge of obstructing a peace officer which is numbered (v) above.\nOn October 31, 1961, an application made on behalf of the appellant for a writ of habeas corpus came before Donnelly J. and was dismissed. The recitals in the order read as follows:\nUpon the application of Counsel on behalf of Frederick Fawcett, upon hearing read the affidavit of Frederick Fawcett and the transcript of evidence herein, and the material filed in the presence of Counsel for the said Frederick Fawcett and the Attorney General for Ontario, and upon hearing what was alleged by Counsel aforesaid, it appearing that there was ample evidence before the Learned Magistrate to justify a finding that the said Frederick Fawcett was mentally ill; and it appearing that the Learned Magistrate has now substituted a warrant of committal pursuant to Sec- tion 524(1a) of the Criminal Code for the original warrant of committal pursuant to Section 451(c) of the Criminal Code;\nOn November 16, 1961, two medical practitioners certified that the appellant was mentally ill and a proper person to be confined in an Ontario Hospital. The appellant was never returned before Magistrate Stewart and has ever since November 16, 1961, been confined in an Ontario Hospital as a certificated patient pursuant to the provisions of The Mental Hospitals Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 236, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d. He is at present confined in the Ontario Hospital at 999 Queen Street, West, in the City of Toronto.\nOn September 25, 1962, pursuant to an order of Ferguson J. a writ of habeas corpus was issued directed to the superintendent of the Ontario Hospital at 999 Queen Street, West, Toronto. The return to this writ came on before Landreville J. and on October 9, 1962, he directed the trial of an issue as to the appellant\u2019s sanity and as to whether he was dangerous to be at large and adjourned the motion to be disposed of by the judge presiding at the trial of the issue. The issue so directed was tried and the matter disposed of by Spence J. as set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the findings made by Spence J. that the appellant was mentally ill and dangerous to be at large. Before this Court counsel for the appellant did not seek to have us interfere with these concurrent findings of fact; he attacked the judgments below on the ground that the confinement of the appellant in the Ontario Hospital at Penetanguishene was not according to law.\nIt is submitted for the appellant that on their true construction the relevant sections of the Act do not authorize the confinement of the appellant in the circumstances of this case and, alternatively, that if they purport to do so they are ultra vires of the Legislature of the province.\nSection 27 of the Act is as follows:\n27(1) Notwithstanding anything in subsection 2 of section 21, any mentally ill person who has been admitted as a voluntary patient or a habituate patient, or any person admitted under section 22 or 38, or any person detained under section 57, may be continued as a certificated patient upon the certificates of two medical practitioners with the accompanying history record in the prescribed form.\n(2) At least one of the certificates required by subsection 1 shall be issued by a medical practitioner who is not an officer of the Department, and a certificate upon which any patient was admitted to an examination unit is not a certificate for the purpose of this section.\n(3) Upon a person being certificated under this section, he is thereafter during the time he is a patient a certificated patient within the meaning of this Act and is subject to the provisions of this Act and the regulations respecting certificated patients.\nIt is under this section that the respondent seeks to support the confinement of the appellant. It is clear that the appellant was certified in accordance with the terms of this section if at the time he was certified he should properly be described as \u201ca person admitted under section 38\u201d.\nSection 38 is as follows:\n38(1) Any person may be admitted to an institution upon the order of a judge or magistrate if the person has been apprehended either with or without warrant and charged with any offence, if the order is accompanied by the prescribed history form and if the order is for a period of not more than sixty days, and any order made under this section shall direct that the person shall be conveyed to the institution most conveniently situated to the place where the order is made.\n(2) Before the expiration of the time mentioned in such order, the superintendent shall report in writing as to the mental condition of the person to the judge or magistrate.\n(3) Where in the opinion of the superintendent the person is mentally ill or mentally defective, he shall direct the examination of the person as provided for by section 27, and if the examining medical practitioners certify the person to be mentally ill or mentally defective, he shall be detained as a certificated patient and is subject to all the provisions of this Act and of the regulations respecting certificated patients.\n(4) Where in the opinion of the superintendent the person is neither mentally ill nor mentally defective and where the superintendent has failed to obtain certificates in the prescribed form, he shall discharge the person to the custody of the court by which he was ordered to the institution.\nFrom the recital of facts given above it appears that the appellant was admitted to the Ontario Hospital at Penentanguishene upon the order of Magistrate Stewart, that the appellant had been apprehended and charged with an offence and that the order was for a period of not more than sixty days. The record is silent as to whether the order was \u201caccompanied by the prescribed history form\u201d referred to in s. 38(1); but no point seems to have been made of this in the Courts below and I did not understand any argument to be founded on the fact, if it be the fact, that the history form did not accompany the order of the magistrate.\nUnder these circumstances I agree with the view expressed by Schroeder J.A. that the magistrate derived the power to make the order requiring the superintendent of the Ontario Hospital at Penetanguishene to admit and detain the appellant from s. 524(1a) of the Criminal Code; and that the terms of s. 38 of the Act obligated the superintendent to admit the appellant. It may well be that even if s. 38 had not been enacted the provisions of the Criminal Code would have been sufficient to impose the obligation on the superintendent but, be that as it may, when the Act is read as a whole it is my opinion that the appellant was \u201cadmitted under section 38\u201d within the meaning of that expression as used in s. 27 of the Act.\nOn the constitutional question also I am in agreement with the view of Schroeder J.A. that the Act is legislation in relation to the subject-matter described in head 7 of s. 92 of the British North America Act and not in relation to criminal procedure, that the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and those of the Act are complementary to, and not in conflict with, each other. It follows that the sections of the Act impugned by the appellant are intra vires of the Legislature.\nI agree with the submission of counsel for the Attorney General of Canada that if a particular case should arise in which the circumstances were such that the provisions of the Criminal Code would bring about one result and those of the Act would bring about a different result then the provisions of the Criminal Code would prevail; but there are no such circumstances in the case at bar.\nThe case of Trenholm v. Attorney-General of Ontario[2] does not assist the appellant. In that case it was sought to justify the detention of the appellant by the production of a warrant signed by the Lieutenant-Governor, which, under the relevant statutory provisions, he had the power to issue only if the person ordered to be detained were imprisoned for an offence or \u201cimprisoned in safe custody charged with an offence\u201d. At the time the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s warrant was signed the appellant was not so imprisoned and this Court held that for that reason the warrant was not legally issued.\nI would dismiss the appeal but would make no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Sol.

These debts arose from the sale by the customer of goods covered by the bank's security. The trustee claimed that he was entitled to collect these debts for administration under the Bankruptcy Act because an assignment of book debts held by the bank was void for lack of timely registration. The bank claimed that the fact that these debts arose from the sale of the goods covered by the bank's security gave them to the bank notwithstanding the failure of the assignment of book debts. The judge of first instance declared that the trustee in bankruptcy was entitled to all book debts of the bankrupt unpaid at the date of bankruptcy. The Court of Appeal, in a majority judgment, held that to the extent that the book debts of the customer outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy represented debts owing to the customer for goods sold and covered by the bank's s. 88 security, these accounts went to the bank.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nBy agreement in. writing between bank and customer an express trust of the accounts in question was created in favour of the bank. In addition, the agreement rejected in advance any suggestion that the bank's right to these accounts would depend upon a valid assignment of book debts. The agreement did no more than set out the terms upon which a bank as holder of s. 88 security permits a customer to sell the property of the bank in the ordinary course of business.\nThe property rights of the bank are defined by ss. 88(2) and 86(2) of the Bank Act. Under s. 88(2) the bank gets the same rights and powers as if it had acquired a warehouse receipt or bill of lading in which the property was described. Under s. 86(2) it acquires all the right and title of the customer.\nSection 88 permits certain classes of persons not of a custodier character, in this case a manufacturer, to give security on their own goods with the consequences as defined. Notwithstanding this, with the consent of the bank, the one who gives the security sells in the ordinary course of business and gives a good title to purchasers from him. But this did not mean that he owns the book debts when he has sold the goods.\nHere, the Court was not concerned with the rights of a purchaser for value without notice of the proceeds of the sale of the bank's security. It was true that s. 63 of the Bankruptcy Act avoided in favour of the trustee the assignment of book debts held by the bank because of defective registration. Subject to this, the trustee had no higher rights than the bankrupt and he took the property of the bankrupt merely as a successor in interest and not as an innocent purchaser for value without notice. He took the property of the bankrupt subject to the express trust created by the written agreement, which could not be characterized as an assignment of book debts in another form. When these debts, the proceeds of the sale of s. 88 security, came into existence they were subject to the agreement between bank and customer. As between these two the customer had nothing to assign to the bank. The actual assignment of book debts which was signed did no more than facilitate collection. Any other assignment, whether general or specific, of these debts by the customer to a third party would fail unless the third party was an innocent purchaser for value without notice.\nUnion Bank of Halifax v. Spinney and Churchill (1907), 38 S.C.R. 187; Re Goodjallow, Trader's Bank v. Goodfallow (1890), 19 O.R. 299; Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Lefaivre et al., [1951] B.R. 83, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, allowing an appeal from an order of Bastin J. Appeal dismissed.\nV. Simonsen, for the appellant.\nW. P. Fillmore, Q.C., and A. R. Philp, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The contest in this litigation is between a bank holding security under s. 88(1)(b) of the Bank Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 12, substituted 1953-54, c. 48, and a trustee in bankruptcy of the bank's customer concerning the ownership of certain uncollected debts owing to the customer at the date of bankruptcy. These debts arose from the sale by the customer of goods covered by the bank's security. The trustee says that he is entitled to collect these debts for administration under the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, because an assignment of book debts held by the bank was void for lack of timely registration. The bank says that the fact that these debts arose from the sale of the goods covered by the bank's security gives them to the bank notwithstanding the failure of the assignment of book debts. There is no dispute about the facts. It is admitted that the bank's security under s. 88 (l)(b) was a valid security and that the assignment of book debts held by the bank is void for want of timely registration.\nThe judge of first instance declared that the trustee in bankruptcy was entitled to all book debts of the bankrupt unpaid at the date of bankruptcy. The Manitoba Court of Appeal2 held that to the extent that the book debts of the customer outstanding at the time of the bankruptcy represented debts owing to the customer for goods sold and covered by the bank's s. 88 security, these accounts went to the bank. Freedman J. A. dissented and would have held that the proceeds of these sales must come under the assignment of book debts, that the bank could only claim in its capacity as holder of this assignment and that, therefore, its claim failed.\nMy opinion is that the majority judgment is correct. By agreement in writing between bank and customer an express trust of these accounts was created in favour of the bank in the following terms:\nThe proceeds of all sales by the Customer of the property or any part thereof, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, cash debts arising from such sales or otherwise, evidences of title, instruments, documents and securities, which the Customer may receive or be entitled to receive in respect thereof, are hereby assigned to the Bank and shall be paid or transferred to the Bank forthwith, and until so paid or transferred shall be held by the Customer in trust for the Bank. Execution by the Customer and acceptance by the Bank of an assignment of book debts or any additional assignment of any of such proceeds shall be deemed to be in furtherance hereof and not an acknowledgment by the Bank of any right or title on the part of the Customer to such book debts or proceeds.\nIn addition to the creation of the trust, the agreement rejects in advance any suggestion that the bank's right to these accounts will depend upon a valid assignment of book debts. This agreement does no more than set out the terms upon which a bank as holder of s. 88 security permits a customer to sell the property of the bank in the ordinary course of business.\nThe property rights of the bank are defined by ss. 88(2) and 86(2) of the Bank Act. Under s. 88(2) the bank gets the same rights and powers as if it had acquired a warehouse receipt or bill of lading in which the property was described. Under s. 86(2) it acquires all the right and title of the customer.\n86. (2) Any warehouse receipt or bill of lading so acquired shall vest in the bank, from the date of the acquisition thereof,\n(a) all the right and title to such warehouse receipt or bill of lading and to the goods, wares and merchandise covered thereby of the previous holder or owner thereof, or\n(b) all the right and title to the goods, wares and merchandise mentioned therein of the person from whom such goods, wares and merchandise were received or acquired by the bank, if the warehouse receipt or bill of lading is made directly in favour of the bank, instead of to the previous holder or owner of such goods, wares and merchandise.\nSection 88 is a unique form of security. I know of no other jurisdiction where it exists. It permits certain classes of persons not of a custodier character, in this case a manufacturer, to give security on their own goods with the consequences above defined. Notwithstanding this, with the consent of the bank, the one who gives the security sells in the ordinary course of business and gives a good title to purchasers from him. But this does not mean that he owns the book debts when he has sold the goods. To me the fallacy in the dissenting reasons is the assumption that there is ownership of the book debts in the bank's customer once the goods have been sold and that the bank can only recover these book debts if it is the assignee of them.\nWe are not concerned here with the rights of a purchaser for value without notice of the proceeds of the sale of the bank's security. It is true that s. 63 of the Bankruptcy Act avoids in favour of the trustee the assignment of book debts held by the bank because of defective registration. Subject to this, the trustee has no higher rights than the bankrupt and he takes the property of the bankrupt merely as a successor in interest and not as an innocent purchaser for value without notice. He takes the property of the bankrupt subject to the express trust created by the agreement noted above, which, in my opinion, cannot be characterized as an assignment of book debts in another form. When these debts, the proceeds of the sale of the s. 88 security, come into existence they are subject to the agreement between bank and customer. As between these two the customer has nothing to assign to the bank. The actual assignment of book debts which was signed does no more than facilitate collection. Any other assignment, whether general or specific, of these debts by the customer to a third party would fail unless the third party was an innocent purchaser for value without notice.\nIn Union Bank of Halifax v. Spinney and Churchill3, the proceeds of the sale of the bank's security came into the hands of Spinney, a third party, who was a guarantor of the customer's account with the bank. The proceeds were in the form of drafts drawn in favour of the guarantor instead of the bank, as they should have been. Spinney took with knowledge that the drafts were in payment for meal, ground from corn, on which the bank held security and he was held liable to account. I can find in the report no mention of any written agreement similar to the one in existence in the present case but it is clear that the oral understanding between bank and customer was to the same effect. Any other understanding would be inconceivable in commercial dealings. Why would any lender who lends for the purpose of enabling another to acquire and manufacture goods, permit the sale of goods on which he holds security except on terms that the borrower must bring in the proceeds of the sale of those goods?\nRe Goodfallow, Traders' Bank v. Goodfallow4 is a similar case. The contest there was between the bank and the administrator of the deceased customer. The customer was a miller who had given a warehouse receipt to the bank. At the date of his death there was found to be a shortage of wheat which had commenced shortly after the warehouse receipt had been given. During the period of shortage some of the wheat had been converted into flour and sold. The proceeds were paid to the administrator, who was compelled to pay the money to the bank. The ratio of the judgment of Boyd C. is contained in the following short extract from his reasons: \"As long as the 'product' of this wheat can be traced, whether it be in flour or in money, it is recoverable by the bank as against the deceased and his administrator.\" Again, I can find in the report no mention of any agreement in writing, but even in its absence the principle is plainly to be spelled out that if you sell my goods with my consent, it is on terms that you bring me the money in place of the goods. Although the bank's customer does not sell as agent for the bank, he does not sell free of the bank's claim to the proceeds. There is an analogy with the case where goods are consigned to a factor to be sold by him and reduced to money. There has never been any doubt of the right of the owner to trace the money or any other form of property into which the money has been converted. (Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees, 11th ed., p. 561.)\nThe only other case to which I wish to refer is Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Lefaivre et al.5, where the Quebec Court of Appeal, on facts which cannot be distinguished from those of the present case, anticipated the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal. In the Quebec case the bank and customer had executed an agreement in the following terms:\nArt. 5: dans le cas de vente par le client des effets, en tout ou en partie, le produit de cette vente y compris les esp\u00e8ces, les effets de commerce, les billets \u00e0 ordre, titres et valeurs qui en seront la consid\u00e9ration de m\u00eame que les cr\u00e9ances contre les acheteurs, appartiendront \u00e0 la banque \u00e0 qui ils devront \u00eatre imm\u00e9diatement vers\u00e9s ou remis, et jusqu'\u00e0 ce versement ou cette remise le client ne les d\u00e9tiendra qu'en fid\u00e9icommis pour la banque. L'ex\u00e9cution par le client et l'acceptation par la banque des transports de dettes de livres seront cens\u00e9s r\u00e9sulter de la pr\u00e9sente convention et ne constitueront pas une reconnaissance de la part de la banque que le client a des droits ou un titre quelconque \u00e0 ces dettes de livres.\nThe contest was between the bank and the trustee in bankruptcy of the customer. The trustee contended that the accounts of the customer representing the proceeds of the sale of the s. 88 security were part of the assets of the bankrupt estate because they had not been validly transferred to the bank in acordance with Art. 1571 of the Civil Code. It was held that the use of the words \"en fid\u00e9icommis\" was merely an attempt to translate the English expression \"in trust\". The majority judgment is founded squarely on the ground that the claims against the buyers of the goods became the property of the bank by virtue of its s. 88 security and never were the property of the customer so as to be affected by the assignment in bankruptcy.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Scarth, Honeyman, Scarth & Simonsen, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fillmore, Riley & Company, Winnipeg.\n1 (1963), 47 W.W.R. 65, 44 D.L.R.

The appellant admitted liability for the sum of $151.45 for hospital premiums and expenses paid on her behalf under the Manitoba Hospital Services Insurance Act, but as to the balance she took the position that any amounts expended on her behalf by way of maintenance and welfare did not constitute a debt recoverable by action. Judgment at trial was given against the appellant for $2,000. This amount was fixed by counsel and was made up of $151.45 for hospital expenses and premiums and $1,848.55 for welfare payments. An appeal, restricted to the amount awarded in respect of welfare, was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, one member of the Court dissenting. With leave, the appellant further appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nSection 453(1)(c) of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173, empowers a municipal corporation, by resolution or by-law, to regulate and prescribe the conditions under which relief is to be given. This would enable such a corporation, if it so desired, to stipulate that any moneys which it paid out in the form of relief payments should constitute a loan and create a debt owing by the recipient to the corporation.\nIn the present case, however, no resolution or by-law of the respondent was pleaded. The question in issue was, therefore, whether the expenditure of moneys by way of maintenance and welfare, per se, gives to the municipal corporation the right to claim for the same in debt as against the person on whose behalf such payments were made. In the absence of a provision by resolution or by-law of the kind above mentioned, the respondent must establish that a right of recovery is conferred upon it by the statute.\nIn the absence of an express stipulation by resolution or by by-law that relief payments are in the form of a loan creating a debt owed by the beneficiary to the municipal corporation, the rights of such corporation to recover the same are limited to those prescribed in subss. (2) to (5) of s. 947 of The Municipal Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, dismissing an appeal from a decision of Bastin J. Appeal allowed.\nJ. F. O'Sullivan and S. I. Schwartz, for the defendant, appellant.\nK. G. Houston, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHall J.:\u2014The respondent municipality brought action against the appellant, claiming the sum of $2,594,92 being moneys expended by the municipality on behalf of the appellant, who was an indigent resident of the municipality, by way of maintenance and welfare from the month of March 1942 until the month of July 1961.\nThe appellant admitted liability for the sum of $151.45 for hospital premiums and expenses paid on her behalf under The Hospital Services Insurance Act, 1962 (Man.), c. 30, s. 17(7), but as to the balance she took the position that any amounts expended on her behalf by way of maintenance and welfare did not constitute a debt recoverable by action.\nThe relevant provisions of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 173, are to be found in ss. 453 and 947 which read as follows:\n453. (1) Any municipal corporation may provide, by resolution or by by-law,\n(a) for aiding in maintaining any indigent person who is a resident of, or found within the limits of, the corporation, at any workhouse, hospital, or institution for the insane, deaf and dumb, blind, or poor, or other public institution of a like character; or\n(b) for granting outdoor relief to the resident poor or those found within the limits of the corporation, and to such persons as are afflicted with any contagious or infectious disease who are unable, through poverty or other causes, to care for themselves; or\n(c) for regulating and prescribing the conditions under which such relief is to be given.\n(2) A municipal corporation, by by-law, may enter into an agreement with another municipal corporation providing that all or any portion of the liability for any indebtedness by reason of a person being a resident of the corporation or having a residence therein shall be assumed and paid by one or more municipal corporations in the proportions fixed by the agreement.\n* * *\n947. (1) Every municipal corporation, including the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface, shall, in addition to, or concurrently with, any other remedies, have the following remedies for the recovery of any debt, statutory or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of the County Court from any person indebted to it, other than another municipal corporation, that is to say:\n(a) It shall not be necessary for the corporation to issue a summons, but it may serve by registered mail upon the person indebted to it a certificate signed by the head of its council or, if directed by resolution of the council, by the treasurer of the corporation, and under its corporate seal, setting out the name of the person so indebted and the amount of the indebtedness and endorsed with a notice to the debtor that if he disputes the amount claimed he must file his statement of defence in the County Court, specifying it, within twenty days from the mailing of the certificate, otherwise judgment will be entered against him.\n(b) It shall, upon serving the certificate, file with the clerk of the County Court a duplicate thereof together with an affidavit proving that the certificate has been so served upon the debtor.\n(c) The serving and filing of such a certificate shall take effect, and judgment may be entered and all subsequent proceedings in the court be had thereon in the same manner, as if a special summons had issued out of the court.\n(2) Where any moneys are paid out or expended by a municipal corporation in connection with the maintenance, relief, support, hospital account, or burial, of a person or his or her husband or wife, or his or her child under twenty-one years of age, a statement over the signature of the head of the corporation or, if directed by a resolution of the council, by the treasurer of the corporation, and certifying what moneys have been so paid out or expended, may be recorded in any land titles office in the province.\n(3) From the time of the recording thereof the statement shall bind, and form a lien and charge for the amount so certified on, all the lands owned by that person or his or her husband or wife, or his or her executors or administrators, in favour of the corporation; and the lien or charge may be realized in the same manner as if it were a mortgage on the land executed by the owner thereof.\n(4) The certificate shall be recorded on its mere production without any affidavit of execution. (5) The statement, when recorded, shall from the time of its being so recorded be held to cover all moneys paid out or expended by the corporation in connection with the maintenance, relief, support, hospital account, or burial of the person, or his or her husband or wife, or his or her child under twenty-one years of age, after the date of recording thereof as well as before; and the statement and the lien or charge created thereby shall remain in force without renewal until discharged.\n(6) The lien or charge created by the statement may be discharged by the registration in the same office or a discharge executed by the head of the corporation or, if directed by resolution of the council, by the treasurer of the corporation.\nThe action was tried by Bastin J. who gave judgment against the appellant for the sum of $2,000. This amount was fixed by consent of counsel and was made up as follows:\nPremiums and hospital expenses paid under The Hospital\nInsurance Act \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 151.45\nWelfare payments \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 1,848.55\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal restricting the appeal to the amount awarded in respect of welfare, $1,848.55. The Court of Appeal2, Freedman J.A. dissenting, dismissed her appeal with costs. Leave to appeal to this Court in forma pauperis was granted on October 16, 1963.\nSection 453(1)(c) of The Municipal Act previously quoted empowers a municipal corporation, by resolution or by-law, to regulate and prescribe the conditions under which relief is to be given. This would enable such a corporation, if it so desired, to stipulate that any moneys which it paid out in the form of relief payments should constitute a loan and create a debt owing by the recipient to the corporation.\nIn the present case, however, no resolution or by-law of the respondent was pleaded. The statement of claim claims for moneys \"expended on behalf of the defendant by way of maintenance and welfare.\" The question in issue in this case is, therefore, whether the expenditure of moneys by way of maintenance and welfare, per se, gives to the municipal corporation the right to claim for the same in debt as against the person on whose behalf such payments were made. In the absence of a provision by resolution or by-law of the kind above mentioned, the respondent must establish that a right of recovery is conferred upon it by the statute. Freedman J.A. in his dissenting judgment dealt with the question in issue as follows:\nThe common-law position supports the defendant. Pontypridd (Guardians) Union v. Drew, [1927] 1 K.B. 214, 95 L.J.K.B. 1030, makes it plain that at common law there was no obligation upon a poor person, who has received relief, to repay what he had received. Unless, therefore, some statutory provision confers upon a municipality the right to recover by action moneys paid by way of relief, no such right can be taken to exist. It is the contention of the plaintiff\u2014and one that was upheld by the learned trial judge\u2014that such statutory authority is to be found, if not expressly at least by implication, in sec. 947 of The Municipal Act, R.S.M. 1954, ch. 173. It is accordingly necessary to examine this section and that contention.\nUnder sec. 947 (1) every municipal corporation is declared to have, in addition to, or concurrently with, any other remedies, the remedies thereafter set forth in the section for the recovery of any debt, statutory or otherwise. I pause here to say that before this section can be of assistance to the plaintiff it must first be shown that moneys paid out by way of relief constitute \"a debt\". Nowhere, however, does the statute so provide.\nIt is largely upon the provisions of subsec. (2) and (3) of sec. 947 of The Municipal Act that the plaintiff relies. Subsec. (2) specifically permits a municipal corporation to record in any land titles office in the province a statement certifying as to the moneys which have been paid out or expended by the municipal corporation for maintenance, relief or support of any person. Subsec. (3) then goes on to say that from the time of the recording thereof, the statement shall bind and form a lien or charge for the amount so certified on all the lands owned by that person, or his or her husband or wife, in favour of the corporation, and that the lien or charge may be realized in the same manner, as if it were a mortgage on the land executed by the owner thereof.\nIn short, the legislature has specifically provided that a municipality may charge a person's land or real property with the amount received by him or her by way of relief. This is a specific remedy which the legislature saw fit to provide. The defendant says that this remedy is exhaustive of the rights of a municipality, and that no right of suit for a debt is permitted.\nFreedman J.A. accepted this submission and, in my opinion, correctly.

The appellant admitted that he shot the bird for food. His defence was that under Treaty No. 11 made in 1921 he was entitled to hunt and shoot ducks for food regardless of any regulations or legislation, whether in season or not. The bird was identified as a female mallard duck. The conviction was set aside by the Territorial Court, which also expressed a doubt as to whether the duck was wild or domestic. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the conviction was restored on the grounds that the Act was valid legislation and abrogated any rights given to Indians by treaty. Leave was granted to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe doubt expressed by the trial judge as to whether the duck in question was a wild duck was a question of law alone, since the validity of this conclusion was dependant upon the true meaning to be attached to the words \"wild duck\" as used in the statute and regulations. There was no room for doubt that a mallard is a species of wild duck within the meaning of the Act, and under the circumstances the doubts expressed by the trial judge were only consistent with his erroneous opinion that a wild duck which once has been tamed or confined and is later found at large is not then a wild duck within the meaning of the statute. Hamps v. Darby, [1948] 2 K.B. 311, referred to. Accord\u00adingly the Court of Appeal and this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. On the merits of the appeal, the reasons and conclusions of the Court of Appeal should be upheld.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories[1], restoring the conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., and Mrs. E. R. Hagel, for the appellant.\nD. H. Christie, Q.C., and J. M. Bentley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal, pursuant to leave, by Michael Sikyea from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories allowing an appeal by the respondent from the judgment of Mr. Justice Sissons of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories who had allowed an appeal by the appellant by way of trial de novo from his conviction at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, on May 7, 1962, by W. V. England, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Northwest Territories for an offence contrary to subs. (1) of s. 12 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. The charge on which the appellant was convicted was that he\u2014\non the 7th day of May AD 1962 at or near the Municipal District of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories did unlawfully kill a migratory bird in an area described in Schedule A of the Migratory Bird Regulations at a time not during an open season for that bird in the area in the aforementioned schedule, in violation of Section 5(1) (a) of the Migratory Bird Regulations, thereby committing an offence contrary to Section 12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, Chapter 179, R.S.C. 1952.\nThe regulation mentioned provides that:\nUnless otherwise permitted under these Regulations to do so, no person shall\n(a) in any area described in Schedule A, kill, hunt, capture, injure, take or molest a migratory bird at any time except during an open season specified for that bird and that area in Schedule A,\nSection 12(1) of the Act provides that every person who violates any regulation is, for each offence, liable upon summary conviction to a fine of not more than three hundred dollars and not less than ten dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nPart XI of Schedule A to the Regulations defines the open season for ducks in the Northwest Territories as being from September 1 to October 15 inclusive.\nUnder s. 3(b) (i) \"migratory game birds\" include \"wild ducks\".\nThe appellant testified at the trial de novo before Sissons J. and in his evidence admitted having shot the duck which was in evidence as part of the Crown's case as testified to by Constable Robin. The appellant also said that he had shot the duck for his own use as food when he saw it swimming on a pond. This pond, according to Constable Robin, was in the open country in the Northwest Territories six miles out of Yellowknife.\nThe appellant's defence was in effect that he was a Treaty Indian, a member of the Yellowknife Band and that under Treaty No. 11 made in 1921 he was entitled to hunt and shoot ducks for food regardless of any regulations or legislation, whether in season or not.\nSissons J. made the following findings:\nTHAT the appellant was a Treaty Indian and one of the Band included under Treaty No. 11;\nTHAT on May 7, 1962 the appellant shot the duck for which he was being prosecuted;\nTHAT the duck was a female mallard.\nSissons J. then dealt at length with the contention that the appellant as a Treaty Indian was lawfully entitled to shoot ducks for food at any time of the year. He concluded his judgment by saying:\nI find that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application to Indians hunting for food, and does not curtail their hunting rights.\nHe had, however, preceded that finding with this statement:\nIt is clear that the evidence does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the female Mallard which was shot was a wild duck. In spite of the argument of the Crown, I cannot draw from the circumstantial evidence the inference that it was a wild duck. The Rule in Hodge's case is in the way. The accused therefore cannot be found Guilty of the offence with which he is charged.\nbut having said that, he immediately added:\nThe real defence and the important issue in this case is that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application to Indians engaged in the pursuit of their ancient right to hunt, trap and fish game and fish for food at all seasons of the year, on all unoccupied Crown lands.\nThe substantial question argued on the hearing of this appeal was whether the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, supra, and the Regulations made there-under apply to Treaty Indians in the Northwest Territories hunting and killing ducks for food at any time of the year.\nBut the point is validly made that an appeal to this Court in a case of this kind can be on a question of law alone and that if the statement of Sissons J. above quoted is a finding of mixed fact and law, no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal or lies to this Court. What the learned judge was deciding in the passage above quoted was that there was some doubt on the evidence as to whether the duck in question was a \"wild duck\" within the meaning of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The validity of his conclusion is dependent upon the true meaning to be attached to the words \"wild duck\" as used in the statute and regulations, and this is, in my view, \"a question of law alone\". See Vail v. The Queen[2]. A mallard duck is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as a \"wild duck\". It is also referred to in Canadian Water Birds, Game Birds: Birds of Prey, by P. A. Taverner as \"perhaps the choice duck of the wild-fowler\" and in the Catalogue of Canadian Birds by J. Macoun and J. M. Macoun, published by the Geological Survey of Canada as \"the most abundant duck in the Northwest Territories and British Columbia, breeding near ponds and lakes from lat. 49\u00b0 to the borders of the Barren Lands.\" Mallards are also referred to as wild birds in the publication Canadian Bird Names, published by the Canadian Wild Life Service, 1962.\nThe facts are not in dispute; the duck in question was a mallard which was shot on a pond some six miles from Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories in the month of May at which time such a bird found in this region would be in the nesting grounds area and would probably be starting to nest.\nThere is evidence that if such a bird were tamed it would be very difficult to distinguish it from one which was wild, and in fact an expert called on behalf of the Crown was unable to say whether the dead duck, which was an exhibit in this case, had been tamed during its lifetime, and it is this evidence which seems to have caused Sissons J. the doubts he expressed.\nThere appears to me to be no room for doubt that a mallard is a species of wild duck within the meaning of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and under the circumstances the doubts expressed by Sissons J. are only consistent with his having erroneously formed the opinion that a wild duck which has once been tamed or confined and is later found at large in the nesting area at a time when it would be likely to nest is not then a \"wild duck\" within the meaning of the statute. The contrary is the case. A wild duck which has once been tamed or confined reverts, on escaping, to being a wild duck in the eyes of the law. See Hamps v. Darby[3]. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nOn the substantive question involved, I agree with the reasons for judgment and with the conclusions of Johnson J.A. in the Court of Appeal[4]. He has dealt with the important issues fully and correctly in their historical and legal settings, and there is nothing which I can usefully add to what he has written.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed. There will be no order as to costs, counsel having stated that costs were not being asked for by either party, regardless of the result.\nAppeal dismissed; no order as to costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

The will provided that if he should die childless, this share was to be paid to the testamentary or legal heir of the deceased. At his death, the deceased left no children, and by his will appointed his widow his universal legatee. The Minister sought to tax this share of the residue as forming part of the estate of the deceased, on the ground that the deceased had had a general power to dispose of it within the meaning of ss. 3 and 58(1)(i) of the Estate Tax Act. The Exchequer Court affirmed the assessment. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe substitution created by the will of the deceased's mother did not lapse upon the death of the deceased leaving no children. The will provided for the possibility of the institute dying without children and in that event, which happened, named as substitute his legal or testamentary heir.\nWhen the substitution opened, the deceased's widow as substitute took the fund directly from the mother of the deceased and not from the institute, her husband.\nThe alternative argument that the deceased had such a general power to dispose of the fund as to bring the case within s. 3 of the Act, could not be upheld. Since the deceased could not dispose of the property to anyone but his testamentary heir, he did not have the power to dispose of it \"as he saw fit\" within the meaning of s. 58(1)(i). His widow took the fund not through the exercise of any power given to the deceased but because the deceased's mother had designated as substitute his testamentary heir. APPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming an assessment of estate tax made by the respondent. Appeal allowed.\nJohn de M. Marler, Q.C., and Terence O'Connor, for the appellant.\nPaul A. Boivin, Q.C., and Paul Ollivier, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment2 of Dumoulin J. pronounced on August 6, 1963, dismissing the appellants' appeal from the confirmation of an assessment of Estate Tax made by the respondent in respect of the death of the late Robert Newmarch Hickson.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts.\nRobert Newmarch Hickson died on June 19, 1960, domiciled in the Province of Quebec. He was survived by his widow, the appellant Dame Orian Hays Hickson; no children were born of his marriage; he left a will executed in notarial form on October 27, 1959. By this will he appointed the appellants his executors and after making a number of particular legacies gave the residue of his estate to his widow in the following words:\nAnd all the rest residue and remainder of the property real and personal moveable and immoveable of every sort nature and description of which I may die possessed or in which I may have any interest or over which I may have the power of appointment or disposal (including any lapsed legacies) I give and bequeath to my wife the said Dame Orian Hays Hickson as her absolute property.\nLady Hickson, the mother of Robert Newmarch Hickson, had predeceased him by many years, leaving a will executed in notarial form on April 22, 1931. After making a number of particular legacies she bequeathed the residue of her estate to be divided in equal shares amongst her five children but provided that the share of her son Robert Newmarch Hickson should be subject to the condition expressed as follows in Article IX of the will:\nI direct that one-half of the share of my son Robert Newmarch Hickson in the residue of my Estate, less the sum of Forty Thousand Dollars which I have given him some years ago, shall belong to him in absolute ownership, and the other half of his share I give and bequeath the usufruct thereof during his lifetime to my said son Robert Newmarch Hickson and the ownership to the children of my said son, and if he leaves no children to his heirs, legal or testamentary.\nAt the date of the death of Robert Newmarch Hickson, the executors of Lady Hickson held the last mentioned half of his share in his mother's residuary estate which had a value of $363,702.19. The question to be determined on this appeal is whether this fund forms part of the aggregate taxable value of the property passing on the death of Robert Newmarch Hickson.\nThe learned trial judge held that Article IX of Lady Hickson's will created a substitution of the fund in question of which Robert Newmarch Hickson was the institute and his children the substitutes, that since he left no children the substitution lapsed thereby vesting the full ownership of the fund in him and giving him \"a general power to appoint, appropriate or dispose of this property as he sees fit by will\". If I have understood the reasons of the learned trial judge correctly, it would follow from the finding that at the time of his death Robert Newmarch Hickson was the full owner of the fund, that it formed part of his estate and estate tax would be payable upon it under s. 2(1) of the Estates Tax Act (1958), 7 Eliz. II, c. 29, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\". In this view it would be unnecessary to consider the effect of ss. 3 and 58 of the Act.\nCounsel for the respondent supports the reasons as well as the judgment of the learned trial judge but also argues, in the alternative, that the judgment should be upheld on the ground that Robert Newmarch Hickson had such a general power to dispose of the fund as to bring the case within s. 3 of the Act.\nCounsel for the appellant, while not so admitting, was content to argue the appeal on the assumption that Article IX of Lady Hickson's will did create a substitution and I propose to deal with the matter on that basis.\nIt is clear that Robert Newmarch Hickson was the institute of the substitution, that its opening took place at his death, and that had he left children him surviving they would have been the substitutes. With respect, I am unable to agree with the learned trial judge that the substitution lapsed. The will of Lady Hickson provided for the possibility of the institute dying without children and in that event, which happened, named as substitutes \"his heirs, legal or testamentary\".\nBy the residuary clause of his will, quoted above, his widow was constituted the testamentary heir of Robert Newmarch Hickson; the character of the gift to her in this clause is that of a universal legacy; this character is not altered by the circumstance that a number of particular legacies had been made to others; this clearly appears from the provisions of art. 873 of the Civil Code.\nThe effect of the concluding words of Article IX of Lady Hickson's will, \"and if he leaves no children to his heirs, legal or testamentary\" is to give the fund on the death of Robert Newmarch Hickson to his testamentary heir. These words envisage two possible events, one that Robert New-march Hickson should die intestate and the other, which happened, that he should die testate. By article 597 of the Civil Code it is provided that the person to whom either abintestate succession or testamentary succession devolves is called heir and that abintestate succession takes place only in default of testamentary succession.\nWhen the substitution opened, at the death of Robert Newmarch Hickson, his widow as substitute took the fund directly from the grantor, Lady Hickson, and not from the institute her husband. It is so provided by art. 962 of the Civil Code.\nIn the simple case of a substitution created by X, of which Y is the institute and Z the substitute and the substitution opens on the death of Y, it is clear that the property would form no part of the estate of Y. The difficulty in the present case arises from the fact that the substitute is not named as an individual in the instrument creating the substitution but is designated, in the events that have happened, as the testamentary heir of the institute.\nThe alternative argument of counsel for the respondent is that, in these circumstances, by the combined effect of ss. 3(1)(a), 3(2) and 58 of the Act the fund in question is required to be included in the aggregate net value of the property passing on the death of Robert Newmarch Hickson. There is no doubt of the power of Parliament to enact that, by a statutory fiction of law, property shall, for purposes of federal taxation, be deemed to form part of the estate of a deceased person although it would not have done so under either the civil law or the common law. The ques- tion is whether the words used by Parliament have that effect having regard to the facts of the case at bar.\nThe sections referred to read as follows:\nSec. 3(l)(a)\n(1) There shall be included in computing the aggregate net value of the property passing on the death of a person the value of all property, wherever situated, passing on the death of such person, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing,\n(a) all property of which the deceased was, immediately prior to his death, competent to dispose;\nSec. 3(2)\n(2) For the purposes of this section,\n(a) a person shall be deemed to have been competent to dispose of any property if he had such an estate or interest therein or such general power as would, if he were sui juris, have enabled him to dispose of that property;\nSec. 58\n(1) In this Act,\n(i) GENERAL POWER\u2014general power includes any power or authority enabling the donee or other holder thereof to appoint, appropriate or dispose of property as he sees fit, whether exercisable by instrument inter vivos or by will, or both, but does not include any power exercisable in a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by him, or exercisable as a mortgagee;\nThe provision which imposes tax, if it is imposed, is s. 3(1)(a) and the question is whether Robert Newmarch Hickson immediately prior to his death was competent to dispose of the fund. Section 3(2) and s. 58 give extended meanings to the phrases \"competent to dispose\" and \"general power\".\nSubject to an argument made by Mr. Marier with which, for reasons that will appear, I do not find it necessary to deal, the words of these sections appear to provide that property is to be deemed to form part of the estate of a deceased person if he had power to dispose of it by will \"as he sees fit\". In my opinion, it is clear that Robert Newmarch Hickson had no such power over the fund in question. Article IX of Lady Hickson's will does not in terms confer any power upon him; regardless of the terms of her will he had the power, which every man has, to dispose of his own property by will or, by refraining from making a will, to die intestate and leave the distribution of his estate to the operation of law. In fact he chose the former course and, by that portion of his will quoted above, constituted his widow his universal legatee and therefore his testamen- tary heir. His widow takes the fund not through the exercise of any power given to Robert Newmarch Hickson but because Lady Hickson has designated as substitute his testamentary heir. It is true that Robert Newmarch Hickson was free to name anyone he pleased to be his testamentary heir and that the person so named would become as substitute entitled to the fund; but he could not dispose of the fund to anyone else. A simple example may be given. Suppose Robert Newmarch Hickson having made his widow his testamentary heir went on in the next clause of his will to provide that \"the half-share held by the executors of the late Lady Hickson pursuant to Article IX of her will shall be paid to my cousin X\". It is obvious that this clause would be without effect. A person who can name anyone he pleases to be the recipient of a fund but only on condition that he makes that person his testamentary heir cannot be said to be free to dispose of the fund \"as he sees fit\".\nI have reached the conclusion that Robert Newmarch Hickson did not have power to dispose of the fund by will as he saw fit and as it is clear that apart from the provisions of the Act the fund formed no part of his estate the appeal must succeed. This makes it unnecessary to consider the interesting question, raised by Mr. Marler, whether a person who has a power, however general, which is exercisable only by will and only in the event of his leaving no children can be held to be competent to dispose of the subject matter of the power \"immediately prior to his death\" and I express no opinion upon it.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and direct that the assessment be referred back to the Minister in order that an assessment may be made excluding the fund of $363,702.19 from the aggregate taxable value of the estate of the late Robert Newmarch Hickson.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

The Appellate Division reversed this judgment and made the declaration; it held that all the elements necessary to establish a partnership were present and that if the relationship between the parties had not been that of husband and wife, \"there probably would have been no argument that the appellant (now respondent) was not a partner.\" The husband appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Spence JJ.: There was evidence from which the Appellate Division could conclude that the parties were carrying on a business in common with a view to profit. This inference was drawn by the Court from the facts in this particular case, which were of an unusual character, but which were not in dispute, in view of the findings of the trial judge, which were not disturbed by the Appellate Division. The Court had not erred in drawing that inference.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The Appellate Division was wrong in holding that all the elements necessary to establish a partnership were present in this case; significant facts indicated otherwise, and above all there was no evidence of any agreement that a partnership should subsist between this husband and wife. Also, it was error to draw any inference of partnership from the usual conversations about a business and its conduct that one would expect between husband and wife who were living and working together.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Farthing J.

I do not have to decide whether, in a first Appellate Court, I would have been satisfied that the decision of the learned trial judge on this question ought to be reversed. I agree with my brother Martland that there was evidence from which the Appellate Division could decide as it did and, in my opinion, on the facts of this particular case we ought not to interfere with the unanimous decision of that Court.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Martland.\nAbbott and Spence JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The question in issue in this appeal is as to whether the appellant and the respondent, who are husband and wife, are partners in the bakery business carried on under the name of \"Bowness Bakery Co.\" at Bowness, Alberta. The definition of \"partnership\" in s. 2(c) of The Partnership Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 230, is as follows:\n\"partnership\" means the relationship that subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by unanimous judgment, held that \"all of the elements necessary to establish a partnership are present in this case and, if the relationship between the parties were not husband and wife, there probably would have been no argument that the appellant (now respondent) was not a partner.\"\nIn my opinion there was evidence from which that Court could conclude that the parties were carrying on a business in common with a view to profit. This inference was drawn by the Court from the facts in this particular case, which are of an unusual character, but which were not in dispute, in view of the findings of the learned trial judge, which were not disturbed by the Appellate Division. I am not prepared to say that the Court erred in drawing that inference.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nJudson J. (dissenting):\u2014In this action a wife is suing her husband for a declaration that she is an equal partner with him in a bakery business in Bowness, Alberta. The trial judge dismissed the action. The Appellate Division reversed this judgment and made the declaration.\nThe trial judge's reasons are founded upon a thorough review of the evidence. There is no doubt that the wife throughout her married life has helped her husband in the establishment and operation of several businesses, first in Germany before, during and after the war, and then in Alberta. The husband is the baker. The wife for many years worked almost as long hours as the husband and did everything she could to help in the business. Her efforts were fully recognized by the learned trial judge but he concluded that the explanation was not to be found in the existence of a partnership but because the parties were husband and wife.\nThe Appellate Division held that all the elements necessary to establish a partnership were present and that if the relationship between the parties had not been that of husband and wife, \"there probably would have been no argument that the appellant was not a partner.\" With respect, it seems to me that in so expressing themselves, they were considering a situation which would never have arisen between these two parties had they not been married and living together. It is the marriage and not business partnership that explains the relationship. It is inconceivable that any woman not a wife would have worked as this woman did without some business arrangement.\nI do not agree that all the elements necessary to establish a partnership were present in this case. I do not propose to repeat the examination of the evidence which the learned trial judge made, but the following significant facts emerge. The husband made the financial arrangements to start the business and he registered it in his name. There is some suggestion that he deceived his wife when he talked about the registration with her. The bank account was in his name. He made all the banking arrangements. The money for the support of the matrimonial home came out of this bank account on the husband's cheque. There is not the slightest suggestion anywhere that the wife was the agent of the husband to do anything in the way of binding the business. Above all, there is no evidence of any agreement that a partnership should subsist between this husband and wife.\nPartnership, it is needless to say, does not arise from ownership in common, or from joint ownership. Partnership arises from contract, evidenced either by express declaration or by conduct signifying the same thing. It is not sufficient there should be community of interest; there must be contract. (Porter v. Armstrong, [1926] S.C.R. 328 at 329, per Duff J.)\nThe dealings with real property and the income tax returns have some significance. One property was bought and put in the joint names of the husband and wife. Another property was bought and put in the wife's name but the husband refused to keep up the payments. The premises on which the bakery business is conducted are in in the husband's name. No income tax return was filed by the wife as a partner or in any other capacity. The husband made his income tax returns as sole owner and paid tax on the total income.\nIt is error, in my opinion, to draw any inference of partnership from the usual conversations about a business and its conduct that one would expect between husband and wife who were living and working together.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial. There should be no order as to costs in this Court or in the Appellate Division.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Judson J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Anderson & Cooper, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Shannon, Rowbotham & Cook, Calgary.\n",

Fraser Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1964: June 2, 3; 1964 : October 6.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Purchase of land for shopping centre and apartment house project\u2014Transfer of land to private companies for shares\u2014 Sale of shares\u2014Whether profit realized capital gain or income from business\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 3, 4, 189(1)(e).\nIn 1952, the appellant and an associate, both of whom were experienced operators in the field of real estate, jointly acquired four contiguous parcels of land, intending to build a shopping centre and apartment houses for investment purposes. The two associates then formed two corporations, and sold the land intended for the shopping centre to one and the land intended for the apartment houses to the other. The associates received all the issued shares of both corporations in equal proportions. Construction of a store was started on the shopping centre site, but before it was finished, the associates sold all their shares in the corporation holding that land, and shortly afterwards all their shares in the other corporation. The Minister assessed the appellant's profit as income. The assessment was confirmed by the Exchequer Court. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe associates were carrying on a business; they intended to make a profit, and if they could not make it one way, then they made it another way. The fact that they incorporated companies to hold the real estate made no difference. The sale of shares, rather than the sale of land, was merely an alternative method they chose to adopt in putting through their real estate transactions. The profit was therefore taxable as income.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, confirming an assessment made by the Minister for income tax purposes. Appeal dismissed.\nP. N. Thorsteinsson and James A. Grant, for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The appellant, together with an associate, both of whom were experienced operators in the field of real estate, bought vacant land in 1952, incorporated two companies to hold the land in two parcels, built on one parcel a store in the year 1953 and sold the store shortly before completion to Dominion Stores. The other parcel they sold at about the same time to a single purchaser. The mode of sale in each case was by way of shares, the appellant and his associate being equal shareholders in the two companies. The appellant claims that he made a capital gain. The Minister of National Revenue assessed the profit as income. The judgment of the Exchequer Court was that the profit was income. This is a bald outline of the problem involved in complicated dealings. But notwithstanding the complexity of the dealings, I think that both the issue and the result are plain and I would affirm the judgment of the Exchequer Court on the ground that the appellant made a business profit.\nThe appellant between 1937 and 1950 worked in the mortgage department of a large insurance company and there acquired some experience in real estate development and financing. He became associated with one Grisenthwaite and at the time of the trial was secretary of Grisenthwaite Investments Limited, which had been incorporated in 1950 with the appellant owning 49 per cent of the issued shares and Grisenthwaite owning 51 per cent. That company was in the business of construction and sale of commercial and industrial buildings. It had constructed and sold buildings to International Business Machines Limited and Singer Sewing Machines Limited. At the date of the trial it owned six buildings and one shopping centre. It also owned a number of subsidiary companies, one of them in the business of building houses and apartment buildings, three in the business of dealing in real estate, two limited dividend housing companies, one in the heavy construction business and lastly, one which owned a shopping centre.\nIn 1952, an official of Dominion Stores in charge of real estate, one Foster, approached the appellant to seek his assistance in locating and developing a Dominion Store in the Aldershot area near the City of Hamilton. Originally it was intended that this official, together with the appellant and one other person, would be members of a syndicate of three to be formed for the purpose, but before any lands were purchased, this third person dropped out. The appellant, who was dissatisfied with his minority position in the Grisenthwaite companies, then made a deal with Grisenthwaite that his project would, as between the two of them, be done on a 50-50 basis and not within Grisenthwaite Investments Limited. The appellant, on behalf of Foster, Grisenthwaite and himself, then acquired through a nominee four contiguous parcels of land totalling 132 acres for a total purchase price of $205,000. Upon the completion of the purchase of the land, Foster held a 50 per cent interest and Grisenthwaite and the appellant each had a 25 per cent interest. The land purchase was completed in the year 1952, but in the spring of 1953, Foster withdrew as a participant. His investment at that point was $60,000. He left this in as an interest-free loan to the appellant and Grisenthwaite.\nBefore the acquisition of these lands, a town planning expert had given an opinion that a shopping centre would not be economically feasible without an adjoining apartment dwelling project. For this reason, the lands which had been acquired were divided between two companies. 36.17 acres were transferred to Aldershot Investments Limited in June of 1953. The remaining lands were transferred to Aldershot Realty Limited in March of 1954. It was on the 36.17 acres held by Aldershot Investments that the Dominion Store was built. The appellant and Grisenthwaite were equal shareholders in each of these companies. In March of 1953 Aldershot Investments Limited sought a building permit for the erection of a supermarket. The Township of East Flamboro refused this building permit. There were mandamus proceedings which were settled in June of 1953 by the issue of a building permit for a supermarket but it was apparent by this time that zoning regulations would prevent apartment building on the lands which had been conveyed to Aldershot Realty Limited.\nBarclay Construction Company Limited, a subsidiary of Grisenthwaite Investments Limited, undertook the construction of the supermarket. In the fall of 1953 a competitor of Dominion Stores approached the appellant with a view to acquiring a site on the lands owned by Aldershot Investments Limited. Dominion Stores objected and offered to buy out Aldershot Investments Limited either by purchase of assets or shares. The transaction was completed by a sale of the shares of Aldershot Investments Limited on April 14,1954. The appellant realized a profit of $140,198.38. This is one of the items in dispute.\nThe appellant in his evidence stated that it was his intention in acquiring the lands and that it was also the intention of Aldershot Investments Limited, to develop the lands acquired by that company as a shopping centre and to hold them as a long-term investment. However, it should be noted that the town planning expert had told them that a shopping centre would not be economically feasible without the nearby apartment development. This advice had been given in 1952 and the dispute with the township knocked out any possibility of any such development. The adjoining lands were zoned for single residence dwellings.\nIn August of 1952 the appellant, in a letter to Dominion Stores, had mentioned two possibilities, rental of the proposed store to Dominion Stores Limited or, in the alternative, an outright sale. In October of 1952, in correspondence with Dominion Stores, the appellant was saying that he and his associate would like to build the building on their own account and lease it to Dominion Stores for a 25 or 30 year lease.\nThe fact is, however, that this one store was built by the two associates operating through a construction company, which was a subsidiary of Grisenthwaite Investments, and sold to Dominion Stores. This is all that happened. The agreement of sale was made in April of 1954 when the store was about 80 per cent completed. Dominion Stores agreed to buy all the shares of the appellant and Grisenthwaite for $360,000 cash, subject to the condition that the liabilities of Aldershot Investments should not exceed $350,000, which sum included $297,000 payable to the contractor, Barclay Construction Company, which up to that date had been paid nothing. The agreement was carried out and the purchase price divided equally between the appellant and Grisenthwaite. The appellant's profit on the sale of these shares was $140,198.38, which the Minister, in making his re-assessment, added to the appellant's reported income.\nCameron J., accepted the evidence of the appellant that when the two associates acquired the property, they did intend to attempt to develop the property for rental purposes. He calls this their dominant intention and he says that he is far from satisfied that it was their sole intention at any time. He also finds that they intended to sell at least part of the property if they were unsuccessful in developing it as they planned. His conclusion is contained in the following extract from his reasons:\nIn my view, the whole scheme was of a speculative nature in which the promoters envisaged the possibility that if they could not complete their plans to build and retain as investments a shopping centre and apartments, a profitable sale would be made as soon as it could be arranged.\nIn spite of the Judge's emphasis on primary and secondary intention, when applied to the facts of this case it amounts to no more than this. He was saying that two active and skilled real estate promoters made a profit in the ordinary course of their business, and this they obviously did. They were carrying on a business; they intended to make a profit, and if they could not make it one way, then they made it another way.\nThe same observations apply to the sale of the shares of Aldershot Realty Limited. The contract for the sale of these shares was made in April of 1954 and completed in 1955. On this transaction the appellant made a profit of $23,498.88. This was added by the Minister to his 1954 income. The profit on this sale, however, was realized in 1955 and should have been assessed in that year. This is the only change made by Cameron J. in the re-assessment and there is no cross-appeal on this point.\nSome point was made of the fact that the appellant did not in one case sell a store and in the other case vacant land but shares in two companies. I agree with Cameron J. that this was merely an alternative method that they chose to adopt in putting through their real estate transactions. The fact that they incorporated companies to hold the real estate makes no difference. Associated London Properties, Ltd. v. Henriksen (H. M.

Irwin Respondent.\n1964: May 13, 14; 1964: October 6.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Profit from sale of oil interests by petroleum engineer\u2014Whether business income\u2014Computation of profit\u2014Valuation of inventory\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 3, 14(1), 14(2), 139(1)(e),139(1)(w).\nOver a number of years, the respondent, a petroleum engineer, acquired interests in prospective oil lands and in 1952, 1953 and 1955 disposed of some of them for cash payments and reservations of a royalty. The payments received were in excess of the cost to him of such rights. The Minister added to his reported income for 1952, 1953 and 1955 the profits realized on the sale of these rights on the ground that he was a trader in oil interests. The Income Tax Appeal Board confirmed the assessments. The Exchequer Court held that the respondent was a trader in oil interests, but ruled that under the combined effect of s. 14(2) of the Act and reg. 1800 of the Regulations, he was entitled to bring such interests into computation of profit as property described in an inventory and valued at fair market value, although such market value was considerably higher than the cost. This method would place the profits in earlier transaction years, rather than in those under appeal. The appeal was therefore allowed. The Minister appealed this latter ruling to this Court and the respondent cross-appealed the finding that he was trading in oil interests.\nHeld: The Minister's appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe law was clear that for income tax purposes gross profits, in the case of a business which consists of acquiring property and reselling it, is the excess of sale price over cost, subject only to any modification effected by the \"cost or market, whichever is lower\" rule. That rule is based upon the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, and s. 14(2) of the Act gave it statutory recognition. M.N.R. v. Anaconda American Brass Ltd., [1956] A.C. 85, referred to. It was doubtful whether the combined effect of s. 14(2) and reg. 1800 made a change in that settled concept of profit. However it was not necessary to express an opinion on this point. The respondent did not in fact adopt the inventory method of computing income and, under the provisions of s. 14(1) of the Act, could not have done so without the permission of the Minister. Such permission was not granted. The respondent's profits were taxable and he was not entitled to adopt the fair value market method of inventory valuation.\nAPPEAL by the Crown and cross-appeal by the respondent from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, allowing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nG. W. Ainslie and G. F. Jones, for the appellant.\nJ. H. Laycraft, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J:\u2014The material facts in this appeal and cross-appeal are not in dispute. Over a number of years commencing in 1942, respondent a petroleum engineer acquired interests in prospective oil lands and in the years 1952, 1953 and 1955 disposed of some of these interests for cash payments and reservations of a royalty. The payments received were in excess of the cost to him of such rights.\nThe appellant re-assessed the respondent for his 1952, 1953 and 1955 taxation years as having carried on business as a trader in oil interests, and included in his income for those years the net profit arising from the sale and partial disposition of the rights referred to. These assessments were confirmed by the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nOn appeal to the Exchequer Court2, No\u00ebl J. held that respondent was a trader in oil interests but he accepted respondent's contention, that if he was a trader in such interests\u2014which of course respondent had denied\u2014they should be brought into computation of profit as property described in an inventory and valued at market value (although such market value was considerably higher than the cost) and allowed the appeal.\nA few weeks before the trial in March 1962, respondent had a statement prepared by an accountant, the witness Morton, showing what purported to be the fair market value of oil interests held by him at the end of the 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, and 1956 taxation years. Opinion evidence as to the fair market value of these interests in those years was adduced by respondent through a petroleum engineer, the witness Sproule. On the basis of that evidence the witness Morton also prepared profit and loss statements purporting to show that respondent had incurred a loss during the years in question.\nOn cross-examination Morton acknowledged that as an accountant he would not be prepared to certify the profit and loss statements prepared by him as accurately reflecting either the loss or profit of respondent from dealing in oil leases; that the statements were simply an exercise in arithmetic based on valuations furnished by Dr. Sproule; and that an accountant in preparing financial statements would not value inventory at market value if the market value was in excess of cost.\nThe Crown appealed the finding of the Exchequer Court that in computing profits respondent was entitled to value oil rights as though described in an inventory at their fair market value. The respondent cross-appealed the finding that he was trading in oil rights.\nAt the hearing before this Court, counsel for appellant was informed that we did not need to hear him in reply on the cross-appeal which would therefore be dismissed.\nSection 2 of the Income Tax Act, the charging section, imposes tax upon the taxable income of every person resident in Canada. Section 3 provides that such income includes income from a business, and s. 4 that income from a business is the profit therefrom for the year.\nThe basic concept of \"profit\" for income tax purposes has long been settled. A recent statement of the principle is that of Viscount Simonds in Minister of National Revenue v. Anaconda American Brass Ltd.3:\nThe income tax law of Canada, as of the United Kingdom, is built upon the foundations described by Lord Clyde in Whimster & Co. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, (1925) 12 T.C. 813, 823, in a passage cited by the Chief Justice which may be repeated. \"In the first place, the profits of any particular year or accounting period must be taken to consist of the difference between the receipts from the trade or business during such year or accounting period and the expenditure laid out to earn those receipts. In the second place, the account of profit and loss to be made up for the purpose of ascertaining that difference must be framed consistently with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, so far as applicable, and in conformity with the rules of the Income Tax Act, or of that Act as modified by the provisions and schedules of the Acts regulating Excess Profits Duty, as the case may be. For example, the ordinary principles of commercial accounting require that in the profit and loss account of a merchant's or manufacturer's business the values of the stock-in-trade at the beginning and at the end of the period covered by the account should be entered at cost or market price, whichever is the lower; although there is nothing about this in the taxing statutes.\"\nThe law is clear therefore that for income tax purposes gross profit, in the case of a business which consists of acquiring property and reselling it, is the excess of sale price over cost, subject only to any modification effected by the \"cost or market, whichever is lower\" rule. That rule as Lord Clyde indicated in the passage which I have quoted is based upon what he described as the ordinary principles of commercial accounting and s. 14(2) of the Act gave it statutory recognition.\nThis appeal has raised the question whether the inventory provisions of the Act and the Regulations have effected a change in that settled concept of profit. I doubt whether the combined effect of s. 14 of the Act and reg. 1800 of the Income Tax Regulations, to which I shall refer in a moment, has made any such change, and I am also doubtful whether, in any event, the inventory provisions referred to, are applicable in the circumstances of a case such as this where the actual cost and sale price of each particular piece of property are well established. However since I have reached the conclusion that the appeal succeeds on other grounds I find it unnecessary to express any opinion on these two points, and I therefore refrain from doing so.\nThe following provisions of the Income Tax Act, relevant to inventory, are applicable to the three years in issue here, 1952, 1953 and 1955:\n14. (1) When a taxpayer has adopted a method for computing income from a business or property for a taxation year and that method has been accepted for the purposes of this Part, income from the business or property for a subsequent year shall, subject to the other provisions of this Part, be computed according to that method unless the taxpayer has, with the concurrence of the Minister, adopted a different method.\n(2) For the purpose of computing income, the property described in an inventory shall be valued at its cost to the taxpayer or its fair market value, whichever is lower, or in such other manner as may be permitted by regulation.\n139, (1)(w) \"inventory\" means a description of property the value of which is relevant in computing a taxpayer's income from a business for a taxation year.\nThis definition was repealed effective July 28, 1955 and the following was substituted:\n(w) \"inventory\" means a description of property the cost or value of which is relevant in computing a taxpayer's income from a business for a taxation year.\nRegulation 1800 of the Income Tax Regulations reads as follows:\n1800. For the purpose of computing the income of a taxpayer from a business (a) All the properties described in all the inventories of the business may be valued at the cost to him; or\n(b) all the property described in all the inventories of the business may be valued at the fair market value.\nRespondent acknowledged on cross-examination that at no time had he kept any document of inventory or valuation of the petroleum oil and natural gas reservations or oil leases acquired by him, and in particular that he had kept no inventory record or account as required by the Act. During the period in issue here, the Respondent was required to report any profit from his business, and if he had used the inventory method he would have been obliged to calculate such profit on the basis of cost or market whichever was the lesser. This was so prior to the enactment of s. 14 of the Act and of reg. 1800 because that was the law as stated in the Anaconda case.\nAs I have said, the Respondent did not in fact adopt the inventory method of computing income either prior to, upon, or after the enactment of reg. 1800, and under the provisions of s. 14(1) of the Act he could not have adopted that method without the permission of the Minister. That no such permission was granted is obvious from the fact that the respondent first put forward his market values at the trial before the Exchequer Court. Moreover if he had been keeping inventories on the \"market value basis\", he should have reported income in respect of his transactions in earlier years, which he failed to do. The repeal of s. 14(1) in 1958 could not have the retroactive effect of permitting him to change the method of computing income after 1958 without the permission of the Minister in respect of years that were past when the sub-section was repealed.\nI would allow the appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal, and restore the assessments made by the Minister for the respondent's 1952, 1953 and 1955 taxation years. The appellant is entitled to his costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. S.

The respondent admitted taking cash from the parking meter collections and depositing cheques due to the municipality from third persons in the parking meter bank account in order to balance that account and finally destroying the records of the transactions with these third persons. Her defence was that she gave the money to the mayor of the municipality in the honest belief that he had authority to receive the same and that she took no money for herself. The mayor gave evidence for the defence and testified that he had been authorized by council to receive up to $2,600 per year in addition to his salary for charitable purposes. Nine cheques were used in this way. The accused admitted that all of these cheques, with the exception of the Beaudry cheque and the No\u00ebl cheque, were bona fide cheques payable to the municipality and should have been credited to other accounts and that these other accounts were falsified. As to the Beaudry cheque, the respondent denied having any knowledge of this transaction. Beaudry himself said that this cheque was for the purchase of a lot and that he had received a conveyance. As to the No\u00ebl cheque which was certified, the mayor said that No\u00ebl cashed this cheque with the municipality to meet a payroll; the accused said that she understood from the mayor that No\u00ebl was cashing the cheque to raise money in a hurry for a holiday in Florida; and No\u00ebl said that it was paid to the municipality as a deposit for services to be rendered to his company by the municipality. The Court of Appeal found non-direction as to these last mentioned cheques and ordered a new trial. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of the defence.\nHeld (Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As to the Beaudry cheque, the jury had the accused\u2019s explanation that she knew nothing about this particular item. They did not believe her. This aspect of the charge was adequate. As to the No\u00ebl cheque, the jury were entitled to consider all the circumstances\u2014the concealment, the falsification of books, the whole operation of the parking meter account for improper purposes and the fact that this was a certified cheque. There could be no possibility of confusion or lack of understanding on the part of the jury. The brevity of the judge\u2019s reference to this cheque had not and could not have had the slightest effect in bringing about any lack of appreciation of the issues or the evidence in the minds of the jury. They could come to no conclusion other than the one that they did, namely, that there could be no honesty or honest opinion of right in these transactions.\nThis appeal raised a question of law.\nThe accused did convert the money to her own use and the judge\u2019s instruction on this point was correct.\nPer Cartwright and Hall JJ., dissenting: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The question on which leave to appeal was granted was one of law and all of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal held that the conviction should be quashed were grounds the validity of which depended upon the answers given by that Court to questions of law.\nThe charge of the trial judge in regard to the evidence relating to the Beaudry cheque and that relating to the No\u00ebl cheque was insufficient. Since the trial judge instructed the jury that they should convict if satisfied that she had stolen the money represented by any one of the nine cheques, an Appellate Court could not know that the verdict was not based solely on the view that the guilt had been established as to the moneys represented by one or part of these two cheques.\nThere was also misdirection when the trial judge directed the jury that they could convict if they found that the accused converted the money in question to the use of the mayor since such a conversion would not be within the scope of the charge as laid. Parliament has seen fit to treat conversion to an accused\u2019s own use and conversion by an accused to the use of another person as two alternative modes of committing the offence of theft by conversion. Subject to the making of an amendment, the prosecution was bound by the description of the offence contained in the indictment. On the charge of the trial judge read in the light of the evidence, it was open to the jury to find that she handed to the mayor some or all of the moneys covered by the nine cheques, that she made use of none of these moneys for herself, but that she had no belief that the mayor had any colour of right to the moneys so taken. On these findings, it would not have been open to them to convict her of converting the moneys to her own use.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge failed to give to the jury the evidence as to the defence in a sufficient character to permit them to consider that defence. It has been held in this Court as a matter of law that the trial judge must review the substantial parts of the evidence and give to the jury the theory of the defence. There was therefore an appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 598(1)(b) of the Code.\nThe ground relied upon by the Court of Appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they could only acquit the accused if they found that she believed she was under a legal compulsion to obey the mayor\u2019s orders, whereas it was sufficient if she honestly believed she was justified in following his orders even though she was not bound to do so, was not well taken. The trial judge pre- sented to the jury the defence as it was made and then added that even if on the facts what was shown was a position weaker than belief in obligation and merely was belief in justification, it would, if established, have been a sound defence. But the ground relied upon by the Court of Appeal that the trial judge while he put the theory of the defence to the jury did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive way, particularly in relation to the Beaudry and No\u00ebl transactions, was well taken. In the light of the circumstances, it would seem that the trial judge was required to outline the evidence adduced by the defence upon these two transactions in some particularity. Failure to do so would, in essence, be failure to put to the jury the defence of the accused. Yet the reference to these two transactions was regrettably brief. This constituted non-direction amounting to misdirection and a new trial should be had.\nThe instruction by the trial judge on the form of the indictment that the accused could have been convicted had it been proved that she converted to her own use any sum was a proper instruction. When the accused took the funds she converted them to her use despite the fact that her use of them was to deliver them to the mayor.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent and directing a new trial on the ground of non-direction. Appeal allowed, Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nR.P. Milligan, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.A. Martin, Q.C., and B. Carter, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Crown appeals with leave of the Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which set aside the conviction of the accused and directed a new trial on the ground of non-direction. The Crown contends on this appeal that the verdict of the jury should be restored and that the judge\u2019s charge was adequate.\nThe accused was convicted on the following indictment:\nThat Adrienne Laroche did, between the 17th day of September, 1956 and the 17th day of May, 1960, at the Town of Eastview, in the County of Carleton, unlawfully convert to her own use money to the amount of $10,790.52, the property of the Municipal Corporation of the Town of Eastview and did thereby steal the same, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada.\nIn spite of the fact that the trial lasted two weeks, the issues in the case were simple. The accused was charged with taking money from the parking meter collections of the Town of Eastview. Periodically, the meters were emptied, the small coins counted and taken to the bank. Instead of being deposited in the proper account, the coins were converted into paper currency and brought back to the Treasurer\u2019s Department of the Town of Eastview and kept there. From time to time the Treasurer took money from this account and the total alleged to be missing is the amount mentioned in the indictment, $10,790.52.\nThis shortage had to be concealed in some way if the auditors were not to become aware of what was going on. The method adopted was to take a bona fide cheque payable to the Town of Eastview and put it in the parking meter collection account and deposit it in the bank. The parking meter account, therefore, showed no shortage. The account in the books of the town to which the bona fide cheque should have been credited was falsified or destroyed. Nine cheques were used in this way. They are as follows:\n(1)\nMillcraft (Ontario) Limited\n$ 906.81\nNov.\n26\/56\n(2)\nMillcraft (Ontario) Limited\n923.81\nJan.\n28\/57\n(3)\nA. Beaudry.\n1,000.00\nApr.\n25\/58\n(4)\nOttawa Gas Company\n347.99\nDec.\n5\/58\n(5)\nOttawa Gas Company\n1,231.05\nJuly\n28\/58\n(6)\nL.W. No\u00ebl Limited\n2,000.00\nOct.\n28\/57\n(7)\nC.L. Laroche\n977.00\nOct.\n4\/58\n(8)\nC.L. Laroche\n1,000.00\nSept.\n4\/58\n(9)\nC.L. Laroche\n2,404.65\nMay\n19\/59\n$ 10,790.52\nThe accused admitted that all of these cheques, with the exception of item No. (3), the Beaudry cheque, and item No. (6), the No\u00ebl cheque, were bona fide cheques payable to the Town of Eastview and should have been credited to other accounts and that these other accounts were falsified. There was some question about the Beaudry and No\u00ebl cheques and I will deal with the evidence on this later.\nThe accused commenced her employment with the Town of Eastview in the year 1947 as a clerk in the Treasurer\u2019s Department. In 1951, she was appointed Treasurer and Tax Collector and held this office until December 29, 1960. The accused admitted that she took cash from the parking meter collections and deposited cheques due to the municipality from third persons in the municipal bank account in order to balance the accounts, and she admitted that she destroyed the records of the transactions with the third persons. Her excuse was that she gave the money to the Mayor of the municipality in the honest belief that he had authority to receive the money and that she took no money for herself.\nLavergne, the Mayor of the municipality, gave evidence for the defence. He was also a member of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. He said that in 1955 and 1956 the municipal council wished to raise his salary to $5,000 from $2,400 but that he declined the increase because of the extra income tax that he would have to pay. He said that he made an informal arrangement with the council that he could draw in cash up to $2,600 a year to give to the poor and needy. He said that he did not exceed in any one year the total of $2,600 so authorized to be paid to him and that he used the money for the purposes stated. He did not keep any records of the amounts he received and Mrs. Laroche did not keep any records of the amounts that she gave to him.\nThis outrageous defence, coming as it did from two public officials of long experience, was put to the jury by counsel for the accused and by the judge. It was put to the jury by the judge with gravity and respect, without criticism and without commendation. This is the way counsel for the accused put it to the jury:\nIf Mrs. Laroche had an honest belief that what Lavergne told her to do was all right, that she could do it, and that he had power and authority to order it, and she believed that he had such power and authority to order it, then what she did in allowing him to take money and what she did in not entering up these records as they should have been entered up, in a proper accounting system, in my respectful submission, is not a crime\u2026whether Lavergne takes the money out of the box, or whether he tells her to take it out and give it to him, is immaterial in my respectful submission. If she honestly believed that Lavergne had the right, Council had said it is all right, charge it to whatever Department has the money.\nThis is the way the judge put it to the jury by way of summary after full discussion:\nNow here the theory of the defence as I understand it is that the accused honestly thought she was obliged to take this money as Lavergne had asked or ordered her to, because he was the Mayor, and had told her the Council had authorized him to have the money. Now if you believe her, or if you have a reasonable doubt in the matter, then you must acquit her, because she had not the fraudulent intent to steal.\nI now turn to the two items on which the Court of Appeal found non-direction. The first is item No. (3) on the above list\u2014the Beaudry cheque. Beaudry said that he gave his cheque payable to the town for the purchase of a lot and that he received a conveyance. The respondent denied having any knowledge of this transaction but the fact is that the Beaudry cheque, a bona fide cheque payable to the town, got into the parking meter collection account under her charge and was used at some date after April 25, 1958, to cover up the taking of the sum of $1,000. This was plain to the jury. They had her explanation that she knew nothing about this particular item. They did not believe her. This is what the judge said about the Beaudry cheque:\nThe same with the Beaudry cheque for $1,000. The accused said she does not know how that got into the Treasurer\u2019s drawer and gave no explanation for it at all, and as Crown counsel has suggested, it is a peculiar situation where a cheque for $1,000 would be kicking around with the Treasurer not being curious enough to make some enquiry to find out where it came from, or why it was there and what it was for, but this again appears to have been used for covering up the taking of monies.\nI think that aspect of the charge was adequate.\nThe second of the two disputed items is No. (6) on the above list, the cheque of L.W. No\u00ebl Limited. This company was in the construction business. The cheque was a certified cheque for $2,000 payable to the Town of Eastview and No\u00ebl said that it was paid to the town as a deposit for services to be rendered to his company by the town for the installation of sewer pipes and water mains. Lavergne said that No\u00ebl cashed this cheque with the town to meet a payroll. Mrs. Laroche said that she understood from Lavergne that No\u00ebl was cashing the cheque to raise money for a holiday in Florida and that he wanted the money in a hurry. These are the three explanations of the use of the No\u00ebl cheque referred to in the judge\u2019s charge, and they could not fail to be clear in the minds of the jury.\nThis is what the judge said:\nThe next one is in April and July of 1958 when we are told about the No\u00ebl cheque for $2,000, and we are given three explanations of how that cheque came to be in the Municipal coffers, and you will have to decide which, if any, of these stories you accept. I do not know that you have to accept any of them. The fact is it was put in there and apparently improperly used and not credited.\nNo\u00ebl was called as the last witness in reply by the Crown. He had by this time, of course, heard the explanations that he was cashing a cheque for a pay-roll or for a trip to Florida. He denied that he had ever cashed a cheque with the municipality and was again cross\u2011examined at length, much of it repetition of what he had gone through before. The next day the case went to the jury. The $2,000 cheque was fully dealt with by counsel for the accused and he put it to them that the cheque was cashed. Counsel for the Crown put it to them that it was for a building permit and that whatever the purpose was, it was payable to the Town of Eastview and had nothing to do with the parking meter account and that the only purpose of getting it into that account was to cover up a defalcation of $2,000. The jury heard all this evidence, argument and instruction from the judge. They were entitled to consider all the circumstances\u2014the concealment, the falsification of books, the whole operation of the parking meter account for improper purposes, and finally, the fact that this was a certified cheque that all the discussion was about. Why have a cheque certified in the afternoon if you are going to need cash? Why not get the cash instead of having the cheque certified?\nI cannot see any possibility of confusion or lack of understanding on the part of the jury. I have already said that in my opinion, the issues were plain. The jury knew what these issues were and were in a position to form an opinion on the credibility of the two witnesses I have mentioned. The brevity of the judge\u2019s reference to the $2,000 cheque had not and could not have had the slightest effect in bringing about any lack of appreciation of the issues or the evidence in the minds of the jury. In my opinion they could come to no conclusion other than the one that they did, namely, that there could be no honesty or honest opinion of right in these transactions.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the verdict of the jury and the sentence of the Court.\nI agree with the reasons of Spence J.\n(a) that this appeal raises a question of law,\n(b) that the accused did convert the monies to her own use and that the judge\u2019s instruction on this point was correct.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The course of the trial and the questions raised on this appeal are stated in the reasons of other members of the Court. I agree with what I understand to be the opinion of all the other members of the Court that the question on which leave to appeal was granted is one of law, that all of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal[2] held that the conviction should be quashed were grounds the validity of which depended upon the answers given by that Court to questions of law and that, consequently, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Spence and those given by McLennan J.A. I agree with their conclusion that the charge of the learned trial judge in regard to the evidence relating to the Beaudry cheque and that relating to the No\u00ebl cheque was insufficient. This defect assumes added importance by reason of the fact that the learned trial judge had, in effect, instructed the jury that they should convict the respondent if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that she had stolen the money represented by any one of the nine cheques listed in the reasons of my brother Spence. An appellate Court cannot know that the verdict of the jury was not based solely on the view that the guilt of the accused had been established as to the moneys represented by one or both of these two cheques.\nMy agreement on this point renders it unnecessary for me to examine the other grounds of law which were raised in the Court of Appeal and on which counsel for the respondent relies. I wish, however, to deal with the one which was stated as follows in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal:\nThat the learned trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that they could convict the appellant if they found that she improperly converted the money in question to the use of Lavergne since such a conversion would not be within the scope of the charge as laid.\nThe charge on which the accused was indicted and tried was as follows:\nAdrienne Laroche did, between the 17th day of September, 1956, and the 17th day of May, 1960, at the Town of Eastview, in the County of Carleton, unlawfully convert to her own use money to the amount of $10,790.52, the property of the Municipal Corporation of the Town of Eastview and did thereby steal the same, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada. The relevant words of s. 269(1) of the Criminal Code defining the offence with which the respondent was charged are as follows:\nEveryone commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything\u2026with intent\u2026\nThe corresponding words of the Criminal Code prior to the coming into force of the present code were the following, in s. 347:\nTheft or stealing is the act of fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without colour of right converting to the use of any person anything\u2026with intent\u2026\nIn the present code Parliament has seen fit to treat (i) conversion to an accused\u2019s own use, and (ii) conversion by an accused to the use of another person, as two alternative modes of committing the offence of theft by conversion. The prosecution could, if so minded, have charged the respondent in the words of s. 269; in which case the defence might well have moved for particulars. However, when the prosecution sees fit to particularize in the indictment itself it is, subject to the making of an amendment in a proper case, bound by the description of the offence contained in the indictment.\nOn the charge of the learned trial judge read in the light of the evidence it was open to the jury to find, (i) that the respondent handed to Lavergne some or all of the moneys covered by the nine cheques, (ii) that she made use of none of these moneys for herself, but (iii) that she had no belief that Lavergne had any colour of right to the moneys so taken. If, as may be the case, these were the conclusions arrived at by the jury, it would have been their duty to convict the respondent, had she been so charged, with converting the moneys to the use of Lavergne; but it would not, in my opinion, have been open to them to convict her of converting the moneys to her own use. It may be observed that at no stage of the proceedings did the Crown apply for any amendment.\nIn the course of his charge to the jury the learned trial judge said:\nNow the accused further says she took or retained none of the money for herself, but she turned over every cent she received to the Mayor, and I must tell you it is immaterial to this charge whether she kept some, all or none of the money. In fact in the first instance when she took it, it was for use to do as she wished with, and the use she made of it was to give it\u2026or some of it surreptitiously I suggest to Lavergne. If she took it for his use entirely it still falls in the definition of theft as I gave it to you, which definition is imported into the charge by the definitions I read.\nFor the reasons I have given above on this branch of the matter, I am of opinion that this was misdirection fatal to the validity of the conviction; and on this ground also I would have upheld the order made by the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario[3] directing a new trial of the accused. The appeal is taken by leave of this Court granted on May 6, 1963, and the appeal was permitted upon the following question:\nWhether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of the defence?\nCounsel for the accused took the preliminary objection that the Court of Appeal had allowed the appeal and directed a new trial upon two separate and independent grounds: (1) that the trial was unsatisfactory because the trial judge, while he put the theory of the defence to the jury, did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive way, and (2) that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they ought to acquit the accused if the accused, honestly thought that she was obliged to give the money to the mayor and thereby conveyed to the jury the impression that they should acquit only if the accused believed she was under a legal compulsion to obey the mayor\u2019s orders, whereas it was sufficient, if she honestly believed that she was justified in following the mayor\u2019s orders even though she was not bound to do so. Counsel for the accused submitted that the first of those grounds was a ground of fact and that no appeal lay to this Court upon such ground. Where the provincial court of appeal has allowed an appeal on two grounds and no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada on one of those grounds, no appeal will be considered with respect to the other of such grounds because the appeal would be devoid of practical results: Ouvrard v. Quebec Paper Box Co. Ltd.[4] and The Queen v. Warner[5]. It is true that in R. v. Cohen and Bateman[6], the Court of Criminal Appeals held that a mistake of the judge as to the fact or omission to refer to some point in favour of the prisoner is not a wrong decision on any point of law but merely comes within the words \u201con any grounds\u201d as those words appear in s. 592(1)(a) (iii) of the Criminal Code, so that the appeal should not be carried beyond the Court of Appeal of Ontario, those words not appearing in s. 598(1)(b) of our Code.\nI am of the opinion that it has been held in this Court as a matter of law that the trial judge must review the substantial parts of the evidence and give to the jury the theory of the defence.\nThe present Chief Justice of this Court, in Azoulay v. The Queen[7], said at p. 497:\nThe rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them.\nIn the result, the appeal was allowed, the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side) reversed, and a new trial directed.\nIn Rex. v. Krawchuk[8], this Court considered an appeal by the Crown from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia quashing a conviction for murder and directing a new trial. In giving judgment dismissing the appeal, Kerwin J., as he then was, said at p. 223:\nA trial Judge need not refer to every piece of evidence but to omit to mention the only evidence upon one branch of the defence is an omission to place that defence before the tribunal of fact.\nThere is no word in the judgment as to any lack of jurisdiction to consider such a ground in the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIn Brooks v. The King[9], this Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which had dismissed an appeal by the accused from his conviction at trial. At p. 636 of the judgment, it is said:\nMisdirection in a material matter having been shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been charged, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty. That burden the Crown, in the view of the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non\u2011direction by the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances of this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within subs. (1)(c) of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code.\nThat section is now s. 592(1)(a) and yet the Court considered it.\nIn Kelsey v. The Queen[10], leave to appeal was granted the accused upon two questions. Question (a) being, did the learned trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence? Fauteux J. at p. 225 said:\nIt is suggested that the trial Judge should have commented on:\u2014\n(h) The lack of any evidence of blood or signs of a struggle in the victim\u2019s taxi which serves strongly to contradict the appellant\u2019s statement to the police.\nAnd at p. 226, commenting on this suggestion (h), said:\nIn law, the general rule as again stated recently in Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, is that the trial Judge in the course of his charge should review the substantial part of the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them.\nAgain, there was no reference to any lack of jurisdiction in this Court.\nDespite the sentence in the judgment of McLennan J.A. in the Court of Appeal, \u201cI have come to the conclusion that while the trial judge told the jury what the theory of the defence was, he did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive way and that the trial was unsatisfactory.\u201d, I have come to the conclusion that what the learned justice in appeal found was the failure of the trial judge to give to the jury the evidence as to the defence in a sufficient character to permit them to consider that defence and that that complaint was a matter of law and that, therefore, there is an appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 598(1)(b). The Court of Appeal of Ontario considered that such a failure to submit the defence of the accused to the jury had been established. I shall deal with that question hereafter.\nAt the present time I turn to the second ground of appeal relied upon in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they could only acquit the accused if they found that she believed she was under a legal compulsion to obey the mayor\u2019s orders, whereas it was sufficient if she honestly believed she was justified in following the mayor\u2019s orders even though she was not bound to do so. If the evidence given by the accused and her counsel\u2019s address to the jury are carefully perused, it will be demonstrated that her defence was, in fact, that she was told by Lavergne that he was authorized to take these moneys, that she believed he was so authorized (she regarded him as the mayor, or as her \u201cboss\u201d) and therefore that she was obliged to obey not merely that she was justified in obeying.\nSince that was the defence which the accused submitted in her evidence and which her counsel emphasized in his address to the jury, it was that defence which the trial judge should have submitted to the jury. The trial judge did so even prefacing this statement with the words, \u201cNow here the theory of the defence is as I understand it\u2026\u201d It may well be that the accused could have advanced a sound defence by merely establishing that she honestly believed she was justified in following the mayor\u2019s orders even though not bound to do so, and even when that belief was without foundation: Regina v. Bernhard[11]. The distinction, in my view, is academic as there could be no belief in justification which the accused could imagine except her obligation as a municipal servant to obey the mayor\u2019s orders. The trial judge, however, went farther having informed the jury of the defence of her belief in her obligation to obey the mayor\u2019s order, he charged them toward the close of his summing up in these words:\nIf you take the other view that she was honestly under the domination of Lavergne, and I pointed out to you the position in which he was there, as Mayor, with the power and prestige that he held, and that she thought she was acting honestly, and what she was doing was alright, or if you have any reasonable doubt about that, then you must acquit the accused.\nTherein, the trial judge stressed that the accused\u2019s honest belief that her actions were honest \u201cand what she was doing was alright\u201d was a complete defence. What counsel for the accused sought to do in the Court of Appear and here was to submit that the trial judge should have presented the accused\u2019s defence not as it was made but as it could have been made. The trial judge presented to the jury the defence as it was made and then added that even if on the facts what was shown was a position weaker than belief in obligation and merely was belief in justification, it would, if established, have been a sound defence. I am therefore of the opinion that this ground of appeal was not well taken and should not have been accepted by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal also allowed the appeal of the accused on the ground that the trial judge while he put the theory of the defence to the jury did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive way, particularly in relation to the No\u00ebl and Beaudry transactions. These transactions were two of the nine as to which evidence was adduced by the Crown to prove the total conversion of $10,790.52. It would seem an accurate summary of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to say that he regarded these two transactions as merely two of the nine and, in fact, he charged the jury very explicitly that even if the accused had not been proved to have converted the $3,000 represented in those two transactions but had been proved to have converted the sums involved in the other transactions, she should be found guilty. This shall be referred to hereafter but at this point we are only concerned with the importance of these two transactions. It must be remembered that the accused swore that she had not used the Beaudry cheque for $1,000 to replace any sum taken from the municipal coffers in order to give it to the mayor, Lavergne, and that she also swore that she merely cashed the $2,000 No\u00ebl cheque as a matter of courtesy when requested by the mayor to do so and gave the proceeds to the mayor to deliver them to No\u00ebl. Now there was the strongest evidence to throw doubt on the bona fides of the defence story as to either of these transactions and that evidence was referred to forcefully and properly by the trial judge in his charge, but the fact remains that if the defence evidence were true, then neither the amount of $1,000 in the case of Beaudry nor of $2,000 in the case of No\u00ebl was filched by the accused from the municipal treasury although both appeared in the deposits to make up the balance in the various accounts. Lavergne, when called as a defence witness, made no estimate at all of the amount received from the accused, and which he swore he used for various philanthropic gifts to citizens of the town, and persisted in this answer despite a very careful cross-examination. About the closest he came to such an estimate was to say that it was over $5,000 and not more than $2,600 per annum, i.e., $10,400.\nThe accused finally, in cross-examination, gave an estimated total of $6,300 as the amount which she had removed from the treasury upon the mayor\u2019s instructions and delivered to the mayor, but this was a most tentative estimate subject to qualification as to her ability to remember. The $6,300 in this estimate seems to be made up as follows: two Millcraft cheques for $906.81 and $923.81; a $1,200 Ottawa Gas cheque which was actually $1,231.05; another cheque which she described as a $900 cheque, i.e., the C.L. Laroche cheque for $977; and another cheque which she described as a $2,400 cheque, i.e., the Laroche cheque for $2,404.65. Those amounts total $6,443.32.\nMcLennan J.A., giving judgment for the Court of Appeal, set out the nine different cheques which were involved in the charge. Those cheques are as follows:\n(1)\nMillcraft (Ontario) Limited\n$ 906.81\nNov.\n26\/56\n(2)\nMillcraft (Ontario) Limited\n923.81\nJan.\n28\/57\n(3)\nA. Beaudry\n1,000.00\nApr.\n25\/58\n(4)\nOttawa Gas Company\n347.99\nDec.\n5\/58\n(5)\nOttawa Gas Company\n1,231.05\nJuly\n28\/58\n(6)\nL. W. No\u00ebl Limited\n2,000.00\nOct.\n28\/57\n(7)\nC.L. Laroche\n977.00\nOct.\n4\/58\n(8)\nC.L. Laroche\n1,000.00\nSept.\n4\/58\n(9)\nC.L. Laroche\n2,404.65\nMay\n19\/59\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the accused acknowledges the delivery to Lavergne of funds represented by cheques Nos. 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9 in that list. The Beaudry and No\u00ebl cheques are Nos. 3 and 6, so this leaves unaccounted for only cheques Nos. 4 and 8, 4 being an Ottawa Gas Company cheque for $347.99, and 8 being a C.L. Laroche cheque for $1,000. It is possible that the accused, in her most inaccurate memory of those cheques which she had used to cover deliveries of cash to Lavergne, forgot those two items. If the accused\u2019s story had been believed that neither the Beaudry nor the No\u00ebl cheques represented any deduction from the assets of the town, it might have gone far towards supporting, in the minds of the jury, her defence that in all other cases she had acted on the orders of Lavergne and honestly believed she was justified in so doing, or at least it might have raised in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt.\nIf, on the other hand, she was not believed on these two, the jury might well have felt that she had taken the $3,000 represented in those two cheques for herself personally and not to pass on to Lavergne, and so would have disbelieved her defence that she honestly believed she was under obligation to obey the orders of Lavergne. In the light of this situation, it would seem that the trial judge was required to outline the evidence adduced by the defence upon these two transactions in some particularity. Failure to do so would, in essence, be failure to put to the jury the defence of the accused. Yet the reference of the trial judge to these two transactions is regrettably brief. As to the Beaudry cheque, there is failure to point out the important fact that many persons had access to the drawer in which the cheque was kept and to the receptacles where the money in the various accounts reposed before such money was deposited in the bank, so that others beside the accused could have removed from these receptacles the amount equal to that represented by the cheque and cause the cheque to be placed amongst those to be deposited in the place of the cash. As to the No\u00ebl cheque, the brief reference thereto fails to mention the evidence of the accused that it was cashed from funds on hand merely as a courtesty, i.e., that it had been simply the delivery of money to the face value of a certified cheque after bank hours.\nIt is true, as has been pointed out above, that the evidence of the accused is contrary to much of the evidence proved on behalf of the Crown, and the jury might well have disbelieved the accused but since it was the gist of the defence the jury should have had called to their attention the evidence of the accused upon that theory of the defence, and, of course, quite properly, the evidence contra, so that they could have come to their decision whether the Crown had proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I, therefore, am in agreement with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the trial judge\u2019s failure to do so constituted non\u2011direction amounting to mis-direction and that a new trial must be had. That, of course, is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However, some other grounds argued by counsel for the accused before the Court of Appeal and either not accepted by that Court or not dealt with in the Court of Appeal should be referred to, although briefly. McLennan J.A., in giving judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nCounsel for the appellant argued that each of the nine transactions should have been made the subject of a separate count and since they were not the conviction is void for uncertainty because a general verdict on the indictment as it stands now does not reveal what amount the jury found that the appellant had stolen. This charge is, however, that the appellant between certain dates stole varying sums, in amounts and at times unknown, to a total sum of $10,790.52. In such a case it is proper to charge a general deficiency: Minchin v. The King, (1914) 23 C.C.C. 414. The proof of the nine transactions was necessary to show the general deficiency and apart from the first Millcraft cheque and the No\u00ebl cheque, if that was a substitution for cash previously taken, there was no relation in time between the takings and the substitutions of the cheques. If the charge had been that of falsifying records under section 340 it would of course have been necessary to set out in a separate count each of the transactions referred to, but that is not this case. The appellant did not apply for particulars before or during the trial under section 497 or to amend or divide the count under section 500. I would not be disposed to quash the conviction on these grounds because in substance the charge is of one continuous act of theft. In any event it is not a rule of law but one of practice that in cases like this the charge should be divided into as many counts as possible: Regina v. Tomlin, (1954) 38 C.A.C. 82. However, if there is a new trial it will be desirable and of assistance in directing the attention of the jury to the issues to be determined by them if either particulars are given under section 497 of the means by which the offence was committed by referring to each transaction or if that count be divided into separate counts so as to separate, at least, the first Millcraft transaction and the No\u00ebl and Beaudry transactions from the others.\nI am in agreement with the view of McLennan J.A. and have nothing to add thereto.\nIf McLennan J.A.\u2019s suggestion is complied with at the new trial, there will be no need to consider any question of the accused being found guilty as charged, when in fact some amount smaller than the total of $10,790.52 was proved beyond reasonable doubt. I must, however, express dissent from the submission made by counsel during the argument of this appeal that on the indictment if the evidence disclosed that only a lesser amount of money had been stolen the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty of that lesser amount but not guilty as charged. In my view, the instruction on the form of the indictment presented at the former trial that the accused could have been convicted had it been proved that she converted to her own use any sum was a proper instruction.\nThe submission that the accused could not have been convicted on the indictment as laid, in that it alleged that she had converted the funds to her own use while the evidence at trial showed that at any rate as to some indeterminate amount, perhaps $6,300, the accused had converted the funds of the town so that they could be used by the mayor, Lavergne, raises a rather difficult and important issue. To accede to the submission of the respondent\u2019s counsel herein, would enable an accused person to establish a sound defence by merely proving that the funds converted were handed over to the third party, be he a creditor or an ailing parent or an informal philanthropist such as Lavergne alleged he was. The trial judge charged the jury on the basis of the definition of theft in s. 269(1) of the Code that it mattered not whether the accused had converted the funds to her own use or that of another. Counsel for the accused, however, takes the position that the Crown had not charged theft generally, which would have permitted such an instruction to the jury, but had specifically charged the accused with conversion to her own use. It must be remembered that until the accused gave evidence in her own defence the allegation of conversion to the use of Lavergne had never been advanced. The answer to this contention, in my opinion, is that given by the learned trial judge when he said in his charge:\nIn fact the first instance when she took it it was for use to do as she wished with. And the use she made of it was to give it or some of it, surreptitiously, I suggest, to Lavergne.\nIn short, when the accused took the funds she converted the funds to her use despite the fact that her use of them was to deliver them to Lavergne. I distinguish cases such as R. v. Haurany[12] and R. v. Lurie[13], on the ground that there the charge was obtaining by false pretences while the evidence showed that what the accused did was to obtain the delivery of property to another by a false pretence and never had possession himself. In the latter case, Goddard L.C.J., at p. 118, said:\nIn this case, the cheques have been made out to the company, there is no doubt that the company was the owner of those cheques; it was always intended to be the owner. The only banking account into which those cheques could have gone was the banking account of the company.\nIn the result, I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, conviction restored, CARTWRIGHT, HALL and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C.

In the event of a claim being made by any policyholder to whom the plaintiff had sold a policy, it was the general practice of the company to send its own adjuster into the area and it was recognized to be part of the plaintiff\u2019s duty to introduce this adjuster to the policyholder and assist on the adjustment. On such an occasion, while returning to his office, the plaintiff suffered serious injuries when the automobile in which he was riding collided with a train. The automobile was owned by the company and was being driven with its consent by its adjuster, one L. The collision was caused solely by the negligent driving of L. The trial judge gave judgment against the company and L; on appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment against the company but dismissed the action against L. Both Courts proceeded on the view that at the moment of the collision the plaintiff and L were fellow servants of the company and acting in the course of their employment as such servants. A further appeal by the company was brought to this Court.\nHeld: (Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer curiam: Part II of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 437, did away with the defence of common employment in this case.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Spence J.: The relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant at the time of the accident was, for the limited purpose of the adjustment and on the limited occasion, not solely that of insurance agent and insurance company but was that of master and servant. The defendant owed a duty by implied term of contract to the plaintiff to take reasonable care to provide for his safety when he was engaged in the course of his employment, and there was by the negligence of L a breach of that duty, a breach for which the defendant as the employer of L was responsible in law.\nAlso, s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act gave the plaintiff a statutory right of action for damages which occurred \u201cby reason of the negligence of any person in the service of his employer (i.e., L) acting within the scope of his employment\u201d. There was no doubt that L at the time was certainly acting within the scope of his employment.\nThe plaintiff, therefore, was entitled to succeed either on the basis of the common law liability of his employer or on the basis of the statutory liability created by s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe argument that s. 50(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167 (now R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 105(2)) barred the right of the plaintiff to recover was rejected. If the plaintiff had a cause of action against his master by reason of the negligence of the master\u2019s servant, subs. (2) did not take it away, even though at the time it arose the plaintiff was being carried in his employer\u2019s motor vehicle. Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, [1945] O.R. 1, approved. All that s. 50(2) of the Act did was to bar recovery against an owner or driver. The action upon the tort was not barred against the employer.\nPer Judson J.: The appeal should be dismissed in view of the decision in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, which could not be distinguished from the present case and unless the Court was ready to overrule that case, it must govern.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: If, as argued by the plaintiff, it was decided in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, that although the liability for the injury caused directly and solely by L\u2019s negligence was taken away as against him the result was that, while L could not be sued, the liability remained and could be enforced against the defendant, then that decision was wrong and ought not to be followed.\nThe effect of s. 50(2) of The Ontario Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167 (now R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 105(2)), was not merely to afford a personal or procedural defence to the driver but to take away the passenger\u2019s right of action founded upon the driver\u2019s negligence.\nWhere the only breach of the duty to take care for the safety of the passenger, whether owed by the driver or the employer of the driver or the employer of the passenger, consists of negligent driving on the part of the driver and liability to the passenger for that negligence is negatived (not because of some personal immunity from suit possessed by the driver because of a particular relationship such as that of husband and wife existing between the passenger and the driver but by an express statutory provision applying to the case of every passenger who is being carried gratuitiously) the passenger\u2019s right of action is gone because the negligent act, liability for which is negatived, is as much an essential part of the passenger\u2019s cause of action against his own employer and of his cause of action against the employer of the driver as it is of his cause of action against the driver.\nPer Ritchie J., dissenting: By reason of the provisions of s. 105 (2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, the driver\u2019s act which occasioned the injury did not constitute a breach of duty giving rise to liability against him and accordingly the defendant could not be held vicariously liable for this act under the rule of respondeat superior because, as was said in Staveley Iron & Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones, [1956] A.C. 627, \u201cWhere the liability of the employer is not personal but vicarious\u2026 if the servant is immune so is the employer\u201d. The plaintiff was not in the car when the accident occurred pursuant to any obligation which was binding on him in the matter of his employment; therefore there was no direct personal duty resting on the defendant with respect to the safe carriage of the plaintiff.\nThe effect of s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was to make an employer responsible to an injured employee for the negligent acts of a fellow servant done in the course of his employment which caused such injury in the same way that the employer was responsible to the rest of the world for such negligent acts. That section did not have the effect of creating a personal liability in the employer if the injured employee was not acting in the course of his employment at the time when he sustained the injury.\n[Hughes v.

Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nB. O\u2019Brien, Q.C., and E. Sabol, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and J.J. Carthy, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 given on September 11, 1963, which dismissed the appeal from the judgment of Haines J. given on February 25, 1963, whereby he awarded damages of $16,800 in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe following questions arose and must be answered for the determination of the judgment herein:\n1. Was the finding of the learned trial judge that at the time of the accident the plaintiff Kearney was in a position where the defendant and its servants, including Livesey, owed to him a duty to carry him with due care correct? Haines J., at trial, found the plaintiff was in such a position, and continued:\nIf, however, it is necessary to put a label on the relationship, I find that for the limited purpose of adjusting the loss there was a master and servant relationship.\n2. Alternatively, was there a liability upon the appellant on the basis that Livesey was the appellant\u2019s servant no matter whether the plaintiff was or was not such servant or was s. 50(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, intended to take away the action of a gratuitous passenger against the master for the negligence of the servant? This alternative need only be considered if it is determined that the plaintiff was not in a position where he could require that he be carried with reasonable care, i.e., if proposition number 1 were decided against the plaintiff.\n3. Has the plaintiff an independent cause of action under s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which independent cause of action was not barred by the provisions of The Highway Traffic Act, supra?\nProposition one entails a finding that Kearney was a servant of the appellant and that Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug[2] was correctly decided. I am of the opinion that the finding that Kearney was a servant is very largely a finding of fact and a finding of fact which the trial judge expressly made upon what he described as conflicting evidence. That finding has been expressly approved by Aylesworth J.A. in his reasons in the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the appellant in this Court sought to avoid the effect of concurrent findings of fact below by purporting to put his case only on the evidence given by the plaintiff Kearney and by those witnesses called on his behalf. This still does not lessen the invulnerability of the finding of fact, which may be determined by a trial judge\u2019s scrutiny of a witness\u2019s testimony and particularly his testimony on cross-examination, so that the trial judge considering evidence as a whole comes to his opinion as to the facts and inferences which should be drawn from that testimony. In so far as the proposition entailed the finding of law, I am in agreement that the test of whether a master and servant relationship existed has been rightly put in many cases, and may be taken from Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 25, p. 452:\nIn general, the distinction between a contract of service and a contract for work and labour or for service is similar to that which exists between a contract of service and a contract of agency, namely, that in the case of a contract of service the master not only directs what work is to be done but also controls the manner of doing it whereas in the case of a contract for work and labour or a contract for service, the employer is entitled to direct what work is to be done but not to control the manner of doing it.\nThe evidence established that Kearney was an insurance agent employed by the appellant under a contract which contract was filed as exhibit 2. Paragraph 6 of that contract provided that the agents agreed \u201cto service policyholders satisfactorily and to report to home office promptly any new information affecting the desirability of a risk\u201d. The evidence established that, probably under the direction and insistence of the former district manager Lang, the plaintiff and others under contract as agents with the appellant company were constantly required to attend policyholders, discuss with them the settlement of claims, and as to certain types of claims actually adjusting the losses themselves. It is true that the plaintiff and other agents of the appellant company were insurance agents holding licence under The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, and that various sections of that Act entitled persons so licensed to \u201ccarry on business in good faith as an insurance agent\u201d but I am of the opinion that a person holding such licence may nonetheless at any rate on a specific occasion and for a specific purpose become the servant of the insurance company. It is also true that Aylesworth J.A. in Baldwin et al v. Lyons et al.[3], at p. 691, said:\nIt is quite clear, I think, and indeed no one has made any submission to the contrary, that so far as this agreement is concerned, the position of Lyons was that of an independent contractor. In my view, therefore, it would require cogent and unequivocal evidence to demonstrate that the parties in fact changed that relationship into one of master and servant.\nIt must be remembered that the plaintiff, when Livesey, the acting district manager of the appellant company, attended his office in Meaford and requested the plaintiff to accompany him to interview the policyholders, demurred pointing out that he was expecting to be engaged in some transactions in reference to his business as real estate agent. Livesey insisted, however, and the plaintiff not only accompanied Livesey to the policyholder\u2019s place of work but then accompanied Livesey and the said policyholder to the garage where the automotive vehicle, the subject of the claim, had been taken, there remained present during the interview between Livesey and the garage keeper, then returned with Livesey and the policyholder to the latter\u2019s place of work and there obtained from the policyholder his proof of loss.\nBefore the Court of Appeal, it was evidently argued that upon the latter duty having been completed, the service, if any, ceased and that therefore the plaintiff was not in the course of employment when he was injured as he was driven back to his own place of business. Aylesworth J.A., in his reasons, said:\n\u2026he had been transported to the place where the work of adjustment occurred in the car of the defendant Livesey and for the very purpose of engaging in that endeavour; he was entitled as part of their joint work as employees of the other defendant, to be returned in the same vehicle to the place whence he came; his employment in that endeavour continued, in our view, until that had been done.\nI agree with that statement.\nIn this Court, it was argued that the plaintiff was not a servant because he could have performed his task of servicing the policyholder in reference to the adjustment by driving his own automobile. I am of the opinion that the evidence refutes that suggestion. The district manager Livesey did not know where the policyholder\u2019s place of work was situated and had not met the policyholder. For the plaintiff to use his own automobile would have entailed the silly performance of two cars being driven down the odd few blocks to that place of work, one containing the district manager and the other containing the plaintiff who was to introduce the policyholder to the district manager. Similarly, as the same two men left that factory and proceeded to the garage, with whom was the policyholder to ride, the district manager whom he did not know, or the plaintiff whom he did know? I am of the opinion that the procedure of riding in the automobile driven by the district manager was the efficient way by which the plaintiff could carry out the duties which the district manager then and there directed him to carry out and that it was intended by the district manager that the said duties should be so carried out. Fleming in his valuable text on the law of Torts, 2nd ed., at p. 328, states:\nUnder the pressure of novel situations, the courts have become increasingly aware of the strain on the traditional formulation [of the control test], and most recent cases display a discernible tendency to replace it by something like an \u2018organization\u2019 test. Was the alleged servant part of his employer\u2019s organization? Was his work subject to co-ordinational control as to \u2018where\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 rather than \u2018how\u2019, [citing Lord Denning in Stevenson, Jordon & Harrison Ltd. v. Macdonald, [1952] 1 T.L.R. 101 at 111]\nApplying such an organizational test to the present case, it is noted that Haines J. in his reasons for judgment said:\nExhibit 8 is a selection of correspondence collected recently by the plaintiff. While it is written after the accident it indicates that in dealing with policyholders, the company referred to the plaintiff from time to time as \u201cour Meaford area representative, Bert Kearney\u201d and \u201cyour C.I.A. representative\u201d, or \u201cyour C.I.A. field underwriter Bert Kearney\u201d. No significance can be attached to the fact that these letters were written concerning claims several years after the accident. Prior to the accident the plaintiff did not have a stenographer and the company files which would contain similar correspondence have been closed long since. The plaintiff says that he has always been held out by the company in this manner and I accept his evidence.\nIn short, the respondent was part of the appellant\u2019s organization; his work was subject to co-ordination control as to \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d and in the case of the present action, as to \u201chow\u201d.\nFor these reasons, I do not believe that the finding of fact made by the learned trial judge and affirmed in the Court of Appeal, that at the time of the accident the plaintiff-respondent was, for the limited purpose and on the limited occasion, the servant of the appellant insurance company, should be disturbed. The fact that the respondent was a servant of the appellant, in my view, on the particular occasion while in other circumstances he may well have been an independent contractor is not fatal to his claim. Fleming, op. cit. says at p. 328:\nThe employment of a servant may be limited to a particular occasion or extend over a long period; it may even be gratuitous.\nSee Smith v. Moss et al.[4] to which further reference will be made hereafter.\nThe respondent certainly was injured by the negligence of his fellow servant Livesey, both being in the course of their employment at the time. Section 50 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, provided:\n50.\u2014(1) The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner\u2019s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from the motor vehicle.\nIt was argued at trial, in the Court of Appeal, and in this Court, that s. 50(2) barred the right of the plaintiff-respondent to recover. Certainly, the vehicle was not \u201coperated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation\u201d. Then under the words of the section, it would appear that neither the owner nor the driver of the motor vehicle was liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in or upon or getting on to or alighting from the motor vehicle. However, in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered a claim by a servant, Harrison, for damages caused to her when injured in the course of her employment riding with her employer Krug in an automobile driven by his employee McKenzie, due to the negligence of the said McKenzie. The same statutory provision, then s. 47(2), R.S.O. 1937, c. 288, was urged in defence. Gillanders J.A., giving the judgment of the Court, said at p. 10:\nThe contention that, in any event, the subsection is only intended to relieve the owner qua owner, from the statutory liability imposed by subs. 1, is a much more substantial contention.\nAnd at p. 13, after examining the defence carefully, said:\nThe provisions now being considered, being directed to the liability of the owner and driver, should be restricted to their liability qua owner and qua driver, and I think may not bar a right of action due to some other relationship. If the appellant has a cause of action against her master \u201cby reason of the negligence of his servant, subs. 2 does not take it away, even though at the time it arose she was being carried in her employer\u2019s motor vehicle.\nThe decision awarding Miss Harrison damages against her employer has been followed in the Courts of Ontario since that date. In the meantime, the section was re-enacted in 1950 as s. 50 and in 1960 as s. 105. It is true that The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 184, s. 19, provided:\nThe Legislature shall not, by re-enacting an Act, or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act or upon similar language.\nBut in Studer et al. v. Cowper et al.[5], where a like provision of the Saskatchewan Intepretation Act was considered, it was held that it merely removed the presumption that existed at common law and that in a proper case it will be held that the\u201d legislature did have in mind the construction that had been placed upon a certain enactment when re-enacting it. It cannot be doubted that the effect of the decision in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug was known to every lawyer and to every judge in the Province of Ontario from the date of its decision on and it is difficult to understand how the frequent statutory amendments to The Highway Traffic Act between 1945 and the present date and the re-enactment of the very section in identical words in both the Revisions of 1950 and 1960 would have occurred if the decision in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, has not represented the intention of the legislature. The case has been cited and either adopted or distinguished in many judgments at trial and in the Court of Appeal. I am, therefore, of the opinion that this Court is entitled to consider the fact that the decision has remained unchallenged for 19 years and that the legislative provision upon which it depends has been twice re-enacted in considering whether the decision is incorrect.\nCounsel for the appellant argued that the decision is contrary to that of the Court of Appeal itself in Hughes v. J.H. Watkins & Co.[6] and the decision of this Court in Dufferin Paving and Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger et al.[7] Gillanders J.A. considered that exact argument. Both of those decisions were decisions holding that the limitation section in The Highway Traffic Act applied generally and would bar an action in the case of Hughes v. J.H. Watkins & Co. by a pedestrian brought after the limitation period, and in the case of Dufferin Paving and Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger by a land owner whose property had been damaged by the vibration caused by the driving of trucks. Both of those decisions turned on the words of the limitation section, and are not decisions which require a general and all-inclusive effect to be given to the provisions of s. 50(2) of The Highway Traffic Act as it existed in 1957 and it still exists. I agree with the view of Gillanders J.A. in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, where he said at p. 13:\nI incline to the view that the essential difference between the limitation sections considered in the Watkins and Dufferin Paving cases and the section with which we are here concerned is that the limitation sections in the cases mentioned were of general application, affecting all actions \u201cfor the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle\u201d, while the subsection now under consideration only affects the liability of the owner or driver to a certain type of action. (The italicizing is my own.)\nIn my view, the history of the enactment of what is now s. 105 of The Highway Traffic Act and which was at the time of the accident in question in this action, s. 50(2) is significant. There was not, of course, at common law, any liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle for damages caused by the negligent driving of that vehicle when the driving was not that of the owner or of his servant. That liability was imposed in the Province of Ontario in the year 1930, by the Statutes of Ontario 1930, c. 48, which added s. 41(a) substantially in the same terms as s. 50(1) of the statute as it existed in the 1950 Revised Statutes of Ontario. In 1935 by the Statutes of that year, c. 26, s. 11, a second subsection was added to the then s. 41 which is in substantially the same terms as s. 50(2) of the Revised Statutes of Ontario 1950. During the intervening five years, Falsetto v. Brown et al.[8] came before the Courts. There, an accident had occurred on August 17, 1932, in a collision between a vehicle owned by one Brown and being driven by McMaster with the consent of the owner. In the vehicle were two passengers, Miss Falsetto and Hernden, both gratuitous passengers. Miss Falsetto, by her next friend, commenced an action against Brown and McMaster, the owner and driver of the automobile in which she had been a gratuitous passenger and against the owner of the truck with which that vehicle had come in collision, and at trial she was awarded judgment against all defendants. The owner of the truck alone appealed, and the majority judgment in the Court of Appeal held that the negligence of the driver of the automobile had been the sole cause of the collision so the appeal of the owner of the truck was allowed. The liability of the owner of the automobile to the gratuitous passenger founded upon s. 41(a) of the 1930 Statutes of Ontario, c. 48, and which had not been the subject of appeal was the situation which the amendment of 1935 was intended to cure. Gillanders J.A. in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, was of the opinion that it was the only situation which the amendment was intended to cure. I have come to the conclusion that he was correct when he said, at p. 13:\nIf the appellant has a cause of action against her master by reason of the negligence of his servant, subs. 2 does not take it away, even though at the time it arose she was being carried in her employer\u2019s motor vehicle.\nThe question arises then, did Kearney in this case have a right of action against his employer by reason of the negligence of the employer\u2019s servant Livesey? It is my intention to consider the matter, firstly, apart from the doctrine of common employment and the provisions of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 12th ed., at p. 783, said:\nAt common law a master owes a duty to his servant to take reasonable care for his servant\u2019s safety\u2026 This duty was described by Lord Herschell as \u201cthe duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, and \u2026so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk.\u201d The classic statement of the duty is to be found in the speeches of Lord Wright and Lord Maugham in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co., Ltd. v. English, [1938] A.C. 57 at 78 and 86.\nAt p. 86 of that case, Lord Maugham said:\nThe first proposition is that, subject as next mentioned, the employer is responsible to an employee for an accident caused by the negligence of any other employee acting within the scope of his authority. The maxim respondeat superior applies: Smith v. Baker, [1891] A.C. 325.\nSchroeder J.A. in giving judgment in the Court of Appeal in Jurasits v. Nemes[9], at p. 174 said:\nAt common law a master did not warrant the safety of the servant\u2019s employment. He bound himself to do no more than to take reasonable care to protect the servant against accidents.\nLord Abinger C.B., in Priestly v. Fowler[10], at p. 1032 said:\nHe [the employer] is, no doubt, bound to provide for the safety of his servant in the course of his employment to the best of his judgment, information, and belief.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that there is a duty by implied term of contract to the servant Harrison in the case of Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug and to the plaintiff-respondent in this case, to take reasonable care to provide for the safety of that servant when he is engaged in the course of his employment and that there was by the negligence of the defendant Livesey in this case, a breach of that duty and a breach for which the appellant insurance company as the employer of Livesey is responsible in law.\nThe question then arises whether the appellant is protected by the doctrine of common employment. That doctrine was first enunciated by Lord Abinger C.B. in Priestly v. Fowler, supra.\nThe defence was carefully defined and limited in Radcliffe v. Ribble Motor Services Ltd.[11], where Lord Wright said at p. 247:\nBut the limitations which I have explained and which for purposes of this opinion I wish to emphasize are based on the fundamental principle that there must be an actual contract between the employer and employee so that it may be possible from the nature and circumstances of that contract to imply, though by a fiction of law, that the employee undertook the particular risks of the negligence of his fellow employees.\nAnd at p. 249:\nBut it is clear on the authorities in this House that there is always the limit, however expressed, that it must be the same work in which the workmen are employed. They must be employed in common work, that is, work which necessarily and naturally or in the usual course involves juxtaposition, local or causal, of the fellow employees and exposure to the risk of the negligence of one affecting the other.\nGillanders J.A. in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, cited this and other authorities and was able to come to the conclusion that the plaintiff Harrison and the chauffeur McKenzie were not engaged in \u201ccommon work\u201d involving \u201cjuxtaposition, local or causal\u201d, and exposure of the risk of negligence of one affecting the other and that therefore the defence of common employment did not apply.\nThe learned justice in appeal proceeded, however, at p. 16 to say:\nIf I am right in concluding that common employment is not applicable under the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether or not the appellant comes under Part II of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, in which case in any event, by virtue of s. 122 of that Act, common employment would have no application. It is, however, probably desirable to express my view on this point.\nAnd then having considered the matter, at p. 17, said:\nUnder the circumstances here, the appellant, I think, falls within the provisions of Part II of the Act. In the present case, this Court is faced with the problem of whether the defence of common employment has been barred by the provisions of the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Haines J. said in his reasons for judgment (at trial):\nAs for the defence of common employment I find that it is not available to the defendants by reason of the provisions of Part II of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1960, ch. 437, sec. 125.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Aylesworth J.A. said:\nHere, but not in those decisions, the plaintiff was not a free agent as to his movements after completion of the work of adjustment upon which he and Livesey were engaged; he had been transported to the place where the work of adjustment occurred in the car of the defendant Livesey and for the very purpose of engaging in that endeavour; he was entitled as part of their joint work as employees of the other defendant, to be returned in the same vehicle to the place whence he came; his employment in that endeavour continued, in our view until that had been done.\nI am of the opinion that in this particular case the two employees, the plaintiff Kearney and the defendant Livesey, were jointly engaged in the very same work. Of necessity they were in such juxtaposition as might involve one in the consequence of the negligence of the other. In short, the situation was the exact one in which the defence of common employment as outlined by Lord Wright in Radcliffe v. Ribble Motor Services Ltd., supra, would apply. That defence, of course, is no longer available in the United Kingdom because of the provisions of the various employers\u2019 liability acts. The defence is, however, available in Ontario unless it is barred by the provisions of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That statute now appears as R.S.O. 1960, c. 437, and the sections are word for word those in effect at the date of the accident. Firstly, it should be noted that s. 1 provides:\n(j) \u201cindustry\u201d includes establishment, undertaking, trade and business; and\n(u) \u201cworkman\u201d includes a person who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, express or implied, whether by way of manual labour or otherwise, and includes a learner and a member of a municipal volunteer fire brigade, but when used in Part I does not include an outworker or an executive officer of a corporation.\nAnd ss. 123 to 125 provide:\n123. Subject to section 126, sections 124 and 125 apply only to the industries to which Part I does not apply and to the workmen employed in such industries, but outworkers and persons whose employment is of casual nature and who are employed otherwise than for the purposes of the employer\u2019s trade or business, who are employed in industries under Part I but who are excluded from the benefit of Part I, are not by this section excluded from the benefit of sections 124 and 125.\n124.\u2014(1) Where personal injury is caused to a workman by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of his employer or by reason of the negligence of his employer or of any person in the service of his employer acting within the scope of his employment, the workman or, if the injury results in death, the legal personal representatives of the workman and any person entitled in case of death have an action against the employer, and, if the action is brought by the workman, he is entitled to recover from the employer the damages sustained by the workman by or in consequence of the injury, and, if the action is brought by the legal personal representatives of the workman or by or on behalf of persons entitled to damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, they are entitled to recover such damages as they are entitled to under that Act.\n(2) Where the execution of any work is being carried into effect under any contract, and the person for whom the Work is done owns or supplies any ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises, and by reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of them personal injury is caused to a workman employed by the contractor or by any subcontractor, and the defect arose from the negligence of the person for whom the work or any part of it is done or of some person in his service and acting within the scope of his employment, the person for whom the work or that part of the work is done is liable to the action as if the workman had been employed by him, and for that purpose shall be deemed to be the employer of the workman within the meaning of this Act, but any such contractor or subcontractor is liable to the action as if this subsection had not been enacted but not so that double damages are recoverable for the same injury.\n(3) Nothing in subsection 2 affects any right or liability of the person for whom the work is done and the contractor or subcontractor as between themselves.\n(4) A workman shall not, by reason only of his continuing in the employment of the employer with knowledge of the defect or negligence that caused his injury, be deemed to have voluntarily incurred the risk of the injury.\n125.\u2014(1) A workman shall be deemed not to have undertaken the risks due to the negligence of his fellow workmen and contributory negligence on the part of a workman is not a bar to recovery by him or by any person entitled to damages under The Fatal Accidents Act in an action for the recovery of damages for an injury sustained by or causing the death of the workman while in the service of his employer for which the employer would otherwise have been liable.\n(2) Contributory negligence on the part of the workman shall nevertheless be taken into account in assessing the damages in any such action.\nIt will be seen that the determination of whether the respondent is entitled to plead the provisions of s. 125 as barring the defence of common employment depends on whether the respondent is a \u201cworkman\u201d. Section 125 applies only to an industry to which Part I does not apply. Then, was the business of the appellant Co-operators Insurance Association an \u201cindustry\u201d? In Lewis v. Nisbet & Auld Ltd.[12], at p. 345, Crocket J., giving judgment for a majority of this Court and in dealing with some of the words in the present s. 124 \u201cby reason of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant buildings or premises\u2026\u201d, said:\nIt will be seen at once that the enactment is a special one which was clearly passed to extend the liability of the employer in favour of the workman. It is an enactment, therefore, which ought not to be narrowly construed against the workman. No court has any right to add to it any condition which its language does not clearly express or necessarily imply. Rather is it the duty of a court, as said by Brett, M.R., in Gibbs v. Great Western Ry. Co. (1884) 12 Q.B.D. 208, at p. 211, in construing a section of the Imperial Employers\u2019 Liability Act (1880) to construe it \u201cas largely as reason enables one to construe it in their (the workmen\u2019s) favour and for the furtherance of the object of the Act.\u201d\nI accept that as a proper canon of interpretation in order to construe the meaning of the words \u201cworkman\u201d and \u201cindustry\u201d, and I am of the opinion that that course has been followed by the Courts of Ontario in construing this statute. In Jarvis v. Oshawa Hospital[13], Raney J. held that a hospital was an \u201cindustry\u201d within the words \u201cestablishment, undertaking, trade and business\u201d and that a pupil dietitian employed at the hospital at a salary of $8 a week was a \u201cworkman\u201d.\nIn Humphreys v. The City of London[14], Middleton J.A. in the Court of Appeal considering the question of whether a relief recipient required by the municipality as a term of obtaining relief to perform duties as directed by the municipal officers was a \u201cworkman\u201d said at p. 301:\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is intended to apply to all workmen and all employees, save in a case of farming or domestic or menial servants. These are excepted from the operation of the Act by sec. 122. Sec. 118 provides that secs. 119 to 121, that is practically Part II, shall apply only to the industries to which Part I does not apply and to workmen employed in such industries. (The italicizing is my own.)\nIn Wiznoski v. Peteroff[15], the Court of Appeal of Ontario held that a bakery employing less than five persons and therefore, excluded from Part I of the Act by the order of the Board was nonetheless an \u201cindustry\u201d to which Part II applied. At p. 206, Middleton J.A. said:\nI think this argument is fallacious, because by s. 1(i) of the Act \u201cindustry\u201d is defined to include not only the enumerated classes of industries,. but establishments, undertaking, trade and business; that is to say, it includes not only the generic but the specific.\nI am of the opinion that the enterprise operated by Co-operators Insurance Association is certainly an \u201cundertaking, trade or business\u201d and that therefore it is an \u201cindustry\u201d as defined in The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Similarly, I can see no reason why the respondent who I have held had at the time of the accident entered into or worked under a contract of service which was oral or implied is not a \u201cworkman\u201d as defined by s. 1(u) of the said Act. It should be noted that the service may be by way of manual labour or otherwise and that by s. 123 \u201coutworkers and persons whose employment is of a casual nature are not by that section excluded from the benefits of ss. 124 and 125 so that if the respondent were considered to be a person whose employment was of a casual nature in that he was only from time to time required to act as a servant in servicing the policyholder, he is nonetheless not excluded from the benefits of ss. 124 and 125.\nI have therefore come to the conclusion that the respondent is a \u201cworkman\u201d in an industry to which Part II of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act applies and that therefore by the provisions of s. 125(1) of that statute the defence of common employment is barred to the appellant.\nThe respondent also asserts a right of action by relying upon the provisions of s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That matter is not referred to in the reasons for judgment either at trial or upon appear but the respondent has asserted such right in his factum while the appellant, in its factum, confines its reference to the statue to an allegation that it has no application to the relationship between an insurance agent and an insurance company.\nFor the reasons which I have set out above, I have found that the relationship between the respondent and the appellant at a limited time and for the limited purpose of the adjustment was not solely that of insurance agent and insurance company but was that of master and servant. I find that the respondent was at that time a workman in an industry and I am of the opinion that s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act gives to the respondent a statutory right of action for damages which occurred \u201cby reason of the negligence of any person in the service of his employer (i.e. Livesey) acting within the scope of his employment\u201d. There is, of course, no doubt that Livesey at the time was certainly acting within the scope of his employment. He was engaged actively in the duty of adjusting a claim which was one of his main duties. I am therefore of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed either on the basis of the common law liability of his employer or on the basis of the statutory liability created by s. 124 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Therefore, I do not find it necessary to deal with the alternative submission of counsel for the respondent that the appellant is liable for the negligence of its servant Livesey on the doctrine of respondeat superior whether or not the respondent was also the servant of the appellant. That theory entails a startling explanation of the principle enunciated in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, supra, and one which in my opinion this Court should not make at the present time.\nThere remains to be dealt with the submission of the appellant that when the action against the defendant Livesey is barred by statute, i.e., s. 50(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, then there can be no liability of his employers. This submission was dealt with by Aylesworth J.A. in giving the reasons of the Court of Appeal in the following words:\nThe appellants took one other point upon which some observations might properly be made. In appellants\u2019 submission the master is excused if the servant who did the wrongful act to the plaintiff is excused. We cannot accede to that submission with respect to the case at bar for the simple reason that in our view the effect of section 105, subsection 2 of The Highway Traffic Act is not to condone a wrongful act by the driver of a motor vehicle qua driver but simply to bar the cause of action with respect to that act. The legislature, in our view, is quite free to do what it has done in a case such as this, namely, to bar a certain cause of action against a wrong-doer without in any way affecting the legal result of the wrongful act with respect to someone else liable for that wrongful act upon some principle of the common law.\nWith that view, I am in agreement and I am of the opinion that it is in accord with established jurisprudence. In Smith v. Moss, supra, Charles J. considered the case of a wife who sued her mother-in-law as the owner of an automobile in which she was riding as a passenger when she was injured by the negligence of the driver who was her husband. Charles J. held that at the time of the accident the husband was driving the car in the capacity of agent for his mother. At p. 425, the learned trial judge said:\nIt is said that the plaintiff cannot recover against her mother-in-law because the accident was caused by the negligence of her husband, and a husband cannot commit a tort on his wife. Strictly, that is right, but I cannot conceive that, if a husband, while acting as agent for somebody else, commits a tort, which results in injury to the wife, the wife is deprived of her right to recover against the principal who is employing the husband as agent. To take an extreme case, suppose that the plaintiff had been in the habit of hiring a car from a garage the proprietors of which employed, among a number of other men, the plaintiff\u2019s husband as a chauffeur. Suppose, too, that on a particular day, when the plaintiff had telephoned for a car, the husband should be sent out as driver of that car. If an accident happened, for which the husband was responsible, could it then be said that the plaintiff was deprived of her right to recover against the owners of the car? I do not think so, because the active operator in the tort, the husband, would have two capacities, (1) that of husband and (2) that of agent. In the present case the husband was, at the time of the accident, acting in the capacity of agent for his mother and it was his negligence alone, I hold, which caused the accident. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to succeed against her mother-in-law, the second defendant.\nIt is, of course, realized that Charles J. was not considering a case in which any such statutory provision as s. 50(2) of The Highway Traffic Act barred action against the actual wrongdoer. Smith v. Moss is cited merely to illustrate the proposition that an action may lie against the master even when it is barred against the servant.\nThe judgment in Smith v. Moss, supra, was considered in Broom v. Morgan[16], in the Court of Appeal. There, husband and wife were both employed by the defendant in a public house, the husband as manager the wife as helper. Owing to the negligence of the husband in the course of his employment as manager, the wife was injured. Denning L.J. said at p. 607:\nIt is said by Mr. Thompson that the liability of the employer is only a vicarious liability\u2014that is to say, that it is a substituted liability whereby a person who is not morally answerable is made responsible for the liability of another, and it cannot exist if that other is not liable.\nI am aware that the employer\u2019s liability for the acts of his servants has often been said to be a vicarious liability, but I do not so regard it. The law has known cases of a true vicarious liability; for instance, in the old days when a wife uttered slanders at a tea party with her friends, the husband was answerable for her wrongdoing, although it was no concern of his. I do not regard the liability of master and servant as coming into this category. The master is not liable when a servant does something \u201con a frolic of his own.\u201d He is liable only when the servant is acting in the course of his employment. The reason for the master\u2019s liability is not the mere economic reason that the employer usually has money and the servant has not. It is the sound moral reason that the servant is doing the master\u2019s business, and it is the duty of the master to see that his business is properly and carefully done. Take the case of a master who sends a lorry out on to the road with his servant in charge. He is morally responsible for seeing that the lorry does not run down people on the pavement. The master cannot wash his hands of it by saying, \u201cI put a competent driver in charge of the lorry,\u201d or by saying, \u201cIt was only the driver\u2019s wife who was hurt.\u201d It is his lorry, and it is his business that it is on. He takes the benefit of the work when it is carefully done, and he must take the liability of it when it is negligently done. He is himself under a duty to see that care is exercised in the driving of the lorry on his business. If the driver is negligent there is a breach of duty not only by the driver himself, but also by the master.\nDenning L.J. repeated his view in Staveley Iron & Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones[17]. In that case Sellers J. at trial considering an action by a workman against his employer for damages caused by an accident occurring in the course of employment had applied Caswell v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd.[18] to find that the plaintiff had not been guilty of contributory negligence and then applied the same standard to find that the defendant company\u2019s servant also was not guilty of negligence, and in consequence dismissed the action. In the Court of Appeal (Denning, Hodson and Romer L.JJ.) it was decided that the crane operator, the defendant company\u2019s servant, had been negligent in her conduct and that therefore the employer was liable for the damage caused to her fellow employee, the plaintiff Jones.\nDenning L.J. said, in the course of his judgment:\nHe [i.e., the employer] acts by his servant; and his servant\u2019s acts are, for this purpose, to be considered as his acts. Qui facit per alium facit per se. He cannot escape by the plea that his servant was thoughtless or inadvertent or made an error of judgment. If he takes the benefit of a machine like this, he must accept the burden of seeing that it is properly handled\u2026 It is for this reason that the employers\u2019 responsibility for the injury may be ranked greater than that of the servant who actually made the mistake: see Jones v. Manchester Corpn., [1952] 2 Q.B. 852, and he remains responsible even though the servant may for some reason be immune: see Broom v. Morgan, [1953] 1 Q.B. 597\u2026\nIn the House of Lords Lord Morton expressed disagreement with that statement and continued at p. 639:\nMy Lords, what the court has to decide in the present case is, was the crane driver negligent? If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d the employer is liable vicariously for the negligence of his servant. If the answer is \u201cno\u201d the employer is surely under no liability at all. And Lord Reid said at p. 644:\nIn Broom v. Morgan, [1953] 1 Q.B. 597, a husband and wife were fellow servants, and the wife was injured by the negligence of the husband. She recovered damages from her employer although she could not sue her husband. But although the husband could not be sued, his injuring his wife was a wrongful act on his part, and again this case is to my mind no authority for a master being liable for an act which it was not wrongful for a servant to do. (The italicizing is my own.)\nI am of the view that the last statement of Lord Reid supplies the answer to the appellant\u2019s argument that when the action against the defendant Livesey is barred by statute there can be no liability on Livesey\u2019s employer. The employer is being held liable for an act of Livesey\u2019s which was wrongful and the employer is being held because Livesey did that act in the course of his (Livesey\u2019s) employment. The actual words of the statutory bar of action against Livesey are significant:\nNotwithstanding subsection (1) the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to\u2026 (The italicizing is my own.)\nThere is in these words no declaration that the act is in any way a rightful as distinguished from a wrongful act and, of course, a negligence is quite plainly a tort. All the statute does is to bar recovery against an owner or driver for part of the damage which may flow from the tort. It would be interesting to speculate what would occur if a gratuitous passenger had on his knees a precious object of art which was destroyed in a collision due to the driver\u2019s negligence although the passenger was unharmed. The action upon the tort is not barred against the employer.\nAfter the decision of the House of Lords in Staveley Iron & Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones, supra, McNair J. in Harvey v. R.G. O\u2019Dell Ltd. et al.[19], considered an action by one servant against his master based on the negligence of a fellow servant and gave judgment for the plaintiff despite the circumstance that the period of limitations had run out against the personal representative of the deceased servant so she could not be sued nor made the subject of a claim for indemnification by the employer. Therefore, McNair J. came to the same conclusion as to the existence of the master\u2019s liability despite the servant\u2019s representative\u2019s protection from liability as did the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal in the present case did, in my opinion, correctly. For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts out of which this appeal arises and the conclusions arrived at in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie and those of my brother Spence. The questions of difficulty are not as to the facts but as to the law.\nThe following facts are undisputed. The respondent suffered serious injuries when the automobile in which he was riding collided with a train. The automobile was owned by the appellant and was being driven with its consent by its employee Livesey. The collision was caused solely by the negligent driving of Livesey.\nThe Courts below have proceeded on the view that at the moment of the collision Kearney and Livesey were fellow servants of the appellant and acting in the course of their employment as such servants. For the purposes of this appeal, I accept the view that at the time mentioned, Livesey was a servant of the appellant and acting in the course of his employment. Counsel for the appellant argues that the relationship between the appellant and Kearney was not that of master and servant at any time and alternatively that if it did exist while Kearney was engaged in assisting Livesey to adjust the policyholder\u2019s claim it had terminated, before the occurrence of the collision, when Kearney had done everything that was required of him by the appellant and was free and anxious to return to his office to deal with the real estate transaction which was awaiting his attention. There appears to me to be great force in this argument but for the purposes of this appeal I will assume, without deciding, that the contrary view taken by the Courts below is correct.\nThe judgments below are founded upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug[20]. In this Court counsel for the appellant submitted that the Harrison case was wrongly decided and alternatively that the case at bar can be distinguished from it on the facts.\nThe Harrison case dealt with the predecessor of s. 50 of c. 167 of R.S.O. 1950, which was in force at the date when Kearney was injured and which is now s. 105 of R.S.O. 1960, c. 172. Section 50 read as follows:\n50.\u2014(1) The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner\u2019s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from the motor vehicle.\nNeither in the Harrison case nor in the case at bar was the automobile in which the injured passenger was being carried \u201ca vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation\u201d and we are not concerned with the numerous decisions in which the scope and meaning of that phrase have been considered.\nAt common law the driver of an automobile owes a duty to a passenger being carried gratuitously in the automobile to use reasonable care for his safety and if as a result of negligent driving the passenger is injured the driver is liable to him for the damages suffered. If the automobile belongs to someone other than the driver that person is not liable at common law merely because he is the owner; his liability, if it exists, must be found in a relationship between him and the driver which renders him liable for the latter\u2019s negligence or in a relationship between the owner and the passenger which imposes on the former a duty to take care for the safety of the latter.\nSubsection (1) of s. 50 of The Highway Traffic Act subjects the owner to liability, which did not exist at common law, if his automobile is being driven with his consent; that liability is \u201cfor loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway\u201d. The foundation of this statutory liability is negligence in the operation of the automobile. The effect of subs. (2) which was enacted after subs. (1) had been in force for about five years, was to provide, subject to the exception with which we are not concerned, that neither the owner nor the driver should be liable for loss resulting from bodily injury to or the death of a passenger caused by negligence in operating the automobile. If the words of the subsection are plain and unequivocal the Courts must give effect to them although they bring about what, in the eyes of the common law, appears to be a grave injustice.\nIn the Harrison case, the defendant Krug, who was in poor health, decided to go on a long motor trip. He employed the plaintiff Miss Harrison to accompany him as a nurse on that trip. The car was owned by Krug and driven by one McKenzie who was held to be Krug\u2019s servant. Miss Harrison was injured in a collision caused solely by the negligent driving of McKenzie. It was held by the Court of Appeal (i) that although the predecessor of s. 50(2) relieved Krug from liability qua owner it did not relieve him from liability qua employer, (ii) that Krug as employer owed a duty (the precise nature of which is not discussed) to Miss Harrison, (iii) that this duty was breached by the negligent driving of McKenzie, (iv) that the defence rested on the doctrine of common employment was not available to Krug, and (v) that consequently Krug was liable.\nI agree with the conclusion of my brother Spence that, on the assumption I have made above as to the relationship of the parties at the time of the collision, the appellant is deprived of the defence of common employment by the terms of ss. 124 and 125 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The relevant wording of those sections as applicable to the facts with which we are dealing are as follows:\nSection 124:\nWhere personal injury is caused to a workman (in this case Kearney) by reason of the negligence of\u2026 any person (in this case Livesey) in the service of his employer (in this case the appellant) acting within the scope of his employment, the workman\u2026 is entitled to recover from the employer the damages sustained by the workman by or in consequence of the injury\u2026\nSection 125:\nA workman shall be deemed not to have undertaken the risks due to the negligence of his fellow workmen\u2026\nThe effect of these sections is to deprive the employer of a defence which was available to him at common law and to render him liable to his injured employee for the negligence of another of his servants acting within the scope of his employment to the same extent as he would have been liable to a person who was not employed by him but not to any greater extent. The foundation of his liability is the negligence of his servant who has caused the injury.\nAssuming, as I do, for the purposes of this appeal that Kearney and Livesey at the moment of the collision, were fellow servants of the appellant and acting in the course of their employment as such servants, it is clear that but for the provisions of s. 50(2) both Livesey and the appellant would be liable to Kearney. Counsel for the respondent, rightly in my opinion, took the position in the Court of Appeal and in this Court that Livesey is not liable to Kearney. Such a liability is expressly negatived by s. 50(2). It is argued, however, that although the liability for the injury caused directly and solely by Livesey\u2019s negligence is taken away as against him the result is that, while Livesey cannot be sued, the liability remains and can be enforced against the appellant. If this was decided in the Harrison case then, in my respectful opinion, that decision was wrong and ought not to be followed.\nThe error in the reasoning in the Harrison case arose, in part at least, from considering the effect of the words in s. 50(2) relieving the owner from liability rather than the effect of the words relieving the driver from liability. Gillanders J.A. said at p. 13:\nThe provisions now being considered, being directed to the liability of the owner and driver, should be restricted to their liability qua owner and qua driver, and I think may not bar a right of action due to some other relationship. If the appellant has a cause of action against her master by reason of the negligence of his servant, subs. 2 does not take it away, even though at the time it arose she was being carried in her employer\u2019s motor vehicle.\nHe does not appear to me to have given adequate consideration to the effect upon the liability of the employer, as such, of the act of the legislature doing away with all liability of his employee.\nIn my view the effect of s. 50(2) is not merely to afford a personal or procedural defence to the driver but to take away the passenger\u2019s right of action founded upon the driver\u2019s negligence. I am unable to impute to the legislature the intention to free from liability the one person whose negligence was fons et origo mali and at the same time to impose liability upon those, morally innocent of any wrongdoing, who would have been required to answer vicariously for the driver\u2019s negligence had he remained liable.\nSuch cases as Smith v. Moss et al.[21] and Broom v. Morgan[22] do not appear to me to assist the respondent. They were cases in which a particular personal relationship prevented the injured person from suing the individual driver. The nature of the immunity possessed by the driver was described by Denning L.J. in the last-mentioned case in the passage from his judgment (at pp. 609 and 610) quoted in the reasons of my brother Ritchie:\nIt is an immunity from suit and not an immunity from duty or liability. He is liable to his wife, though his liability is not enforceable by action; and, as he is liable, so also is his employer, but with this difference, that the employer\u2019s liability is enforceable by action.\nThis may be contrasted with the terms of s. 50(2) whereby it is liability which is expressly negatived.\nIn Dyer v. Munday et al.[23] both the servant and his employer were originally liable to the plaintiff for the damages caused by the assault committed by the servant. The conviction of the servant for common assault merely provided him with a personal defence.\nSome assistance in arriving at the intention of the legislature may be derived from considering what is now s. 2(2) of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261. This reads as follows:\n(2) In any action brought for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from a motor vehicle other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, and the owner or driver of the motor vehicle that the injured or deceased person was being carried in, or upon or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from is one of the persons found to be at fault or negligent, no damages are, and no contribution or indemnity is, recoverable for the portion of the loss or damage caused by the fault or negligence of such owner or driver, and the portion of the loss or damage so caused by the fault or negligence of such owner or driver shall be determined although such owner or driver is not a party to the action.\nThis subsection was first enacted by Statutes of Ontario 1935, c. 46, s. 2(2) which received Royal Assent on the same day as c. 26 of the same Statutes, by s. 11 of which the predecessor of subs. (2) of s. 50 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167, was first enacted.\nThe two provisions are clearly in pari materia. The terms of s. 2(2) of The Negligence Act appear to me to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature, for all purposes of determining whether liability exists, to identify a passenger who is being carried gratuitously with the negligent driver of the vehicle in which he is being carried. It appears to me improbable that the legislature would intend that such identification should operate to the advantage of a wrongdoer whose negligence in driving another car is one of the causes of the passenger\u2019s injuries but not to the advantage of the employer of the driver of the car in which the passenger is riding when such employer is morally free from any blame.\nWhere the only breach of the duty to take care for the safety of the passenger, whether owed by the driver or the employer of the driver or the employer of the passenger, consists of negligent driving on the part of the driver and liability to the passenger for that negligence is negatived (not because of some personal immunity from suit possessed by the driver because of a particular relationship such as that of husband and wife existing between the passenger and the driver but by an express statutory provision applying to the case of every passenger who is being carried gratuitously) the passenger\u2019s right of action is gone because the negligent act, liability for which is negatived, is as much an essential part of the passenger\u2019s cause of action against his own employer and of his cause of action against the employer of the driver as it is of his cause of action against the driver.\nIf the judgments below are upheld it appears to me that the plain purpose of s. 50(2) will be defeated as the appellant will be entitled to sue Livesey for indemnity in respect of the damages it is required to pay to Kearney. Such a right of indemnity appears to me to be recognized by the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in McFee v. Joss[24] and in that of the House of Lords in Lister v. Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co. Ltd.[25] As the question of the existence of a right of indemnity does not arise directly on this appeal I refrain from examining the other relevant authorities. A number of them are examined and discussed in an article by Mr. Glanville Williams in (1957) 20 Modern Law Review at pp. 220 and 437.\nIt is interesting to speculate oh the result which would flow from this Court upholding the rule laid down in the Harrison case if a case where the facts are similar should arise in a province where the right of recovery of a passenger who is being carried gratuitously is not taken away altogether but is limited to cases in which the driver is guilty of gross negligence. Suppose it is found as a fact that the driver was negligent but not grossly negligent, the result presumably would be that the injured passenger could recover from his employer who is also the driver\u2019s employer but not from the driver, and the employer in turn could recover indemnity from the driver. In my respectful view we should not uphold a rule which brings about such anomalous results.\nAs, for the reasons given above, I agree with the submission of appellant\u2019s counsel that the Harrison case was wrongly decided and that the right of action which the respondent had at common law is taken away by the terms of s. 50(2) it becomes unnecessary for me to consider the question, so fully argued before us, whether the case at bar can be distinguished on its facts from the Harrison case.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the respondent\u2019s action. I agree with my brother Ritchie that having regard to all the circumstances there should be no order as to costs in any Court.\nJUDSON J.:\u2014I agree with Spence J. that this appeal should be dismissed. My agreement is founded solely upon the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug[26], which cannot be distinguished from the present case and unless we are ready to overrule this case, it must govern.\nOn the findings made both at trial and on appeal, Kearney was injured in the course of his employment by the negligent driving of his fellow servant Livesey, who was driving a car owned by the common master, Co-operators Insurance Association. Although Kearney cannot succeed against the driver because of the provisions of s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, as a servant injured in the course of his employment he still has a right of action against his master and this right of action is not taken away by s. 105(2).\nPart II of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act does away with the defence of common employment in this case. Co-operators Insurance Association, the master and owner of the car, is liable to its first servant for the negligent driving of its second servant. There is a master and servant relationship between both passenger and driver and the owner of the car, as there was in the Harrison case. The passenger-servant is the plaintiff. He retains his right of action against the master notwithstanding the statute. I refrain from expressing any opinion on what would happen in any other relationship.\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[27] dismissing the appeal of the Co-operators Insurance Association from a judgment rendered at trial by Haines J, whereby the respondent was awarded damages in the amount of $16,800 in respect of personal injuries sustained by him while he was travelling in an automobile allegedly owned by the appellant and driven by its servant, one Edward George Livesey. The learned trial judge gave judgment against both the appellant and its servant, but the action against Livesey was dismissed in the Court of Appeal and it was assumed for the purpose of this appeal that he was not liable for any of the damage sustained by the respondent.\nThe respondent conducts a real estate and insurance business in the town of Meaford and at all times material hereto was an agent of the appellant \u201cin soliciting insurance and servicing policyholders\u2026\u201d under the terms of a written contract which was executed on July 2, 1955. In the event of a claim being made by any policyholder to whom the respondent had sold a policy, it was the general practice of the appellant to send its own adjuster into the area and it was recognized to be part of the respondent\u2019s duty to introduce this adjuster to the policyholder and to accompany them both while the loss was being adjusted. On these occasions the respondent was primarily concerned with maintaining good relations between himself and his company on the one hand and the policyholder on the other. The actual work of adjusting the loss was conducted by the company\u2019s adjuster. The learned trial judge has found:\n\u2026that both the company and the plaintiff considered it the plaintiff\u2019s duty to accompany the adjuster on request in the adjusting of losses with the policyholder. (The italics are mine.)\nOn November 26, 1957, Livesey, who was one of the appellant company\u2019s adjusters, drove to Meaford for the purpose of adjusting a claim for collision damage to the automobile of one Sewell who had been insured by the appellant through the agency of the respondent. On his arrival Livesey went to the respondent\u2019s office and asked him to make arrangements for meeting the insured and visiting the garage where the damaged car was. It appears that the respondent was busy with some real estate matters at the time and did not want to be disturbed, but on Livesey\u2019s insistence he agreed to leave the office and, although his own car was available, he went with Livesey so that they could discuss the claim before meeting the insured, and they drove a few blocks to the F. Stanley Knight Manufacturing Co. where Sewell was employed. When Sewell came out, Kearney introduced him to the adjuster and the three men drove together to the garage where Livesey discussed the damage with the garage proprietor and after making an arrangement for repairs, which appears to have been satisfactory to the insured, he drove with Sewell and the respondent back to the Knight Manufacturing Co. where Sewell signed a claim form and returned to his work.\nHaving performed the function of introducing the adjuster to his client and having accompanied them both to the scene of the adjustment where the insured appeared to be satisfied, the respondent was anxious to get back to his office and his real estate deal, and although his office was only a few blocks away he asked Livesey to drive him back there. It was on the way back to Kearney\u2019s office that the accident occurred.\nThe respondent\u2019s claim is framed on the assumption that the accident occurred after the work of adjustment had been completed and that the appellant was under a duty to provide safe transportation for the respondent while he was returning from the investigation after he had discharged his obligation to the company in respect of the Sewell claim.\nBy paras. 6 and 7 of the statement of claim it is alleged that:\n6. The Plaintiff on the 6th day of November, 1957, in company with the Defendant, Edward George Livesey, attended to adjust an insurance claim for the Defendant, Co-Operators Insurance Association, in the east part of the Town of Meaford, in the County of Grey. Upon completion of the investigation by the plaintiff and defendant, Edward George Livesey, the Defendant, Edward George Livesey, drove the Plaintiff in his motor vehicle in a westerly direction on Boucher Street, in the Town of Meaford, and negligently failed to observe a railway train approaching from the south to cross Boucher Street and collided with great force with the said railway train.\n7. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants were under a duty to provide safe transportation to the Plaintiff while attending at and returning from the said investigation. (The italics are my own.)\nThe allegation that Livesey was driving \u201chis motor vehicle\u201d at the time of the accident is not denied in the pleadings and in the Court of Appeal Aylesworth J.A. referred to the vehicle as \u201cthe car of the defendant Livesey\u201d. The case was, however, argued before us on the basis that the appellant was the owner and in any event it will be seen that the disposition of this appeal does not, in my view, turn on any question of the ownership of the motor vehicle, but rather on the question of whether or not, after the investigation of the claim had been completed, the respondent was under a duty to the appellant which required him to return to his office in the Livesey car and which therefore gave rise to a concomittant duty on the part of the appellant to ensure his safe carriage to his destination.\nBy way of defence the appellant pleaded the provisions of s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario as relieving him from all liability for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to the respondent, and in the alternative, pleaded that Livesey and the respondent were engaged on a joint mission on behalf of the appellant at the material time so as to give rise to the defence of common employment.\nThe relevant sections of The Highway Traffic Act read as follows:\n105.\u2014(1) The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of the motor vehicle on a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner\u2019s consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as the owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in, or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from the motor vehicle.\nI agree with both the Courts below that under the authority of the case of Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug[28] (hereinafter referred to as the Harrison case), s. 105(2) does not have the effect of exempting the owner of a motor vehicle from the personal duty which rests on him as the employer of a servant who is injured while a passenger in a motor vehicle in which he is required to drive in the discharge of a duty arising out of his contract of employment.\nIn the present case the learned trial judge found the driver Livesey to be liable and if this were indeed the case it would seem to me to follow that, in view of the provisions of s. 125 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the appellant would be vicariously liable to Kearney for the action able negligence of his fellow employee while acting in the course of his employment. The Court of Appeal has however found, and it is now conceded, that by reason of s. 105(2), the driver Livesey is not liable and this gives rise to the question of whether and if so under what circumstances an employer may be held liable for the acts of its servant when that servant himself is for some reason immune from liability. This question was argued before us at length and appears to me to be one of some difficulty and importance.\nUntil the decision of Charles J. in Smith v. Moss et al.[29], it was widely accepted as a general rule, at least in England, that vicarious liability did not attach to an employer unless his servant had committed an actionable tort. This is frequently referred to as \u201cthe traditional view of true vicarious liability\u201d, e.g. (see Salmon on Torts, 13th ed., 1961, p. 109; Winfield on Tort, 7th ed., 1963, p. 759). In Smith v. Moss, however, the plaintiff was injured as the result of the negligence of her husband in the operation of his mother\u2019s car and Charles J. held that although under The Married Women\u2019s Property Act the wife could not sue her husband for a tort, he was at the time of the accident acting as his mother\u2019s agent, and that she was therefore liable. The judgment is a short one and the conclusion appears to be based on an analogy which Charles J. drew between the circumstances before him and the supposed case of a plaintiff being driven by her husband in a car which she had hired from a garage where the husband was employed as a driver.\nThe difference between the supposed case and the facts with which Charles J. had to deal is that the wife in the supposed case had entered into a contract of hire with the garage proprietor whose liability would therefore not have been vicarious but personal, whereas in the Smith case no such personal liability rested on the mother-in-law, and under the traditionally accepted view of the matter she would not have been held liable unless her son had been liable also. Some commentators treat this case as authority only for the proposition that the position of a husband and wife under The Married Women\u2019s Property Act constitutes an exception to the general rule of vicarious liability, (see Powell\u2019s Law on Agency, p. 240), while others explain it on the ground that the wording of that Act, i.e. \u201cNo husband or wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort\u201d, recognizes that there can be a tort between husband and wife but simply establishes a procedural bar to suit on behalf of either of them and that the mother-in-law Smith was therefore vicariously liable for Smith\u2019s tort, although his wife was prevented from suing him for it. The decision might also be treated as an application of what has come to be known as \u201cthe master\u2019s tort\u201d doctrine which will hereafter be discussed, but as has been indicated, the judgment of Charles J. was not fully reasoned and he made no reference to any of these propositions.\nNotwithstanding the wide implications which have since been attributed to the decision of Charles J. in Smith v. Moss, supra, which was delivered at nisi prius apparently on the day of the trial, (see 56 T.L.R. 305), it is, in my view, highly unlikely that the traditional course of the development of the law of master and servant would have been in any way affected by such a \u201cside wind\u201d had it not been for the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of Broom v. Morgan[30], where the husband and wife were fellow employees and the wife, having been injured through the negligence of the husband, in the course of his employment, brought action against their common employer.\nIn that case the trial judge, Lord Goddard, based his decision (reported in [1952] 2 All E.R. at p. 1007) in great measure on \u201cthe master\u2019s tort\u201d doctrine of liability, which he expressed in the following language at p. 1009:\n\u2026although it is common to speak of the master\u2019s liability as vicarious, it is nonetheless regarded as the liability of a principal. The master is just as much liable as though he commits the tort himself because the servant\u2019s act is his act.\nLord Goddard also referred to the decision of Cardozo C.J. in the New York Court of Appeals in Schubert v. Schubert Wagon Co.[31], where that distinguished judge said, at p. 43:\nA trespass, negligent or wilful, upon the person of a wife, does not cease to be an unlawful act, though the law exempts the husband from liability for the damage. Others may not hide behind the skirts of his immunity\u2026\nIn the Court of Appeal, Denning L.J., (as he then was) in dismissing the appeal also relied primarily on the \u201cmaster\u2019s tort\u201d doctrine. At the beginning of his judgment, at p. 607, he observed:\nI am aware that the employer\u2019s liability for the acts of his servants has often been said to be a vicarious liability, but I do not so regard it.\nAfter developing this point at some length, the learned judge concluded at p. 609 by saying:\nMy conclusion on this part of the case is, therefore, that the master\u2019s liability for the negligence of his servant is not a vicarious liability but a liability of the master himself owing to his failure to have seen that his work was properly and carefully done. If the servant is immune from an action at the suit of the injured party owing to some positive rule of law, nevertheless the master is not thereby absolved. The master\u2019s liability is his own liability and remains on him notwithstanding the immunity of the servant.\nLord Denning then proceeded to develop an alternative argument to the effect that the immunity afforded by The Married Women\u2019s Property Act was a mere rule of procedure and not a rule of substantive law. At pp. 609 and 610 he said:\nIt is an immunity from suit and not an immunity from duty or liability. He is liable to his wife, though his liability is not enforceable by action; and, as he is liable, so also is his employer, but with this difference, that the employer\u2019s liability is enforceable by action.\nThe uncertainty raised by the above cases as to the true basis of the doctrine that a master is vicariously responsible for the tort of his servant committed in the course of his employment, was clarified by the House of Lords in Staveley Iron & Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones[32], hereinafter referred to as the Staveley case, and although what was there said in this regard was obiter, the decision is nevertheless widely regarded as having decisively rejected the \u201cmaster\u2019s tort\u201d approach to the question. (See Winfield on Tort, 7th ed., 1963, at p. 761). I agree with this view.\nIn the Staveley case, the plaintiff, who was an employee of the appellant, had been injured as the result of an act of the appellant\u2019s crane operator and the trial judge, Sellers J., dismissed the action by applying an extension of the rule in Caswell v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd.[33] and holding the crane operator\u2019s act to have been nothing more than an error in judgment not amounting to negligence. It was the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal[34] that the crane operator\u2019s act constituted negligence on the part of a servant of the company acting in the course of her employment, and on this ground the majority of the Court found the company to be vicariously liable, but Denning L.J., in a passage which received no support from the other members of the Court, went out of his way to restate the \u201cmaster\u2019s tort\u201d theory of liability. He put this part of his decision on the ground that the fault was the fault of the employer who, having taken the benefit of such a machine as the crane, must accept the burden of seeing that it is properly handled, and he then said, at p. 480:\nIt is for this reason that the employer\u2019s responsibility for injury may be ranked greater than that of the servant who actually made the mistake: see Jones v. Manchester Corp., [1952] 2 Q.B. 852, and he remains responsible even though the servant may, for some reason, be immune; see-Broom v. Morgan, (supra). (The italics are my own.)\nIn the House of Lords this phase of the matter was only dealt with in the decisions of Lord Morton of Henryton and Lord Reid. Lord Morton\u2019s reasons were concurred in by three other members of the Court, but Lord Reid was speaking only for himself. In expressly rejecting Lord Denning\u2019s reasoning as disclosed in the last-quoted passage, Lord Morton said at p. 639:\nMy Lords, what the court has to decide in the present case is: Was the crane driver negligent? If the answer is \u201cYes\u201d, the employer is liable vicariously for the negligence of his servant. If the answer is \u201cNo\u201d, the employer is surely under no liability at all.\nI pause here to say that in my view the learned law Lord was here using the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in the sense of \u201cactionable negligence\u201d. Lord Morton continues:\nCases such as this, where an employer\u2019s liability is vicarious, are wholly distinct from cases where an employer is under a personal liability to carry out a duty imposed upon him as an employer by common law or statute. In the latter type of case the employer cannot discharge himself by saying: \u201cI delegated the carrying out of this duty to a servant, and he failed to carry it out by a mistake or error of judgment not amounting to negligence.\u201d To such a case one may well apply the words of Denning L.J.: \u201c[the employer] remains responsible even though the servant may, for some reason, be immune.\u201d These words, however, are, in my view, incorrect as applied to a case where the liability of the employer is not personal but vicarious. In such a case if the servant is \u201cimmune\u201d, so is the employer\u2026 This passage in the judgment of Denning, L.J. receives no support in the judgments of Hodson and Romer L.JJ., and I cannot find that the decisions in the cases cited by Denning L.J. lend any support to it, though it may be that the passage is to some extent supported by certain dicta in the first two of these cases. (The italics are mine.)\nThe distinction between direct personal liability and vicarious liability of a master has been most clearly expressed by Rand J. in a much quoted passage from his judgment in The King v. Anthony[35], where he says:\nThere may be a direct duty on the master toward the third person, with the servant the instrument for its performance. The failure on the part of the servant constitutes a breach of the master\u2019s duty for which he must answer as for his own wrong; but it may also raise a liability on the servant toward the third person by reason of which the master becomes responsible in a new aspect. The latter would result from the rule of respondeat superior; the former does not.\nBy reason of the provisions of s. 105(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, the driver\u2019s act which occasioned the injury-does not constitute a breach of duty giving rise to liability against him and accordingly, in my view, the appellant cannot be held vicariously liable for this act under the rule of respondeat superior because, as Lord Morton has said in the Staveley case, supra, \u201cWhere the liability of the employer is not personal but vicarious\u2026 if the servant is immune so is the employer\u201d.\nIn the present case the Courts below did not base their decision on any application of the rule of respondeat superior but rather, in finding that the circumstances were governed by the Harrison case, they decided that the appellant was in breach of a direct personal duty which it owed to its injured servant, the existence of which was dependent upon it being found that Kearney was in the vehicle at the time of the accident in the discharge of a binding obligation to be there which arose out of his contract of service and which in turn gave rise to a concomitant obligation on the part of the appellant to carry him with due care.\nThat the decisions of the Courts below were predicated on the existence of such a duty appears to me to be made plain by the following excerpts from their judgments. In this respect, the learned trial judge said:\nI think it sufficient if I find that in the circumstances as they existed between the parties, that the plaintiff became a passenger pursuant to an obligation he owed the defendant company and the defendant company and its servants owed to the plaintiff a duty to carry him with due care. This I so find.\nIn the course of the reasons which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Aylesworth J.A. put the matter even more forcefully when he said:\nWe think such cases as the Dallas case reported in [1938] S.C.R. 244 and the Hoar case reported in [1938] O.R. 666 are quite distinguishable from the case at bar upon their respective facts. Here, but not in those decisions, the plaintiff was not a free agent as to his movements after completion of the work of adjustment upon which he and Livesey were engaged; he had been transported to the place where the work of adjustment occurred in the car of the defendant Livesey and for the very purpose of engaging in that endeavour; he was entitled as part of their joint work as employees of the other defendant, to be returned in the same vehicle to the place whence he came; his employment in that endeavour continued, in our view, until that had been done. (The italics are my own.)\nIn deciding that the appellant\u2019s liability was dependent upon the respondent having been obliged to be in the vehicle\u2019 at the time of the accident, the Courts below appear to me to have been following the principle established in relation to the English Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1906 in the case of St. Helen\u2019s Colliery Co. v. Hewitson[36], where it was held that before an employee can recover from his employer for personal injuries it was necessary for the injured employee not only to establish that he was in the course of his employment in the sense of being on his master\u2019s business at the time of the accident, but also that he was in the place where the accident occurred because his contract required him to be there. In this regard, Hudson J. speaking on behalf of himself and Duff C.J., Crockett, Davis and Kerwin JJ., in Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Ltd.[37] quoted with approval the language of Lord Wrenbury in the Hewitson case at p. 95 where he said:\nThe man is not in the course of his employment unless the facts are-such that it is in the course of his employment, and in performance of a duty under his contract of service that he is found in the place where the accident occurs. If there is only a right and there is no obligation binding; on the man in the matter of his employment there is no liability.\nThe fact that the Courts below based their decision on the existence of such a direct personal duty and that they at the same time found the present case to be governed by Harrison v. Toronto Motor Car Ltd. and Krug, is understandable having regard to the fact that in the Harrison case Miss Harrison was under an obligation arising out of her contract of employment to be in the Krug vehicle at the time the accident occurred and Mr. Krug was accordingly under a direct personal duty with respect to her safe carriage which arose under the same contract. With the greatest respect for the members of the Court of Appeal, I am unable to find any evidence to support the inference that \u201cthe plaintiff was not a free agent as to his movements after completion of the work of adjustment\u201d. It appears to me to be established by the pleadings and the evidence that at the time of the accident the respondent was no longer under any obligation to the appellant arising out of the Sewell adjustment and it is apparent that the parties directly concerned did not treat the matter of Kearney driving back to his office as a passenger in the Livesey car as being something which he did in the discharge of a duty which he was obliged to perform under his contract. Kearney\u2019s evidence in this regard is that:\nMr. Livesey was going back up to Lon Smith\u2019s garage, and I asked him to leave me back up to my office, because I was anxious to be back there.\nLivesey\u2019s evidence is to the same effect. He says of the conversation with Kearney after dropping Sewell:\nThen I said to him: \u201cWell do you want to come back\u2014come up to Lon Smith\u2019s with me or shall I drop you at your office?\u201d which I felt was the only polite thing to do and he said: \u201cNo, drop me at the office\u201d and I would say 45 seconds later there was no car.\nIn light of all the evidence and having regard to the sequence of events outlined in the last-quoted passages, I am of opinion that Kearney was not in the car when the accident occurred pursuant to any obligation which was binding on him in the matter of his employment, and I am therefore unable to find that in the circumstances of the present case there was any direct personal duty resting on the appellant with respect to the safe carriage of the respondent.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Aylesworth that Kearney \u201cwas entitled\u201d to be returned from whence he came in the Livesey vehicle if he wanted to use it, but if he had preferred to walk the few blocks over to his office or to go and call on a nearby friend, I am unable to see how it could be said that he was bound by any obligation to the appellant which would have prevented him from doing so.\nI agree with the Courts below that the doctrine of common employment is of no assistance to the appellant in view of the provisions of s. 125 of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 437, but I am of opinion that the effect of s. 124 of that Act is to make an employer responsible to an injured employee for the negligent acts of a fellow servant done in the course of his employment which caused such injury, in the same way that the employer is responsible to the rest of the world for such negligent acts. I do not think that the section has the effect of creating a personal liability in the employer if the injured employee was not acting in the course of his employment in the sense above referred to at the time when he sustained the injury.\nLike the Court of Appeal, I have confined my consideration of the relative duties of Kearney and his employer to the period of the return journey when the accident took place, but if it were necessary to do so, I would hold that although Kearney had the right to be driven to the garage by the company\u2019s adjuster, he was not under any compelling duty to do so arising out of his contract and would not have been in breach of any obligation owing by him to the company if he had travelled in his own vehicle.\nIn view of all the above, I would allow this appeal, but having regard to all the circumstances, I would make no order as to costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Phelan, O\u2019Brien, Phelan & Rutherford, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McKay & Scheifele, Meaford.\n[1] [1964] 1 O.R. 101, 41 D.L.R.

A number of persons were summoned for the purpose of being questioned under oath regarding the affairs of the persons subject to the inquiry. But the respondent was not summoned to appear nor did he receive any official notice that this inquiry was being held. At the opening of the inquiry, attorneys appeared on behalf of the respondent and asked that the latter be allowed to be present and to be represented by counsel during the examination of all persons summoned by the investigator. This request was refused. Whereupon, the respondent applied to the Superior Court for an injunction asking that the sittings be suspended until the respondent had obtained from the investigator the authorization to be present and to be represented. The injunction was granted by the trial judge; and his judgment was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The investigator was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Hall J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the injunction dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Section 2 (e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights had no application since no rights and obligations of the respondent were to be determined by the person conducting the investigation. The investigation was a purely administrative matter which could neither decide nor adjudicate upon anything. It was neither a judicial nor a quasi-judicial inquiry but a private investigation at which the respondent was not entitled to be present or represented by counsel. The power given to the Minister under s. 126 (4) is to enable him to obtain the facts which he considers necessary to enable him to discharge the duty imposed on him of assessing and collecting the taxes payable under the Act. The taxpayer's right is not affected until an assessment is made. Then all the appeal provisions mentioned in the Act are open to him. As a purely administrative matter where the person holding the inquiry neither decides nor adjudicates upon anything, it was not for the Courts to specify how that inquiry was to be conducted except to the extent, if any, that the subject's rights are denied him. The fact that the investigator was given certain limited powers of compelling witnesses to attend before him and testify under oath did not change the nature of the inquiry.\nPer Cartwright J.: Generally speaking, apart from some statutory provisions making it applicable, the maxim \"Audi alteram partem\" did not apply to an administrative officer whose function was simply to collect information and make a report, and who had no power either to impose a liability or to give a decision affecting the rights of the parties, as in the present case.\nPer Spence J.: The investigation was a purely administrative matter which could neither decide nor adjudicate upon anything. To give effect to the respondent's demand even without the right to cross-examine the witnesses would be for the judiciary to attempt to impose its own methods on an administrative officer and the judiciary should not make such an attempt. Saint John v. Fraser, [1935] S.C.R. 441, referred to. The fact that the investigator was bound to act judicially in the sense of being fair and impartial did not require him to permit the respondent and his counsel to be present whether or not such counsel were to attempt to cross-examine witnesses.\nHall J. dissenting: The respondent's right to a fair and impartial investigation implied that he had the right to attend and to be represented by counsel. Although he was not acting in a judicial capacity or performing a judicial function, the investigator was clothed with all the outward attributes of a judicial body. The terms of his appointment authorized under s. 126 of the Act did not exclude the making of recommendations arising out of the inquiry. On the contrary it was implicit to the inquiry that some judgment on the facts and information obtained would be made by the investigator in his report to the Deputy Minister.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the granting of an injunction by the trial judge. Appeal allowed, Hall J. dissenting.\nRodrigue B\u00e9dard, Q.C., and Roger Tass\u00e9, for the appellant.\nRoch Pinard, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The material facts in this case are not in dispute. The sole issue is whether the respondent is entitled to be present and represented by counsel at an enquiry conducted by appellant under the Income Tax Act. The appellant is an officer of the Department of National Revenue. On December 28, 1960, he was authorized in writing by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue, acting for his Minister under the provisions of the Act, \"to investigate the affairs\" of the respondent and thirteen other individuals, corporations and estates.\nThe appellant commenced the investigation on January 10, 1961, after summoning a number of persons (of whom respondent was not one) to appear on that date at the office of the Department of National Revenue in Montreal, to be questioned under oath regarding the affairs of the persons subject to the enquiry. The persons summoned for examination were permitted to be represented by counsel if they so desired.\nAt the opening of the enquiry, attorneys appeared before appellant on behalf of respondent and asked that respondent be allowed to be present and to be represented by counsel during the examination of all persons summoned by the appellant. That request was refused.\nThe same day respondent applied to the Superior Court for an injunction asking for an order\u2014\nque lesdites s\u00e9ances de ladite commission soient suspendues jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le demandeur ait obtenu du d\u00e9fendeur l'autorisation d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent et d'\u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes et chacune desdites s\u00e9ances par ses procureurs.\nOn January 12,1961, the date fixed for the hearing on the application for an interlocutory injunction, the appellant agreed to suspend his investigation until judgment was rendered on the application, and therefore no interlocutory order was necessary.\nOn February 17, 1961, Mr. Justice Brossard in a considered judgment granted the injunction asked for in the following terms:\nACCUEILLE la requ\u00eate en injonction du demandeur; ORDONNE que les s\u00e9ances du d\u00e9fendeur agissant en sa qualit\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eateur nomm\u00e9 par le sous-ministre du Revenu national en date du 28 d\u00e9cembre 1960 et en vertu des dispositions de l'article 126(4) de la Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu soient suspendues jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le demandeur ait obtenu du d\u00e9fendeur l'autorisation d'y \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent et d'y \u00eatre repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par ses procureurs; le tout sans frais mais avec recommandation que les frais du demandeur soient pay\u00e9s par le mis-en-cause.\nThat judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench[2], Hyde and Montgomery JJ. dissenting. As I have indicated, under the terms of his appointment, the appellant was authorized\u2014\nto make an inquiry, as authorized by Section 126, subsections 4 and 8 of the said Income Tax Act which sections give the person authorized to make the inquiry all the powers and authorities conferred on a commissioner by sections 4 and 5 of the Inquiries Act or which may be conferred on a commissioner under section 11 thereof, into the affairs of RENE LAFLEUR, MARIE-MARTHE LAFLEUR, FRANCOIS FOURNELLE, DAME HENRIETTE LAFLEUR-FOURNELLE, JEAN FAUVIER, JEAN CHAPOLARD, RAOUL DASSERRE, P.

The Commissioners have the power of summoning before them any witnesses, and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, or on solemn affirmation if they are persons entitled to affirm in civil matters, and orally or in writing, and to produce such documents and things as the commissioners deem requisite to the full investigation of the matters into which they are appointed to examine.\n5. The Commissioners have the same power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and to compel them to give evidence as is vested in any court of record in civil cases.\nSection 11 of the Inquiries Act referred to in the authorization does not appear to be material to the present proceedings.\nThe rights claimed by the respondent are not to be found in the Income Tax Act or the Inquiries Act, and this was recognized by the learned trial judge. He appears to have based his judgment primarily upon the ground that, in refusing to permit the respondent to be present and represented by counsel, appellant had infringed the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights specifically s. 2 (e) which seeks to ensure the right of all persons\u2014\nto a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations.\nWith respect to this section it is sufficient to say that it can have no application since no rights and obligations are determined by the person appointed to conduct the investigation.\nThere are no common reasons of the majority in the Court of Queen's Bench. Mr. Justice Bissonnette and Mr. Justice Rinfret held that the investigation was a quasi-judicial one and that consequently respondent had a right to be heard. Mr. Justice Rinfret also held that the enquiry infringed the Canadian Bill of Rights.\nMr. Justice Owen was of opinion that the enquiry is an administrative matter and that the Canadian Bill of Rights was not infringed. He held however that respondent was entitled to be present and represented by counsel for the following reasons:\nLafleur's right to a fair and impartial investigation implies that he has the right to attend and to be represented by counsel at the sittings of the Inquiry.\nThe proposed investigation into the affairs of Lafleur with Lafleur and his counsel excluded would, in my opinion, be a one-sided and prejudiced Inquiry.\nThe presence of Lafleur and his counsel at the Inquiry would tend to discourage exaggerated or biased evidence by the witnesses called and to remind Guay and counsel for the Minister of their duty to act with fairness and impartiality.\nAccording to the fundamental principle of law which requires that the present investigation be fair and impartial Lafleur is entitled to attend the sittings of the Inquiry and to be represented by legal counsel at such sittings.\nHyde and Montgomery JJ. dissenting, held that the investigation conducted by appellant on behalf of the Minister, is a purely administrative matter which can neither decide nor adjudicate upon anything, that it is not a judicial or quasi-judicial enquiry but a private investigation at which the respondent is not entitled to be present or represented by counsel.\nI am in respectful agreement with Hyde and Montgomery JJ. and there is very little I desire to add to what they have said in their reasons.\nThe power given to the Minister under s. 126(4) to authorize an enquiry to be made on his behalf, is only one of a number of similar powers of enquiry granted to the Minister under the Act. These powers are granted to enable the Minister to obtain the facts which he considers necessary to enable him to discharge the duty imposed on him of assessing and collecting the taxes payable under the Act. The taxpayer's right is not affected until an assessment is made. Then all the appeal provisions mentioned in the Act are open to him.\nThe fact that a person authorized to make an investigation on behalf of the Minister is given certain limited powers of compelling witnesses to attend before him and testify under oath, does not, in my opinion, change the nature of the enquiry. That view was admirably expressed by Mr. Justice Hyde whose words I adopt:\nAs a purely administrative matter where the person holding the inquiry neither decides nor adjudicates upon anything, it is not for the Courts to specify how that inquiry is to be conducted except to the extent, if any, that the subject's rights are denied him. The taking of sworn statements is a common everyday occurrence. The deponent is frequently examined in subsequent Court proceedings where the interests of another may be affected by the statements of that witness. I know of no requirement in law that any person likely to be affected in such a way is entitled to be present with counsel when such a sworn statement is originally made, and I see little distinction from the proceeding in issue.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the application for the injunction, with costs throughout.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the questions raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Abbott. I agree with the conclusion at which he has arrived and wish to add only a few observations.\nThe function of the appellant under the terms of his appointment is simply to gather information; his duties are administrative, they are neither judicial nor quasi-judicial.\nThere are, of course, many administrative bodies which are bound by the maxim \"audi alteram partem\" but the condition of their being so bound is that they have power to give a decision which affects the rights of, or imposes liabilities upon, others.\nIt was of a body having such power that Lord Loreburn L.C. said in Board of Education v. Rice[3]:\nI need not add that \u2026 they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon everyone who decides anything. The appellant in the case at bar has no power to decide anything.\nIn Lapointe v. L'Association de Bienfaisance et de Retraite de la Police de Montreal[4], Lord Macnaghten, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, cited with approval the following passage from the judgment of Kelly C.B. in Wood v. Wood[5], which was adopted by Rinfret C.J. in L'Alliance des Professeurs Catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. Labour Relations Board[6]:\nThey are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim 'Audi alteram partem' that no man should be condemned to consequence resulting from alleged misconduct unheard, and without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals.\nThe appellant in the case at bar is not invested with authority to adjudicate upon any matter.\nGenerally speaking, apart from some statutory provision making it applicable, the maxim \"audi alteram partem\" does not apply to an administrative officer whose function is simply to collect information and make a report and who has no power either to impose a liability or to give a decision affecting the rights of parties.\nIn the case of Re The Ontario Crime Commission, Ex Parte Feeley and McDermott[7], the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that while the question, whether persons against whom grave allegations of criminal conduct were made should be permitted to be represented before the Commissioner conducting an inquiry to ascertain facts and without power to make any decision binding on anyone, was one committed to the discretion of the Commissioner, the Court of Appeal had authority to review his decision and substitute its discretion for his. Schroeder J.A. who gave the reasons of the majority made it clear that this result flowed from the terms of s. 5 of the Public Inquiries Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 323, a statutory provision which the learned Justice of Appeal aptly described as unique. Laidlaw J.A., dissenting, reached the opposite conclusion. I refrain from attempting to choose between these con- flicting views; it is unnecessary to do so for the purpose of deciding the case before us as there is no similar statutory provision relating to the inquiry which the appellant is conducting.\nThe only statutory provision relied on by the respondent is clause (e) of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, which reads as follows:\n2. \u2026no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to \u2026\n(e) deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;\nThis does not assist the respondent, for the appellant has no power to determine any of the former's rights or obligations.\nIn conclusion I wish to express my general agreement with the reasons of my brother Abbott and with those of Hyde and Montgomery JJ. I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Abbott.\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts and the questions raised on this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Abbott. With deference, however, I cannot agree with the conclusion reached by him and by the other members of the Court. I see no alternative to the position taken by Owen J. in the Court of Queen's Bench[8] that \"Lafleur's right to a fair and impartial investigation implies that he has the right to attend and to be represented by counsel at the sittings of the inquiry.\"\nAlthough he was not acting in a judicial capacity or performing a judicial function, Guay was clothed with all the outward attributes of a judicial body, including the right to subpoena witnesses, to have them questioned under oath by counsel for the Crown and to compel them to give evidence as might any court of record in civil cases. Anyone entering the room in which the inquiry was begun would have thought himself in a judicial hearing or proceeding akin thereto. From this scene only one person is missing\u2014the man whose affairs are under investigation. The door is barred to him. That, in my view, is a denial of a fair and impartial hearing to this man.\nIt is urged that the requirement of acting judicially is absent here because Guay as Commissioner was not required to make a decision, that he was merely to conduct an inquiry and to make a report to the Deputy Minister who had authorized and named him to make the inquiry. I do not read the terms of Guay's appointment authorized by s. 126 of the Income Tax Act as excluding the making of recommendations arising out of the inquiry. I think it is implicit to the inquiry that some judgment on the facts and information obtained would be made by Guay in his report to the Deputy Minister. If the Deputy Minister (who is said to be the person who would make the decision) had himself conducted the inquiry, he would have been required to act judicially in the sense that he must act fairly and impartially. See St. John v. Fraser[9]. Surely when the powers are given to a subordinate, the requirement of acting judicially is even stronger. One cannot ignore the reality of the situation that in such cases the decision is made by the subordinate but put out in the name of the Deputy Minister.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Abbott and I agree in the result.\nIt would appear, however, that it would be proper to examine the decision of this Court in St. John v. Fraser[10]. There, Fraser was appointed by the Attorney General of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 10 of the Securities Fraud Prevention Act of that province to carry on an investigation in reference to the affairs of Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited. It appearing during the examination that the Vancouver Stock and Bond Company Limited had underwritten a large part of a new issue of stock to the former company, St. John, the Vancouver company's business manager, was examined by the investigator on four occasions. The solicitor for Mr. St. John and the Vancouver company was present on all of those occasions and their counsel on the last two. Both the solicitor and the counsel took part in the examinations of Mr. St. John and the counsel was afforded the fullest opportunity for argument on his clients' behalf. The investigator had in the meantime examined some other witnesses on matters connected with St. John and the Vancouver company's conduct without notice to them and with no opportunity for their counsel to cross-examine such witnesses. Their counsel requested a copy of the evidence given by two particular witnesses and the investigator informed such counsel that in view of the fact that St. John was about to be recalled to give further evidence he would furnish the counsel with the copies of the transcript of the evidence so requested after Mr. St. John had been further examined, and suggested that then counsel could recall St. John to give any further evidence or explanation that might be desired. It was admitted on behalf of the Attorney General that he had taken the position after counsel for Mr. St. John and the Vancouver company had intervened in the case, that such counsel was not entitled to cross-examine any witnesses who had been examined by the investigator in the course of the investigations and that he, the Attorney General, had so instructed the investigator. The solicitor for Mr. St. John and the Vancouver company then applied for an injunction restraining the investigator from proceeding with the investigation in so far as it related to the conduct or actions of either St. John or the Vancouver company and from making any finding or report to the Attorney General in connection therewith on the ground that he had not given notice to St. John or the Vancouver company of the examination of witnesses concerning their relations with the Wayside Consolidated Gold Mines Limited and that he had not afforded them an opportunity of cross-examining such witnesses. The court was unanimous in coming to the opinion that the investigation was an administrative procedure only. Davis J. said, at p. 452:\nFundamentally, the investigator in this case was an administrative officer, and the machinery set up by the statute was administrative for the purpose of enquiring as to whether or not fraudulent practices had been or were being carried on in connection with the sale of the securities of the Wayside Company.\nIn the present case, I am in agreement with my brother Abbott in holding as did Hyde and Montgomery JJ. that this investigation is a purely administrative matter which can neither decide nor adjudicate upon anything.\nOn the basis of that finding in the St. John v. Fraser case, Crocket J., with whom Lamont J. agreed, held that s. 29 of the Securities Fraud Prevention Act, a prohibitory section, barred the action for an injunction. Davis J., however, although agreeing with that conclusion, proceeded at p. 451:\nAssuming then in favour of the appellants that the prohibitory section does not apply in this case, the real issue on the merits is whether or not the plaintiffs were entitled as of right to be afforded freedom of cross-examination of each and every witness called by the investigator.\nAnd at p. 452:\nThe investigator was not a court of law nor was he a court in law, but to say that he was an administrative body, as distinct from a judicial tribunal, does not mean that persons appearing before him were not entitled to any rights. An administrative tribunal must act to a certain extent in a judicial manner, but that does not mean that it must act in every detail in its procedure the same as a court of law adjudicating upon a lis inter partes. It means that the tribunal, while exercising administrative functions, must act \"judicially\" in the sense that it must act fairly and impartially. In O'Connor v. Waldron, [1935] A.C. 76 at 82, Lord Atkin refers to cases where tribunals, such as a military court of enquiry or an investigation by an ecclesiastical commission, had attributes similar to those of a court of justice.\n\"On the other hand (he continues) the fact that a tribunal may be exercising merely administrative functions though in so doing it must act judicially, is well established, and appears clearly from the Royal Aquarium case.\"\nIn the Royal Aquarium case [1892] 1 Q.B. 431, \"judicial\" in relation to administrative bodies is used in the sense that they are bound to act fairly and impartially.\nAnd at p. 453:\nThe only objection taken by the appellants, and it was very strenuously and earnestly pressed upon us in a very able argument by their counsel Mr. Farris, was that it was against natural justice that the plaintiffs should have been denied the right they claim of cross-examining every witness who was heard by the investigator. The right was asserted as a right to which every witness against whom a finding might possibly be made was entitled. I do not think that any such right exists at common law. The investigation was primarily an administrative function under the statute, and while the investigator was bound to act judicially in the sense of being fair and impartial, that, it seems to me, is something quite different from the right asserted by the appellants of freedom of cross-examination of all the witnesses. It is natural, as Lord Shaw said in the Arlidge case, [1915] A.C. 120 at 138, that lawyers should favour lawyer-like methods but it is not for the judiciary to impose its own methods on administrative or executive officers,\nAlthough in the St. John v. Fraser case the complaint urged by counsel for the plaintiffs was the refusal to permit him to cross-examine all witnesses called, it is significant that the investigator took exactly the same course as the investigator had done in the present case, i.e., he proceeded in the absence of counsel for the plaintiffs and without notice to either the plaintiffs or their counsel to examine other witnesses. During the course of the argument, I attempted to ascertain from counsel for the respondent whether, in fact, his present demand that he should be allowed to be present during the examination of all witnesses and therefore necessarily to have notice of such examinations, was not merely preliminary to a demand that counsel have leave to cross-examine such witnesses, and, in my opinion, the prejudice to the respondent suggested in the reasons for judgment of Owen J. could not be avoided without such right of cross-examination being exercised. However, even if the respondent were to confine his demand to a simple right to be present in person and with counsel during such examination, in my view, to give effect to that demand would be for the judiciary to attempt to impose its own methods on an administrative officer and, with respect, I am of the opinion that Davis J. rightly held that the judiciary should not make such an attempt. The fact that the investigator is bound to act judicially in the sense of being fair and impartial does not require the investigator to permit the respondent and his counsel to be present during every examination carried on by virtue of the authorization of the Deputy Minister whether or not such counsel were to attempt to cross-examine such witnesses.\nFor these reasons, I agree that the appeal should be allowed and the application for the injunction dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs, HALL J. dissenting.\nAttorney for the appellant: E.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside the jury's award and substituted therefor an award of $6,500; from that judgment the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the award of the jury restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal erred in substituting its own view of the severity of the plaintiff's injuries for that of the jury. It was impossible for the Court to say that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was so large that the jury reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably could not properly have arrived at that amount. Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd., [1938] S.C.R. 52, followed; Praed v. Graham (1889), 24 Q.B.D. 53; McCannell v. McLean, [1937] S.C.R. 341, referred to.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The task of this Court was to determine whether it had been shown that the Court of Appeal was in error, not whether this Court would have done the same thing as the first appellate Court. The appellant had failed to show that the Court of Appeal was in any way wrong. Donnelly v. McManus Petroleum Ltd., [1950] 1 D.L.R. 303, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, setting aside a jury award for damages for personal injuries received in a motor vehicle accident and substituting therefor a reduced award. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting, and award of jury restored.\nW. J. Wallace and G. W. Baldwin, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nG. F. Henderson, QC., and B. Crane, for the defendant, respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia setting aside the award by a jury of $17,500 damages to the appellant in respect of injuries which she sustained in a motor vehicle accident, and substituting therefor an award of $6,500.\nLiability for the accident which occasioned the injuries complained of is admitted by the respondent, and the sole question at issue is whether or not the Court of Appeal was justified in reducing the jury's award as it did. There is no doubt that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia is empowered to make such a reduction under the provisions of R. 36 of the British Columbia Court of Appeal Rules which read as follows:\n36. Where excessive damages have been awarded by a jury, if the court is of the opinion that the verdict is not otherwise unreasonable, it may reduce the damages without the consent of either party instead of ordering a new trial.\nThe rule of conduct for a court of appeal when considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that the damages are excessive, has been well described by Lord Esher in Praed v. Graham[1], as being\n\u2026as nearly as possible the same as where the court is asked to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.\nThis statement was endorsed by Lord Wright in Mechanical and General Inventions Co. Ltd. and Lehwess v. Austen[2], and in this Court by Kerwin J. as he then was, in Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd[3], and Deutch v. Martin[4].\nThe principle on which this Court acts in such cases has been clearly stated by Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in McCannell v. McLean[5], at p. 343 where he said:\nThe principle has been laid down in many judgments of this Court to this effect, that the verdict of a jury will not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it. That is the principle on which this Court has acted for at least thirty years to my personal knowledge and it has been stated with varying terminology in judgments reported and unreported.\nAs a result of the accident in the present case, the appellant sustained cuts to her face, her dentures were broken in her mouth, her right ankle was badly sprained, her right shoulder was broken and she had a dislocation of both ends of the right collar bone. In addition, she complained of a fractured rib on her left side and she had multiple bruises. There was evidence, which the jury was entitled to believe, to the effect that her ankle had suffered an unusual injury resulting in an arthritic process which might require surgery in the future in order to control pain, and that it would require her to curtail her activities. An orthopedic surgeon, who had examined Mrs. Roumieu the day before the trial, which was two years and nine months after the accident, testified, inter alia, that she would have a permanent deformity in the shoulder which had some cosmetic effect and that there would always be pain at the outer aspect of her collar bone.\nIn the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Lord made an extensive analysis of the evidence and with the greatest respect, it appears to me that he fell into the error of substituting his own view of the severity of these injuries for that of the jury.\nI would adopt as directly applicable to the circumstances of the present case, the words of Mr. Justice Davis in Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd., supra, at p. 56 where he said:\nWhile it may be that the general damages were awarded on a generous scale, there was no firm ground, in our opinion, on which the Court of Appeal was entitled to set aside the jury's assessment. This was essentially a case for a jury and it is quite impossible for the Court to say that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was so large that the jury reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably could not properly have arrived at that amount.\nI would accordingly allow this appeal with costs, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the award of the jury.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014I would not interfere with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The careful and detailed analysis contained in the unanimous reasons of that Court satisfies me that they were acting well within their powers of review of a non-judicial award and that there was no misunderstanding of the principle to be applied, as set out in Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd1.; Deutch and Deutch v. Martin.\nOur task is to determine whether it has been shown before this Court that the Court of Appeal was in error, not whether we would have done the same thing as the first appellate Court.\nIn such matters this Court cannot overlook the fact that the question of damages is intimately related to the surroundings in which they arise and are determined, and the Court below is so far to be credited with an intimate appreciation of those conditions.\nPer Rand J. in Donnelly v. McManus Petroleum Ltd3.\nThe appellant has not satisfied me that the Court of Appeal was in any way wrong and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and the award of the jury restored, ABBOTT and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Wilson, King & Baldwin, Prince George.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Harper, Gilmour, Grey & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] (1889), 24 Q.B.D. 53.\n[2] [1935] A.C. 346 at 358.\n[3] [1938] S.C.R. 52 at 59.\n[4] [1943] S.C.R. 366 at 368.\n[5] [1937] S.C.R. 341 at 343.\n",

Before their marriage they had decided to leave Hungary permanently for Israel and in furtherance of this intention they left Budapest three weeks after the marriage and, having put themselves in the hands of a Jewish deputy, started for Israel in company with many thousands of other Hungarians. In 1948, while still en route to Israel, they obtained a Jewish bill of divorcement in Italy in conformity with rabbinical law by appearing, in the presence of witnesses, before a rabbi at which time a formal document entitled a \u201cgett\u201d was delivered to the defendant. This document was not recognized either in Italy or in Hungary as bringing the marriage to an end, but it was so recognized in Israel, where the defendant and W finally arrived a few weeks after the \u201cgett\u201d was delivered.\nAs to W\u2019s life and activities after his arrival in Israel the evidence was sketchy; as to the defendant, the evidence disclosed that she remained in Israel and lived with her parents. Some years later, while on a trip to Ontario for the purpose of visiting relatives, the defendant met and married the plaintiff in Toronto. Subsequently, the plaintiff obtained a declaration in the Supreme Court of Ontario that the marriage solemnized between the parties at Toronto was null and void because there was a valid and subsisting marriage then in existence between the defendant and W. On appeal by the defendant the judgment at trial was set aside. With leave of the Court of Appeal, an appeal by the plaintiff was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe manner of their coming to Israel was such as to justify a finding that immediately upon their arrival W and the defendant acquired a domicile of choice in that country, where the dissolution of their marriage was recognized from the moment when the \u201cgett\u201d was delivered to the defendant, and where each of them therefore had the status of a single person with full capacity to enter into a valid and binding contract of marriage. The defendant was thereafter free to continue and did continue to be domiciled in Israel as an unmarried woman until the time of her marriage to the plaintiff. Accordingly, at the time of her marriage in Toronto the defendant had the capacity to marry according to the law of the country where she was then domiciled.\nAlthough, as a general rule, under Ontario law a divorce is not recognized as valid unless it was so recognized under the law of the country where the husband was domiciled at the time when it was obtained, the Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that, for the limited purpose of resolving the difficulty created by the peculiar facts of this case, the governing consideration was the status of the defendant under the law of her domicile at the time of her second marriage and not the means whereby she secured that status.\nBell v. Kennedy (1868), L.R. 1 Sc. & Div. 307, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. granting a declaration of nullity of marriage. Appeal dismissed.\nH.W. Silverman, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG.D. Finlayson, Q.C., and J.H. Francis, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of the Court of Appeal of Ontario from a judgment of that Court1 setting aside the judgment rendered at trial by McRuer C.J.H.C. which had declared that the marriage solemnized between the parties at Toronto on April 6, 1957, was null and void because there was a valid and subsisting marriage then in existence between the respondent and one Joseph Waktor.\nAt the time of his marriage to the respondent, the appellant was a bachelor domiciled in the Province of Ontario and the couple thereafter lived together in Toronto where their daughter was born in 1958, but differences appear to have developed between them which culminated in the present litigation.\nIn essence the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is that the validity of the bill of divorcement granted before a rabbinical court at Trani, Italy, which purported to dissolve the respondent\u2019s first marriage was not, at the time when it was granted, recognized in Hungary which was then the country of Waktor\u2019s domicile and accordingly that it should not be recognized in the Province of Ontario. It is further contended, as the learned trial judge has found, that the evidence does not justify a finding that Waktor had acquired a domicile of choice in Israel, where his marriage was regarded as having been legally dissolved, and that the respondent therefore never lost her status as Waktor\u2019s wife according to the law of his domicile of origin in Hungary which should be recognized in the Courts of Ontario as the status which she had at the time of her marriage to the appellant.\nThe respondent, who was born in Hungary, was married to Waktor in Budapest in 1945 when she was 19 years of age. Before her marriage she had decided to leave Hungary for Israel, and Waktor\u2019s position in this regard can best be gathered from the following excerpts from the respondent\u2019s examination for discovery:\nQ. Where were you born? A. I was born in Hungary.\nQ. And you lived there all your life prior to this marriage with Joseph Waktor? A. Yes.\nQ. What about Joseph Waktor? Do you know where he lived? A. He once went to Israel and after came back.\nQ. Was he in business in Hungary, or was he a teacher? What was his occupation? A. He was in the army and after in a forced labour camp. Q. But, he always had lived in Hungary? A. He went to Israel for two years previous to our marriage.\nQ. When was that he went to Israel? A. Before he was in\u2014it must be in the service.\nQ. That was in the early thirties? A. I don\u2019t know.\nQ. And then he came back to Hungary? A. Yes, he could\u2019nt get back.\nQ. And he continued to live in Hungary? A. He was in the labour camp, yes.\nAnd again in her examination-in-chief:\nQ. And what happened after you were married? Did you decide to leave Hungary? A. We decided to leave Hungary after we got married.\nQ. You had made up your mind to leave before you got married? A. I made up my mind when the Germans was in, that I will leave Hungary after the War.\nQ. And was Mr. Waktor of the same mind? A. Yes.\nQ. Where did you intend to go? A. To Israel.\nQ. And is that where your husband intended to go? A. Yes.\nIn furtherance of this intention, the newly married couple left Budapest a few weeks after the marriage and started for Israel in company with many thousands of other Hungarians. For the purpose of the journey the respondent testified that they put themselves \u201cin the hands of a Jewish deputy, an Israeli deputy\u201d who appears to have been representing \u201ca few Jewish people who arranged to get people out of Europe to Israel\u201d of whom the respondent says: \u201cThey was only organized to take people from all over the world, but mostly from European countries to Israel\u201d.\nIt is to be inferred from the evidence that the Waktors left Hungary having already decided that they would never return, but it does not appear to me that they are to be characterized as \u201cpolitical refugees\u201d in the sense of being people who left under the fear of political oppression. In the case of refugees of the latter type, the possibility of the return of a political climate which would make it safe and practical for them to come home is always a factor to be considered before drawing the inference that they have formed a permanent intention to remain in another country. In the case of the Waktors, however, it appears to me that the dominant motive in their departure was not so much a desire to get away from Hungary as it was their decision to become a part of the new community then in the process of development in Israel which was the country of their racial origin. For nearly three years the couple moved from one displaced persons camp to another in Germany and Italy en route to Israel and in October 1948, when they had reached a camp at Trani in Italy, which proved to be the last stage of their journey, they obtained a Jewish bill of divorcement in conformity with rabbinical law by appearing, in the presence of witnesses, before the rabbi in the camp at which time a formal document entitled a \u201cgett\u201d was delivered to the respondent. This document was not recognized either in Italy where it was delivered or in Hungary which was the Waktors\u2019 domicile of origin as bringing the marriage to an end, but it was so recognized in the State of Israel and a few weeks later, when the Waktors finally landed there, they were recognized as having had the status of unmarried persons under the law of that county from the time when the \u201cgett\u201d was delivered.\nAs I have indicated, there is evidence to the effect that Waktor had lived in Israel for two years before his marriage and that on his return to Hungary he had not been able to get back to Israel because he was placed in a forced labour camp. This affords some ground for the suggestion that when he left Hungary for Israel after his marriage he was returning to a country where he had already established a domicile of choice, and that he was therefore domiciled in a jurisdiction which recognized the validity of a Jewish bill of divorcement at the time when the \u201cgett\u201d was delivered to the respondent at Trani. I do not, however, think that the evidence is sufficiently clear and precise to justify a finding to this effect.\nThe evidence as to Waktor\u2019s life and activities after his arrival in Israel is sketchy but in the course of proving that he was still alive at the time of the respondent\u2019s second marriage, the appellant\u2019s counsel led evidence to show that, as far as was known, he had remained in Israel from the time that he arrived there, and an extract was introduced from a registration in the census book at Tel Aviv which is dated August 16, 1962, and which states that Waktor is single, that his religion and nationality are Jewish and that he is a resident of Israel from November 20, 1948.\nThe respondent\u2019s evidence discloses that she lived in Israel with her parents for seven and a half years after her arrival and that it was on a trip to New York and Toronto for the purpose of visiting relatives that she met and married the appellant.\nThe learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial of this action decided that the respondent was not domiciled in Israel at the time of her second marriage on the ground that while she was in Italy she still retained the domicile of her first husband which was Hungary and that the evidence necessary to support a finding that Waktor had established a domicile of choice in Israel was lacking in this case.\nAlthough there is a presumption against a change of domicile, and the intention to remain permanently in a country other than the country of origin must be accompanied by actual residence in the new country in order to establish a domicile of choice, there may nevertheless be circumstances which so clearly indicate the existence of an intention to remain permanently in the new country that the mere fact of arrival there is enough to establish the new domicile. This proposition finds support in Dicey\u2019s Conflict of Laws, 7th ed., p. 96, where it is stated:\nIt is not, as a matter of law, necessary that the residence should be long in point of time: residence for a few days or even for part of a day is enough. Indeed, an immigrant can acquire a domicile immediately upon his arrival in a country in which he intends to settle. The length of the residence is not important in itself: it is only important as evidence of animus manendi.\nIn Cheshire\u2019s Private International Law, 6th ed., at p. 174, it is said:\nOn the other hand, time is not the sole criterion of domicil. Long residence does not constitute nor does brief residence negate domicil. Everything depends upon the attendant circumstances, for they alone disclose the nature of the person\u2019s presence in a country.\nThese views appear to me to be consistent with the observations of Lord Chelmsford in Bell v. Kennedy[2], where he had occasion to say:\nIt may be conceded that if the intention of permanently residing in a place exists, a residence in pursuance of that intention, however short, will establish a domicile.\nIt would, in my view, be difficult to conceive of circumstances pointing more forcefully to the existence of an intention to permanently reside in a new domicile than those which were present in the case of the Waktors who, on leaving their domicile of origin, immediately placed themselves in the hands of a deputy of the country to which they were destined and who thereafter lived for three years in a community of Jewish people all sharing the common purpose of settling in the country of their racial origin.\nAs I have indicated, Chief Justice McRuer did not consider that the evidence of Waktor\u2019s movements after landing in Israel was sufficiently clear and satisfactory to warrant a finding that he had acquired a domicile of choice there, but in my view any frailties which may be thought to exist in that evidence are more than offset by the circumstances preceding his arrival which point so clearly to the existence of his long-held intention to settle in the new country. I accordingly agree with the conclusion reached by MacKay JA. in the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal where he says:\nOn a reading of all the evidence in this case, I think the proper conclusion is that Waktor (1) had an intention to abandon his domicile of origin in Hungary, and (2) to establish a domicile of choice in Israel; and did so.\nI am, however, of opinion that the emphasis which the Courts below have placed on the evidence or lack of evidence as to Waktor\u2019s movements after he came to Israel is unnecessary in the present case. In my view the manner of their coming was such as to justify a finding that immediately upon their arrival the Waktors acquired a domicile of choice in Israel where the dissolution of their marriage had been recognized as valid from the moment when the \u201cgett\u201d was delivered to the respondent, and where each of them therefore had the status of a single person with full capacity to enter into a valid and binding contract of marriage. The respondent was thereafter free to continue and did continue to be domiciled in Israel as an unmarried woman until the time of her marriage to the appellant.\nI am accordingly of opinion that at the time of her marriage in Toronto the respondent had the capacity to marry according to the law of the country where she was then domiciled. This does not, however, solve the whole problem because as a general rule, under Ontario law a divorce is not recognized as valid unless it was so recognized under the law of the country where the husband was domiciled at the time when it was obtained, and although the validity of the Jewish divorce was at all times recognized in Israel where the Waktors established a domicile of choice within three weeks of it having been granted, it was never so recognized according to the law of the husband\u2019s Hungarian domicile of origin.\nThe Court of Appeal of Ontario has treated these singular circumstances as constituting an exception to the general rule to which I have just referred. In the course of his reasons for judgment Mr. Justice MacKay has thoroughly and accurately summarized and discussed the authorities bearing on this difficult question and it would in my view be superfluous for me to retrace the ground which he has covered so well. I adopt his reasoning in this regard and agree with his conclusion that, for the limited purpose of resolving the difficulty created by the peculiar facts of this case, the governing consideration is the status of the respondent under the law of her domicile at the time of her second marriage and not the means whereby she secured that status.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: H.W.

The trial judge found that there was a prima facie case against him on both charges. However he acquitted him on the ground that the first charge had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal and contended that the magistrate erred in holding that the Crown should have proved affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial and substituted verdicts of guilty in respect of the two charges. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux and Ritchie JJ.: In order to sustain a conviction under s. 176(1) of the Code it is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of the accused having either received or recorded a bet, it being enough, under the provision s. 168(1)(c), if it be proved that he kept a disorderly house for the purpose of \u201cenabling any person to receive bets\u201d. Once it has been established that the accused was the keeper of such a house, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in which bets were received or recorded therein. The accused would necessarily have been found guilty by the magistrate but for this error in law. The Court of Appeal was justified in entering a verdict of guilty with respect to these offences.\nPer Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting: The magistrate did not misdirect himself but was merely putting to himself the well-known rule in Hodge\u2019s case. The magistrate was putting to himself the basic proposition of criminal jurisprudence that the Crown must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside two verdicts of acquittal and substituting therefore verdicts of guilty. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nA. Maloney, Q.C., and B. Clive Bynoe, for the appellant.\nF.W. Callaghan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau C.J., and Fauteux and Ritchie JJ, was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought pursuant to 597(2) of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario1 setting aside two verdicts acquitting the appellant of the offences of keeping a common betting house and of book-making which were entered by Magistrate Howitt of the City of Guelph on August 14, 1963, and substituting therefor verdicts of guilty in respect of the following charges:\n1. Samuel Silvestro on the 24th day of April and one month previous thereto at the City of Guelph A.D. 1963 in the County of Wellington did unlawfully keep a disorderly house to wit: a common bet- ting house at 165 Ferguson Street in the City of Guelph contrary to the Criminal Code Sec. 176(1).\n2. Samuel Silvestro on the 24th of April and one month prior thereto at the City of Guelph, A.D. 1963 in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully engage in bookmaking contrary to the Criminal Code Sec. 177(1)(e).\nIt appears to me to be desirable to analyze the nature of these charges before proceeding to a consideration of the question of law raised by this appeal.\nAs to the first charge, the relevant sections of the Criminal Code read as follows:\n176. (1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n168. (1) In this Part,\n(c) \u201ccommon betting house\u201d means a place that is opened, kept or used for the purpose of\n(ii) enabling any person to receive, record, register, transmit or pay bets or to announce the results of betting.\n(h) \u201ckeeper\u201d includes a person who\n(i) is an owner or occupier of a place.\n(e) \u201cdisorderly house\u201d means a common bawdy-house, a common betting house or a common gaming house.\n169. In proceedings under this Part,\n(a) evidence that a peace officer who was authorized to enter a place was wilfully prevented from entering or was wilfully obstructed or delayed in entering is prima facie evidence that the place is a disorderly house.\nIt will be seen from the above that any keeper of a disorderly house which is opened, kept or used for the purpose of enabling any person to receive bets is guilty of keeping a common betting house contrary to 176(1).\nAs to the second charge, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows:\n177. (1) Every one commits an offence who\n(e) engages\u2026 in the business or occupation of betting, or\u2026\n21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who\n(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it\u2026\nIt will accordingly be seen that anyone who does anything for the purpose of aiding another to engage in the occupation of betting is guilty of an offence under this section.\nIn the present case the learned Magistrate made the following findings of fact:\n1. As to the premises being a disorderly house: I find as a fact that entry was wilfully delayed by the accused and therefore, there is a prima facie evidence that the place is a disorderly house.\n2. As to the appellant being the keeper of the premises:\nAlthough counsel for the accused strenuously argued that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the accused Silvestro was the keeper of the premises, I find as a fact that he was.\n3. As to certain telephone calls made to the premises in question while the telephone was being monitored by the police:\nI find as a fact that the telephone conversations were accurately recorded and that such evidence is admissible to prove the nature, character and atmosphere of the premises but not proof of the matters asserted\u2026 The conversations were about placing bets on horses that were running at various race tracks that day. Such evidence standing by itself, is not enough to substantiate a conclusion that the premises were being kept for betting. It is evidence of some value, however, tending to prove the charge.\nIn my opinion, the learned Magistrate\u2019s finding that the telephone conversations were properly recorded carries with it an acceptance of the record as to the number of betting messages which were received over the telephone at the premises while the police were listening in, and this discloses that between 1:35 and 2:34 p.m. there were eleven such calls, eight of which took place in the first twenty-eight minutes.\nNone of these findings of fact was disturbed by the Court of Appeal and I can see no basis for interfering with them in this Court. When they are read together, I am unable to construe these findings as amounting to anything other than a prima facie case that the appellant was the keeper of a disorderly house which was used for the purpose of enabling persons to receive telephone messages about placing bets on horses, and this, in my opinion, constitutes an offence under s. 176(1) of the Criminal Code. In my view also, a keeper of a common betting house is one who does something for the purpose of aiding other persons to engage in the occupation of betting, and I am therefore of opinion that having regard to the provisions of s. 21, the findings of fact above referred to also constitute a prima facie case under s. 177(1)(e). Notwithstanding the above, however, the learned Magistrate, after considering all the evidence, was left in doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on both charges, and it is the question of whether or not his doubts were founded solely on an error in law which forms the subject of this appeal.\nNo evidence was called for the defence, and the considerations which gave rise to doubt in the Magistrate\u2019s mind appear to me to be illustrated by the following excerpts from his reasons for judgment:\n1. I feel that in order to register a conviction not only must I find as fact that the accused received and recorded bets, but also \u00ce must outline and describe how he did it. This I find a little difficult to do as I am faced on the one hand with the suggestion that the accused used a flash board on which to record bets and on the other hand with the suggestion that he used the arborite table top for this purpose.\n2. There is no direct evidence that the accused received or recorded a bet.\n3. In the present case I am left wondering just what method the accused used to carry out his alleged illegal activity. There are no betting slips and scratch sheets in evidence. Also, I think it is obvious that a book maker must have some printed or written record of the day\u2019s racing contestants immediately at hand, as a reference before receiving a bet. In the case before me there is no sign of any such information. Admittedly there were the newspapers in the parked automobile but they were not being used at the time of the raid.\n4. I feel the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation.\nThe following question of law was stated in the notice of appeal of the Attorney-General of Ontario to the Court of Appeal:\nThe learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.\nIt is true that the question so stated does not embody the exact language used in the reasons for judgment delivered at trial, but it does appear to me that in acquitting the appellant the learned Magistrate made it clear that he was acting in accordance with his opinion that in order to convict it was necessary for him to have affirmative proof, not only that the accused received bets, but also that he recorded them and that there must in addition be proof, amounting to reasonable certainty, of the manner in which these things were done.\nIn my view, one of the questions of law raised by the opinion so expressed by the Magistrate is fairly reflected in the question posed by the notice of appeal.\nIt will be noted that a substantial part of the difficulty which led the Magistrate to hold that the first charge was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt sprang from his being under the impression that in order to convict he must be satisfied as to how the bets were recorded. In fact, as Roach J.A. has pointed out in the course of his reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, the learned Magistrate, like the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Failkaw[2], was wrong in considering that the recording of bets is an essential ingredient of the offence under s. 176(1). Indeed, in order to sustain a conviction under that section it is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of the accused having either received or recorded a bet, it being enough, under the provisions of s. 167(1)(c), if it be proved that he kept a disorderly house for the purpose of \u201cenabling any person to receive bets\u201d. Once it has been established that the accused was the keeper of such a house, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in which bets were received or recorded therein.\nAs I consider that the findings of fact above referred to constitute a prima facie case of guilt as to both charges, and as there was no evidence for the defence, I am of opinion that the accused would necessarily have been found guilty by the learned Magistrate but for the errors in law which I have indicated, and I am of the further opinion that the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s. 592(1)(i) of the Criminal Code, was justified in entering a verdict of guilty with respect to these offences.\nI would accordingly dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] dated January 31, 1964. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal of the Attorney General for Ontario from the acquittal of the accused by His Worship Magistrate Howitt on August 14, 1963. The accused had been charged with two offences as follows:\n(1) On the 24th day of April and one month previous A.D. 1963, at the City of Guelph in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common betting0 house at 165 Ferguson Street, in the City of Guelph, contrary to the Criminal Code, Section 176, subsection (1).\nand (2) On the 24th day of April and one month prior thereto at the City of Guelph A.D. 1963, in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully.engage in bookmaking, contrary to the Criminal Code, Section 177, subsection (1)(e).\nThe trial took place on June 26, 1963, the learned magistrate reserved judgment, and on August 14, 1963, gave written reasons for the acquittal of the accused upon both charges.\nThe Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by notice of appeal dated August 23, 1963. I repeat in full the grounds of appeal set out therein:\nThe learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario gave effect to this ground of appeal. In the course of his judgment, Roach J.A. said:\nThe question of law on which the Attorney General founds this appeal is stated in his notice of appeal, thus:\nThe learned Magistrate erred in law in holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.\nIn my opinion that objection as applied to these charges is well taken and the learned Magistrate misdirected himself.\nThe appellant urged many grounds of appeal before this Court. In my view, the appeal may be decided by reference only to the first thereof, i.e., that the learned magistrate did not misdirect himself and that the statement quoted inaccurately in the notice of appeal was not an attempt by the magistrate to direct himself at all. It is probably unnecessary to cite at length the reasons for the judgment given by the learned magistrate and a short summary thereof will be sufficient. Firstly, the magistrate found upon evidence that the provisions of s. 169(a) of the Code applied to the circumstances and that there was prima facie evidence that the premises were a disorderly house. Secondly, the learned magistrate found that the accused was the keeper of that house. Thirdly, the learned magistrate found that the telephone messages adduced in evidence as having been received at the premises by an officer in the hour which followed the officer\u2019s entry upon the premises were accurately recorded in the tape recording produced as a witness. Fourthly, the magistrate recounted the other evidence as to what was found in the premises and outside the premises in an automobile, and then continued:\nThe evidence which I have outlined is wholly circumstantial There is no direct testimony that the accused received or recorded a bet. The Crown asks that a conviction be made, suggesting that evidence indicates that the accused received bets over the telephone and recorded them in pencil on the arborite table top or on flash paper, which paper burns instantly on being ignited. It is argued that the burnt match points to the fact that flash paper was used. Further, it is submitted that the pencil found on the accused man was used to record the bets on the table and the smudge mark or marks, barely discernable, on the table, were made after the face cloth was used in an effort to destroy all evidence of bets having been so recorded.\nI feel that in order to register a conviction not only must I find as fact that the accused received and recorded bets, but also I must outline and describe how he did it. This I find a little difficult to do as I am faced on the one hand with the suggestion the accused used flash paper on which to record bets and on the other hand, with the suggestion that he used the arborite table top for this purpose.\nAlso I feel that in cases of this kind, I should look for very tangible evidence. The circumstantial evidence, although any part of it may be capable of innocent interpretation, should be closely connected so that the cumulative effect should almost impel me to find the accused guilty. The evidence should be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion of innocence.\nIn the present case I am left wondering just what method the accused used to carry out his alleged illegal activity. There are no betting slips and scratch sheets in evidence. Also, I think it is obvious that a book maker must have some printed or written record of the day\u2019s racing contestants immediately at hand, as a reference before receiving a bet.\nIn the case before me, there is no sign of any such printed information. Admittedly there were the newspapers in the parked automobile but they were not being used at the time of the raid. The gist of the offence is the keeping of the premises for betting (and I emphasize \u201ckeeping\u201d). No doubt, Samuel Silvestro is a keeper, but there is some evidence, the admissibility of it being doubtful, that a Frank Silvestro is involved. Did the accused use the name of Frank Silvestro in answering the telephone or was a Frank Silvestro actually engaged or about to engage in receiving and recording bets on the 24th day of April 1963? Do Frank and Samuel Silvestro work together in such an illegal enterprise? These questions are not answered.\nIt may be that a man is so enveloped by a web or network of inculpatory evidence, that it is incumbent upon him to make an explanation or be convicted. This is not so here. I am left to draw too many inferences in order to reach the conclusion that the accused is guilty. Although my suspicions are strong that the accused was carrying on betting operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation.\nIt is the sentence from that portion of the learned magistrate\u2019s reasons reading, \u201cI feel that in order to register conviction not only must I find it a fact that the accused received and recorded bets but also I must outline and describe how he did it\u201d, that the Crown took the proposition set out in its notice of appeal. It should first be noted that the magistrate is not even purporting to say what the Crown must prove, he says rather what he must do. He has pointed out the circumstantial nature of the evidence and, of course, there was no other kind of evidence, and by saying, \u201cthe circumstantial evidence although any part of it may be capable of innocent interpretation, should be closely connected so that the cumulative effect should almost impel me to find the accused guilty\u201d, he was putting to himself the well-recognized rule in Hodge\u2019s case[4]. When he says, \u201cI am left to draw too many inferences in order to reach the conclusion that the accused is guilty. Although my suspicions are strong that the accused was carrying on betting operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation\u201d, the learned magistrate is putting to himself again the basic proposition of criminal jurisprudence that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and when the magistrate used the words objected to and which I have quoted above, the magistrate was simply saying what he felt he should be able to determine in order to come to his conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. It may well be that neither the members of the Court of Appeal nor I, had we heard the evidence adduced at trial, would have any reasonable doubt, but it is not a doubt in our minds which is at issue, it is a reasonable doubt in the mind of the learned magistrate who tried the charges.\nI therefore am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversed, and that of the magistrate restored.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Maloney & Hess, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

In 1952, he applied for an increase in his salary. He was told by the head of his Department, the Solicitor General who had referred his application to the Attorney General, that he was entitled to an increase but due to the fact that a general survey of salaries in the Civil Service was in progress, an increase could not be granted at the time. However, he was told that he could draw a certain amount per month by way of expenses. A large number of the expense accounts which were thereafter submitted by the respondent were admittedly fictitious. This practice continued until 1960 when his salary was increased. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of guilty restored. Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the uncontradicted evidence of the respondent himself, no other conclusion could be reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, no other conclusion in law could be reached save that he had defrauded the provincial government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained. With the exception of certain counts in the indictment on which he was acquitted, there was no evidence on the basis of which any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to the respondent having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expenses which were fictitious and false. On an appeal from a conviction, if an Appellate Court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt, there is an error in law. It is no answer to a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the accused nor is the proposition that the province and the public were not defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely because the respondent's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought it ought to be. To hold so was an error in law.\nThe guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depended upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Courts below. This raised questions of law in respect of which there was error. There was, therefore, a right of appeal to this Court by the Crown.\nPer Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting: The judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense. It follows that this Court had no power to review the judgment of the Court of Appeal, since it is a well-settled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal to this Court is limited to questions of law in the strict sense and that when a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be dismissed.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1] , quashing the conviction of the respondent.

(Code Criminel 598).\nCet appel cependant ne peut porter que sur des questions de droit et nullement sur des questions de faits ou des questions mixtes de droit et de faits.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il me semble clair que la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du banc de la reine, en d\u00e9livrant son jugement, a fait reposer en partie ses conclusions sur des questions de faits, ou au moins sur des questions mixtes de droit et de faits qu'il nous est interdit de reviser.\nII faut, pour que la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada ait juridiction, qu'il s'agisse d'une question de droit stricte dans le vrai sens du mot. (508 C. Cr) (Rex. v. D\u00e9cary[3] ).\nComme je crois que cet appel comporte l'appr\u00e9ciation de questions de faits, je suis d'opinion que cette Cour n'a pas juridiction et que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the District of Quebec1, dated July 26, 1963, allowing an appeal from the judgment of His Honour Judge Dumontier dated September 28,1962, and directing that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted.\nOn July 16, 1962, the respondent, who had elected to be tried by a Judge without a jury, was arraigned before His Honour Judge Dumontier on an indictment containing three counts to which he pleaded \"not guilty\". We are concerned only with count 3, which reads as follows:\n3\u00b0. entre le 1er janvier 1952 et le 1er juillet 1960, dans les cit\u00e9 et district de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9tant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs, donc Commandant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de d\u00e9penses faux et fictifs pour lui-m\u00eame, fraud\u00e9 le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le Gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, pour une somme d'au moins $8,999.10, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21. On July 17, 1962, the learned trial judge ordered that this count be divided into 235 separate counts which are set out in his judgment and in that of the Court of Queen's Bench. The first of these reads as follows:\u2014\n3.-1. Le ou vers le 31 mai 1952, dans les cit\u00e9 et district de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9tant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs donc Commandant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de d\u00e9penses faux et fictifs pour lui-m\u00eame, fraud\u00e9 le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le Gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21;\nThe remaining 234 counts were similarly worded except as to date and amount; the last charged an offence committed on May 9, 1960.\nThe learned trial judge acquitted the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty as charged.\nWhile the printed record consists of many volumes the relevant facts may be stated comparatively briefly.\nIn May, 1940, the respondent was appointed Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police at a yearly salary of $4,000; in August, 1941, this was increased to $4,500. In 1952 the respondent applied for an increase in salary to the then Solicitor-General who referred the matter to Mr. Duplessis who was then both Attorney-General and Prime Minister. Mr. Duplessis told the Solicitor-General that an enquiry was going on before the Civil Service Commission into the question of raising the salaries of the Quebec Liquor Police and of civil servants in general and that if he granted the respondent an increase he would immediately be pressed with requests by others and then said words to the following effect:\nVous direz \u00e0 Lemire, ou vous lui ferez dire que je l'autorise \u00e0 retirer cinquante piastres ($50.00) par mois, \u00e0 titre de frais de repr\u00e9sentation, ou de d\u00e9penses,\nThe evidence of the Solicitor-General continued:\nDe retour \u00e0 mon bureau, j'ai dit \u00e0 Lemire \u2014 je ne sais pas si c'est \u00e0 lui personnellement ou si c'est peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 C\u00f4t\u00e9, ma m\u00e9moire n'est pas assez fid\u00e8le pour vous l'affirmer que je l'ai dit \u00e0 lui \u2014 mais je sais qu'il l'a su, ou \u00e0 son adjoint, qui \u00e9tait Wellie C\u00f4t\u00e9, que le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral l'autorisait \u00e0 retirer mensuellement un montant de cinquante dollars ($50.00) \u00e0 titre de frais de repr\u00e9sentation, et que dans le fond, \u00e9tait pour tenir lieu d'une augmentation de salaire qui s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 six cents piastres ($600.00) par ann\u00e9e. The substance of this conversation was communicated to the respondent by Wellie C\u00f4t\u00e9 who had been appointed associate director of the Quebec Liquor Police in January, 1951, and of whom Tremblay C.J. says that unofficially he was the respondent's superior. At this time C\u00f4t\u00e9 handed the respondent a cheque of the Qu\u00e9bec Liquor Police for $50. Some days later C\u00f4t\u00e9 presented a document to the respondent for signature. This was a printed form partially filled in in typewriting. The following phrase was type-written:\nD\u00e9placement et frais de s\u00e9jour pour surveillance du travail.\nSeveral blank spaces in the form intended for the insertion of details were left blank. Above the signature of the respondent appeared the following certificate:\nJe certifie que les d\u00e9penses plus haut mentionn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement encourues dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accord\u00e9es.\nThe form did not specify any \"cause\". It was dated \"May\".\nThereafter from time to time C\u00f4t\u00e9 presented the respondent with a cheque and a similar form which the respondent signed and in this manner the respondent received amounts totalling $50 a month until the form dated February 17, 1953, was returned to the respondent marked \"annul\u00e9\".\nOn receipt of this the respondent went to the office of the Provincial Auditor and had an interview with an employee. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence of their conversation was inadmissible and we do not know what was said between them. The question whether this evidence was rightly excluded is not before us, and consequently, I express no opinion on it.\nFollowing this interview the forms signed by the respondent were filled up in detail, specifying the place visited, the hotel at which respondent stayed, the amount paid for railway fare and the price paid for meals. There appears to be no doubt that a large number of these forms were entirely false in fact and described trips which the respondent had not taken.\nIn the year 1954 C\u00f4t\u00e9 advised the respondent that he was authorized to draw $100 a month in this manner instead of $50. This practice continued until May, 1960, when the respondent's annual salary was increased to $7,400 and he ceased to withdraw any further sums in augmentation of his salary.\nThe learned trial judge finds as a fact that the authorization to withdraw the sum of $50 was given orally by the Attorney-General and communicated to the respondent but concluded as a matter of law that it was \"nulle, de nullit\u00e9 absolue\". He goes on to hold that the respondent could not have had an honest belief that he was entitled to obtain the moneys which he did obtain by rendering expense accounts which were false in fact. He finds as a fact that the great majority of the expense accounts signed by the respondent were false and fictitious but does not specify which particular ones were false and finds that about twice a year the respondent went on trips of inspection in connection with which he would have been entitled to receive his expenses. He does not make an express finding as to whether C\u00f4t\u00e9 told the respondent he was authorized to draw $100 monthly instead of $50. At the time of the trial both the Attorney-General and C\u00f4t\u00e9 had died.\nThe respondent appealed against his convictions. On October 1, 1962, the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, granted him leave to appeal on questions of fact.\nThe appeal was heard by a Court composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ. The appeal was allowed and it was directed that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted. All the members of the Court reached the same result but each gave separate reasons.\nOn October 2, 1963, leave was granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court on the following three questions:\n1. La Cour d'Appel du district de Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle err\u00e9 en droit dans l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de l'article 592(1) (a) de Code Criminel du Canada?\n2. La Cour d'Appel du district de Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle err\u00e9 si elle a ignor\u00e9 les lois gouvernant la manipulation et la d\u00e9pense des deniers publics et a-t-elle mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les lois applicables dans l'esp\u00e9ce?\n3. La Cour d'Appel du district de Qu\u00e9bec a-t-elle err\u00e9 en droit dans l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de l'article 323(1) du Code Criminel?\nThis leave was granted pursuant to s. 598(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. Authority is not required for the wellsettled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal is limited to questions of law in the strict sense. It is clear from the judgment of this Court in The Queen v. Warner[4], that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be dismissed.\nI am satisfied that in the case at bar the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense.\nTremblay C.J. holds that as to the first 17 counts, in regard to which the certificates signed by the respondent named no \"cause\" and gave no details, the money was paid over to the respondent before he signed the certificates which constituted rather receipts for money paid than demands for payment and that no one was in fact deceived or induced to pay over the money by any representation on the part of the respondent. This is a finding of fact or, at the highest from the point of view of the appellant, a mixed finding of fact and law.\nAs to the remainder of the counts the learned Chief Justice expresses himself as follows:\nQuant aux autres chefs, entre en jeu une consid\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rente qui me para\u00eet p\u00e9remptoire.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9le hors de tout doute\u2014l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admisque certains frais inscrits sur les formules n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus par l'appelant. Mais il r\u00e9sulte aussi de la preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouv\u00e9 hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces frais n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du doigt ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. La seule preuve apport\u00e9e par la Couronne sur ce point r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'appelant \u00e9tait \u00e0 son bureau de Qu\u00e9bec la plupart du temps. Les t\u00e9moins admettent cependant qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par ann\u00e9e. L'appelant a retrouv\u00e9 deux formules qui contenaient des frais r\u00e9ellement encourus. Il a jur\u00e9 qu'il y en avait s\u00fbrement d'autres mais que sa m\u00e9moire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer apr\u00e8s tant d'ann\u00e9es. Il faut dire que l'appelant \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 74 ans lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne, me para\u00eet nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs, le premier juge a acquitt\u00e9 l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu pr\u00e9ciser. De son propre chef, il a retranch\u00e9 du montant all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans d'autres chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit de recouvrer.\nDe ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de il r\u00e9sulte que, m\u00eame si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le paiement et les repr\u00e9sentations, je ne puis dire quant \u00e0 quels chefs d'accusation en particulier les repr\u00e9sentations sont fausses et quant \u00e0 quels chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef num\u00e9ro 18 qui fait double emploi avec le chef num\u00e9ro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9. Le substitut du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a d'ailleurs franchement admis lors de l'audition qu'il est impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation pr\u00e9cis sont bien fond\u00e9s. La seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable et que l'appelant doit \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9 sur tous les chefs.\nThis appears to me to be a finding of fact. The learned Chief Justice has considered the evidence and reached the conclusion that it does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the guilt of the accused upon any of the counts on which he was convicted. I find it impossible to say that the question whether he was right in reaching this conclusion is one of law in the strict sense.\nTASCHEREAU J. delivered the following reasons:\nLes faits r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s par la preuve et qu'ont expos\u00e9s M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Casey d\u00e9montrent que de graves irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par l'appelant. Mais la question vitale est celle de savoir si Lemire, un homme maintenant \u00e2g\u00e9 de 74 ans qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 directeur de la police des liqueurs \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, pendant vingt ans, avait l'intention coupable de frauder le public et le gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, lorsqu'il a pos\u00e9 les actes qu'on lui reproche.\nL'\u00e9tude du dossier m'a convaincu qu'il fallait r\u00e9pondre n\u00e9gativement \u00e2 cette question. Aussi, commes mes coll\u00e8gues, j'accueillerais l'appel et lib\u00e9rerais l'accus\u00e9:\nThe first paragraph accurately states a question which the Court of Appeal was called upon to answer. It involves an inquiry into the respondent's state of mind. The state of a man's mind is, in the often quoted words of Bowen L.J., as much a fact as the state of his digestion; vide Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5]. The decision of Taschereau J. to allow the appeal appears to me to be based on a finding of fact certainly it cannot be said that the sole ground on which he has proceeded is a question of law in the strict sense.\nFrom this it appears that a majority of the Court of Appeal, in quashing the convictions, have proceeded on grounds which this Court has no power to review and it follows that the appeal must be dismissed.\nHaving reached this conclusion it becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether it could be said that the judgment of Casey J. was based only on grounds which this Court has jurisdiction to review and I express no opinion on that question.\nI would dismiss the appeal. The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The material facts involved in this case are not in dispute. At all relevant times the respondent Lemire (hereinafter referred to as \"Lemire\") was the Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police. There was an Associate Chief, one Wellie C\u00f4t\u00e9, who was in fact, though not in name, the real head of the force. In the year 1952 Lemire applied to the Solicitor-General of Quebec for an increase in his salary, which was then $4,500 per annum. The Solicitor-General referred the application to the Attorney-General, Mr. Duplessis, who was then also the Prime Minister of the Province. The latter, while he approved of an increase for Lemire, was not prepared to grant it, because it might provoke other similar requests, and the whole salary structure of the Quebec civil service was then under review. He told the Solicitor-General to tell Lemire that he would authorize Lemire to draw $50 per month by way of expenses. This information was communicated to Lemire by C\u00f4t\u00e9.\nI agree with Casey J. in the Court[6] below when he says that the instructions given by the Attorney-General necessarily implied the making of fictitious expense accounts.\nLemire commenced, in May, 1952, to put in expense accounts, initially for $50 per month and then, commencing on July 15, 1952, for $25 for each half month, represented to be for \"Frais de d\u00e9placement et de s\u00e9jour pour surveillance du travail.\" Each of these expense accounts contained the following certificate, signed by Lemire:\nJe certifie que les d\u00e9penses plus haut mentionn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement encourues dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accord\u00e9es.\nThe expense account dated February 14, 1953, was returned to Lemire, by the Provincial Auditor's Department, marked \"annul\u00e9\". Lemire then saw an employee of that Department who is unkown. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence by Lemire as to his interview with the employee was not admissible. In any event Lemire filed an expense account, dated February 15, 1953, purporting to contain the details of his expenditures, totalling $25. Thereafter, until the beginning of the year 1954, he proceeded to file two, and occasionally three, expense accounts each month, appearing to contain items of expenditure which he had incurred, each one of which contained the certificate previously quoted. Each of these was for an odd amount and not for an even $25.\nEarly in the year 1954 Lemire says that he was advised by C\u00f4t\u00e9 that his monthly expense accounts could be increased to $100. At the time of the trial C\u00f4t\u00e9 was dead. Evidence was given by the former Solicitor-General that he was unaware of any authority having been given for any increase beyond the initial, fixed amount of $50 per month. Commencing in 1954, Lemire's total expense accounts rendered each month became larger. In most instances two accounts were filed in each month, although on some occasions there would be three or more.\nThis practice continued until the year 1960, when Lemire received a salary increase to $7,400 per annum. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased.\nThe procedure respecting expense accounts was that two forms were required to be filed, one white and one yellow, the latter being retained in the office of the Liquor Police. The white one, signed by the person seeking payment of expenses, had to be verified by the accountant of the Liquor Police, was then forwarded to the Department of the Attorney-General and, from there, was transmitted to the office of the Provincial Auditor for approval. Section 17 of the Provincial Audit Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c.72, required that such accounts be examined and that it be ascertained that the payments charged be supported by voucher.\nIt is clear, from this brief outline of the facts, the material portions of which are admitted by Lemire, that, over a period of years, he submitted expense accounts which he knew to be false and obtained payment out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec of those amounts which were claimed in the expense accounts.\nLemire was charged under s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code, which provides:\n323. (1) Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years. The learned trial judge required that the original count, which had charged Lemire with defrauding the public and, in particular, the Government of the Province of Quebec, of the sum of $8,999.10, be divided into 235 separate counts, each dealing with one expense account.\nCount No. 1 will serve as an example of the form in which these various charges were made:\n1. le ou vers le 31 mai 1952, dans les cit\u00e9 et district de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9tant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs dont Commandant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de d\u00e9penses faux et fictifs pour lui-m\u00eame, fraud\u00e9 le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et le Gouvernement de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21;\nThe learned trial judge acquitted the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty as charged.\nLemire's appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[7], was allowed by unanimous decision. The Court was composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ., each of whom gave separate reasons.\nAs to the first 17 counts, which dealt with those expense accounts rendered by Lemire prior to and including that dated February 14, 1953, which was annulled by the Auditor-General, Tremblay C.J. says:\nPour ces 17 premiers cas, l'appelant t\u00e9moigne, et il n'est pas contredit, que les ch\u00e8ques lui \u00e9taient remis soit avant, soit au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 on lui demandait de signer les formules. Ce ne sont donc pas les repr\u00e9sentations contenues dans ces formules qui ont amen\u00e9 le consentement au paiement. C'\u00e9tait un re\u00e7u que l'appelant signait plut\u00f4t qu'une demande de paiement.\nDe plus, il ne me para\u00eet pas raisonnable de croire que quelqu'un ait pu \u00eatre tromp\u00e9 par ces formules. Bien que la partie imprim\u00e9e de la formule l'exige\u00e2t, aucune date de d\u00e9part ou de retour, aucun d\u00e9tail des suppos\u00e9s frais ne sont donn\u00e9s. Le certificat qui r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00abl'int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette cause\u00bb n'a pu tromper personne puisqu'aucune cause n'est mentionn\u00e9e. ll manque donc un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l'offense: le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le consentement au paiement et les repr\u00e9sentations de l'appelant. ll est possible que ceux qui ont pay\u00e9 n'avaient pas le pouvoir de disposer ainsi des fonds publics, mais il y aurait alors recours civil en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'ind\u00fb mais non crime de fraude.\nL'on dira peut-\u00eatre que ce raisonnement est exact quant au \u00abgouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u00bb mais non quant \u00abau public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u00bb que l'appelant est aussi accus\u00e9 d'avoir \u00abfraud\u00e9\u00bb. Si l'on consid\u00e8re le public ind\u00e9pendamment de son mandataire, le gouvernement de la province, il faut d\u00e9cider que, si l'appelant est coupable d'un crime, ce n'est pas de celui de fraude, parce que le public n'a jamais consenti au paiement et que le consentement de la personne frustr\u00e9e est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du crime de fraude.\nWith respect, I think it is an error in law to construe the forms signed by Lemire as being receipts, rather than demands for payment, merely because, according to his evidence, after the first occasion, the signed form was handed him by C\u00f4t\u00e9 at the same time that he received the cheque from C\u00f4t\u00e9. The cheques which were delivered by C\u00f4t\u00e9 were drawn on the account of the Liquor Police. They were signed by C\u00f4t\u00e9, as director, and also by the accountant of the Liquor Police. They represented payments from public funds, which, admittedly, could only be validly justified by proper vouchers, and these C\u00f4t\u00e9 had to obtain. Expense moneys were payable only on the basis of a certified statement of actual expense. Each such statement had to be verified and thereafter to be approved by the Auditor-General. It is obvious that Lemire could not have continued to receive the cheques without having provided the false statements which were the basis for their issuance. The scheme must be examined as a whole and, when that is done, there is no question but that false expense accounts were submitted by Lemire as a basis for his receipt of public funds. This constitutes the \"lien de causalite\" between the vouchers and the payments which the learned Chief Justice felt was lacking in this case.\nIt is suggested that no one was deceived by these expense accounts because they did not contain a detailed list of the expenditures as contemplated by the form. To say this is to say either that the persons required by law to check the forms were themselves also parties to the fraud, or that they failed to perform their duties properly. However, even if this be so, and whichever is the case, this does not provide Lemire with an answer in law to the charges under s. 323(1). Whether or not they deceived the people who were supposed to check and verify them, the point is that, without filing of the expense accounts, the payments to Lemire from public funds could not have been obtained or continued. Section 323(1), in addition to mentioning deceit and falsehood, also refers to \"other fraudulent means\". Whether or not they deceived the people who saw them, they were the necessary means used to obtain the payments and without them the payments would not have been made. They were fraudulent. In my opinion the ground taken in the second paragraph above quoted is wrong in law.\nIn the third paragraph of the passage above quoted it is said that the public was not defrauded because the public never consented to the payment. There is here an error in law. The public, through its elected representatives, had consented to the expenditure of public funds only on the basis of compliance with the requisite statutory procedures. In my opinion any one who, by fraudulently purporting to fulfill those requirements, obtained payment of public moneys, to which he was not lawfully entitled, would thereby have defrauded the public within the meaning of s. 323(1).\nI find it impossible to see how, on the uncontradicted evidence of Lemire himself, any other conclusion can be reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, I do not see how any other conclusion in law can be reached save that he had defrauded the Provincial Government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained.\nIn this connection the reasoning of Cartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of this Court in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[8], is relevant. In that case the accused were charged with having conspired to commit an indictable offence; i.e., by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited. It was contended in argument that there was no evidence that any official of that company had been deceived, particularly as the president of the company and its controlling shareholder was fully aware of all that was being done by the accused. Dealing with this argument, Cartwright J., at p. 512, said:\nIn the course of argument on this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false representation made to the company or of any official of the company have been deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished. Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the meaning of s. 597(1) of the Criminal Code,, I would reject this argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to the $200,000 which is the first item in the particulars. I have already indicated my agreement with the statement of Freedman J.A. that \"implicit in the entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to make\" and with his view that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding that this representation was false to the knowledge of the accused. If it deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at least in control of the company into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that would be a fraud on the company. If, on the other hand, it is suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid the money over knowing that the transaction was not bona fide, that the Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with its own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds to purchase an asset which they know to be worthless as part of a scheme to divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be said that, the directors being \"the mind of the company\" and well knowing the true facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I should find it difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case the directors would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood, by \"other fraudulent means\".\nAs to the expense accounts submitted after February 14, 1953, the learned Chief Justice says:\nQuant aux autres chefs, entre en jeu une consid\u00e9ration diff\u00e9rente qui me para\u00eet p\u00e9remptoire.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le hors de tout doute\u2014l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admis\u2014que certains frais inscrits sur les formules n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus par l'appelant. Mais, il r\u00e9sulte aussi de la preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouv\u00e9 hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces frais n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du doigt ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. La seule preuve apport\u00e9e par la Couronne sur ce point r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l'appelant \u00e9tait \u00e0 son bureau de Qu\u00e9bec la plupart du temps. Les t\u00e9moins admettent cependant qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par ann\u00e9e. L'appelant a retrouv\u00e9 deux formules qui contenaient des frais r\u00e9ellement encourus. ll a jur\u00e9 qu'il y en avait s\u00fbrement d'autres mais que sa m\u00e9moire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer apr\u00e8s tant d'ann\u00e9es. ll faut dire que l'appelant \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 74 ans lors de son t\u00e9moignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne, me para\u00eet nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs, le premier juge a acquitt\u00e9 l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu pr\u00e9ciser. De son propre chef, il a retranch\u00e9 du montant all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans d'autres chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit de recouvrer.\nDe ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de il r\u00e9sulte que, m\u00eame si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalit\u00e9 entre le paiement et les repr\u00e9sentations, je ne puis dire quant \u00e0 quels chefs d'accusation en particulier les repr\u00e9sentations sont fausses et quant \u00e0 quels chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef num\u00e9ro 18 qui fait double emploi avec le chef num\u00e9ro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9. Le substitut du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a d'ailleurs franchement admis lors de l'audition qu'il est impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation pr\u00e9cis sont bien fond\u00e9s. La seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun chef n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable et que l'appelant doit \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9 sur tous les chefs. Before this Court, counsel for the appellant impressed upon us that there must have been a misunderstanding with respect to the admission referred to in the last paragraph, in the passage above quoted, as having been made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Counsel before us advised that he did not think that such an admission had been made. It certainly had not been intended to make any such admission on behalf of the Crown, and the record would not support the making of it.\nIn my opinion the conclusion reached in this passage is also wrong. Lemire was asked, in his evidence, to indicate which of the expense accounts in evidence represented expenditures really incurred by him. He was able to identify only two. The following is the evidence which he gave in chief in this connection:\nPAR Me REN\u00c9 LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nQ. Alors, en somme, monsieur Lemire, dans cette p\u00e9riode, allant de mai, mil neuf cent-cinquante-deux (1952), \u00e0 mai, mil neuf cent-soixante (1960), vous dites que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir cinquante dollars ($50.00) par mois jusqu'en mil neuf cent cinquante-quatre (1954)?\nR. Oui.\nQ. C'est-\u00e0-dire huit (8) mois en mil neuf cent cinquante-deux (1952), c'est \u00e7a?\nR. C'est \u00e7a.\nQ. Et douze (12) mois, en mil neuf cent cinquante-trois?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Ce qui fait vingt (20) mois \u00e0 cinquante dollars ($50.00), soit mille dollars ($1,000.00)?\nR. C'est \u00e7a.\nQ. Et ce que vous dites, c'est qu'\u00e0 partir de mil neuf cent cinquante-quatre (1954), jusqu'\u00e0 mil neuf cent soixante (1960), c'\u00e9tait cent dollars ($100.00) par mois?\nR. C'est \u00e7a.\nQ. Est-ce que vous pourriez nous dire, effectivement, combien vous avez pris sur ces montants-l\u00e0, pendant cette p\u00e9riode-l\u00e0?\nR. Bien, je calcule que je dois avoir pris entre huit mille (8,000) et huit mille six cents piastres ($8,600.00).\nQ. Je comprends \u00e9galement qu'il y a des comptes de d\u00e9penses, pour plus ce montant l\u00e0?\nR. Absolument.\nQ. Comment expliquez-vous cette difference-l\u00e0?\nR. Bien \u00e7a, je ne peux pas le dire, parce que j'ai fait des voyages, et dans les comptes, je ne les ai pas vus.\nQ. Alors, est-ce que vous voulez dire que la diff\u00e9rence repr\u00e9senterait vos d\u00e9penses r\u00e9elles?\nR. Oui. Q. Et, vous avez dit tout \u00e0 l'heure que vous \u00eates m\u00eame d'opinion qu'il en manque des comptes de d\u00e9penses?\nR. Je le crois.\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. Seriez-vous capable, en examinant chacun des exhibits, nous dire si vous ne pourriez pas reconna\u00eetre des comptes, pour des d\u00e9penses que vous auriez r\u00e9ellement faites pour des voyages?\nR. Bien, j'ai regard\u00e9 avec Me Letarte, j'en ai vu une couple.\nD'autre part, j'ai des comptes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour des voyages, et je ne les ai pas vus.\nQ. Alors, est-ce que vous pourriez m'indiquer ceux-l\u00e0 que vous avez vus?\nSi vous avez besoin d'un ajournement pour examiner les comptes attentivement, je vais vous permettre de le faire.\nR. On les a examin\u00e9s tous les deux.\nPAR Me REN\u00c9 LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nMoi, je ne peux pas t\u00e9moigner.\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. Mais, vous m'avez dit, si j'ai bien compris, que dans les exhibits produits, il y en aurait deux (2) que vous avez reconnus comme repr\u00e9sentant des d\u00e9penses que vous auriez r\u00e9ellement faites \u00e0 l'occasion de voyages?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la Police des Liqueurs?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Alors, pourriez-vous les indiquer \u00e0 la Cour, dans les exhibits, ces deux-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui, il y a un voyage en Gasp\u00e9sie, je pense, au commencement de septembre, mil neuf cent cinquante-neuf (1959).\nQ. Il s'agit de quel exhibit?\nPAR LE GREFFIER:\nP.-221.\nPAR LE T\u00c9MOIN:\nR. Oui, quarante-deux piastres et trent-cinq ($42.35).\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. Ce sont des d\u00e9penses r\u00e9elles que vous avez assum\u00e9es pour du travail \u00e0 la Police des Liqueurs?\nR. Oui.\nEt il y en a un autre, je me rappelle pas de la date, c'est un voyage aux environs de La Tuque et Berthier.\nPAR Me LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nQ. Maintenant, voici \u00e0 part ces deux voyages-l\u00e0, voulez-vous dire qu'int\u00e9gralement . . .\nPAR LA COUR:\nJ'aimerais bien qu'on le retrace avant de clore la D\u00e9fense; j'aimerais bien qu'on le retrace. PAR Me REN\u00c9 LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nQ. Ce serait en quelle ann\u00e9e, \u00e7\u00e0, celui-l\u00e0 en particulier?\nR. Je me rappelle pas, je ne sais pas si c'est en cinquante-six (56), ou en cinquante-sept (57), c'est pas mal loin en arri\u00e8re.\nQ. Est-ce qu'il y aurait eu une note particuli\u00e8re, sur ce compte-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui, il y aurait eu le nom de Letarte et de Laforest, dessus.\nPAR LE GREFFIER:\nAlors, ce serait P.-38.\nPAR Me REN\u00c9 LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nQ. C'est \u00e7a, P.-38, en novembre, mil neuf cent cinquante-trois (1953)?\nR. Oui, pour un montant de vingt-neuf et vingt-cinq ($29.25).\nQ. Alors, \u00e7a, ce sont deux comptes, dans les comptes auxquels vous venez de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer, pour lesquels vous vous souvenez positivement qu'il s'agit int\u00e9gralement de d\u00e9penses r\u00e9elles?\nR. Absolument.\nQ. Maintenant, dans les autres cas, dans les autres comptes, qu'est-ce qu'il y a l\u00e0-dedans?\nR. C'est parce qu'on a fait un voyage \u00e0 Saint-Hilaire, aussi, dans le temps, c'est pr\u00e8s de Beloeil, \u00e7a.\nPAR LA COUR:\nQ. Dans le comt\u00e9 de Rouville?\nR. Oui.\nEnsuite, j'en ai fait \u00e0 Chicoutimi.\nPAR Me REN\u00c9 LETARTE,\nDe la part de l'accus\u00e9:\nQ. Maintenant, est-ce que des comptes s\u00e9par\u00e9s et distincts \u00e9taient faits pour ces autres voyages-l\u00e0, ou bien non, si vos d\u00e9penses \u00e9taient dissimul\u00e9es dans d'autres comptes?\nR. Je ne faisais pas de distinction, des fois je le marquais dans le mois, avec l'autre, l\u00e0.\nQ. Vous m\u00ealiez \u00e7a ensemble?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Et ce que nous allons appeler votre allocation, et les d\u00e9penses r\u00e9elles qui vous \u00e9taient occasionn\u00e9es dans le mois?\nR. Absolument.\nQ. C'\u00e9tait fondu ensemble?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Maintenant, vous dites que, toutefois, dans cette liste-l\u00e0, il y a deux cas o\u00f9 ce sont des comptes r\u00e9ellement distincts pour des voyages en particulier?\nR. Oui.\nThis evidence can be summarized as follows:\n1. Of the expense accounts which were exhibits, Lemire could identify only two as representing genuine expenses.\n2. He thought there were other expense accounts which he had submitted which were not included among the exhibits at the trial.\n3. He thought that some of the expense accounts which were exhibits, apart from the two which he had specifically identified, included both real and false expenses mingled together.\nTo say that, on this evidence, a reasonable doubt exists as to Lemire's guilt on each and every charge is, in my view, wrong in law.\nIn the first place, Lemire does not appear to go any further in relation to the expense accounts, other than the two which he identified, than to say that some of them may have contained a mixture of real and false expenditures. Even accepting this evidence, it would be wrong in law to hold that he was entitled to an acquittal in respect of an expense account which contained some real expenditures as well as false expenditures merely because the amount charged in the count would then be larger, by the amount of the real expenditures, than the amount which he actually obtained by fraud. To hold that, in such a case, Lemire was entitled to an acquittal is an error in law.\nIn the second place, the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice as to the existence of a reasonable doubt on all counts has no basis on the evidence. Lemire admitted that the express purpose of filing the expense accounts was. in order to obtain payments to him equivalent to $50 per month, and later $100 per month. An examination of the total of the accounts rendered for each month and also for each year establishes, beyond peradventure, that in practically every month, from 1952 to 1960, inclusive, a part, if not the whole, of each account rendered represented expenses not actually incurred. An example will illustrate the point which I am seeking to make. In October, 1954, after Lemire had increased his expense account payments from $50 to $100 per month, he rendered two expense accounts, one on October 8 for $48.90, another on October 22 for $53.25, making a total for the month of $102.15. This total exceeds the $100 which he was seeking to obtain in lieu of salary increase by only $2.15. Each of the two expense accounts was for more than that amount. Similarly, in the following month of November three accounts were rendered, one on November 8 for $35.90, one on November 20 for $41.90, one on November 25 for $29.10, making a total of $106.90. In December the monthly total was $76.50, made up of two accounts, one on December 4 for $33.85, the second on December 16 for $42.65. In view of Lemire's own admission as to the basic purpose for which the accounts were rendered, it seems to me to be impossible to conclude that any one of these seven accounts mentioned related only to expenditures genuinely incurred. This illustration could be repeated many times.\nWith the exception of those counts on which Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on the basis of which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire's having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were fictitious and false.\nIn my opinion, on an appeal from a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error in law.\nI turn now to the reasons given by Casey J., who said:\nDespite what is said in the judgment and in respondent's factum, the facts of this case are crystal clear and surprisingly simple. Appellant wanted an increase and the one who controlled every aspect of the Government's business and certainly that of appellant's department, the Attorney General and Prime Minister, felt that his request was a legitimate one and that it should be granted. But there was a fly in the ointment. An enquiry into the government's salary structure was under way and it would have been embarrassing to grant an increase at that moment. In fact \"that moment\" dragged on and on and the results of the enquiry were given effect only in November of 1959. So the means above described were devised.\nWithout commenting on the propriety or prevalence of this method of granting disguised salary increases, and without asking why appellant's situation was not regularized post factum, I give it as my view that in the circumstances obtaining throughout this whole period appellant was entitled to believe that for reasons of higher policy he was given an increase in this fashion and that the procedure, irregular though it may have been on its face, could and would in the fullness of time be ratified and validated. After all he was dealing with the person who gave the orders, and who had\u2014\"l'autorit\u00e9 pour augmenter ou diminuer les salaires\".\nSince the instructions given by the Attorney General necessarily implied the making of fictitious expense accounts I am unable to find in appellant the intention to defraud contemplated by the Criminal Code, nor since we are dealing with a salary increase that his superiors considered warranted, am I able to see in what respect the public or the Province was defrauded.\nThe effect of the second paragraph, above quoted, may be rather bluntly summarized in this way. Because the augmentation of Lemire's income by the filing of false expense accounts was suggested and approved by the Attorney-General and Prime Minister of the Province, Lemire, who deliberately filed false documents and thereby obtained payments from the provincial public funds, could not be held guilty of fraud, because he could reasonably anticipate that the fraudulent system would later be somehow validated. In other words, there is no intent to defraud within the requirement of s. 323(1) if the accused person, while deliberately committing an act which is clearly fraudulent, expects that that which he is doing may, at a later date, be validated. To me the very statement of this proposition establishes its error in law.\nIncidentally, it may be noted that when, in 1960, Lemire's salary was increased, no attempt was made to validate his receipt of the moneys paid to him on the basis of the false expense accounts in the preceding years.\nThe implication of the third paragraph is that, because the suggestion for the proposed fraudulent method emanated from the Attorney-General of the Province, Lemire, who was the one who deliberately certified the fraudulent expense accounts, could not be found to have intended to defraud and, further, that because his superiors thought Lemire was entitled to a salary increase (which they would not grant), a fraudulent scheme for the obtaining of payment of fictitious expense accounts did not constitute a fraud on the public.\nTo me the idea that it is an answer to a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the accused is completely erroneous in law, as is also the proposition that the Province of Quebec and the public of Quebec were not defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely because Lemire's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought it ought to be.\nIn conclusion, with respect to the reasons given by the learned judges to which I have referred, it appears to me that, while each of them contains findings which, viewed in isolation, might, at first glance, be regarded as findings of fact, or of mixed fact and law, each judgment is palpably based on a misconception of the effect of s. 323(1) of the Criminal Code. We have, in this case, an accused person who admits to having obtained, out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec, between $8,000 and $8,600 and, for that purpose, to have rendered certified expense accounts which were fictitious. These facts are not in dispute. In the reasons given in the Court below, which I have reviewed, certain inferences have been drawn from the facts in evidence, but the fundamental error which exists in each, and which is an error in law, is in holding that, on the basis of those inferences, some element in the offence was lacking.\nIn Belyea and Weinraub v. The King[9], this Court considered a case in which the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario had allowed an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal by the trial court in proceedings by indictment. The right of appeal to the Appellate Division was limited, as is the appellant's right to appeal to this Court in the present case, to questions of law. It was contended by the appellants in that case that the issues before the Appellate Division did not involve a question of law alone. Chief Justice Anglin, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at p. 296:\nThe right of appeal by the Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to \"questions of law\". That implies, if it means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,\u2014especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.\nIn my opinion, the guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of which, for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no ground not involving such questions upon which Lemire's appeal could have been allowed. There was, therefore, a right of appeal to this Court and the appeal should succeed. The judgment of the learned trial judge, with respect to the question of guilt, should be restored. Lemire also appealed against sentence, but, in view of the conclusions there reached, no decision was rendered on this point by the Court below. The case should therefore, be returned to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, to deal with the appeal from sentence.\nAppeal allowed, conviction restored, TASCHEREAU CJ. and CARTWRIGHT and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Ivan Mignault and Jean Bienvenue, Quebec.\nAttorney for the respondent: Ren\u00e9 Letarte, Quebec.\n[1] [1936] Que.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1964: November 4, 5; 1964: December 21.\nPresent: Cartwright, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nContracts\u2014Agreement between subcontractors to undertake highway contract\u2014Subsequent agreement of contractor with one of the subcontractors to perform the contract\u2014Whether contractor entitled to enforce provisions of agreement betwen itself and one of the subcontractors as against the other subcontractor\u2014Counterclaim for arrears of equipment rental\u2014Claim for damages flowing from interim injunction preventing subcontractor removing machinery.\nThe plaintiff company, which was the successful tenderer for the construction of certain sections of a highway, had proposed an arrangement with another company L that when the tender was accepted the plaintiff would immediately assign the contract in whole to L. The plaintiff had advised L to obtain the services of someone who had knowledge of excavating through rock and who possessed the necessary equipment for that type of work. L made arrangements with the defendant company V and an agreement between them was executed on July 22, 1958. On the following day a copy of this agreement was delivered to the plaintiff's manager, and on July 28th the plaintiff entered into a contract with L. The job was commenced by L and V and some financial assistance required by the latter in connection with its equipment was given by the plaintiff. The work progressed badly and on April 1, 1959, L was to a large extent removed by the plaintiff from the operation of the contract; L formally abdicated its position under the contract on July 23rd. Under an agreement made between a representative of the plaintiff and a representative of V, and later confirmed by a letter which the plaintiff wrote to V, the plaintiff used V's equipment through the working season of 1959 and certain rental payments were made. When these rentals fell into arrears, V threatened to remove its machinery. The plaintiff took the position that a partnership existed between V and L, which partnership was evidenced by the agreement between the two on July 22, 1958, and that, since such partnership existed, V was bound as was L by the provisions of the contract between the plaintiff and L and particularly by para. 12 thereof, which contained specific provisions in the event of default by the subcontractor.\nUpon V insisting that it must be paid the equipment rentals or that it would remove its equipment, the plaintiff applied for and obtained an interim injunction preventing V from so doing. At trial, the judge dismissed the plaintiff's action and allowed the defendant's counterclaim, but refused to grant to the defendant any damages attributable to the interim injunction. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to the interim injunction and dismissed the defendant's counterclaim. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the judgment in favour of the defendant upon the counterclaim restored, and a reference directed to determine the damages attributable to the interim injunction, such damages to be granted to the defendant.\nIt was unnecessary to determine whether or not V and L were partners. Even if one presumed that the relationship of these two companies was a partnership, it was abundantly clear that the plaintiff elected to deal with L alone. Having so elected the plaintiff now could not attempt to hold the defendant liable and require it to perform the contract of L even if it were a partner of L. British Homes Assurance Corporation, Ltd. v. Paterson, [1902] 2 Ch. 404, applied; Calder v. Dobell (1871), 6 C.P. 486; Basma v. Weekes et al., [1950] A.C. 441, distinguished. Accordingly, the plaintiff was not entitled to enforce the provisions of para. 12 of the agreement between itself and L, as against V, and prevent V from removing its equipment either in April 1959, when L abandoned the contract, or later, when the plaintiff failed to pay the equipment rental.\nThe defendant was entitled to succeed on its counterclaim for the arrears of equipment rental which it alleged was owed to it by the plaintiff. The transaction between the defendant company and the plaintiff company was a contract for the payment of equipment rental at scheduled rates, the schedule being that set out in the agreement of July 22, 1958, between V and L.\nWith respect to the defendant's claim for damages flowing from the interim injunction, this was an ordinary case of an injunction granted upon a plaintiff's application and upon the plaintiff's undertaking to abide by any order which the Court might make as to damages, and the plaintiff should be required to make good its undertaking. Accordingly, an inquiry as to damages was granted. Griffith v. Blake (1884), 27 Ch. D. 474, approved.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], granting an appeal from a judgment of Riley J. Appeal allowed, judgment of the Appellate Division set aside and judgment at trial varied.\nR. A. McLennan and T. C. Fraser, for the defendant, appellant.\nT. Mayson, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2] pronounced on May 6, 1964, granting an appeal from the judgment pronounced after trial by Riley J. on June 24, 1963. In that judgment, the learned trial judge dismissed the action of the respondent Rush & Tompkins Construction Ltd. and allowed the appellant's, Vieweger Construction Ltd., counterclaim in the amount of $42,769.64, but refused to grant to the appellant any damages attributable to the interim injunction to which reference shall be made here-after.\nRush & Tompkins Construction Ltd., hereinafter referred to as Rush & Tompkins, had acted as the financial backer of a company known as Layden Construction Ltd., and in some considerable number of cases had submitted tenders under its own name to owners contemplating certain construction work. Then, when its tender was accepted, Rush & Tompkins immediately assigned that contract in whole to Layden Construction Ltd.\nUpon a call for tenders having been issued by the Government of Canada for the construction of certain sections of the Trans-Canada Highway in the Rogers Pass area of British Columbia, Rush & Tompkins proposed to make a similiar arrangement with Layden Construction Ltd. but first advised Layden Construction Ltd. to obtain the services of someone who had knowledge of excavating through rock and who possessed the necessary equipment for that type of work. There is some indication in the evidence that Rush & Tompkins actually designated to Layden Construction the appellant company and its chief officer, Mr. Luther Vieweger, as being acceptable. Be that as it may, Layden Construction Ltd., through its officers, Mr. James Layden and Mr. Earl Layden, met with Mr. Luther Vieweger who assisted them with advice and figures and took an active part in the preparation of the tenders for two sections of the said highway. The tenders were submitted in Rush & Tompkins' name and upon Rush & Tompkins being advised that they were the successful tenderers the general manager of that company, John Ford, advised Mr. James Layden, the manager of Layden Construction Ltd. of that fact, and told him to make his own arrangements with Vieweger Construction Ltd. Mr. James Layden, at trial, testified:\nQ. Following this meeting, did you or Mr. Vieweger have a meeting or discussion as to your relationship? A. Mr. Ford told me to make my own agreement with Mr. Vieweger, which we done later on.\nAnd Mr. Ford testified:\nI discussed the matter with Jim Layden that I wanted an agreement between he and Vieweger Construction as to how they were going\u2014what arrangements they were going to have between themselves.\nUpon receiving such instructions, James Layden, Earl Layden, and their accountant, one James Butler, met with Luther Vieweger and discussed the arrangement between Layden Construction Ltd. and the appellant company. As a result an agreement was prepared and executed by the respective companies. That agreement was produced at trial as Exhibit 4 and will be referred to hereafter.\nOn the very following day, i.e., July 23, 1958, James Layden delivered a copy of Exhibit 4 to Mr. John Ford, the manager of Rush & Tompkins, and on July 28th Rush & Tompkins entered into a contract with Layden Construction Ltd. This first agreement between Rush & Tompkins and Layden Construction Ltd. was of an informal nature, produced as Exhibit 12, and was later replaced by a formal contract which although it also bore the date July 28, 1958 was not actually executed until some considerable time thereafter. The latter formal contract was produced at trial as Exhibit 9 and it will be referred to hereafter.\nLayden Construction Ltd. and the appellant commenced work. It appeared that the appellant company required some financial assistance at the very beginning. Various items of their equipment were repaired and the repairmen were paid directly by Rush & Tompkins. In addition, the latter company paid to various finance companies accounts which were alleged to be in arrears on equipment which the appellant company had purchased. All of these payments were charged in Rush & Tompkins' accounts to Layden Construction Ltd. and none were charged to nor were payments of any kind received from the appellant company.\nLuther Vieweger was active on the site of the work and in a short time differences of temperament between him and the foreman of the Layden Construction company became a source of concern, which seems to have been adjusted by Mr. Luther Vieweger suggesting that a completely independent foreman be retained and given full authority and by Luther Vieweger undertaking to \"continue to serve to the best of my ability under the circumstances centering particularly on getting some rock drilled off\". The work progressed badly and on April 1, 1959, Layden Construction were to a large extent removed by Rush & Tompkins from the operation of the contract. Layden Construction Ltd., on July 23, 1959, by letter of that date, Exhibit 10, formally abdicated its position under the contract of July 28, 1958.\nIt is of some considerable significance that Luther Vieweger has sworn that he was never informed of the final amount of the tenders submitted by Rush & Tompkins to the Canadian Government and that he never received any copy of either Exhibit 12 or the formal agreement which followed it, Exhibit 9, nor was he shown a copy of the abdication letter to which I have just referred. He was informed by Mr. John Ford, the general manager of Rush & Tompkins, that the Layden Construction company was being removed from the operation and he was asked to confer with the new project manager, a Mr. Murphy. He met Mr. Murphy in Vancouver, after Mr. Murphy had inspected the site of the operations, and Mr. Vieweger swore that at this meeting Mr. Murphy, on behalf of Rush & Tompkins, agreed to use certain of the defendant's (here appellant's) equipment and to pay rental therefor \"as scheduled\" and on July 8, 1959, Rush & Tompkins, over the signature of Mr. Ford, wrote to Mr. Vieweger a letter which read as follows:\nOn April 1, 1959, our Mr. B. N. Murphy took over from Mr. Jim Layden as Project Manager on our road contract 15\/58\/TCH-G at Stoney Creek Siding, Glacier Park, B.C.\nThis is to confirm arrangements made by Mr. Murphy with you subsequent to that date that you were not required on job. However, as your equipment was to be used on this project, it was agreed that you should draw a salary of $500.00 per month, while job was in operation. Moreover, it was agreed that such wages received would be deducted from any machine rental earned.\nThe appellant company worked under this new arrangement with Rush & Tompkins and the respondent used the equipment through the working season in 1959 and made certain payments on account of rentals to the appellant company. When these equipment rentals fell into arrears, the appellant company threatened to remove its machinery and for the first time the respondent Rush & Tompkins took the position that a partnership existed between the appellant company and Layden Construction Ltd., which partnership was evidenced by the agreement between the two on July 22, 1958, Exhibit 4, and that, since such partnership existed, the appellant company was bound as was Layden Construction Ltd. by the provisions of the contract between Rush & Tompkins and Layden Construction Ltd., Exhibit 9, and particularly by para. 12 thereof, which read as follows:\n12. If the Subcontractor shall fail to commence the work or to prosecute the work continuously with sufficient workmen and equipment to insure its completion within the time fixed by the principal contract or to comply with the lawful orders of the Engineer or to perform the work in strict accordance with the provisions of the principal contract, or if for any other cause or reason the Subcontractor shall fail to carry on the work in a manner acceptable to the Engineer or the Contractor, the Contractor may give notice to the Subcontractor requiring it to remedy such defects, orders, defaults or delays and if such orders are not complied with or should such defaults or delays continue for Seventy-two hours after such notice shall have been given or should the Subcontractor make default in completion of the works or should the Subcontractor become insolvent or abandon the work or make an assignment of this contract without the consent of the Contractor, or otherwise fail to observe and perform any of the provisions of the principal contract or of this contract, then in any of such cases the Contractor without process of law and without any further authorization may take all of the work out of the hands of the Subcontractor and may employ such means as the Contractor may see fit to complete the works and in such case the Subcontractor shall have no claim for any further payment in respect of work performed and shall be chargeable with and shall remain liable for all loss and damage which may be suffered by the Contractor by reason of such non-compliance, default, delays or non-completion : PROVIDED that should the expense incurred by the Contractor in taking over and completing the work be less than the sum that would have become payable under this agreement if said work had been completed by the Subcontractor, then the Subcontractor shall be entitled to the difference, and should such expense exceed the said sum, then the Subcontractor shall be liable to and shall pay the Contractor the amount of such excess. In the event of the Contractor taking over the work as aforesaid, all machinery, tools, plant, equipment or other property of the Subcontractor on the work may be used by the Contractor for the purpose of completing the work without charge. Upon the taking over of the work by the Contractor as herein provided, no further payment will be made to the Subcontractor until the work is completed, and any monies due or that may become due to the Subcontractor under this agreement will be withheld and may be applied by the Contractor to payments for labour, materials, supplies and equipment used in the prosecution of the work by the Contractor, or to the payment of any excess cost to the Contractor of completing the work.\nUpon the appellant company insisting that it must be paid the equipment rentals or that it would remove its equipment, the respondent company applied for and on October 13, 1959, obtained an injunction preventing the appellant company so doing. That injunction contained the usual provision reading:\nand the Plaintiff, by its Counsel, undertaking to abide by any order which this Court may make as to damages in case this Court shall hereafter be of opinion that the defendant shall have sustained any by reason of this order which the Plaintiff ought to pay.\nThe defendant moved to vacate that injunction order and such application was refused by the order of the Court on November 6, 1959.\nMuch argument before this Court was directed to whether in these circumstances a partnership existed between Layden Construction Ltd. and the appellant company and if so, whether the appellant company was bound by the provisions of s. 12 of the agreement between the respondent and Layden Construction Ltd. which I have set out above. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that such partnership did not exist and in carefully considered reasons based his finding upon the circumstances to which I have referred briefly aforesaid, although he did take into consideration the agreement between Layden Construction Ltd. and the appellant company, Exhibit 4.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge relied very strongly upon the terms of that agreement, Exhibit 4, and were of the opinion that the presumption of partnership which it evidenced was not in any way rebutted by the circumstances upon which the learned trial judge had relied.\nI am of the opinion that it is not necessary to determine whether or not the appellant company and Layden Construction Ltd. were partners. Even if one presumes that the relationship of these two companies was a partnership, it is abundantly clear that the respondent elected to deal with Layden Construction Ltd. alone. It is to be remembered that the respondent company had in its possession, when it drafted the agreements between it and Layden Construction Ltd.\u2014both the early informal agreement, Exhibit 12, and the later formal agreement, Exhibit 9\u2014a copy of Exhibit 4, yet it chose to make both the informal and later the formal agreements with Layden Construction Ltd. alone. As I have recited above, Mr. Ford earlier instructed Mr. James Layden to make what arrangements he deemed fit with the appellant company. It is not necessary to recite the many occasions in his testimony in which Mr. Ford reiterated his position that he was dealing with Layden Construction Ltd. and James Layden alone, and every piece of evidence is consistent with that position and inconsistent with any other. It was argued before us that the respondent company was not required to make an election as to what remedies it would pursue until the appellant company threatened to remove its equipment from the site. At that time, it was submitted, in a further consideration of the contract between the appellant company and Layden Construction Ltd., Exhibit 4, it came to the view that such agreement created a partnership and it could then elect to hold the partner, the appellant company, bound by the provisions of the contract between it, the respondent, and Layden Construction Ltd., i.e., Exhibit 9. I cannot accept this argument. I am of the opinion that the date on which the respondent company came to the conclusion that the appellant company and Layden Construction Ltd. were partners is quite irrelevant. The respondent company knew throughout that the other two were in some sort of business relationship. It had, in fact, caused that relationship to be created and it had knowledge of the details of that relationship and yet the respondent company carefully chose to enter into contractual arrangements with Layden Construction Ltd. alone.\nI am of the opinion that British Homes Assurance Corporation, Ltd. v. Paterson[3] is sound authority for the proposition that having so elected the respondent company now cannot attempt to hold the appellant company liable and require it to perform the contract of Layden Construction Ltd. even if it were a partner of Layden Construction Ltd. There, Farwell J., at p. 408, quoted Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[4] :\nWhere a man has an option to choose one or other of two inconsistent things, when once he has made his election it cannot be retracted, it is final and cannot be altered.\nLindley on Partnership, 11th ed., accepts the authority of this decision at p. 183 where, after quoting s. 5 of the Partnership Act of 1890, which is a counterpart of s. 7 of the Alberta Partnership Act, the learned author states:\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that this section imposes no liability on a firm for acts done by a partner, who is acting and is dealt with as acting, on his own behalf, and not on behalf of the firm.\ngiving the British Homes Assurance case as the authority for that proposition.\nAnd at p. 248, the learned author states:\nThe general proposition that a partnership is bound by those acts of its agents which are within the scope of their authority, in the sense explained in the foregoing pages, must be taken with the qualification that the agent whose acts are sought to be imputed to the firm was acting in his character of agent, and not as a principal.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nThe learned trial judge accepted the authority of this decision and quoted therefrom as I have.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Johnson J. A., giving the judgment for the Court, outlined the reliance of the present appellant upon the decision and then continued:\nIn entering into the contract the Layden company was acting as agent for itself and the respondent and Calder v. Dobell, (1871), L.R. 6 C.P. 486, would be applicable. And then quoted Kelly C. B. at p. 499, noting that the passage was approved in Basma v. Weekes et al.[5]\nThose two decisions and the others which are discussed in the judgments deal with cases where a partner or agent was acting as such for either a disclosed or non-disclosed principal and with the subsequent suit by the opposite party against such principal.\nIn the present case, the learned trial judge concluded, and for the reasons which I have outlined I agree with his conclusion, that Layden Construction Ltd. was dealing with the appellant company as principal and was doing so at the insistance of the respondent company through the agency of its general manager Ford. Therefore, with respect, the cases cited by Johnson J. A. are not applicable and British Homes Assurance is exactly applicable.\nFor these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the respondent company was not entitled to enforce the provisions of s. 12 of the agreement between itself and the Layden Construction company, Exhibit 9, as against the appellant company, and prevent the appellant company from removing its equipment either in April 1959, when Layden Construction Ltd. abandoned the contract, or later, when the respondent company failed to pay the equipment rental. Having come to that conclusion, therefore, I turn to the counterclaim of the appellant company for the arrears of equipment rental which it alleges is owed to it by the respondent company. The learned trial judge gave effect to this counterclaim acting on the basis which he termed an implied contract.\nJohnson J.A., giving judgment for the Court in the Appellate Division, took the view that Murphy, as the agent for the respondent company in his conversations with Mr. Luther Vieweger, \"went no further than to assume the obligations which the partnership by the agreement of July 22nd assumed to the respondent\".\nI have concluded that no partnership assumed such obligations; Layden Construction alone did so. It is to be remembered that this was certainly the view of Mr. Luther Vieweger at the time of his conversation with Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Ford for the respondent company has admitted that it never took the position that it could bind the appellant company as a partner of Layden Construction Ltd. until months after when it ceased paying the equipment rental.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the transaction between the appellant company and the respondent company, the former represented by Mr. Luther Vieweger and the latter by Mr. Murphy, was simply a contract for the payment of equipment rental at scheduled rates, the schedule being that set out in Exhibit 4, the agreement between the appellant company and Layden Construction Ltd. I cannot appreciate the argument of counsel that what Mr. Vieweger was doing then was agreeing to continue the agreement between the Layden company and the respondent company, Exhibit 9, and be paid the schedule of rentals only from possible profits. It is agreed that at that time the contract was $300,000 in deficit, and I do not see how it can be imagined that Mr. Vieweger would agree to have his equipment worked with such a faint hope of reward, when he did not then and for months later know that the respondent company was taking the position that they were entitled to hold the equipment on the site and he has never yet, let alone in April 1959, agreed to that contention. An attempt was made to interpret the agreement between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Vieweger as being to pay rentals in accordance with Exhibit 4. That is not Mr. Vieweger's evidence of what occurred. He swore that Mr. Murphy said:\nMr. Vieweger, we will pay you for them, we will maintain them and keep them in order, and we will pay you rentals as scheduled.\nAnd in cross-examination, he was asked these questions:\nQ. Now, I say to you that your arrangement, if you ever had one with Murphy, was that you were to get the rentals on the same terms as you were entitled to under your agreement with Layden? A. My understanding with Murphy, as I have told you, it was that we would be paid at that rate, on the 15th of the month following, basis. Q. Did you understand that Rush & Tompkins was stepping in, and was going to do the best he could to see that you were paid rentals, if the project made money? A. Nobody ever told me that, no.\nMr. Murphy did not give evidence for the respondent company.\nCounsel for the respondent company submitted that practically all subcontracts bear a clause similar to cl. 12 of Exhibit 9 and that Mr. Vieweger would know the existence of such a clause and would expect that Rush & Tompkins would keep his equipment on the site and use it for the completion of the contract. On the other hand, Mr. Vieweger knew that he had made no such agreement and he could be under no such impression. The agreement made between Mr. Vieweger and Mr. Murphy was, in my opinion, confirmed by the letter which the respondent company wrote to the appellant company on July 8, 1959, which I have recited above. I have no difficulty in finding consideration for this contract. By virtue of it the machines were left on the site and were used for months by the respondent company, and the learned trial judge has found that there were payments made on account of the equipment rentals, although no invoices were rendered by the appellant company. The amount of the equipment rental in arrears has been agreed at by counsel at the sum of $42,769.64 and the judgment at trial in favour of the appellant on its counterclaim should be restored to such an extent.\nI turn now to the appellant company's claim for damages flowing from the interim injunction granted on October 13, 1959, and continued on the motion to vacate. The learned trial judge in refusing the appellant company's claim for such damages adopted the principle stated by Hyndman J. in McBratney et al. v. Sexsmith [6], at p. 459, as follows:\nThe law is well settled that it does not follow that because an interlocutory injunction is dissolved before or after trial the successful defendant is therefore or in any event entitled to damages. The test is whether the plaintiff, by the suppression of facts, or misrepresentation, or maliciously, improperly obtains the injunction. It would appear that the proper test was laid down by the Court of Appeal in Griffith v. Blake[7]. There, the Court of Appeal was concerned with a dictum of the late Master of the Rolls in Smith v. Day[8], to the effect that the undertaking as to damages only applies where the plaintiff has acted improperly in obtaining the injunction, and all the members of the Court expressed dissent with that view. Baggallay L.J. said, at p. 476:\nIf the Defendants turn out to be right, it appears to me that they can, under the undertaking, obtain compensation for all injury sustained by them from the granting of the injunction.\nAnd Cotton, L.J., said at p. 477:\nBut I am of opinion that his dictum is not well founded, and that the rule is, that whenever the undertaking is given, and the plaintiff ultimately fails on the merits, an inquiry as to damages will be granted unless there are special circumstances to the contrary.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nCounsel for the respondent company before this Court agreed to such statement of the principle, but submitted that in this case there were special circumstances as it had not been shown that the respondent company obtained the injunction by any perjury or misrepresentation and that since two judges in the Trial Division and three judges in the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the respondent company was entitled to its injunction, if this Court were of the other view it would be an example of judicial error and not any misrepresentation by the respondent company which caused the injunction to issue.\nI am of the opinion that these circumstances do not constitute such \"special circumstances\" as were in the mind of Cotton L.J. There are examples of plaintiffs who are public bodies and who acted in the public interest to hold the situation in statu quo until the rights were determined. There are other cases where the defendant, although he succeeded upon technical grounds, certainly had been guilty of conduct which did not move the Court to exercise its discretion in his favour. In these cases, the Court has found the \"special circumstances\" which entitled it to refuse a reference as to damages. Here, the respondent company throughout has insisted that very considerable items of heavy construction machinery be held so the defendant could not use them and therefore make any profit from them, and that situation continued for months until the respondent company's use for the equipment ended. I am of the opinion that it is an ordinary case of an injunction granted upon a plaintiff's application and upon the plaintiff's undertaking, and that the plaintiff should be required to make good its undertaking. I would, therefore, direct that there be a reference in the ordinary course of procedure in the Province of Alberta to determine such damages and that the appellant company be granted judgment for such damages and the costs of the reference.\nIt is said that the damages can now be ascertained at the sum of $30,500. Counsel for the respondent, however, submits that there has been no proper proof of damages in that amount and, reading the record, I am of the opinion that under the circumstances in this case this Court would not be entitled to make a specific award of damages upon the evidence set out therein.\nIn the result, I would allow the appeal, restore the judgment in favour of the appellant company upon the counterclaim for $42,769.64, direct a reference as aforesaid, and allow the appellants its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed, judgment of the Appellate Division set aside and judgment at trial varied, with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Becker, Weeks, Peterson, Clark, McLennan and Fraser, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan and Macdonnell, Edmonton.\n[1] (1964), 45 D.L.R.

The furnaces were exempt from sales tax as \"building materials\". When a manufacturer of furnaces ordered humidifiers, he quoted his licence number and gave a certificate as prescribed by the regulations. The appellant reported the sales as not taxable. This practice was accepted by the Revenue Department until July 1958, when the Crown took the view that the humidifier was not part of the furnace, and, later, that it was wrong to act on the certificates in the circumstances of this case. The Crown's claim to recover sales tax from the period of August 1, 1956, to December 31, 1958, was upheld by the Exchequer Court. The judgment was appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe humidifier was part of the tax-exempt furnace supplied by the furnace manufacturer. It was not part of the duct work as was contended by the Crown. The manufacturer of humidifiers was entitled to rely on the certificate of the furnace manufacturer. The regulations provided that in those odd cases where the humidifier was not in fact used in the furnace, it was the purchaser of the humidifier who became responsible for the sales tax. These regulations did not require the manufacturer of humidifier to enter into contractual relations as to the use to which the manufacturer of furnaces could put the goods and to conduct an investigation for the purpose of ensuring that the goods were in fact put to that use.\nIt was not necessary to deal with the claim for exemption under s. 30(2) of the Excise Tax Act for \"partly manufactured goods\", nor as to whether the Crown was estopped as a result of its representations and conduct during that preceding period.\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014Exemptions\u2014Humidificateurs employ\u00e9s dans la fabrication de fournaises non sujettes \u00e0 la taxe\u2014Certificats d'exemption\u2014Exempts comme mat\u00e9riaux de construction ou marchandise partiellement fabriqu\u00e9e\u2014Fin de non-recevoir contre la Couronne\u2014Loi sur la taxe d'accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, arts. 29(1)(d), 30(1)(a), 30(2), 32(1), 44(4), et R\u00e8glements. L'appelant fabriquait des humidificateurs et les vendait \u00e0 des fabricants de fournaises qui les fournissaient avec les fournaises. Comme \u00ab mat\u00e9riaux de construction \u00bb les fournaises n'\u00e9taient pas sujettes \u00e0 la taxe. Lorsqu'un fabricant de fournaises commandait un humidificateur, il citait le num\u00e9ro de sa licence et produisait un certificat tel que prescrit par les r\u00e8glements. L'appelant rapportait cette vente comme n'\u00e9tant pas sujette \u00e0 la taxe. Cette mani\u00e8re d'agir fut accept\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re du Revenu jusqu'en juillet 1958, alors que la Couronne prit la position que ces humidificateurs ne faisaient pas partie de la fournaise, et, plus tard, que dans les circonstances I'appelant avait eu tort d'agir sur la foi de ces certificats. La r\u00e9clamation de la Couronne pour le recouvrement de la taxe de vente entre le premier ao\u00fbt 1956 et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1958 fut maintenue par la Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nL'humidificateur fait partie de la fournaise, non sujette \u00e0 la taxe, fournie par le fabricant de fournaises.

Les r\u00e8glements stipulent que dans les quelques cas o\u00f9 I'humidificateur n'\u00e9tait pas en fait incorpor\u00e9 dans la fournaise, c'est I'acheteur de I'humidificateur qui devenait responsable de la taxe de vente. La fabricant de I'humidificateur n'est pas requis par les r\u00e8glements d'entrer en relations contractuelles avec le fabricant de fournaises concernant I'usage que ce dernier pourrait faire de ces articles et de faire enqu\u00eate dans le but de s'assurer que ces articles \u00e9taient en fait utilis\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re.\nIl n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de traiter de I'exemption sous I'article 30(2) de la Loi sur la taxe d'accise concernant les \u00ab marchandises partiellement fabriqu\u00e9es \u00bb, non plus de la question de savoir s'il y avait fin de non-recevoir contre la Couronne \u00e0 la suite de ses repr\u00e9sentations et de sa conduite durant la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la r\u00e9clamation.\nAPPEL d'un jugement du juge Thurlow de la Cour de I'\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], maintenant la r\u00e9clamation pour taxe de vente. Appel maintenu.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], maintaining the Crown's claim for sales tax. Appeal allowed.\nP. B. C. Pepper, Q.C., and William R. Herridge, for the appellant.\nC. R. O. Munroe, Q.C., and R. A. Wedge, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is a claim by the Crown for sales tax on humidifiers sold by the manufacturer, Skuttle Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd., to a number of manufacturers of furnaces. The claim was allowed at $42,292.51, together with interest and penalties of $20,168.55. The period covered is from August 1, 1956 to December 31, 1958. During this period Skuttle carried on its business as it had done since 1945 without collecting sales tax. Its books had been audited by the Revenue Department from time to time and no question was raised against the propriety of this course until July of 1958, when the Crown decided that there was no exemption. Skuttle had hitherto reported all the sales of humidifiers to furnace manufacturers as tax free.\nThe company's claim for exemption is under s. 32(1) and Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act. This section reads:\n32. (1) The tax imposed by section 30 does not apply to the sale or importation of the articles mentioned in Schedule III.\nSchedule III is a long classified list. Furnaces are included in the list under the heading of certain building materials. Also included in this list are:\nArticles and materials to be used exclusively in the manufacture or production of the foregoing building materials.\nThe evidence was that when a customer bought a furnace from a furnace manufacturer, the humidifier was supplied with the furnace as a matter of course and was included in the price, just as were other accessories such as pressure regulators, thermostats and other controls. When a manufacturer of furnaces ordered humidifiers, he quoted his licence number and gave a certificate as prescribed by the Regulations in the following form:\nI\/We certify that the goods ordered\/imported hereby are to be used in, wrought into, or attached to taxable goods for sale.\nLicence Number\nName of Purchaser)\nBefore 1945 furnaces were subject to sales tax. After 1945 furnaces and articles and materials to be used exclusively in the manufacture or production of furnaces were exempted from sales tax by inclusion in Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act, 1945 (Can.), c. 30, s. 8. After 1945, this manufacturer of humidifiers continued as before to accept the above quoted certificate. I think that it was authorized to do this under the Regulations, the particular one reading as follows:\n(b) A licensed manufacturer shall not quote his licence number nor give the certificate as above when purchasing or importing goods to be used in, wrought into, or attached to articles specified as exempt from the Consumption or Sales Tax. (Note.\u2014Except in respect of goods conditionally exempted according to use.)\nThese humidifiers were, in my opinion and evidently in the opinion of the Department until July of 1958, goods conditionally exempted according to use. In July of 1958, when the Department first raised the question, its only ground for saying that the humidifiers were not exempt from sales tax was that they were not part of the furnace but part of the duct work. This, I think, it is impossible to accept. These humidifiers had to be placed in the furnace close to the heating distributor if they were to function at all. Sometimes the humidifier was placed in that part of the furnace which is called the \"plenum\", which is the air pressure mixing chamber and serves as a lid for the furnace. Some furnaces were sold with the plenum already made. Some were sold while still requiring adaption to connect them with the duct system. But however sold, both the plenum and humidifier were part of the furnace.\nIn the Courts the Department extended its claims. In addition to the claim that the humidifier was part of the duct work, the Department said that it was wrong to act on the certificate in the circumstances of this case. Notwithstanding the fact that the furnace manufacturer certified, in accordance with the regulations, that the goods were to be used, wrought into or attached to taxable goods for sale, a few of these humidifiers might have been used in space heaters or sold as replacement parts for existing furnaces, and in both these cases there was no exemption. The evidence is that very few of the humidifiers would be so disposed of.\nThis led the Exchequer Court[3] to say that the certificates offered no protection and that in the absence of any contractual arrangements that the humidifiers were to be used exclusively in the manufacture or production of furnaces, the sales tax had to be paid. The manufacturer of humidifiers was not entitled to rely on the furnace manufacturer's certificate and the burden was imposed on the humidifier manufacturer of seeing to it both by contractual arrangements and by subsequent investigation that its products were used exclusively in the manufacture of furnaces. The difficulty or even impossibility of operating under these conditions is apparent. In so deciding, I think that the Exchequer Court was in error. The manufacturer of humidifiers is entitled to rely on the certificate of the furnace manufacturer. The Regulations provide that in those odd cases where the humidifier is not in fact used in the furnace, it is the purchaser of the humidifier who becomes responsible for the sales tax. This follows from those sections in the Regulations dealing with Certificates of Exemption, which are numbers (b), (l) and (m) and which read:\n(b) A licensed manufacturer shall not quote his licence number nor give the certificate as above when purchasing or importing goods to be used in, wrought into, or attached to articles specified as exempt from the Consumption or Sales Tax. (NOTE.\u2014Except in respect of goods conditionally exempted according to use.)\n(l) Where a purchaser quotes a licence number only on his order for goods, the vendor is responsible for Sales Tax on the sale.\nWhere a purchaser erroneously quotes both licence number and certificate on his order, the purchaser is liable for the tax, except in such cases where it is obvious to the vendor that the quotation was made in error.\n(m) A licensed manufacturer or producer, who also operates a retail branch or branches, shall not use his licence when purchasing or importing merchandise for such retail businesses.\nThese do not require the manufacturer of humidifiers to enter into contractual relations as to the use to which the manufacturer of furnaces can put the goods and to conduct an investigation for the purpose of ensuring that the goods are in fact put to that use.\nIt is unnecessary to deal with the claim for exemption under s. 30, subs. (2), of the Excise Tax Act, which exempts goods sold by a licensed manufacturer to another licensed manufacturer \"if the goods are partly manufactured goods.\" I note that the Minister by s. 29(1) (d) is made the sole judge whether or not goods are \"partly manufactured goods.\" Nor do I express any opinion on the argument that the Crown is estopped from collecting for the period in question as a result of its representations and conduct during the preceding period. It is, however, clear that everything that the Department did in the preceding period led this manufacturer to assume that its course of conduct was in accordance with the departmental interpretation of the Statute and Regulations. Nothing happened during the period August 1,1956 to December 31,1958, except a change of opinion on the part of the enforcement officers in July of 1958, on the meaning and effect of the Statute and Regulations. I think that they were wrong in the second meaning which they attached to them.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and dismiss the Crown's Information with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

After they had both been convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code, within the meaning of s. 19(1) (e) (ii) of the Immigration Act, they were ordered to be deported by a special inquiry officer whose order was upheld by the Immigration Appeal Board. Then each brother was informed by letter that his deportation order was deferred, in the case of R for a period of twelve months and in the case of G for a period of six months, provided no unfavourable report was received during that period, at the end of which a further study of their cases was to be made. Some three years later in the case of R and eighteen months in the case of G, they were arrested and detained pursuant to a warrant of arrest signed by the Minister, and both were informed by letter that their cases had been reviewed and that the deportation orders were to be implemented. Neither had had any notice of the time or place of this review. The issuance of a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid was refused by the trial judge. This judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched in this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: Following the expiration of the stipulated periods of probation, the Minister could not thereafter hold the deportation orders in suspense and require their enforcement at any time he chose, at his own discretion. Having exercised his power of review, as he chose to do, under s. 31(4) of the Act, his decision to grant a probationary period was, by the terms of that subsection, final. After the expiration of the probationary periods, the Minister did not have power to make a further review and to decide to extend the probationary period for an additional time. In the absence of any event occurring during the probationary period which would have justified his so doing, the Minister did not thereafter have the statutory authority to enforce the deportation orders. The position was the same as if he had allowed the appeals from the decisions of the Immigration Appeal Board.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: What the Minister did was to confirm the deportation orders but defer their execution. The Minister alone had power to do so under s. 31(4). Had the brothers been able to satisfy the Minister that they should be allowed to remain, he could then have exercised the discretionary power conferred upon him by s. 31(4) and have quashed the orders. The Minister is the only person authorized to quash such an order. The Courts have no power to do so. The exercise of that power requires positive action on the part of the Minister and is not to be inferred from circumstances such as a delay in the execution. Even if such a delay were relevant to the continuing validity of the orders, which it was not, deferment in this case was not unreasonable. The fact that the Minister signed the warrants of arrest was evidence that he had no intention of quashing the deportation orders.\nImmigration\u2014Expulsion\u2014Habeas corpus\u2014Ordonnance d'expulsion suspendue pour une p\u00e9riode sp\u00e9cifique sous surveillance\u2014Revision sans avis\u2014Tentative de donner suite \u00e0 l'ordonnance longtemps apr\u00e8s l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode sous surveillance\u2014Autorit\u00e9 de mettre en vigueur l'ordonnance\u2014Loi sur l'immigration, S.R.C. 1952, c. 325, arts. 8, 15(1), 17, 19(e), 26, 31(4), 33\u2014Loi sur la d\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, 1960 (Can.), c. 44.\nLes deux fr\u00e8res de l'appelant, R et G, furent admis au Canada comme immigrants. Apr\u00e8s qu'ils furent tous deux trouv\u00e9s coupables d'une infraction sous le Code criminel, selon les pr\u00e9visions de l'art. 19(1) (e) (ii) de la Loi sur l'immigration, une ordonnance d'expulsion fut \u00e9mise par un enqu\u00eateur sp\u00e9cial. Cette ordonnance fut maintenue par la Commission d'Appel. Chacun des fr\u00e8res fut inform\u00e9 par lettre que son ordonnance d'expulsion \u00e9tait retard\u00e9e, dans le cas de R pour une p\u00e9riode de douze mois et dans le cas de G pour une p\u00e9riode de six mois, \u00e0 condition qu'aucun rapport d\u00e9favorable ne soit re\u00e7u durant cette p\u00e9riode, \u00e0 la fin de laquelle une autre \u00e9tude de leur cas serait faite. Quelques trois ans plus tard dans le cas de R et dix-huit mois dans le cas de G, ils furent tous deux arr\u00eat\u00e9s et d\u00e9tenus en vertu d'un mandat d'arrestation sign\u00e9 par le ministre, et tous deux furent inform\u00e9s par lettre que leur cas avait \u00e9t\u00e9 revis\u00e9 et que les ordonnances de d\u00e9portation devaient \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es. Ils n'avaient re\u00e7u aucun avis du temps et de la place de cette revision. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a refus\u00e9 d'\u00e9mettre le bref d'habeas corpus. Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi devant cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: A l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode sous surveillance sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e, le ministre ne pouvait pas maintenir l'ordonnance d'expulsion en suspens et exiger leur expulsion \u00e0 n'importe quel temps de son choix, de sa propre discr\u00e9tion. Ayant exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir de revision, comme il l'a fait, sous l'art. 31(4) de la loi, sa d\u00e9cision d'accorder une p\u00e9riode sous surveillance \u00e9tait finale de par les termes de cet article. Apr\u00e8s l'expiration de la p\u00e9riode sous surveillance, le ministre n'avait pas le pouvoir de faire une autre revision et de d\u00e9cider d'\u00e9tendre pour un temps additionnel cette p\u00e9riode sous surveillance. En l'absence de tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement survenant durant cette p\u00e9riode qui l'aurait justifi\u00e9 de le faire, le ministre n'avait pas alors l'autorit\u00e9 statutaire de mettre en vigueur les ordonnances d'expulsion. La situation \u00e9tait la m\u00eame que s'il avait maintenu les appels de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'Appel.\nLe Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson, dissidents: Le ministre approuva les ordonnances de d\u00e9portation mais d\u00e9cida d'en retarder leur ex\u00e9cution. Seul le ministre avait ce pouvoir sous l'art. 31(4). Si les deux fr\u00e8res avaient pu satisfaire le ministre qu'on devait leur permettre de demeurer, il pouvait alors exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'art. 31(4) et annuler les ordonnances. Seul le ministre a l'autorit\u00e9 pour annuler une telle ordonnance. Les Cours n'ont pas ce pouvoir.

Appeal allowed, Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nA. H. J. Zaitlin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nC. A. Geoffrion, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts and the relevant provisions of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, are set out in the reasons of my brother Martland which I have had the advantage of perusing. I agree with him that the letters written by officers of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration which he has quoted, should be accepted as evidence that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration had seen fit to exercise the power of review given to him under subs. 4 of s. 31 of the Act. I regret however that I am obliged to differ as to the legal effect of that review. The only persons entitled to enter Canada and to remain here as of right, are Canadian citizens and persons having a Canadian domicile. All others desiring to do so must comply with the requirements of the Immigration Act and the regulations made thereunder.\nRocco Violi and his twin brother Giuseppe were admitted to Canada as immigrants, on December 28, 1958, and thereafter under s. 4 of the Act, could acquire a Canadian domicile by having their place of domicile for at least five years in Canada after landing. During that period they were, in effect, here on probation and liable to deportation in the circumstances set out in s. 19 of the Act. Among other grounds deportation may be ordered if a landed immigrant has been convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code. Each of the brothers was convicted of such an offence.\nUnder the Act, residence in Canada after the making of a deportation order and prior to its execution is not to be counted towards the acquisition of Canadian domicile by a person against whom such order has been made.\nThe validity of the deportation orders made against the Violi brothers is not challenged. In my view, what the Minister did was to confirm the two deportation orders but defer their execution to enable each of the two brothers, as stated in one of the letters, \"to demonstrate that you can rehabilitate yourself\". There is no express power given under the Act to grant such a deferment but in my view the Minister\u2014and the Minister alone\u2014had power to do so under s. 31(4). Such deferment was certainly not adverse to the interests of the two brothers. Had they been able to satisfy the Minister that they should be allowed to remain in Canada, he could then have exercised the discretionary power conferred upon him in s. 31(4) and have quashed the deportation orders. In the final analysis the Minister is the only person authorized under the Act to quash such an order. The courts have no power to do so.\nIn my view the exercise of that power by the Minister requires positive action on his part and is not to be inferred from circumstances such as delay in the execution of the deportation order.\nExecution of the deportation order against Rocco Violi was deferred for some three years and that against Giuseppe for some eighteen months. Even if such a delay were relevant to the continuing validity of the orders (which in my opinion it was not) deferment for such periods was not in my view unreasonable in the circumstances.\nThat the Minister himself had no intention of quashing the deportation orders is evidenced by the fact that he signed the warrants under s. 15(1) of the Act for the arrest of the two brothers.\nFor these reasons as well as for those of Rivard J. in the Court below, with which I am in substantial agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec[2], which, by a majority of three to two, dismissed the appellant's appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal, which had dismissed the appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus and for a writ of certiorari in aid. The facts involved in the appeal are not in issue.\nRocco Violi and Giuseppe Violi, both brothers of the appellant, were admitted to Canada as immigrants on December 28, 1958. On July 20, 1960, Rocco Violi was found guilty of causing bodily harm with a knife, contrary to s. 216A of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. On December 22, 1961, Giuseppe Violi was convicted for failure to stop his motor vehicle at the scene of an accident, contrary to s. 221(2) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a fine and costs, which he paid.\nFollowing each of these convictions an inquiry was held by a Special Inquiry Officer, pursuant to s. 19(2) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325 (which statute is hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\"). In each case an order for deportation was issued, pursuant to s. 28(3) of the Act. The one relating to Rocco Violi was made on February 1, 1961, and the one relating to Giuseppe Violi was made on October 16, 1962. In each case an appeal was taken to an Immigration Appeal Board, in accordance with s. 31 of the Act, and in each case the appeal was dismissed. The decisions were delivered in the case of Rocco Violi on February 20, 1961, and in the case of Giuseppe Violi on November 19, 1962. Before continuing with the recital of the facts, it would be desirable, at this point, to quote s. 31 of the Act, as the subsequent events have to be considered in the light of this section and, in particular, subs. (4).\n31. (1) Except in the case of a deportation order referred to in subsection (5) of section 7, subsection (4) of section 8 or section 30, an appeal may be taken by the person concerned from a deportation order if the appellant forthwith serves a notice of appeal upon an immigration officer or upon the person who served the deportation order.\n(2) All appeals from deportation orders shall be reviewed and decided upon by the Minister with the exception of appeals that the Minister directs should be dealt with by an Immigration Appeal Board.\n(3) An Immigration Appeal Board or the Minister, as the case may be, has full power to consider all matters pertaining to a case under appeal and to allow or dismiss any appeal, including the power to quash an opinion of a Special Inquiry Officer that has the effect of bringing a person into a prohibited class and to substitute the opinion of the Board or of the Minister for it.\n(4) The Minister may in any case review the decision of an Immigration Appeal Board and confirm or quash such decision or substitute his decision, therefor as he deems just and proper and may, for these purposes, direct that the execution of the deportation order concerned be stayed pending his review and decision, and the decision of the Minister on appeals dealt with or reviewed by him or the decision of the majority of an Immigration Appeal Board on appeals, other than those reviewed by the Minister, is final.\nIn the case of Rocco Violi, following the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board, he received a letter, dated February 24, 1961, as follows:\nOTTAWA, February 24, 1961.\nMr. Rocco Violi,\nc\/o Governor, Montreal Gaol,\n800 Gouin Boulevard West,\nMONTREAL, Quebec.\nDear Sir:\nIn his letter of February 24, 1961, the Appeal Clerk, General Board of Immigration Appeals, informed you that your appeal against the order of deportation made at Montreal, Quebec, on February 1, 1961, had been carefully considered and dismissed.\nThis letter is to inform you that it has been decided to defer deportation proceedings for a period of 12 months to give you a chance to demonstrate that you can rehabilitate yourself.\nThe local Immigration office will be required to submit a report on your circumstances in one year and I would therefore ask you to keep them informed of your address. I would also like to advise you that any unfavourable reports could mean the carrying out of the deportation order.\nYours very truly,\nE. P. Beasley,\nChief,\nAdmissions Division. c.c.

For your information and report in 12 months' time.\nIn the case of Giuseppe Violi, following the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board, he received a letter, dated December 10, 1962, as follows:\nOTTAWA 4, December 10, 1962.\nMr. Giuseppe Violi,\n4666 Charleroi,\nMontreal North, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\nOn November 26th, 1962, you were informed by the Appeal Clerk of the Immigration Appeal Board that your appeal, taken from a deportation order made against you at Montreal on October 16, 1962 had been dismissed.\nI have been directed to advise you that the deportation proceedings are being suspended for a period of six months provided no unfavourable report is received during that period. A further study of this case will be made in six months' time.\nI wish to make it quite clear to you that should a further unfavourable report be received, consideration will be given to proceedings immediately with your deportation to Italy.\nA copy of this letter has been sent to your Counsel, Mr. Jean Blain.\nYours very truly,\nC.

Should there be an unfavourable report during this six-month period, an immediate report should be submitted. If there is no unfavourable report, please investigate the present circumstances and submit a report on the same in six months' time, together with your recommendation.\nThis letter was followed by a letter dated May 28, 1963, in the following terms: 305 Dorchester Boulevard West\nMontreal 1, Que.\nED. 3-347\nMay 28, 1963.\nMr. Giuseppe Violi,\n4666 Charleroi Street,\nMontreal North 39, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\nThis is to inform you that your case has been reviewed and it has been decided that it will not be necessary for you to report to this office as you have been doing in the past; however, it will be necessary for you to present yourself at this office on May 15, 1964.\nMeanwhile, it will be necessary for you to inform us of any change of address.\nYours very truly,\nfor District Supervisor of Admissions.\nThere is no evidence of any further action on the part of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, or of any further communication to either of the two brothers until the end of March, 1964. On April 1, 1964, each of them received a letter, in the same form, save as to the date of the deportation order. The one to Rocco Violi is as follows:\nDear Sir:\nI have been directed to inform you that your case has been carefully reviewed and that it has been decided to implement the deportation order rendered against you at Montreal on February 1, 1961.\nYour deportation to Italy will be effected as soon as the necessary arrangements in this regard have been completed.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) Leo R. Vachon.\nLeo R. Vachon,\nRegional Administrator,\nEastern Region.\nIt is admitted that neither Rocco Violi nor Giuseppe Violi had any notice of the time or place of any review of the deportation order affecting him.\nEach of the two letters dated April 1, 1964, was dispatched to the recipient in care of the Governor of Montreal Gaol, where each was detained pursuant to a warrant of arrest, which had been issued by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (hereinafter referred to as \"the Minister\"), dated March 25, 1964, and a letter, from a departmental official to the Governor of the Gaol, dated March 26, 1964, requiring his detention there for deportation.\nThe appellant filed his petition in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal, for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and a writ of certiorari in aid on April 2, 1964.\nFrom the foregoing facts it is clear that each of the two persons involved committed an offence under the Criminal Code, within the meaning of s. 19(1) (e) (ii) of the Act, and thereby became subject to deportation. The relevant portions of s. 19 provide as follows:\n19. (1) Where he has knowledge thereof, the clerk or secretary of a municipality in Canada in which a person hereinafter described resides or may be, an immigration officer or a constable or other peace officer shall send a written report to the Director, with full particulars, concerning.\n(e) any person, other than a Canadian citizen or a person with Canadian domicile, who\n(ii) has been convicted of an offence under the Criminal Code,\n(2) Every person who is found upon an inquiry duly held by a Special Inquiry Officer to be a person described in subsection (1) is subject to deportation.\nIt is also clear that the Special Inquiry Officer properly made deportation orders, pursuant to s. 28 of the Act, and that the appeals from the deportation orders were properly dealt with, pursuant to s. 31, by the Immigration Appeal Boards. None of these matters is questioned by the appellant as to its legal validity.\nAt that stage the Minister had discretion, pursuant to s. 31(4), to review, or to refrain from reviewing, the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board. Had he adopted the latter course, the decision of the Board in each case would have been final. However, he elected in each case to review the decision of the Board and it is necessary to consider what are the consequences of that action on his part.\nCounsel for the respondent urged that the letter of February 24, 1961, to Rocco Violi and the letters of December 10, 1962, and May 28, 1963, written to Giuseppe Violi were written by departmental officials without any statutory authority to do so. I am not prepared to accept that submission. The first-mentioned letter uses the phrase \"it has been decided to defer deportation proceedings\u2026.\" The second letter contains the phrase \"I have been directed to advise you that the deportation proceedings are being suspended\u2026.\" The last-mentioned letter states: \"This is to inform you that your case has been reviewed\u2026. \" I think we are entitled to presume that these were properly authorized communications, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, and the only authority for them is the exercise by the Minister of his power to review the decision of an Immigration Appeal Board under s. 31(4).\nThe power there given is to confirm or quash the Board's decision, neither of which was done, or to \"substitute his decision therefor as he deems just and proper.\" What then is the interpretation to be given to these letters? The respondent argues that they merely hold out the hope that eventually, if the recipient of the letter succeeds in rehabilitating himself in the opinion of the Department, the deportation order against him may be revoked, and that they do not promise a revocation nor promise a decision within any specified delay. The appellant contends that the decision made by the Minister, on his review of an appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board, is final and that he cannot, by such decision, retain power to enforce the deportation orders at any time he should see fit, arbitrarily.\nCounsel for the appellant placed reliance upon s. 33(1) of the Act, which provides: \"Unless otherwise provided in this Act, a deportation order shall be executed as soon as practicable.\"\nHe contended that this is not a case in which the Act otherwise provides and that failure to observe the provision resulted in the lapse of the order.\nCounsel for the respondent relied upon s. 33(2) which provides: \"No deportation order becomes invalid on the ground of any lapse of time between its making and execution.\"\nI am not prepared to agree that the two deportation orders lapsed because of the delay which was stipulated in the letters written to Rocco and Giuseppe Violi. However, subs. (1) does contemplate that if a deportation order is to be enforced there shall not be undue delay. Subsection (2), in my opinion, means that lapse of time per se does not result in a deportation order becoming invalid. In the present case, however, there is more involved than mere lapse of time. The issue here involves the powers of the Minister in respect of the enforcement of deportation orders. The letter of February 24, 1961, to Rocco Violi stipulated a probationary period of 12 months and required a report, at the end of that time, from the District Superintendent. The letter of December 10, 1962, to Giuseppe Violi provided for a probationary period of six months and required a report from the District Superintendent at the end of that time. Both periods expired and no steps were then taken to enforce the deportation orders.\nThe question in issue is whether, following the expiration of those stipulated periods, the Minister can thereafter hold the deportation orders in suspense and require their enforcement at any time he chooses, at his own discretion. I do not think he can. Having exercised his power of review, under s. 31(4), his decision is, by the terms of that subsection, final. This decision was to grant to each of the persons involved a probationary period. The probationary periods expired and no steps was then taken to enforce the orders. The Minister did not, thereafter, have power to make a further review and to decide to extend the probationary period for an additional time. Nothing has been said on behalf of the respondent to establish the existence of any authority given to the Minister to adopt such a course.\nIn my opinion, having made the decision which he did in each case, on his review of the decisions of the Immigration Appeal Boards, in the absence of any event occurring during the probationary period which would have justified his so doing, the Minister did not thereafter have the statutory authority to enforce the deportation orders. The position is the same as if he had allowed the appeals from the decisions of the Immigration Appeal Boards.\nIn my opinion, therefore the appeal should be allowed, the detention of Rocco and Giuseppe Violi should be declared illegal and they should be released from detention forthwith. It should be recommended that the Minister should pay the appellant's costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs, TASCHEREAU C.J. and ABBOTT and JUDSON J.J. dissenting.\nAttorney for the appellant: A.

Graham, Frederick Nobel Graham, Adrian Dobbie and Hyatt Dobbie (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nLoreen Myers, Ronald Harmer, Dale Dvorachek, Donald Alexander Campbell and Crown Trust Company, Executors and Trustees under the Last Will and Testament of Lenna May Harmer, deceased (Defendants) Respondents.\n1964: June 15; 1964: October 6.\nPresent: Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWills\u2014Construction\u2014Gift to testatrix\u2019s husband if he survives\u2014Provision for alternative disposition and will to take effect as if husband had predeceased testatrix in event of their deaths being simultaneous\u2014Whether expression of intention that in either of the two situations, contemporaneous death or death of testatrix following that of husband, disposition of property to be the same.\nThe testatrix was a spinster until 1947 when at the age of 64 she married a widower who was then 75. Her husband had living at that time one child and four grandchildren. On September 10, 1959, the testatrix and her husband made wills which were in the same terms mutatis mutandis. The testatrix\u2019s husband died on May 4, 1962, and the testatrix died on July 3, 1962. Paragraph III of the testatrix\u2019s will read in part: \u201cIf my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other, I declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and I GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH all my said property to my Trustees upon the following trusts, namely: x x x (3) To divide the residue of my estate into as many equal parts as there are grandchildren of mine then alive, and to pay to each grandchild one of such equal parts.\u201d\nThe legatees in accordance with para. III (3) claimed the whole balance of the estate and their claim was opposed by the heirs-at-law of the testatrix. A motion was made for construction of the will; the trial judge was of the opinion that there was an obvious omission in para. III and that the testatrix intended to provide not only for the contingency of simultaneous death but also for the contingency of her husband predeceasing her. He held that in the circumstances it was the right and the duty of the Court to supply the omission and proceeded to do so by giving an affirmative answer to the question: Having regard for the provisions of the will as a whole and the language of para. III, does para. III apply when the testatrix\u2019s husband clearly predeceases her? An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed; the majority held that in the testatrix\u2019s will there was a clear and unequivocal expression of her intention that in either of the two situations, i.e., contemporaneous death or by her death following that of her husband, the disposition of her property was to be the same. A further appeal by the heirs-at-law was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: This was not a case in which the Court was justified in supplying words in the will; it could not be said with certainty that anything had been omitted. In para. III the testatrix made a complete disposition of her property to take effect if her husband and she should die at the same time. By using the words \u201cI declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and\u2026\u201d she had expressed the intention that if her husband predeceased her her estate was to be disposed of as if he had died contemporaneously with her and what was to be done if the latter event should happen was fully set out in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of para. III.\nPer Ritchie J.: The construction urged by the heirs-at-law was based on the assumption that the testatrix intended to die intestate in the event of her husband having predeceased her. The suggestion that she had such an intention failed. When an individual has purported to make final disposition of all his \u201cproperty both real and personal of every nature and kind and wheresoever situate\u201d, he is not to be taken to have intended to leave all his property undisposed of on the happening of certain events, unless there are some very exceptional and compelling reasons for so holding. A construction resulting in an intestacy \u201cis a dernier ressort in the construction of wills.\u201d\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The declaration and dispositions made by para. III were in terms wholly conditioned upon an event which did not happen. Therefore, in order to attain the result which was reached in the Courts below, this Court must insert additional words in the testatrix\u2019s will. To read into this will the words necessary to provide for the unmentioned event the Court must be compelled to the conclusion that the will revealed so strong a probability of such an intention that a contrary intention could not be supposed. No compelling necessity to insert the words allegedly omitted could be found; neither the actual words of the will nor the circumstances of the testatrix and her late husband\u2019s death resulted in any compelling conviction that there was an accidental omission in the will as executed.\nThe words \u201cI declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me\u2026\u201d could not be considered as mere surplusage but even if that were so, the existence of surplusage in a will was no ground for giving the rest of the clause a new and different meaning. These words did not indicate that the testatrix had made a clear and unequivocal expression that in either of the two situations, the disposition of her property was to be the same.\n[Maclean et al. v. Henning (1903), 33 S.C.R. 305, distinguished]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Fraser J. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nS.C. Biggs, Q.C., for the appellants. G.H. Davies, for the respondents: L. Myers, R. Harmer, D. Dvorachek and D.A. Campbell.\nM.J. Tarrison, for the respondent: Crown Trust Company.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the manner in which the case has been dealt with in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence.\nIn my opinion, this is not a case in which the Court is justified in supplying words in the will; I agree with my brother Spence that it cannot be said with certainty that anything has been omitted.\nThe decision of the appeal appears to me to turn on the construction of the opening words of para. III of the will reading as follows:\nIII. If my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other, I declare that my will \u2018 shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and I GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH all my said property to my Trustees upon the following trusts, namely:\nIf this clause did not contain the words:\nI declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me, and\nthis case would be indistinguishable from that of Maclean et al. v. Henning[2]; but, in my opinion, the presence of the last\u2011quoted words is of decisive importance.\nAs a matter of syntax all the words of para. III which follow the opening conditional clause:\nIf my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other\nare dependent upon the prescribed condition and come into operation only if it be fulfilled, in the events that have happened it has not been fulfilled, and consequently, on a literal construction, para. III would be without effect and the estate of the testatrix would pass to those entitled on an intestacy, as was held by Aylesworth J.A. The objection to this view is that it gives no effect to the words:\nI declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and\nIt is argued that even if this literal construction be adopted the words last quoted are not pure surplusage as in the event of uncertainty whether he survived, they would cancel the gift to the husband and revoke his appointment as executor; but if the husband and wife had died in a common disaster the same result would have been reached although the words last quoted had been omitted. In my view, these words serve no purpose if the literal construction is adhered to, although they may have been inserted ex abundanti cautela.\nNot without hesitation, I have reached the conclusion that the last-quoted words shew that it was the intention of the testatrix that if her husband should predecease her the disposition of her estate contained in clauses (I), (2) and (3) of para. III of her will should take effect.\nIn para. III the testatrix has made a complete disposition of her property to take effect if her husband and she should die at the same time. By using the last-quoted words she has said that the disposition made on that condition shall be the same as if her husband had predeceased her. If the disposition of her property to be made if her husband and she die contemporaneously is represented by the symbol \u201cX\u201d, she has said that this shall be the same as the effect of her will if her husband predeceases her; if the last-mentioned effect is represented by the symbol \u201cY\u201d the meaning of the opening words of para. III now under consideration may be represented by the equation \u201cX equals Y\u201d; from which it follows that \u201cY equals X\u201d.\nIf this reasoning be sound, as I think it is, it follows that the meaning of the words used by the testatrix is that if her husband predeceases her her estate shall be disposed of as if he had died contemporaneously with her and what is to be done if the latter event should happen is fully set out in clauses (I), (2) and (3) of para. III. In my opinion this is the intention which the testatrix has expressed by the words which she has used.\nI agree with the reasons of Kelly J.A., who gave the judgment of the majority in the Court of Appeal, subject only to the reservation that, while I have reached a definite conclusion, I do not find the matter as clear as did the learned Justice of Appeal. In my opinion this case falls within the observations as to the disposition of costs made by Lord Birkenhead in Boyce v. Wasbrough[3], at p. 435, which were applied by the majority of this Court in Niles v. Lake[4]. The issue to be decided in the case at bar was difficult and debatable and there has been a difference of judicial opinion in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nI would dismiss the appeal but would direct that the costs of all parties, other than Crown Trust Company, be paid as between party and party out of the estate of the testatrix. I would make no order as to the costs of Crown Trust Company.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The facts giving rise to this appeal are fully set forth in the reasons for judgment which have been filed by Mr. Justice Spence and it will accordingly be unnecessary for me to restate them.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Cartwright, whose decision I have also had the benefit of reading, that, for the reasons stated by him, the words \u201c\u2026I declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and\u2026\u201d as they occur in clause III of the will of the late Lenna May Harmer, are sufficient to distinguish this case from that of Maclean et al. v. Henning[5], and that it is not necessary to delete or supply any words in order to give effect to that clause as a valid disposition of the whole estate of the testatrix in the event of her husband having predeceased her.\nI only wish to add that in my view this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the alternative construction urged upon us on behalf of her heirs-at-law is based on the assumption that the testatrix intended to die intestate in the event of her husband having predeceased her.\nThe inclination of courts to lean against a construction which will result in intestacy is far from being a rule of universal application and is not to be followed if the circumstances of the case and the language of the will are such as to clearly indicate the testator\u2019s intention to leave his property or some part of it undisposed of upon the happening of certain events. It appears to me, however, that when an individual has purported to make final disposition of all his \u201cproperty both real and personal of every nature and kind and wheresoever situate\u201d, he is not to be taken to have intended to leave all that property undisposed of on the happening of certain events, unless there are some very exceptional and compelling reasons for so holding. As was said by Lord Shaw in Lightfoot v. Maybery[6], at p. 802, a construction resulting in an intestacy \u201cis a dernier ressort in the construction of wills\u201d.\nIn the present case the husband and wife made mutual wills and the suggestion is that it was the intention of each of them that in the event of one having predeceased the other, the whole property of the survivor should remain undisposed of. One reason which is relied on in support of the existence of such an intention in the case of the testatrix is that it would be quite rational for her to leave the final disposition of her estate in the event of her surviving her husband to be decided after she had learned who was going to assist her during the balance of her life. It appears to me that the opening words of the will\u2014\u201cTHIS IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of me, Lenna May Harmer\u2026\u201d must of themselves be taken as mitigating strongly against any interpretation which is predicated on the assumption that the testatrix signed that document intending that in the event of her surviving her husband, she might make another will.\nFor the above reasons, as well as for those stated by Mr. Justice Cartwright, I would dismiss this appeal and direct that the costs should be paid in the manner proposed by him.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[7] made on January 3, 1964, in which that Court by a majority dismissed an appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Fraser made on August 9, 1963.\nThe testatrix married Stephen Harmer, a widower, in 1947. She was a spinster and had no children and at the time of her marriage she was 64 years of age. Her husband, a widower, had living at that time one child and four grandchildren. On September 10, 1959, the testatrix and her hus- band made wills which were in the same terms mutatis mutandis. The testatrix was at that time 76 years of age. On June 13, 1961, the testatrix\u2019s husband by a codicil revoked the provisions of para. III(3) of his last will which had been made on September 10, 1959, and provided that the whole of the remainder of his estate should go to his granddaughter Mrs. Loreen Myers. The testatrix\u2019s husband then died on May 4, 1962, and the testatrix died on July 3, 1962, without making any alteration of her will dated September 10, 1959. That will provided in part:\nII. I GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH all my property, both real and personal, of every nature and kind and wheresoever situate, including any property over which I may have a general power of appointment, to my husband, STEPHEN HARMER, for his own use absolutely, if he survives me, and I NOMINATE, CONSTITUTE AND APPOINT my husband and CROWN TRUST COMPANY to be the Executors of this my Will.\nIII. If my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other, I declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and I GIVE, DEVISE and BEQUEATH all my said property to my Trustee upon the following trusts, namely:\n(1) To pay all my just debts, funeral and testamentary expenses as soon as possible after my decease.\n(2) To pay out of the capital of my general estate all estate taxes, inheritance and death taxes and any taxes that may be payable in this or in any other jurisdiction by reason of my decease in connection with any insurance or any gift or benefit given by me to any person hereinafter mentioned, either in my lifetime or by survivorship or by this my will or any codicil thereto, with full power to my Trustees in their sole discretion to settle, compromise, commute or postpone payment of the duty or any part thereof.\n(3) To divide the residue of my estate into as many equal parts as there are grandchildren of mine then alive, and to pay to each grandchild one of such equal parts.\nThe legatees in accordance with para. III(3) claimed the whole balance of the estate and their claim was opposed by the heirs-at-law of the testatrix.\nThe Crown Trust Company, as surviving executor, applied to the Supreme Court of Ontario for advice and directions on the following questions:\n1. Having regard for the provisions of the Will as a whole and the language of paragraph numbered III, does paragraph numbered III apply when the Testatrix\u2019s husband clearly predeceases her?\n2. If the answer to question 1 is affirmative, to whom do the benefits pass under subparagraph numbered (3) of paragraph numbered III if the testatrix had no children of the marriage and consequently no grandchildren or in the alternative\nTo whom the words \u2018grandchildren of mine\u2019 and \u2018grandchild\u2019 refer in subparagraph numbered (3) of paragraph numbered III?\nFraser J. answered the first question in the affirmative and answered the second question by finding that the words \u201cgrandchildren of mine\u201d and \u201cgrandchild\u201d in para. III(3) referred to the grandchildren of the testatrix\u2019s deceased husband.\nIn the Court of Appeal and here, the appeal was argued solely with respect to the answer to the first question. Fraser J., in written reasons, was of the opinion that there was in the will of the testatrix an obvious omission, although he was unable to find the exact words which were, in his opinion, omitted or to say whether those words would have been, by an additional clause inserted before III or by additional words inserted into clause III. Fraser J. held that it was the right and the duty of the Court under the circumstances which existed to supply the omission and proceeded to do so by his answer to question 1.\nKelly J.A., giving judgment for the Court of Appeal, said:\nI am in agreement with the conclusions reached by Fraser J. for the reasons so ably set out by him, and would adopt his reasons save in one particular. \u2018\nHe continued:\nI take it as a governing principle that the very words used by the testatrix in framing her will should be interpreted so as to give effect in its ordinary meaning to every word and phrase employed by the testatrix, unless there are such inconsistencies as to make it impossible to accomplish this end.\nand found that the testatrix had considered the possibility of three different sets of circumstances prevailing at the time of her death. First, that her death might occur prior to that of her husband, second, that her death might occur after her husband\u2019s death, and third, that due to some common disaster both deaths might occur under circumstances which would make it difficult or impossible to determine which death had occurred first. And then continued:\nHaving made effective provision for the one to whom she felt the most responsibility should he continue to live and enjoy the benefit of her bequest, she then directed her attention to situations (b) and (c).\nThere is a clear and unequivocal expression of her intention that in either of these two situations the disposition of her property was to be the same. Whether the death of her husband occurred before her death or at the same time, only one set of provisions for the disposition of her property was to be made.\nHaving made clear her intention that in either situation (b) or situation (c) the disposition of her property was to be the same, she proceeded to set out adequate provisions dealing with her property. Whether the distributive provisions, paragraph III, are grammatically related to situation (b) or to situation (c), if the words of distribution are applicable to either situation they must perforce be deemed equally applicable to the other.\nI am unable to adopt the view of Kelly J.A. that in the testatrix\u2019s will there is a clear and unequivocal expression of her intention that in either of the two situations, i.e., contemporaneous death or by her death following that of her husband, the disposition of her property was to be the same. I am, on the other hand, of the view that Aylesworth J.A., in his dissenting reasons, was exactly accurate when he said:\nThe declaration and dispositions made by paragraph III of the Will (supra) are in terms wholly conditioned upon an event which did not happen, namely, \u201cif my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other\u201d.\nI am, therefore, of the view that in order to attain the result which was reached in both Courts below, this Court must insert in the last will of the testatrix additional words. Aylesworth J.A. suggested those words, if they should be inserted, might be inserted at the beginning of clause III(3) of the will and those words might be \u201cin the event my husband predeceases me\u201d or words to like effect.\nThe difficulty of such an insertion by order of the Court is that the Court must be able to say as a matter of necessary implication that there was an omission and what the omission was: Crook v. Hill[8], per Sir William James, L.J., at p. 315. The Court must not speculate but be able to say as a matter of compelling conviction the nature of the error which has occurred: Re Smith, Veasey v. Smith et al.[9]\nDavis J. said in the Supreme Court of Canada in Maclean et al. v. Henning[10], at p. 307:\nMuch has been said as to the \u201cintention\u201d of the testator. It is our duty, however, to gather that intention from the language he has used. Speculation as to what he must have intended has been indulged in based upon the alleged vagueness of the language of the will and the relations of the testator toward his wife who predeceased him, the character of the contingent dispositions he has made, and the circumstances surrounding his death. Able and ingenious as many of them are, however, they must not be permitted to alter the plain meaning of the language used.\nI adopt the view cited by Aylesworth J.A. in the Court of Appeal:\nTo read into this will the words necessary to provide for the unmentioned event the Court must be compelled to the conclusion that the will reveals so strong a probability of such an intention that a contrary intention cannot be supposed.\nNow do either the actual words of the will or the circumstances of the testatrix and her late husband\u2019s death result in any compelling conviction that there was an accidental omission in this will as executed. Since the counsel for the respondent submits that the Court to determine the intention of the testatrix may not only look at the will but at surrounding circumstances, it is my intention to consider these two matters together. One would surely believe that neither the testatrix nor her husband at the date they both executed wills would have believed that they would ever have any children. The first interest of them both was that whichever one survived would have available for his or her support the whole of their joint estates. Both the testatrix and her husband saw to that by clause II of their respective wills. To reverse the order of the consideration by Kelly J.A., I turn next to the contemplated situation that both might die as a result of a common disaster under circumstances which would make it difficult or impossible to determine which death had occurred first. Again, both the testatrix and her late husband took care of that situation in the words of clause III and particularly the opening lines thereof, and did so, in my view, in a perfectly rational fashion, i.e., that the whole of the estate would go to the grandchildren of the testatrix\u2019 husband, who he had determined would be the recipients of his bounty. When both died, to all intents and purposes contemporaneously, then neither one was in need of any fund to maintain them after such catastrophe and the testatrix might be perfectly ready under those circumstances to have her husband\u2019s grandchildren take the fund.\nLastly, one might survive the other, considering the situation from the point of view of the survivor. It is the position of counsel for the said grandchildren of the husband that it would be ridiculous that the two testators should contemplate intestacy. I am of the opinion that rather than it being ridiculous it was quite rational. There is nothing to conclude that either the testatrix or her husband believed that either of them would, when such one survived his or her spouse, be deprived of an opportunity to make further testamentary disposition. In fact, if the deaths did not occur as a result of a common disaster, each one would think that the survivor could then contemplate the future in the light of the situation which then maintained and make such testamentary disposition as was commensurate with the view. Either of them, due to their age on the death of the spouse might well contemplate that he or she would have to have some assistance and care in living out the balance of his or her life. It might be that that care would be provided, at any rate in the case of the testatrix, by either her late husband\u2019s grandchildren or by her own nieces or nephews. Therefore, it would be quite rational for the testatrix to leave the disposition of her estate, in the event she survived her husband, which is the event that occurred, to be decided after she had learned who was going to assist her in living out the balance of her life and therefore who would be entitled to her bounty. This is the view expressed by Aylesworth J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said:\nshe may have considered the contingency but have come to no conclusion upon it, reflecting that if she survived her husband her future was uncertain as to whom she would live with or where she would live and as to many circumstances which might arise creating claims upon her bounty\u2026\nThe fact that the testatrix died only 88 days after her husband without having made such further testamentary disposition, in my view does not operate as any denial of the view which I have expressed, especially when it appears that she had been in hospital suffering from a broken hip from January 1962, some months before the death of her husband, until the date of her death. I, therefore, can find no compelling necessity to insert the words allegedly omitted.\nBoth at trial and in the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, the view was expressed that to interpret the will of the testatrix in the manner suggested by her heirs-at-law was to find the words \u201cI declare that my will shall take effect as if my husband had predeceased me and\u2026\u201d mere surplusage. If those words are omitted the clause would read\nIf my husband and I should both die under circumstances rendering it uncertain which of us survived the other, I give, devise and bequeath all my said property to my trustee upon the following terms:\nThere would still remain the whole of clause II so that it would have still resulted in the appointment of her late husband as an executor and it might have caused difficulties in administration despite the provisions of The Survivorship Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 391. I am of the opinion such words cannot be considered as mere surplusage and even if that were so, the existence of surplusage in a will is no ground for giving the rest of the clause a new and different meaning: In re Boden, Boden v. Boden[11], per Fletcher Moulton L.J., at pp. 143 and 145.\nTherefore, with every respect to the views of Kelly J.A., I have come to the conclusion that these words do not indicate that the testatrix had made a clear and unequivocal expression that in either of the two situations, the disposition of her property was to be the same.\nI would allow the appeal and would answer the first question in the negative. The costs of the parties appearing on the appeal with the exception of the executor, should be paid out of the estate. There should be no costs to the executor.\nAppeal dismissed, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Payton, Biggs & Graham, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents, L. Myers, R.

These balls would strike obstructions of all kinds which would direct them in various directions. When the balls struck these obstructions, lights would flash on, points would be registered and a player who reached one thousand points with the five balls would get to play an additional game free. The respondent was convicted of keeping a common betting house by having in her premises a slot machine called \"Spot-A-Card\", contrary to s. 176 of the Criminal Code. Her conviction was set aside by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal on the ground that the prosecution had not discharged the burden of proof that \"the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator\". The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Abbott J.: The machine in question served for vending services and the result of one of any number of operations was a question of chance and uncertainty for the player. Even if the balls could be controlled to an appreciable extent, as found by the Court of Appeal, there would be an element of mixed skill and chance rendering the machine illegal. It was not a question of knowing whether the operation of the machine depended on the skill of the player, it must be determined whether the operation depended on chance and was therefore a question of uncertainty.\nPer Fauteux and Hall JJ.: The machine was \"a slot machine\" within the meaning of s. 170(2) (b)(i) of the Code. The finding by the majority that \"the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent\" was a finding of fact and was consistent with the finding of fact made by the dissenting judge that the results were a matter of chance or uncertainty. The dissent was on the question of law as to whether the prosecution had discharged its burden of proof. This burden is met even when the proof establishes some measures of control, but there remain elements of \"chance or uncertainty\". Once it is accepted that the player has only partial control over the ball, then all elements of the offence have been met. Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The Crown had no right of appeal in this case under s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, because the dissent in the Court below was not on a question of pure law. The majority judgment reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player could control the operation to an appreciable extent. Whereby the dissenting judge would have sustained the conviction on the finding of fact that the evidence showed that any effective control by the player of the operation of the machine was impossible. This was a dissent as to the facts.\nDroit criminel\u2014Maison de jeu\u2014Appareil \u00e0 sous\u2014Verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel\u2014Question de savoir si le joueur a un contr\u00f4le sur l'op\u00e9ration\u2014Question de savoir si la dissidence en Cour d'appel porte sur une question de droit\u2014Droit criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 170(2)(b)(i), 176.\nUn local occup\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait muni d'un appareil automatique qui permettait \u00e0 une personne, moyennant une somme de cinq sous que la personne pla\u00e7ait \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la machine, d'obtenir cinq boules, qu'au moyen d'un \u00e9jecteur activ\u00e9 par un ressort elle dirigeait sur une table ayant un plan inclin\u00e9. Ces boules frappaient des obstructions de toutes sortes et \u00e9taient projet\u00e9es dans des directions diff\u00e9rentes et variables. Quand elles frappaient ces obstructions, des lumi\u00e8res s'allumaient, des points s'enregistraient, et le joueur qui avait compt\u00e9 mille points avec cinq boules avait droit \u00e0 une partie additionnelle gratis.

M\u00eame si le joueur pouvait avoir un certain contr\u00f4le, comme la Cour d'appel l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, il y aurait quand m\u00eame un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mixte de science et de hasard qui rendrait la machine ill\u00e9gale.

La conclusion de la majorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que la boule pouvait \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point \u00e9tait une conclusion sur les faits et \u00e9tait compatible avec la conclusion du juge dissident que le r\u00e9sultat de l'op\u00e9ration \u00e9tait une affaire de chance ou d'incertitude. La dissidence portait sur la question de droit de savoir si la Couronne avait rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau de la preuve. Ce fardeau est rencontr\u00e9 m\u00eame si la preuve \u00e9tablit une certaine mesure de contr\u00f4le, s'il demeure des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de chance ou d'incertitude. Une fois qu'il est admis que le joueur a seulement un contr\u00f4le partiel sur la boule, tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'offense sont alors pr\u00e9sents. Le juge Cartwright, dissident: La Couronne n'avait pas un droit d'appel en vertu de l'art. 598(1) (a) du Code criminel, parce que la dissidence enregistr\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour d'appel ne portait pas sur une question de droit pur. Le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 en vint \u00e0 la conclusion sur la preuve qu'un joueur pouvait contr\u00f4ler l'op\u00e9ration jusqu'\u00e0 un certain point. Par contre, le juge dissident aurait maintenu le verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 en concluant sur les faits que la preuve d\u00e9montrait qu'un contr\u00f4le effectif par le joueur \u00e9tait impossible.

(1) Aux fins des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par la pr\u00e9sente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni d'un appareil \u00e0 sous est de fa\u00e7on concluante pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 une maison de jeu.\n(2) Au pr\u00e9sent article, l'expression \u00ab appareil \u00e0 sous \u00bb signifie toute machine automatique ou appareil \u00e0 sous\n(a) employ\u00e9 ou destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9 pour toute fin autre que la vente de marchandises ou services; ou (b) utilis\u00e9 ou destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour la vente de marchandises ou services\n(i) si le r\u00e9sultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'op\u00e9rations de la machine est une affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'op\u00e9rateur;\n(ii) si, en cons\u00e9quence d'un nombre donn\u00e9 d'op\u00e9rations successives par l'op\u00e9rateur, l'appareil produit des r\u00e9sultats diff\u00e9rents; ou\n(iii) si, lors d'une op\u00e9ration quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci \u00e9met ou laisse \u00e9chapper des pi\u00e9cettes ou jetons.\nC'est, dans cet article 170, le paragraphe 2(b) (i) qui nous int\u00e9resse particuli\u00e8rement.\nLe m\u00e9canisme de cet appareil est assez compliqu\u00e9. Moyennant une somme de cinq sous, que le joueur place \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la machine, il obtient cinq boules, qu'au moyen d'un \u00e9jecteur activ\u00e9 par un ressort, il dirige sur une table qui est sur un plan inclin\u00e9. Ces boules frappent des obstructions de toutes sortes, sont projet\u00e9es \u00e0 gauche ou \u00e0 droite, dans des directions \u00e9videmment diff\u00e9rentes et variables. Quand elles frappent ces obstructions, des lumi\u00e8res s'allument, des points s'enregistrent, et le joueur qui a compt\u00e9 1,000 points avec cinq boules a droit \u00e0 une partie additionnelle gratis.\nJe suis d'opinion que cette machine est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e et est en effet utilis\u00e9e pour la vente de services et que le r\u00e9sultat de l'un ou de n'importe lequel nombre d'op\u00e9rations est une affaire de hasard et d'incertitude pour l'op\u00e9rateur. La Reine v. Topechka[3].\nLe joueur ne contr\u00f4le pas la partie, et je ne puis m'accorder avec Casey J. qui dit que \u00ab the ball can be controlled to an appreciable extents \u00bb. Dans ce cas, il y aurait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment mixte de science et de hasard, ce qui rendrait la machine ill\u00e9gale.\nIl y a bien des jeux o\u00f9 le succ\u00e8s d\u00e9pend en partie du hasard, comme le hockey, le football, etc., mais, quand le r\u00e9sultat, bon ou mauvais, ne d\u00e9pend pas du joueur, mais du m\u00e9canisme de la machine sur lequel le joueur n'a pas de contr\u00f4le, il y a violation de la loi.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans d'autres causes d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendues par cette Cour, il ne s'agit pas de savoir si l'une des op\u00e9rations de la machine d\u00e9pend de l'habilet\u00e9 du joueur, mais bien de d\u00e9ter- miner si l'une des op\u00e9rations d\u00e9pend du hasard et est en cons\u00e9quence une affaire d'incertitude. M. le Juge Owen soutient le premier point de vue, et M. le Juge Badeaux r\u00e9affirme la m\u00eame chose en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la cause de C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. La Reine[4]. M. le Juge Rivard est d'opinion contraire et conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du Code (art. 170) croit que la machine est ill\u00e9gale si le r\u00e9sultat d'une seule op\u00e9ration est une affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude. Je crois devoir accepter les vues de M. le Juge Rivard et l'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu et le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The circumstances out of which this appeal arises, the description of the machine seized on the premises of the respondent and the course of the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall.\nI have reached the conclusion that the Crown has no right of appeal in this case.\nLeave to appeal was not sought and the right of appeal, if it exists, must be found in s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. The Attorney General may appeal to this Court \"on any question of law on which a Judge of the Court of Appeal dissents\". Authority need not be quoted for the well settled rule that the question raised in the dissenting judgment must be one of law in the strict sense and not merely one of mixed fact and law.\nIn the case at bar Casey J. reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player of the seized machine could control its operation to an appreciable extent by the manual operation of \"flippers\" and by tilting the machine. Badeaux J. reached the conclusion that the evidence showed the machine in question to be the same as that which was the subject matter of the decision in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Her Majesty the Queen[5]. In that case the Court of Appeal found on the unanimous evidence of all the witnesses that an experienced player could and did control the play. Taking these views of the facts Casey J. and Badeaux J. decided that the appeal should be allowed.\nRivard J., who dissented, did not differ from the view of either of the Judges who formed the majority as to the applicable law. He disagreed with them as to the effect of the evidence. He said in part:\nLa question qui se pose est donc de savoir si le r\u00e9sultat de quelqu'une des op\u00e9rations de cet appareil sous examen est l'affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude.\n***\nL'on a tent\u00e9 de prouver en d\u00e9fense que pendant que la boule est ainsi en mouvement, en secouant l'appareil, en le \u00ab brassant \u00bb, suivant l'expression des t\u00e9moins, on peut exercer un contr\u00f4le sur cette bille en l'emp\u00eachant de descendre directement vers le bas o\u00f9 elle se perd, en la projetant contre d'autres obstacles et en courant ainsi la chance que dans son trajet, elle accumule des points additionnels.\nJe dois dire que les t\u00e9moins tant de la Couronne que de la d\u00e9fense ont compl\u00e8tement failli dans les exp\u00e9riences qu'ils ont tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir ce contr\u00f4le.\n***\nIl faut distinguer cette cause de celle de C\u00d4T\u00c9 v. LA REINE rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 1963 B.R. p. 567, o\u00f9 la preuve a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente de celle qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. Dans ses notes, M. le Juge Hyde \u00e9crit:\nA new feature, however, has been introduced into the evidence in this case in that all the witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defence, state that an experienced operator can and does exercise considerable control over the course of the ball by striking the machine with his hand while in play and that the ability of the player in this way has a distinct effect upon the score which he will achieve.\nPlus loin, il ajoute:\nAll the witnesses, as I have indicated, are unanimous in agreeing that an experienced player can and does control the play in this way.\nDans la cause pr\u00e9sente, les t\u00e9moins ne sont pas unanimes pour dire qu'il est possible de contr\u00f4ler cette boule, une fois que l'\u00e9jecteur l'a mise en mouvement. Au contraire, il est prouv\u00e9 hors de tout doute que tout contr\u00f4le efficace est impossible. C'est une machine sp\u00e9cifique que nous avons \u00e0 juger, non pas un genre d'appareil.\nFrom these excerpts and from the reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal read as a whole it is apparent that he based his decision on the ground that the evidence showed that any effective control by the player of the operation of the machine was impossible. It was on this finding of fact that he based his decision to dismiss the appeal and sustain the conviction. I am unable to find in the reasons of Rivard J. either an expression or an implication of the view that had he agreed with the findings of fact made by either Casey J. or Badeaux J. he would have disagreed with their conclusion as to how the appeal should be decided. In my view, he disagreed with the majority only as to the facts and, certainly, did not differ from them on a question of pure law.\nFor these reasons I would quash the appeal.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL JJ.:\u2014The respondent was convicted on a charge which read:\n\u2026le 14i\u00e8me jour de d\u00e9cembre 1962 en ladite cit\u00e9, tenait ill\u00e9galement une maison de jeu, situ\u00e9e rue St-Cl\u00e9ment, num\u00e9ro 503, et ses d\u00e9pendances. En contravention au statut adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet.\nThe prosecution was under s. 176(1) of the Criminal Code, keeping a common gaming house. Section 170(2) (b)(i) was invoked to establish the charge because there was found on the premises a machine which the Crown alleges was a \"slot machine\".\nThe machine and its operation are described by Rivard J. in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench as follows:\nIl s'agit d'une machine qui porte le nom de \u00ab Spot-A-Card \u00bb fabriqu\u00e9e par Gotliet Manufacturing de Chicago, portant le num\u00e9ro de s\u00e9rie 42,004. C'est de cet appareil seul dont il peut \u00eatre question dans cette cause\u2026.\nL'appareil en question ne livre pas de marchandise, de jeton, de pi\u00e9cette ou d'argent. Si le joueur r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 atteindre un certain nombre de points, \u00e0 allumer certaines cartes qui sont dispos\u00e9es dans l'appareil, ou \u00e0 obtenir un chiffre d\u00e9termin\u00e9, il a droit \u00e0 une, deux ou trois parties gratis. La partie consiste \u00e0 mettre en mouvement 5 boules. Il s'agit donc d'une machine automatique destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9e pour l'amusement seulement\u2026.\nLa preuve tr\u00e8s longue vers\u00e9e au dossier nous indique que l'op\u00e9ration de cette machine est compliqu\u00e9e. Pour la mettre en mouvement, il faut que le joueur y place d'abord une pi\u00e8ce de $0.05: la machine s'illumine, 5 billes viennent \u00e0 la surface. En tirant l'\u00e9jecteur, c'est-\u00e0-dire une tige mue par un ressort, l'une des boules vient se placer au bout de la tige et le joueur le met en mouvement en laissant aller cette tige avec plus ou moins de force, selon qu'il la retient ou la laisse aller avec toute la puissance du ressort tendu.\nCet appareil qui est en somme une table \u00e0 plan inclin\u00e9 vers le joueur, re\u00e7oit la bille qui est lanc\u00e9e vers le sommet de l'appareil. Elle frappe alors des pare-chocs, des coussinets, des obstacles qui se la renvoient dans des directions inattendues. C'est en ex\u00e9cutant ces carambolages provoqu\u00e9s par des ressorts ou des m\u00e9canismes \u00e9lectriques cach\u00e9s derri\u00e8re les obstacles que la boule frappe, que des points s'enregistrent. Au bas de l'appareil, de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du centre, c'est-\u00e0-dire en face du joueur, se trouvent deux ailerons qui sont \u00e9galement \u00e9lectrifi\u00e9s et que l'on peut mettre en mouvement en pressant sur un bouton, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que si la bille par hasard vient dans leur direction, on peut la renvoyer soit au centre, soit au sommet de l'appareil pour qu'elle recommence ses carambolages et accumule ainsi des points.\nLe joueur qui, avec les 5 billes, a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 1,000 points, a droit \u00e0 une partie gratis, s'il a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 1,100 points il a droit \u00e0 une autre partie, et 1,300 points \u00e0 une troisi\u00e8me.\nThe question to be determined is whether this machine is a \"slot machine\" within the meaning of s. 170(2) (b) (i) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n170. (2) In this section \"slot machine\" means any automatic machine or slot machine\n***\n(b) that is used or intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if\n(i) the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator\u2026.\nThe word \"services\" in this section includes amusement:\nIsseman v. The Queen[6].\nRivard J. held that the results here were a matter of chance or uncertainty. Casey J. said:\nThere is evidence that discloses that the mechanism of the machine seized was electro-magnetically operated and that the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent by the manual operation of baffles or \"flippers\" and by tilting the machine itself. This satisfies me that the prosecution has not discharged its burden of proof. (The italics are mine.)\nIn my view this finding that \"the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent\" was a finding of fact and is consistent with Rivard J.'s finding of fact on the same issue. The dissent, implicit in the opposite conclusions reached by Casey J. and Rivard J., is that on this finding the prosecution had not discharged the burden of proof which rested on it to establish that:\n(i) the result of one of any number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the operator, \u2026\nThe section does not require the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the player cannot control the ball at all. The burden is met even when the proof establishes some measure of control, but there remain elements of \"chance or uncertainty\".\nUnder s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code this Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the ground of appeal raises only a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of appeal must raise a question of law in the strict sense and in respect to which there is a disagreement, expressed or implied, between the minority and the majority in the Court of Appeal: Demenoff v. Her Majesty the Queen[7].\nThe finding that the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent by the player was a finding which Casey J. erroneously held as negativing proof of the commission of the offence and resulted in his finding that the prosecution had not discharged its burden of proof. Once it is accepted that the player has only partial control over the ball, then all elements of the offence have been met.\nI agree with Rivard J. and would allow the appeal and sustain the conviction.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nAttorney for the appellant: A.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1964: October 22; 1964: October 23; 1964: December 21.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatents\u2014Compulsory licence\u2014Restricted to sale \"to be used in Canada\" Infringement\u2014Sale by licensee to related Canadian company\u2014Sale by purchaser to third related Canadian company with resale to customer outside Canada\u2014Whether infringement\u2014Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, ss. 41 (3), 46.\nThe plaintiff, a French corporation, was the owner of a Canadian patent relating, inter alia, to a process for producing chlorpromazine, a medical substance. The defendant company Micro was the non-exclusive licensee in Canada under a compulsory licence issued by the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to s. 41(3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203. The licence allowed Micro to use the invention to prepare medicine in its own establishment and then to sell the medicine so prepared \"to be used in Canada\". Micro manufactured chlorpromazine in bulk, sold it to the defendant company Gryphon which used it to make chlorpromazine hydrochloride tablets which it then sold to the defendant company Maney, which in turn sold the tablets to the New Zealand government. The three defendant companies had the same offices and had officers and personnel in common, and all three had clear notice of the scope and limitations of the licence. The trial judge found that the sale of the tablets to the New Zealand government infringed the terms of the licence and maintained the action for infringement.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe rights of the defendants to manufacture, use and sell were contained in the compulsory licence. Their justification for making, using or selling in Canada rested squarely on the compulsory licence and that licence restricted the licensee to use the patented invention in Canada and to sell the medicine so prepared or produced \"to be used in Canada\". The trial judge was right in his finding that the evidence clearly established that the three defendants with full knowledge of the restrictions in the compulsory licence did not operate. within its ambit and that they thereby infringed the patentee's rights.

La compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse Micro \u00e9tait le porteur d'une licence non exclusive au Canada sous le r\u00e9gime d'une licence forc\u00e9e \u00e9mise par le Commissaire des brevets en vertu de l'art. 41(3) de la Loi sur les brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203. La licence permettait \u00e0 Micro de se servir de l'invention pour pr\u00e9parer des m\u00e9dicaments dans son propre \u00e9tablissement et de les vendre tels que pr\u00e9pares pour servir au Canada. Micro a fabriqu\u00e9 de la \u00ab chlorpromazine \u00bb en gros, l'a vendue \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse Gryphon qui s'en est servie pour faire des comprim\u00e9s chlorhydrate de \u00ab chlorpromazine \u00bb lesquels elle a vendus \u00e0 la compagnie Maney, qui \u00e0 son tour a vendu ces comprim\u00e9s au gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande. Les trois compagnies d\u00e9fenderesses avaient les m\u00eames bureaux et avaient des officiers et du personnel en commun, et toutes trois \u00e9taient clairement au courant de la port\u00e9e et des limites de la licence. Le juge au proc\u00e8s trouva que la vente des tablettes au gouvernement de la Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande avait viol\u00e9 les termes de la licence et maintint l'action pour contrefa\u00e7on.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLes droits des d\u00e9fendeurs de fabriquer, d'utiliser et de vendre \u00e9taient contenus dans la licence forc\u00e9e.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], maintaining an action for infringement of a compulsory licence obtained from a patentee. Appeal dismissed. G. F. Henderson, Q.C., and C. W. Robinson, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and Russell S. Smart, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court[3] dated January 6, 1964, in an action brought by the respondent against the appellants in which the respondent claimed that the appellants had infringed Patent No. 519,525 issued to it on December 12, 1955, as the assignee of Paul Charpentier, the inventor of the invention covered by the patent.\nPatent No. 519,525, the patent in question, relates to new phenthiazine derivatives having valuable therapeutic properties and to processes for their preparation and is confined for the purpose of the present action to claim 5 which reads as follows:\n5. A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein X is a chlorine atom in the 3-position, A is a \u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014CH2\u2014 group and R1 and R2 are methyl groups.\nThis is a process for producing a chemical product called chlorpromazine and relates to a medical substance.\nThe validity of the patent is not in question nor is there any dispute that what the appellants are charged with making, using or selling is chlorpromazine covered by the patent. The only matter which fell to be determined in the action was whether what the appellants did was or was not within the scope of a compulsory licence obtained from the patentee by Micro Chemicals Limited.\nMicro Chemicals Limited had, under s. 41(3) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, applied to the Commissioner of Patents for what is called a \"compulsory licence\". The Commissioner granted a licence under said s. 41(3). The licence so granted was subsequently amended by No\u00ebl J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The relevant portions of the licence as amended read as follows:\nNOW THEREFORE be it known that pursuant to the powers vested in me by the Patent Act and particularly by sections 4 and 41 of the said Act, I do order the grant to the applicant, MICRO CHEMICALS LIMITED of a non-exclusive licence under Canadian Patent Number 519,525, for the unexpired term thereof, to use the patented invention in Canada in its own establishment only for the purpose of the preparation or production of medicine but not otherwise and to sell the medicine so prepared or produced by it to be used in Canada, with notice of such restriction, the whole under the following terms and conditions:\n1. MICRO CHEMICALS LIMITED shall apply to every container of medicine prepared or produced by it and sold pursuant to this licence, a notice reading \"Licensed under Canadian Patent No. 519,525 but not for export\".\n1A. MICRO CHEMICALS LIMITED shall pay to RHONEPOULENC a royalty of 15% (fifteen per cent) on its net selling price to others of the active product in its crude form prepared or produced pursuant to this licence and sold by it.\n***\n8. Nothing herein contained shall preclude purchasers of the medicine prepared or produced by Micro Chemicals Limited pursuant to this licence from using the medicine in any way they choose for their own personal consumption.\n***\n10. The word \"medicine\" when used herein shall include medicine in bulk form.\nThe grant clause above quoted indicates that the compulsory licence imposed on the patentee and given to Micro Chemicals Limited as licensee allows that company to use the invention to prepare medicine in its own establishment and then to sell the medicine so prepared to be used in Canada.\nThe infringement alleged against the three appellant companies consists in a sale of 450,000 tablets to the Government of New Zealand made possible by means of appellants' joint action which the respondent alleges infringes the nonexclusive licence which as stated allows the sale of the product to be used in Canada only.\nThe three appellants, hereinafter called \"Micro\", \"Gryphon\" and \"Maney\" have the same offices and they have officers and personnel in common. Mr. Miller and Mr. John M. Cook are common officers to all the appellants. A Mr. I. D. Heintzman is vice-president of both Micro and Gryphon and Micro's purchasing agent acts as such for all three appellant companies. As explained by Mr. Cook, who is president and general manager of Micro and secretary-treasurer of Gryphon and Maney and is active in the three companies, day to day co-operation between the latter would be a very close one. His position as secretary-treasurer of Gryphon and Maney is more of a financial type of administration and covers office routine, and in the case of Gryphon, he did sign some documents as manager of the company.\nMicro is a company that makes chemicals used in many cases as the basis for pharmaceutical preparations. Gryphon is a company which makes up pharmaceutical preparations from chemicals it buys, sometimes from Micro and sometimes from elsewhere. In the present case, Gryphon made up into tablets the substance called chlorpromazine with other ingredients and only a small part of its weight is chlorpromazine.\nMr. Cook admits that in the case of a product marketed by Maney originally manufactured by Micro and made up into tablets by Gryphon, the information required by the Food and Drugs administrator for approval purposes would have come from all three companies.\nWhen Gryphon sells its finished products it can be in the form of tablets such as we have here, or in liquids and suppositories packed in bottles or containers with sometimes the customer's label on, but normally its products are shipped in bulk containers in accordance with whatever packaging instructions the customer has given.\nThe third company, Paul Maney Laboratories Canada Limited, is a supplier. It markets pharmaceutical preparations which it gets either from Gryphon or elsewhere.\nOn or about December 4, 1962, Maney contracted to sell to the New Zealand Government 450,000 tablets of Chlorpromazine hydrochloride which bulk substance had been manufactured by Micro and then sold to Gryphon and held in stock by Gryphon until the need to make the order arose. Mr. Cook admitted that these 450,000 tablets were manufactured by Gryphon and packaged to the specification of Maney after which they were delivered to Maney and by it to agents of the New Zealand Government. Maney not only sold to the New Zealand Government but acted as its agent in Canada in shipping the tablets to New Zealand.\nSection 46 of the Patent Act which reads as follows:\nEvery patent granted under this Act shall contain the title or name of the invention, with a reference to the specification, and shall, subject to the conditions in this Act prescribed, grant to the patentee and his legal representatives for the term therein mentioned, from the granting of the same, the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using and vending to others to be used the said invention subject to adjudication in respect thereof before any court of competent jurisdiction.\nspells out the exclusive rights and privileges of the holder of the patent.\nThe rights of the appellants to manufacture, use and sell are contained in the compulsory licence previously mentioned. If it were not for the compulsory licence and the terms thereof the appellants would have had no right at all to make, use or sell the substance covered by the patent. Their justification for making, using or selling in Canada rests squarely on the compulsory licence and that licence restricts the licensee to use the patented invention in Canada and to sell the medicine so prepared or produced \"to be used in Canada\".\nThe sale of the 450,000 tablets to the Government of New Zealand was clearly in breach of the terms of the compulsory licence. All three appellants had clear notice of the scope and limitations of the licence.\nI agree fully with the learned trial judge in his finding that the evidence clearly establishes that the three appellants with full knowledge of the restrictions in the compulsory licence did not operate within the ambit of the licence and that they thereby infringed the patentee's rights. The appeal should accordingly be dismissed with costs and the judgment of No\u00ebl J. sustained including his directions as to the assessment of damages.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: An appeal by Micro Chemicals Ltd. against the judgment of the Exchequer Court, reported at [1964] Ex.

(Eng.), Ord. 16, r. 11.\nIn an action concerning two pending applications for patents for a method of handling flotation middlings in ore concentration processes, one made by the plaintiff company D and the other by the defendant company I, D asked for a declaration that it was entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict or, failing that relief, that there was no conflict. I, by its defence, asserted that the Commissioner of Patents was right in determining that the inventor named in its application was the prior inventor of the claims in conflict and asked for dismissal of the action. A third company P claimed prior knowledge and use of the process; P had negotiated with I in regard to making application for a patent and subsequently P and I jointly negotiated with D but without success. I later decided to negotiate with D on an entirely independent basis. P made application to the Exchequer Court to be added as a party defendant in the action brought by D against I and such order was made by the President of the Court. With leave, I appealed from that order and contended that there was no jurisdiction to make it.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Exchequer Court was a superior court of record and was properly seized of the action between D and I; its general jurisdiction over its own process was not restricted by the circumstance that the action was commenced pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act.\nBy virtue of r. 42 of the Exchequer Court Rules the practice as to adding parties was governed by r. 11 of order 16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. It was not necessary in this case to choose between the wider and the narrower view as to the scope of that rule, which was considered in Amon v. Raphael Tuck & Sons Ltd., [1956] 1 Q.B. 357. D was asking that it be declared that it was entitled to the issue of a patent which, if granted, would confer upon it the exclusive right of using the flotation process which P had been using for years. The order would affect the legal right of P to continue to carry on its business. To allow the action to proceed to judgment without the intervention of P, leaving it to its rights under ss. 61 and 62 of the Patent Act, would be to countenance the multiplicity of proceedings which it was one of the objects of the rule to avoid.\nThe President had jurisdiction to make the order adding P as a defendant and he exercised his discretion correctly.\nAPPEAL from an order made by Thorson P., whereby the respondent was added as a party defendant in an action pending in the Exchequer Court of Canada. Appeal dismissed.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and J. D. Kokonis, for the defendant, appellant.\nHon. C. H. Locke, Q.C., and Ross G. Gray, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by my brother Abbott, from an order made by Thorson P., without recorded reasons, on December 12, 1963, whereby the respondent, Potash Company of America, hereinafter referred to as \"PCA\" was added as a party defendant in an action pending in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe action was commenced on June 14, 1961, by Duval Sulphur and Potash Company, hereinafter referred to as \"Duval\", as plaintiff, against the appellant, International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \"International\", and the Commissioner of Patents as defendants.\nIn the amended statement of claim Duval alleges (i) that conflict exists, within the meaning of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, as amended, between two pending applications for patents for a method of handling flotation middlings in ore concentration processes, one made by Duval and the other by International; (ii) that D. J. Bourne and M. H. Harrison are the inventors of the subject-matter of the patent claims and that Duval is the assignee of their invention; (iii) that International claims that one G. E. Atwood is the inventor and that it is the assignee of Atwood's rights; and (iv) that the Commissioner of Patents by decision dated March 17, 1961, has declared Atwood to be the prior inventor thus deciding the conflict in favour of International.\nThe statement of claim concludes by asking for judgment, with costs, determining the rights of the parties and declaring:\n(a) That the plaintiff Duval is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict;\n(b) In the alternative and only if the foregoing relief is not granted, that there is in fact no conflict between the alleged conflicting claims;\n(c) Such further and other relief as plaintiff may be advised.\nOn October 20, 1961, International filed a brief statement of defence, admitting the existence of the conflict, denying that Bourne and Harrison are the inventors of the subject-matter of the conflicting claims, stating that the Commissioner of Patents was right in determining that Atwood is the prior inventor, and asking that the action be dismissed with costs.\nThe Commissioner of Patents is taking no part in the action.\nDuval does not appeal against the order of Thorson P.\nThe application of PCA to be added as a defendant was supported by two affidavits, dated September 26, 1963 and November 15, 1963, made by its resident counsel, Roy H. Blackman an attorney at law; the contents of the first of these may be summarized as follows.\nSince prior to World War II PCA has been engaged in the commercial production of potassium chloride from sylvinite (a soluble potash ore) at its mines and plant in New Mexico, U.S.A. and is currently engaged in the development of its potash ore deposit in Saskatchewan, Canada.\nOn August 26, 1958, United States Patent No. 2,849,113 issued to Duval as assignee of Bourne and Harrison. The said patent claimed an invention corresponding to the invention claimed in one or more of the conflicting claims referred to in the statement of claim. Shortly after the issuance of this patent Blackman had discussions with representatives of International concerning the validity of the said U.S. patent. At some time subsequent to the issue of the said U.S. patent and before May 25, 1959, Blackman became aware that Duval had pending in Canada an application for patent for the same invention as that covered by the said U.S. patent. In the early part of 1959 Blackman was approached by International and requested to help it in preparing a defensive position against the said U.S. patent and agreed to co-operate. In May 1959, Blackman conferred with Mr. Harold J. Birch, an attorney representing International who informed Blackman that International had filed an application in Canada for a patent for substantially the same invention as that covered by Duval's U.S. patent, that the said application was based upon 1949 disclosures of Atwood made when he was an employee of International, and that it was filed as a defensive measure to provoke a conflict with the pending Canadian patent application of Duval. Birch also stated that if the said U.S. patent claimed a patentable invention he considered it likely that a patent of similar scope would issue to International in Atwood's name and not to Bourne. Birch said that International's primary objective was invalidation of the said U.S. patent and prevention of issuance of a corresponding Bourne Canadian patent. Birch agreed that International and its counsel would make their best efforts to employ any disclosures made by PCA including disclosures of work done prior to the 1949 Atwood disclosures to that end, despite the effect any such efforts might have on the Atwood Canadian application filed by International. Blackman then agreed to disclose and did in fact disclose to Birch work done several years previously by PCA relating to the treatment of middling material in its potash flotation circuit which he considered to be relevant to any assessment of the validity of the claims of the U.S. patent and the corresponding Canadian application.\nDuring the summer and early fall of 1959 PCA caused a Canadian patent application to be prepared based upon the previous work of PCA referred to above and a copy of the specification and claims of the said patent application was sent to Birch. As early as October 12, 1959, the attorneys for International requested Blackman not to file the proposed PCA Canadian patent application. Blackman expressed to them his concern that if PCA acceded to the request and if International prevailed in the anticipated Canadian conflict with Duval and obtained a Canadian patent, International might seek to assert the patent against PCA. Blackman indicated that if PCA's position in this respect were protected PCA would refrain from filing its Canadian application. Following discussions International agreed that it would not assert its prospective Canadian patent against PCA and this was confirmed by letter dated January 13, 1960. Since the receipt of this letter and because of it PCA has made no attempt to file its Canadian patent application.\nDuring the summer of 1961 PCA agreed with International that PCA would share with International and another interested company the Canadian counsel fees and out-of-pocket expenses in respect of International's defence to the present action. PCA and International further agreed that they would jointly negotiate with Duval with the objective of settling the dispute on a basis that would include provision for a royalty-free licence both to PCA and International under the said U.S. patent and under any corresponding Canadian patent that might issue to Duval. It was further agreed between International and PCA that if such negotiations were unsuccessful International's defence to the present action would be vigorously prosecuted. Thereafter International and PCA jointly negotiated with Duval but such negotiations were not successful.\nFurther discussions and correspondence continued until on September 3, 1963, one of the attorneys for International telephoned Blackman and told him that International had decided, as a matter of policy, to negotiate with Duval on an entirely independent basis. Blackman took the position that International was not free to do this because of its obligations to PCA but International by letter dated September 3, 1963, repeated its decision.\nParagraph 14 of Mr. Blackman's first affidavit is as follows:\nIn view of International's announced intention to negotiate with Duval on an entirely independent basis, PCA fears that International may withdraw its defence to the present action, or consent to judgment therein in favour of Duval, with the possible result that Duval's said Canadian application would issue to patent, thereby reversing the Commissioner of Patents' decision awarding the claims in conflict to International, without the Exchequer Court having had an opportunity to consider in contested proceedings the merits of the issues presently defined by the pleadings, or the merits of further grounds that could be and should be pleaded by International for denying the issuance of a patent to Duval. Mr. Blackman's second affidavit describes in considerable detail the work done and the methods of handling flotation middlings used by PCA from 1944 on, and expresses the opinion that the facts stated show knowledge and use by PCA of what is claimed by Duval as an invention in its application for the Canadian patent which is in question in this action, for years prior to the date on which Duval claims the invention was made.\nParagraph 31 of the affidavit is as follows:\nIt is the desire of PCA to operate in Saskatchewan a flotation process which would be within the scope of claim C 5, and other claims of the said Duval application, in the beneficiation of the potash ores from its deposits in Saskatchewan. The grant to Duval of an exclusive right to practise the invention claimed in the Duval application would adversely affect the interests of PCA.\nMr. Blackman was not cross-examined and the only challenge to any of the statements set out in his affidavits is contained in para. 2 of an affidavit made by Mr. Irons, an attorney for International, which is as follows:\nThe allegations of paragraph 14 of the Blackman affidavit dated the 26th day of September, 1963, and filed in support of the Potash Company of America's motion to the effect that \"\u2026International may withdraw its defence to the present action or consent to judgment therein in favour of Duval \u2026\" is not well founded. I state on behalf of and with the knowledge and approval of LMC that IMC will neither 'withdraw its defence to the present action' nor 'consent to judgment therein in favour of Duval.' To the contrary, IMC will insist on an adjudication of the conflict controversy on its merits by the Exchequer Court.\nWhile many of the matters of fact set out above may be in controversy at the trial, we should in dealing with this appeal proceed on the basis that the facts are as stated.\nCounsel for the appellant attacks the order appealed from on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to make it. He disclaims any suggestion that we should review the discretion exercised by the learned President if he had jurisdiction to add PCA as a defendant.\nThe argument is based on two main grounds.\nFirst, it is said that in an action commenced pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act, as was this action, the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction to deal with an objection to the grant of a patent only by way of review of a decision of the Commissioner and only at the instance of an applicant for patent whose application has been in unsuccessful conflict with another application. It is argued that to allow PCA to intervene in the action between Duval and International in order to contend (as it does in para. 10 of its statement of defence) that neither of them is entitled to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict would be contrary to the whole scheme of procedure in the Patent Act respecting applications for patent.\nIn my opinion, this argument is not entitled to succeed. One of the matters which the Exchequer Court is called upon to decide by s. 45(8) (b) of the Patent Act, is whether or not any of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent. Under s. 21 (a) of the Exchequer Court Act that Court \"has jurisdiction as well between subject and subject as otherwise,\n(a) in all cases of conflicting applications for any patent of invention\u2026\nThe Exchequer Court is a superior court of record and is properly seized of the action between Duval and International; its general jurisdiction over its own process is not restricted by the circumstance that the action was commenced pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act.\nThe second argument of the appellant, is that the order under appeal is outside the jurisdiction to add parties conferred on the Exchequer Court by the applicable rules of practice. By virtue of r. 42 of the Exchequer Court Rules the practice as to adding parties is governed by r. 11 of order 16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England, which reads as follows:\nNo cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties, and the Court may in every cause or matter deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. The Court or a Judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the Court or a Judge to be just, order that the names of any parties improperly joined, whether as plaintiffs or defendants, be struck out, and that the names of any parties, whether plaintiffs or defendants, who ought to have been joined, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the cause or matter, be added. No person shall be added as a plaintiff suing without a next friend without his own consent in writing thereto. Every party whose name is so added as defendant shall be served with a writ of summons or notice in manner hereinafter mentioned, or in such manner as may be prescribed by any special Order, and the proceedings as against such party shall be deemed to have begun only on the service of such writ or notice. In support of this argument the appellant relies chiefly on the judgment of Devlin J., as he then was, in Amon v. Raphael Tuck & Sons Ltd.[1], in which the construction and scope of order 16 r. 11 are fully considered.\nAfter quoting the rule Devlin J. says that there are two views about its scope and that authority can be cited for both. One, the wider, is that the rule gives a wide power to the Court to join any party who has a claim which relates to the subject-matter of the action; the other, and narrower, is that the power given by the rule is hedged about with limitations which are to be found in the decided cases and which do not merely set out principles on which the Court's discretion should be exercised but place limits on its jurisdiction. At p. 363 of the report Devlin J. quotes, as an accurate statement of the narrower view of the application of the rule, the following portion of a note in the White Book (1955 ed., p. 232):\n\"Generally in common law and Chancery matters a plaintiff who conceives that he has a cause of action against a defendant is entitled to pursue his remedy against that defendant alone. He cannot be compelled to proceed against other persons whom he has no desire to sue \u2026 Generally speaking, intervention can only be insisted upon in the three classes of case, namely: (A) In a representative action where the intervener is one of a class whom plaintiff claims to represent\", but who denies that the plaintiff does in fact represent him; \"(B) Where the proprietary rights of the intervener are directly affected by the proceedings,\" and \"(C) In actions claiming the specific performance of contracts where third persons have an interest in the question of the manner in which the contract should be performed.\"\nAfter an elaborate review of the relevant authorities Devlin J. expresses the view that the narrower construction of the rule should be adopted. To decide whether a particular case falls within class (B) in the passage from the White Book, quoted above, Devlin J. proposes the following test:\nMay the order for which the plaintiff is asking directly affect the intervener in the exercise of his legal rights?\nOn the material before him in the Amon case Devlin J. held that this question should be answered in the affirmative and accordingly allowed the intervention.\nIn order to decide the present appeal I do not find it necessary to choose between the wider and the narrower view as to the scope of the rule and I refrain from doing so. On the material before us I am satisfied that in this case the question formulated by Devlin J. should be answered in the affirmative. The order for which Duval is asking in the action is that it be declared that it is entitled to the issue of a patent which, if granted, will confer upon it the exclusive right of using the flotation process which PCA has been using for years and proposes to use in the development of its deposits of potash ores in Saskatchewan. The order sought would, in my opinion, affect the legal right of PCA to continue to carry on its business. It is true that if the intervention were not allowed the question of the validity of any patent to which Duval might be declared entitled would not as against PCA be res judicata and could be put in question under either s. 61 or s. 62 of the Patent Act, but until the patent was successfully impeached the right of PCA set out above would be affected. To allow the present action to proceed to judgment without the intervention of PCA, leaving it to its rights under the sections mentioned, would be to countenance the multiplicity of proceedings which it was one of the objects of the rule to avoid.\nIn my opinion the learned President had jurisdiction to make the order adding PCA as a defendant; I have already mentioned that it was not argued that we should review the discretion which he exercised if we came to the conclusion that the order was one within his jurisdiction, but I think it proper to say that, in my opinion, on the material before him his discretion was rightly exercised.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Herridge, Tolmie, Gray, Coyne & Blair, Ottawa.\n[1] [1956] 1 Q.B. 357.\n",

P had veered to the left in order to avoid hitting a truck which was proceeding in front of him and as a consequence he collided with B\u2019s automobile which was approaching in the opposite direction. The trial judge found L Jr. as owner and L Sr. as driver of the truck jointly and severally liable with P for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs. As between the defendants, the trial judge attributed one third to the negligence of L Sr. and two thirds to that of P. An appeal by O L, as executrix of the estate of L Sr., and L Jr. was allowed and so, in the result, P was held alone liable for the damages as fixed by the trial judgment. P did not appear upon the appeal to the Court of Appeal nor upon the further appeal to this Court.\nThe grounds on which it was argued that negligence should be imputed to the L\u2019s were (i) that the tail-light of the truck was not lighted, (ii) that there was not on the rear of the truck a reflector as required by s. 40(2) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, and (iii) that the driver of the truck was negligent in slowing down and attempting to make a left hand turn without adequate warning and without ascertaining that this movement could be made in safety. As to the second ground, the trial judge found as a fact that there was no reflector on the L truck but, having found that the tail-light was not lighted and that this was an effective cause of the collision, he did not deal with the question whether the lack of a reflector was also an effective cause.\nAs to the first ground, three questions were raised for decision, (i) was the tail-light on the L truck lighted?, (ii) if not, was the failure to have it lighted an effective cause of the collision? and, (iii) if the second question was answered in the affirmative did the result follow that the respondents were liable for the damages caused to the appellants.\nThe trial judge answered each of these questions in favour of the appellants. It was conceded that in answering the first question the trial judge misdirected himself as to the incidence of the burden of proof, holding that it was for the L\u2019s to show that the tail-light was lighted. The Court of Appeal held that the first question should be answered in the affirmative, but, in so doing mistakenly proceeded on the assumption that certain answers made by L Jr. on his examination for discovery had been admitted in evidence and were evidence against the appellants.\nHeld (Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgments of the Courts below set aside except in so far as they found P liable to the appellants, and a new trial should be had of the questions, (i) whether the respondents were liable to the appellants, (ii) if the respondents were found liable to the appellants, the degrees of fault as between the respondents and P, and (iii) the quantum of the appellants\u2019 damages.\nPer Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. The question whether the tail-light on the L truck was lighted at the relevant time could not be answered from a perusal of the written record. A new trial was necessary, and if it should be found as a fact that the tail-light was not lighted it would be for the judge on the evidence adduced before him to decide whether or not that failure was an effective cause of the collision.\nThe respondents had further argued that even if, contrary to their submission, it should be found that the tail-light was not lighted and that the failure to have it lighted was an effective cause of the collision, they were not to be found liable in the absence of evidence that the driver of the truck knew or ought to have known that the tail-light was out. This argument was rejected. Once it was found (i) that the respondents committed a breach of the statutory duty to have the tail-light lighted, and (ii) that that breach was an effective cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries, the respondents were prima facie liable for the damages suffered by the appellants.\nIt was not necessary in this case to decide whether the statutory duty to have the tail\u2011light lighted was an absolute one or, if not absolute, to attempt to define the extent of the burden cast upon a person who had committed the breach because in the case at bar it could not be said that the respondents had discharged it. The position of the respondents was not that there was a sufficient explanation to account for and excuse the fact that the light was not lighted; their position was that the light was in fact lighted at all relevant times.\nPer Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The provisions of s. 51 of The Highway Traffic Act were no more effective than the decision in Kuhnle v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co. and Green, [1946] 3 D.L.R. 681, to relieve the appellants from the burden which they assumed on the pleading of proving that the negligence of L Sr. combined with that of P to cause the collision and resulting damage. The only evidence given on behalf of the appellants as to the absence of a tail-light on the L truck was that given by P, and as this only served to raise a doubt in the trial judge\u2019s mind, the Court of Appeal was right in concluding that the onus cast upon the appellants to prove this allegation was not satisfied. The only other allegation of negligence which appeared to find any support in the evidence was that L \u201cwas in the process of making an unusual manoeuvre without first ascertaining that it could be done in safety\u201d. However, the evidence did not establish that any negligent manoeuvre by L caused or contributed to the accident. Thus the case could be disposed of as it was by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the appellants failed to discharge the burden of proving that the tail-light on the truck was either not operating or defective, and that this constituted negligence which contributed to the accident.\nThe Court of Appeal was right in its reversal of the trial judge on the grounds: (i) that he was in error in putting the burden of proof on the respondents, and (ii) in his failure to find that P\u2019s negligence was the sole effective cause of the accident.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Moorhouse J. Appeal allowed and a new trial directed on certain questions, Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nB.J. Thomson, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and R.E. Nourse, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent, Olive Russell Little.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C, and J. Sopinka, for the defendant, respondent, Frederick H. Little.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie and in those of my brother Spence.\nThe following findings made in both Courts below are not now challenged, (i) that the collision, in which Mrs. Brown was fatally injured and William John Brown suffered grave and permanent injuries, was caused by negligence on the part of Postma and (ii) that Brown was not guilty of any negligence. The question of difficulty is whether there was negligence in the maintenance or operation of the truck owned by Frederick H. Little and driven by his father, the late Frederick A. Little, which was also an effective cause of the collision.\nThe grounds on which it was argued before us that negligence should be imputed to the Littles were (i) that the tail-light of the truck was not lighted, (ii) that there was not on the rear of the truck a reflector as required by s. 40(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 167 [now R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, s. 51(2)], and (iii) that the driver of the truck was negligent in slowing down and attempting to make a left hand turn without adequate warning and without ascertaining that this movement could be made in safety.\nThe first and third of these grounds were pleaded in the statement of claim as originally delivered; the second was pleaded in an amendment permitted by the learned trial judge at the opening of the trial.\nAs to the third ground, I agree with Mr. Thomson\u2019s submission that the circumstance that in giving evidence Postma limited his complaints to the lack of tail-light and reflector does not prevent the appellants taking the position that the late Fred A. Little was otherwise negligent, if the evidence taken as a whole supports that position.\nAs to the second ground, the learned trial judge found as a fact that there was no reflector on the Little truck but, having found that the tail-light was not lighted and that this was an effective cause of the collision, he did not deal with the question whether the lack of a reflector was also an effective cause.\nAs to the first ground, three questions were raised for decision, (i) was the tail-light on the Little truck lighted?, (ii) if not, was the failure to have it lighted an effective cause of the collision? and, (iii) if the second question is answered in the affirmative does the result follow that the respondents are liable for the damages caused to the appellants?\nThe learned trial judge answered each of these three questions in favour of the appellants. It is conceded that in answering the first question the learned trial judge mis- directed himself as to the incidence of the burden of proof, holding that it was for the Littles to shew that the tail-light was lighted.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the first question should be answered in the affirmative, but, in so doing, mistakenly proceeded on the assumption that certain answers made by Frederick H. Little on his examination for discovery had been admitted in evidence and were evidence against the appellants.\nAfter an anxious perusal of all the admissible evidence bearing on the question whether the tail-light on the Little truck was lighted at the relevant time, I have been forced to the conclusion that this question cannot be answered from a perusal of the written record. The learned trial judge has found that Postma, though confused, was honest and when all his evidence is read it is plain that on two points he did not waver; he reiterates that the tail-light was not lighted and that if it had been lighted he would have seen the truck in sufficient time to have avoided the fatal collision. But for the misdirection as to onus I do not think that an appellate court could have interfered with the finding of fact that the tail-light was not lighted. My difficulty is that I cannot be certain that the learned trial judge would have made this finding if he had not ruled wrongly as to the burden of proof. There is in the written record evidence on which it might be found that the tail-light was lighted and there is also evidence on which the contrary could be found.\nIn my respectful view, it would be mere guess-work to make either finding from the written record; the only tribunal by which such a finding can safely be made is one that has seen and heard the witnesses. For this reason I have reluctantly reached the conclusion that a new trial should be directed, unless a further argument of the respondents to be dealt with hereafter is entitled to prevail.\nIf it were established that the tail-light was not lighted, it would be my opinion that there was evidence to support the finding of the learned trial judge that this failure was an effective cause of the collision. If at the new trial it is found as a fact that the tail-light was not lighted it will be for the judge on the evidence adduced before him to decide whether or not that failure was an effective cause of the collision. The further argument of counsel for the respondents referred to above is that even if, contrary to their submission, it should be found that the tail-light was not lighted and that the failure to have it lighted was an effective cause of the collision the respondents are not to be found liable in the absence of evidence that the driver of the truck knew or ought to have known that the tail-light was out. In my opinion this argument is not entitled to prevail.\nThe decision of the House of Lords in London Passenger Transport Board v. Upson[1] appears to me to proceed on the basis that the breach by the driver of a motor vehicle of a statutory provision which is designed for the protection of other users of the highway gives a right of action to a user of the highway who is injured as a direct result of that breach. The statutory provision requiring a motor vehicle to have a lighted tail-light when it is travelling on a highway after dark is designed for the protection of other users of the highway, particularly the drivers of overtaking vehicles. Its primary purpose is to prevent the occurrence of such a disaster as that out of which this case arises.\nIn my opinion, the law on this question is so well settled that it is unnecessary to multiply citations of authority. There have been differences of opinion as to whether an action for breach of a statutory duty which involves the notion of taking precautions to prevent injury is more accurately described as an action for negligence or in the manner suggested by Lord Wright in Upson\u2019s case, at p. 168, in the following words:\nA claim for damages for breach of a statutory duty intended to protect a person in the position of the particular plaintiff is a specific common law right which is not to be confused in essence with a claim for negligence. The statutory right has its origin in the statute, but the particular remedy of an action for damages is given by the common law in order to make effective, for the benefit of the injured plaintiff, his right to the performance by the defendant of the defendant\u2019s statutory duty. It is an effective sanction. It is not a claim in negligence in the strict or ordinary sense.\nI do not find it necessary in this case to attempt to choose between these two views as to how this cause of action should be described. I think it plain that once it has been found (i) that the respondents committed a breach of the statutory duty to have the tail-light lighted, and (ii) that that breach was an effective cause of the appellant\u2019s injuries, the respondents are prima facie liable for the damages suffered by the appellants. I wish to adopt two observations made in the House of Lords in Lochgelly Iron and Coal Co. Ltd. v. M\u2019Mullan[2] as applicable to the case at bar.\nAt p. 23, Lord Wright said:\nIn such a case as the present the liability is something which goes beyond and is on a different plane from the liability for breach of a duty under the ordinary law, apart from the statute, because not only is the duty one which cannot be delegated but, whereas at the ordinary law the standard of duty must be fixed by the verdict of a jury, the statutory duty is conclusively fixed by the statute.\nAt p. 9, Lord Atkin said:\nI cannot think that the true position is, as appears to be suggested, that in such cases negligence only exists where the tribunal of fact agrees with the Legislature that the precaution is one that ought to be taken. The very object of the legislation is to put that particular precaution beyond controversy.\nI have used above the expression that once it is found that the breach of the statute was committed and was an effective cause of the collision the respondents are prima facie liable to the appellants. The question then arises whether the respondents can absolve themselves from liability by showing that they had done everything that a reasonable man could have done under the circumstances to prevent the occurrence of the breach. A passage in the judgment of Lord Uthwatt in Upson\u2019s case, at p. 173, seems to suggest that this can be done by showing that under the circumstances it was impossible for the defendants to avoid committing the breach so that the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia takes effect. On the other hand in Galashiels Gas Co. Ltd. v. O\u2019Donnell or Millar[3] the House of Lords held the statutory duty there under consideration to be absolute.\nI do not find it necessary in this case to decide whether the statutory duty to have the tail-light lighted was an absolute one or, if it be not absolute, to attempt to define the extent of the burden cast upon a person who has committed the breach because, even if it is not so heavy as Lord Uthwatt seems to suggest, I do not think it can be said that in the case at bar the respondents have discharged it. The position of the respondents is not that there was a sufficient explanation to account for and excuse the fact that the light was not lighted, their position is that the light was in fact lighted at all relevant times. If the burden could be discharged simply by showing that the person upon whom it lay neither intended nor knew of the breach, the protection which it is the purpose of the statute to afford would in most cases prove illusory.\nBefore parting with this phase of the matter I think it desirable to refer to the three cases which were chiefly relied on by counsel for the respondents. These are Falsetto v. Brown[4]; Grubbe v. Grubbe[5], and Fuller v. Nickel[6].\nIn Falsetto v. Brown an automobile had run into the rear of a stationary truck in darkness. Kingstone J., the trial judge, found that the tail-light of the truck was not lighted. He found that the driver of the automobile was negligent in driving too fast under the weather conditions and in not keeping a proper look-out. He found both parties equally to blame. He stated his reasons for imposing liability on the driver and the owner of the truck as follows:\nNotwithstanding the fact that the driver may not have been aware that his light was out\u2026 the driver of the truck and the truck owner are still responsible to any person who, by reason of the failure of the rear light under such circumstances, collides with a vehicle ahead of it, whether stationary or in motion.\nAn appeal by the owner and driver of the truck was allowed by the Court of Appeal, composed of Latchford C.J. and Riddell and Davis JJ.A., Riddell J.A., dissenting in part. The complete reasons of Latchford C.J. are as follows:\nI agree with the result reached by my brother Davis on the ground that the efficient cause of the accident, the causing cause, was the negligence of the driver of the sedan.\nDavis J.A. examined the evidence in considerable detail and reached the following conclusion, at p. 658 of the report:\nI am satisfied that the negligence of the driver of the sedan was solely responsible for the accident which gave rise to the damages sued for in these actions. He was driving, without having regard to the conditions existing at the time, at such a rate of speed and in such a manner as to be unable to control his car within the range of visibility. On his own evidence he did not see the truck when he should have seen it had he been looking, and when he did see it was unable to control his car and crashed into the truck. Davis J.A. had opened the preceding paragraph of his reasons, on the same page, with the words:\nBut assuming that there was negligence, the plaintiffs in order to succeed must show that the negligence had a causal connection with the loss or damage that arose out of the accident.\nNo one would quarrel with this result on the view of the facts taken by the learned Justice of Appeal. It is not suggested that the breach of a statutory duty, any more than the breach of a duty owed under the ordinary law, gives a right of action to a plaintiff unless the breach has been a cause of the damage which he has suffered.\nHowever, Davis J.A. gave an additional reason for allowing the appeal which is summarized in the following sentence at p. 656:\nThe statutory duty to have a red tail lamp burning at certain times imposed by the statute is a public duty only to be enforced by the penalty imposed for a breach of it, and it was not the intention of the Legislature that everyone injured through a breach of any statutory requirement should have a right of civil action against the owner for damages.\nWhile this statement was not necessary for the decision of the appeal, it was a ground on which Davis J.A. based his decision and cannot be regarded as having been said obiter. It was not, however, the judgment of the Court. It has already been shewn that Latchford C.J. refrained from agreeing with it and proceeded on the other ground on which Davis J.A. founded his judgment; Riddell J.A. disagreed with it, holding that the owner and driver of the truck were liable to the passengers in the sedan but not to the driver of the sedan because, in his view, the latter was guilty of ultimate negligence.\nLater in the same year a similar question came before the Court of Appeal in Irvine v. Metropolitan Transport Co. Ltd.[7] The breach of statutory duty committed by the defendant was leaying its truck parked on the travelled portion of the highway contrary to s. 35a of The Highway Traffic Act then in force. The plaintiff\u2019s vehicle ran into the parked truck from behind. The trial judge found both parties at fault and apportioned the blame 75 per cent to the defendant and 25 per cent to the plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal was composed of Mulock C.J.O. and Riddell and Masten JJ.A. The defendant\u2019s appeal was dismissed, Riddell J.A. dissenting. In dealing with the question whether the defendant\u2019s breach of the statutory provision gave the plaintiff a right of action, Masten J.A. said at p. 833:\nIn considering this phase of the appeal I have not overlooked subsec. 4 of sec. 35 (a) which imposes a penalty for violation of any of the provisions of the section.\nUpon a consideration of the whole section, I think that, notwithstanding that it prescribes a penalty for breach of the duty imposed, it also creates a cause of action in favour of a particular class of persons, namely, those who are travelling on the highway and suffer damage from breach of the statute. My reasons are (1) that the legislation is for the protection of one particular class of the community; (2) that the penalty is not payable to the party injured; (3) that a penalty of $5.00 up to $50.00 would in most cases be a wholly inadequate compensation for the damages suffered.\nThe learned Justice of Appeal then referred to a number of authorities and continued at pp. 833 and 834:\nI am therefore of opinion that sec. 35 (a) of the Traffic Act applies against the defendant, and that its breach of statutory duty was a wrong which continued down to the moment when plaintiff\u2019s car ran into the rear of the truck. Thus this defendant is liable unless the plaintiff was the sole cause of his own injury.\nMulock C.J.O. concluded his reasons as follows at p. 827:\nIf I had tried this case I think I would not have found the plaintiff guilty of any negligence, but I am not prepared to overrule the learned trial Judge\u2019s finding and, therefore, I approve of the judgment of my brother Masten.\nIn his dissenting judgment, Riddell J.A. makes no criticism of the propositions of law enunciated by Masten J.A. but takes the view that on the facts the sole causa causans of the accident was the ultimate negligence of the plaintiff. Falsetto v. Brown was referred to in argument by counsel for the appellant in Irvine\u2019s case and also in the reasons for judgment of Riddell J.A. I think it clear that the majority of the Court must have disagreed with the proposition of law on the point now under consideration stated by Davis J.A. in Falsetto v. Brown. In my respectful view the reasoning of Masten J.A. on this point in Irvine is to be preferred to that of Davis J.A. in Falsetto.\nIn Grubbe v. Grubbe, supra, the plaintiff had run into the rear of the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle which had stopped on the highway without a lighted tail-light. The trial judge found the defendant solely to blame. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and held that the negligence of the plaintiff in driving too fast and not having his motor vehicle under proper control was \u201cthe sole cause of the damages suffered by the parties\u201d. The following passage in the reasons of Laidlaw J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court, appears to lend some support to the view expressed by Davis J.A. in Falsetto. At p. 627, Laidlaw J.A. says:\nWith much respect for the judgment of the learned trial Judge, I express the view that he has not approached the determination of the issues in this case in a proper manner. I accept his finding of fact that the rear light of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was not lighted when the vehicles stopped on the highway. But it appears to me that the learned judge was improperly influenced to the conclusion that there was negligence on the part of the defendant merely because the rear light of his vehicle was out. That fact alone does not impose liability on the defendant: Falsetto v. Brown et al. [1933] O.R. 645.\nThe note of the case does not shew whether the judgment was delivered at the conclusion of the argument. The reasons refer to no authority other than Falsetto. Reading the reasons as a whole I think that it appears that the ratio of the decision was that on the facts the absence of a tail-light was not a causa causans of the collision. I cannot think that the Court intended to depart from the principles enunciated in Irvine\u2019s case, supra, and in London Passenger Transport Board v. Upson, supra, when the reasons make no reference to either of these decisions.\nThe case of Fuller v. Nickel, supra, does not assist the respondents. The following sentence, from the judgment of Estey J., who gave the judgment of the majority, was referred to:\nThe appellant\u2019s infractions of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, both in failing to display clearance lights and having upon his truck a rack 3\u00bd inches too wide, may justify the imposition of penalties, but in fixing the responsibility for a collision in an action between parties they are important only if they constitute a direct cause of that collision.\nThere is nothing in any of the judgments delivered in that case to suggest that the infractions of the statute would not have rendered the appellant liable if they had been an effective cause of the collision.\nIt is always unfortunate when a new trial has to be ordered. It is particularly so in this case where so long a time has elapsed since the collision out of which it arises. I can, however, find no escape from the conclusion that the vital question whether or not the tail-light was lighted at the relevant time cannot be safely answered from a perusal of the writen record. At the new trial it will be taken as decided that Postma was negligent and that Brown was not negligent. The question of the quantum of damages was fully argued before us but I do not think we should deal with it. If the appellants fail at the new trial it will be unnecessary; if they succeed the damages should be assessed in the light of the evidence as to the condition of the appellant William John Brown existing at the time of the new trial.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial except in so far as they find Postma liable to the appellants and direct that a new trial be had of the questions, (i) whether the respondents are liable to the appellants, (ii) if the respondents are found liable to the appellants, the degrees of fault as between the respondents and Postma, and (iii) the quantum of the appellants\u2019 damages. It was necessary for the respondents to appeal to the Court of Appeal and the order of that Court as to the costs of the appeal should stand. The appellants shall recover their costs of the appeal to this Court from the respondents. The costs of the former trial as between the appellants and the respondents shall be disposed of by the judge presiding at the new trial hereby directed.\nThe judgment of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the appeal of the executrix of Fred A. Little and Frederick H. Little personally from a judgment of Moorhouse J. whereby he had found Frederick H. Little as owner and Fred A. Little as driver of a Dodge truck, jointly and severally liable with the defendant, Henry Postma, for damages in the amount of $166,720, which he found to have been sustained by the plaintiffs as a result of a collision between a 1953 Meteor sedan, owned and operated by Henry Postma and a 1956 Volkswagen, owned and operated by the plaintiff, William Brown, as a result of which Mrs. Brown was killed and Mr. Brown sustained very extensive permanent injuries.\nAs between the defendants, the learned trial judge attributed one third to the negligence of Fred A. Little and two thirds to that of Postma. The effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is to dismiss the action as against the Littles. The defendant Postma did not appeal to the Court of Appeal and has not appealed to this Court.\nThe accident giving rise to this litigation occurred after dark (i.e., between 5.20 and 5.30 p.m.) on the evening of December 19,1959, at a point about two miles west of Trenton, Ontario, on highway No. 2 which runs generally east and west. The night was clear and the highway, which has a paved surface 20 feet in width and 10-foot gravel shoulders, was dry and straight so that from the crest of a knoll more than 420 feet to the east of the estimated point of collision there was clear visibility looking west for a halfa-mile to one mile. On the evening in question, Henry Postma was proceeding in a westerly direction on his way from Trenton to Brighton at a speed of \u201cat least 50 to 55 miles per hour\u201d when, after breasting the knoll above referred to, and having been momentarily blinded by the headlights of an on-coming car, he saw \u201ca flicker of a light\u201d ahead of him and then noticed for the first time the presence of what turned out to be the westbound Little truck proceeding slowly and only three or four car lengths ahead. He applied his brakes and his car skidded a distance of 122 to 124 feet on his own side of the road when, fearful of hitting the truck, he veered to the left and skidded a further 14 to 16 feet before colliding with the Brown vehicle which was proceeding in an easterly direction on its own side of the highway and the lights of which, according to Postma, had not been seen by him until he turned into the eastbound lane.\nThe usual difficulties in attempting to reconstruct the events immediately before and at the time of an automobile accident are magnified in the present case by the fact that of the drivers of the three vehicles concerned, Brown has no recollection of the accident, Fred A. Little died before trial and Postma was described by the learned trial judge as \u201ca very confused young man\u201d. The task is not made easier by the fact that the distances given by the investigating policeman are in terms of estimate rather than measurement.\nThere has, however, never been any appeal by the plaintiff or Henry Postma from the finding of the trial judge that Postma was chiefly to blame for the collision, and the only question raised by this appeal is whether or not any degree of fault should attach to the Little vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Little had been shopping in Trenton on the afternoon of the accident and were returning to their farm, the entrance to which opens off the south side of highway No. 2 at a point estimated to be 50 or 60 feet to the eastward of the point of collision. There is no doubt that it was as Fred A. Little was slowing down preparatory to turning across the main road into his own driveway, that Postma applied his brakes and started his skid, but there are conflicting accounts of the movements of the truck immediately before and after the collision, of which the trial judge has accepted that given to Constable Graham of the Provincial Police two days after the accident. In so doing the learned judge makes the following finding:\nFred A. Little\u2019s statement to the police some two days after the accident is of importance, and I take this from the evidence of Police Constable Graham;\nI was proceeding west on No. 2 about to make a left turn and at the same time saw the vehicle\u2026\nhe did not say, but I put in there that it was the Postma vehicle I assumed, and I revert now again to his statement,\n\u2026coming from the rear at a high rate of speed. I pumped my brake light to show the car I was stopping. After oncoming vehicle passed I made turn and was in the driveway when I heard collision.\nMrs. Olive Little, his widow, is an elderly woman appearing, perhaps, more than her actual years. Her memory was not good. I prefer the above version of what transpired. It is confirmed, in part, by Postma when he referred to the \u201cflickering light\u201d.\nUnder all the circumstances I find it difficult to understand how, after the Brown vehicle had passed him travelling to the east, Little could have turned his truck to the left, driven it across 20 feet of highway and a 10-foot shoulder and attained his own driveway before Brown had travelled 50 or 60 feet to collide with the oncoming, skidding Postma Meteor sedan.\nThe version accepted by the trial judge was an account given by Constable Graham of a conversation which had taken place two years previously. It could not be tested by cross\u2011examination of Little and it conflicted with the story told by him at a subsequent hearing of a charge against Postma under The Highway Traffic Act. I am bound to say that the story told by Mrs. Little of her husband\u2019s actions appears to me to be more consistent with the circumstances. She said:\nWe drove up on the north hand side of the road and as he got near home he said something about a car, and then he slowed down to make the turn into Lafferty\u2019s driveway, which is across from us, and he put out his arm and he put on his brakes and we drove. Into Lafferty\u2019s driveway across from ours, and then I heard the screeching of tires and glass being broken, and then we drove over to our own driveway which is across on a slant, and then I went around\u2014he left the lights on and I went around to the back and got my bag of groceries out, and he left the lights on for me to get part way up the driveway, and then he turned them off and he said, \u201cI am going back, there is an accident\u201d.\nIn the course of her evidence, Mrs. Little also testified that it was her husband\u2019s custom to make the turn into his own driveway from the north shoulder of the highway; and as to the condition of the rear light on the truck she said:\nQ. When you went around to get your groceries, did you notice anything in particular? A. Yes, I noticed the light was on.\nQ. What light? A. Well, what do you call them, spot\u2014no, dash light, or spot light.\nQ. What colour was the light? A. It was a bright red, a red light.\nQ. Where was it located? A. On the left hand side.\nQ. Where, in relation to the licence plate, was it located? A. It was just above it.\nMrs. Little was subjected to searching cross-examination by two counsel and from the record it does not appear that she was shaken in any vital particular of her story. I am, however, conscious of the advantage which was enjoyed by the trial judge in seeing and hearing this witness and of the fact that the frailty of her memory, to which he refers, would not necessarily appear from a reading of the record. While her story of how and why the turn was made into the Little driveway appears to me as the most likely one, I do not base my decision on this construction of the evidence.\nPostma, who was the only eye-witness to the accident called by the plaintiffs, made the following answers on cross-examination:\nQ. Mr. Postma, am I right in thinking that the only thing, the thing you suggest that the truck driver did wrong, or might have done otherwise, was the failure to have a rear light on the vehicle, is that correct? A. Yes.\nQ. Is that correct? A. Yes, it is.\nQ. And so far as you are concerned, that is the only thing that you suggest was something done, or not done on the part of the truck driver which had anything to do with the causing of the accident? A. No, sir, I think it was just the light.\nQ. It was the lack of the light? A. Yes.\nQ. It was the only thing that you suggest against the truck driver, isn\u2019t that right? A. Yes. In its passage through two Courts, the case against the Littles has been treated as being dependent on whether or not the plaintiffs have discharged, or indeed were required to discharge, the burden of proving that the negligent operation of the Little truck contributed to the accident.\nIn this latter regard the learned trial Judge made the following finding:\nIn the instant case the defendants, Little, made it part of their case to prove the tail-light was on. The burden of proving that then, in my opinion, in this case was transferred to them. Postma\u2019s evidence cast doubt upon that fact and the Littles then assumed the burden of proving it. In that I must find they have not succeeded. I refer to the case of Kuhnle v. Ottawa Electric Railway, [1946] 3 D.L.R. 681.\nIn commenting on this passage in the factum, counsel for the appellants says:\nThe trial judge clearly concluded that the defendants Little had not satisfied the onus of proving that the tail-light was on and expressly found that their truck was not equipped with a reflector as required by the Highway Traffic Act. It is conceded that the learned trial judge misapplied the case of Kuhnle v. Ottawa Electric Railway as an authority for his finding that the defendants Little had not satisfied the onus, but it is submitted that as the evidence of the defendant Little left him in doubt as to \u2018the nature and effectiveness of the rear light\u2019 he should properly have reached the same result by properly applying section 51 of The Highway Traffic Act and the case of Foster v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles, [1961] O.R. 551.\nThe well-known provisions of s. 51 read as follows:\n51(1) When loss or damage is sustained by any person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle shall be upon the owner or driver.\n(2) This section shall not apply in case of a collision between motor vehicles on the highway nor to an action brought by a passenger in a motor vehicle in respect of any injuries sustained by him while a passenger.\nThe appellants state their argument in regard to this section in their factum in the following terms:\nThe plaintiff William John Brown and his wife sustained loss or damage by reason of the Little and Postma motor vehicles on a highway. There was no collision between the Brown and Little vehicles: the onus of proof that the loss or damage did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner (Frederick H. Little) and the driver (the late Fred A. Little) was accordingly upon the said owner and driver.\nThis proposition involves construing s. 51 (1) so that its provisions apply not only to the motor vehicle which is alleged to have inflicted the loss or damage, but also to any and all other motor vehicles which were present on the highway, and which might have contributed to the damage having been sustained.\nThis was \u201ca collision between motor vehicles on a highway\u201d and in order to invoke the provisions of s. 51 at all in the present case it is necessary to construe subs. (2) of that section as only applying to the two motor vehicles which actually collided so that the words \u201cThis section shall not apply in case of a collision between motor vehicles on the highway\u201d are to be read as meaning that the section shall not apply to the owners and drivers of two motor vehicles so colliding, but that it shall apply in respect of other motor vehicles which, although not directly involved, are alleged, by reason of their presence on the highway, to have contributed to the collision. It appears to me that if such a construction were placed on the statute it would mean that whenever a driver on the highways of Ontario was involved in an accident as a result of having pulled out to pass a car ahead of him in the face of oncoming traffic, the owner or driver of the car which he passed could become involved by a mere allegation of negligence in a lawsuit in which he would be required to assume the burden of disproving his own negligence.\nI cannot believe that the legislature intended any such meaning to be attached to the provisions of s. 51 of The Highway Traffic Act, nor do I think that the case of Foster v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles, supra, affords any authority for such a proposition as that case did not involve \u201ca collision between motor vehicles on a highway\u201d.\nIt will be seen that I do not consider the provisions of s. 51 of The Highway Traffic Act to be any more effective than the decision in Kuhrile v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co. and Green, supra, to relieve the plaintiffs from the burden which they assumed on the pleading of proving that the negligence of Fred A. Little, combined with that of Postma to cause the collision and resulting damage.\nAs I have indicated, the only evidence given on behalf of the plaintiffs as to the absence of a tail-light on the truck was that given by Postma, and as this only served to raise a doubt in the learned trial judge\u2019s mind, I agree with the conclusion reached by Schroeder J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal, when he said that:\nThe onus cast upon them to prove this allegation was not satisfied. The only other allegation of negligence contained in the statement of claim which appears to me to find any support in the evidence is that Little \u201cwas in the process of making an unusual manoeuvre without first ascertaining that it could be done in safety\u201d. It is, however, apparent that the learned trial judge did not place this construction on the movements of the Little truck. In dealing with this branch of the case, Moorhouse J. said:\nIt is alleged that Little was negligent in making an unusual movement on the highway without first seeing such movement could be made in safety. I cannot make such a finding in the face of Postma\u2019s evidence that the only thing Little did wrong was his failure to have illuminated a rear light.\nThis view of the matter was not disturbed by the Court of Appeal and the evidence does not satisfy me that any negligent manoeuvre by Little caused or contributed to the accident so that the case can be disposed of as it was by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to discharge the burden of proving that the tail-light on the Little truck was either not operating or defective, and that this constituted negligence which contributed to the accident.\nMy opinion is that the Court of Appeal was right in its reversal of the learned trial judge on both grounds: First, that he was in error in putting the burden of proof on the Littles and, second, in his failure to find that Postma\u2019s negligence was the sole effective cause of the accident.\nIn the view I take of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the effect of a breach of the statutory duty for which provision is made in s. 40(2) of The Highway Traffic Act. If it were necessary, I would adopt the analysis of the conflicting decisions in Falsetto v. Brown[8] and Irvine v. Metropolitan Transport Co. Ltd[9]., contained in the reasons of Cartwright J., and hold that once it is found that the tail-light was unlit, the problem then is one of causation.\nI agree with my brothers Cartwright, Hall and Spence that the ordering of a new trial is particularly unfortunate in the present case, but unlike the majority of the Court, I am not persuaded that such a course is necessary.\nIt appears to me that the decision of the learned trial judge was founded on his having wrongly imposed the burden of proof on the Littles with respect to the condition of the tail-light on their truck and that he did not consider the evidence of Postma to be sufficiently strong to do more than \u201ceast a doubt upon that fact\u201d and was therefore not prepared to base his judgment on an acceptance of that evidence. Postma\u2019s was the only evidence to the effect that the tail-light was out. This evidence, having been considered and found wanting by the learned trial judge as a basis for making a finding in this regard, I am, with the greatest respect for those who take a different view, unable to see that a new trial is likely to accomplish anything more than the obtaining of a further opinion from another judge, sitting three years later and five years after the accident, as to the weight which is to be attached to the evidence of a witness who was characterized as \u201ca very confused young man\u201d at the time of the last trial. In my view the effect of such a new trial insofar as the Littles are concerned would be to require them to re-litigate an issue the determination of which is dependent upon a reassessment of evidence which has already been passed upon and found insufficient to fix them with liability.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nHALL J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Cartwright. I do, however, wish to add a few words on the necessity for a new trial.\nOn December 19, 1959, William John Brown was driving his motor vehicle accompanied by his wife, the late Dorothy Margaret Brown, when he was crippled for life and his wife killed in a highway collision for which he was in no way responsible. The Browns just happened to be passing on their own side of the road when, through the negligence of the respondent Postma or through the combined negligence of the respondent Postma and of Frederick A. Little, deceased, the driver of the Fred H. Little truck, the Brown vehicle was struck by the Postma vehicle.\nThe learned trial judge found negligence on the part of Postma and the deceased Frederick A. Little, whose death prior to the trial was not related to the accident, but in so doing, he erred in holding that there was a burden on the Littles to establish that the tail-light was lighted.\nIn the Court of Appeal an equally serious error arose when, in dealing with the question as to whether the tail-light was lighted or not, the Court proceeded on the as- sumption that certain answers made by Frederick A. Little on his examination for discovery had been admitted in evidence and were in fact evidence against the appellants.\nThere are many cogent reasons why a new trial after such a long delay should not ordinarily be ordered, but all of these are negatived by the dominant fact here that the merits of the appellants\u2019 cause have not been tried according to law.\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Sterling Trusts Corporation, executor of Dorothy Margaret Brown, deceased, and William John Brown, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dated December 12, 1962. In that judgment the Court of Appeal had allowed an appeal from the judgment of Moorhouse J. dated December 1, 1961, in which he had found that the accident which resulted in the action had been caused by the negligence of both the defendant Henry Postma and the late Fred A. Little for whose negligence the defendant Frederick H. Little was responsible in law.\nBy the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the appeal of the defendants Olive Russell Little, as executrix of the estate of the late Fred A. Little, and Frederick H. Little was allowed and so, in the result, the defendant Henry Postma was held alone liable for the damages as fixed by the judgment of Moorhouse J.\nNotice of this appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was given to the defendant Henry Postma but he did not appear upon the appeal nor has he appeared on the further appeal to this Court although again notice of appeal to this Court was served upon him by the appellants, the Sterling Trusts Corporation and William John Brown.\nI have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Ritchie and, to avoid repetition, I shall adopt the statement of facts set out therein referring only to such matters as I desire to deal with in more detail.\nThe appellant, in the argument before this Court, sought to assess liability against the respondents, Olive Little, as executrix of the estate of the late Fred A. Little, and Frederick H. Little, upon several acts of negligence, arguing that the appellants were not limited to the single act of negligence alleged by the defendant, here respondent, Postma. It is, of course, true that the appellants are not so limited but that is a proposition of law and it must be considered in the view of the circumstances. The appellant William John Brown suffered injuries which resulted in his failure to remember anything for some time before the impact and, therefore, could give no evidence of negligence of any party.\nThe only person who could give evidence as to any conduct of the late Fred A. Little which in any way affected him and thereby caused or contributed to the accident is the respondent Postma. Therefore, on that basis, the only evidence upon negligence before the Court to consider is the evidence of Postma complaining of the fact that the tail-light on the truck driven by the late Fred A. Little was not illuminated. That is the only conduct which he swore affected him in any way. This view is reflected in the judgment of the learned trial judge when he said:\nIt is alleged that Little was negligent in making an unusual movement on the highway without first seeing such movement could be made in safety. I cannot make such a finding in the face of Postma\u2019s evidence that the only thing Little did wrong was his failure to have illuminated a rear light. I must find too that the Little vehicle had no reflector, as required by the Highway Traffic Act.\nMoreover, the late Fred A. Little, on any evidence given at the trial, whether it be his story as recounted to the constable and recounted by the constable at trial, his evidence in the Police Court during the trial of Postma upon a charge under The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, or taken from Mrs. Olive Little\u2019s evidence at trial, showed no other actionable negligence than failure to have the tail-light illuminated. He was making a left turn into his driveway and for the purpose of doing so was approaching the point where the driveway left highway no. 2 driving slowly just to the right of the centre line of the road. This would appear to be in accordance with the provisions of The Highway Traffic Act. No conduct of the late Fred A. Little, which renders him liable in law, caused or contributed to the accident apart from his possible liability due to failure to have the tail-light on the truck illuminated.\nAnother ground of negligence of the late Fred A. Little alleged by the plaintiffs was that there was not upon the truck driven by him a reflector as required by s. 40(2) of The Highway Traffic Act. At trial, Moorhouse J. found as a fact that there was no reflector on the Little truck and, of course, as a necessary part of that finding that such a condition was known to Little Sr., and Little Jr. but, having found that the tail-light was not lighted and that this was an effective cause of the collision, Moorhouse J. did not deal further with any liability which could result from the failure to have the said reflector in proper position on the said truck. There remains, therefore, the third and main ground upon which the appellants submit that the defendants Olive Little and Frederick H. Little are liable to the plaintiff, i.e., their allegation that the tail-light on the truck was not lighted at the time of the accident. This allegation raises three questions. Firstly, was the tail-light on the Little truck lighted or not; secondly, if not, was the failure to have it lighted an effective cause of the collision, and thirdly, if the tail-light was not lighted and the failure to have it lighted was an effective cause of the collision, are the respondents liable for the damages caused to the appellants.\nMoorhouse J., at trial, put the onus of proving that the tail-light was illuminated upon the defendants, here respondents, Olive Little and Frederick H. Little. The learned trial judge did so because of his interpretation of the decision in Kuhnle v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co. and Green[10]. I am in agreement with the view expressed by Schroeder J.A. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal when he said:\nThe judgment relied upon by the learned judge does not support that proposition, and this was readily conceded by respondents\u2019 counsel.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario found that the appellants here (respondents in that Court) had failed to discharge the onus of proof which the Court put upon them to prove that the tail\u2011light had not been lit at the time of the accident. In doing so, the Court considered as evidence part of the examination for discovery of the defendant, here respondent, Frederick H. Little, as follows:\n194 Q. Did he ask you at that time to check his lights? A. No.\n195 Q. Did you subsequently check to see whether or not his tail-lights were operating? A. Yes.\n196 Q. When? A. Next morning.\n197 Q. Why? MR. CASS: Don\u2019t answer the question.\n198 Q. Did you have some conversation with your father as to the accident after the conversation you have told me about before you checked the lights on the truck? A. No. 199 Q. Did you have any conversation with your father the next morning, prior to checking the truck? A. No.\n200 Q. Did you have any conversation with your father after checking the truck before the accident? A. Well different times.\n201 Q. How soon after checking the lights in the truck? A. I don\u2019t recall off hand.\n202 Q. Did your father ask you to check the lights of your truck? A, No.\n* * *\n208 Q. Then you have told us you checked the lights, did you? That is what you have told us didn\u2019t you? A. The next morning I did check the lights.\n209 Q. And what lights did you check the next morning? A. The head-lights and tail\u2011lights.\n210 Q. Did you check any other lights? A. No.\n211 Q. And how did you check them? A. Well I turned them on, looked to see if they were going.\n212 Q. What time in the morning did you check them? A. Oh perhaps around eight.\n213 Q. Was it before breakfast or after breakfast? A. It would be after.\n214 Q. And what lights were there on the truck? A. They were working.\n215 Q. That wasn\u2019t my question Mr. Little, what lights were on the truck? A. Two head lights and one tail light.\nWhat had occurred was this: The plaintiff as part of his case read into the evidence questions numbered 194 to 197 in the examination for discovery of the said respondent Frederick H. Little.\nAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, Mr. Cass, as counsel for the said Frederick H. Little, moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the plaintiffs had not proved that the truck in question was owned by the said Frederick H. Little. That motion was dismissed and Mr. Cass declared his intention not to call any evidence. Mr. Nourse acting as counsel for the respondent, Olive Russell Little, as executrix of the estate of Fred A. Little, deceased, adduced evidence and then read the examination for discovery of the defendant Postma. I find that course rather startling in view of the fact that Postma had given evidence and been cross-examined for a very lengthy period by the same Mr. Nourse. I am of the opinion that such a course is not permitted in the practice in the Province of Ontario. With that the production of evidence ended, counsel addressed the Court, and the Court was adjourned until the next morning for judgment. On the opening of the Court the next morning, Mr. Nourse as counsel for Olive Little, executrix of the estate of the late Fred A. Little, pointed out that Mr. Haines, as counsel for the plaintiffs, had criticized the failure of Frederick H. Little to give evidence, and had inferred that Mr. Cass\u2019s refusal to permit his client to answer question 197 in the examination for discovery as aforesaid was because the answer, if given, would be unfavourable to his cause. Mr. Nourse, therefore, requested the right to read other questions in the said examination for discovery of the said Frederick H. Little, advancing R. 329 as being the basis for such application. That rule of the Ontario Rules of Practice permits any party to read, in whole or in part, the examination of an opposite party. I cannot imagine how the interest of Mr. Nourse\u2019s client, the executrix of the estate of the driver, could be considered as opposite to that of the owner and it was the owner\u2019s examination which he sought to read.\nThe trial judge then permitted questions 198 to 215 of the said examination for discovery to be read, subject to the objection, but in his reasons for judgment, said:\nThe defendant Frederick H. Little examined this light the next morning about eight o\u2019clock. The vehicle belonged to him. This question was of vital interest to him yet there is no evidence before me as to the result of the examination.\nI am of the opinion that in this statement the learned trial judge expressed the view that the reading of questions and answers 198 to 215 by the counsel for the executrix of Frederick A. Little after the close of the case and after the opportunity to cross-examine or to adduce evidence contra had passed was the production of inadmissible evidence to which he did not intend to pay any attention in coming to his conclusion. I am in accord with that view.\nThe situation, therefore, before this Court is this: The trial judge, with respect, in error, found that the tail-light had not been lit by putting the onus on the defendants Olive Little and Frederick H. Little and again, with respect, the Court of Appeal in error, although putting the onus correctly on the appellants here, found that the tail-light had been lighted on the basis of inadmissible evidence.\nI have made an exhaustive analysis of all the admissible evidence upon the question of whether the tail-light of the Little truck was illuminated at the time of the accident, and I have come to the reluctant conclusion that I am unable, from a perusal of the record, to make such a finding of fact and that a new trial is necessary.\nI have come to this conclusion with the utmost reluctance, realizing that the accident occurred on December 19, 1959, and that Fred A. Little died even before the trial of the action took place, that William John Brown, the plaintiff, is unable to give any evidence whatsoever as to what caused the accident, and that Henry Postma was characterized by the learned trial judge in his reasons for judgment as a \u201cvery confused young man\u201d. Giving weight, however, to all of these factors, I can see no other alternative for the sound determination of the most important question as to whether or not the tail-light was illuminated at the relevant time than to have a new trial upon that issue.\nThe new trial will be concerned with the three issues as to the said tail-light to which I have referred above, i.e., was the said tail-light lit or unlit at the time of the accident and if it were unlit was such a condition an effective cause of the collision? I agree with my brother Cartwright, whose reasons I have had the privilege of reading, that if the Court upon the retrial were to find that the tail-light were unlit and that such unlit condition was an effective cause of the collision, there is a prima facie liability upon the defendants Olive Russell Little and Frederick H. Little. I am not prepared to say that that liability is an absolute one and that the said defendants would be unable to discharge it by showing that such condition occurred without negligence for which they are in law responsible as all of the evidence which I have perused in reference to the tail-light was not addressed to the question of whether it was unlit because of negligence but to the question of whether it was lit or unlit. I agree with my brother Cartwright that such evidence is not even relevant upon the issue of whether the tail-light, if unlit, was unlit due to any negligence.\nI therefore agree that there must be a new trial upon the questions as outlined by my brother Cartwright in his reasons for judgment, including the contribution, if any, between the defendant Henry Postma on the one hand, and the defendants Olive Russell Little and Frederick H. Little on the other hand, and further including the quantum of the appellants\u2019 damages. I also agree with my brother Cartwright\u2019s disposition of the costs.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Haines, Thornson, Rogers, Howie & Freeman, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Fasken, Calvin, Mackenzie, Williston & Swackhamer, Toronto.\n[1] [1949] A.C. 155.\n[2] [1934] A.C. 1.\n[3] [1949] A.C. 275.\n[4] [1933] O.R. 645.\n[5] [1953] O.W.N. 626.\n[6] [1949] S.C.R. 601.\n[7] [1933] O.R. 823.\n[8] [1933] O.R. 645.\n[9] [1933] O.R. 823.\n[10] [1946] 3 D.L.R. 681.\n",

At the hearing of the application for approval of the amalgamation agreement, only one person appeared to oppose the application, this being the respondent F. The position which he took was that the ratio between the participation of G and N shareholders in the amalgamated company was unfair to the G shareholders. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed the appeal and set aside the approving order; two members of the Court held that the material submitted to the shareholders of G was insufficient to enable them to judge of the fairness and propriety of the scheme and a third member of the Court held that the material furnished by the companies was insufficient to enable either the shareholders or the Court to determine whether or not the transaction was provident. An appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The vital elements in relation to this appeal were: 1. The Registrar of Companies, acting upon the strength of an order which the judge who made it had jurisdiction to make and which was, therefore, valid until set aside, issued, as he was required to do by the statute, a certificate that G and N had been amalgamated into one company. 2. Upon such certificate being issued, G and N then became one company, which company thereafter possessed all the property rights, privileges and franchises and became subject to all the liabilities, contracts and debts of each of the amalgamating companies. 3. Thereafter the amalgamated company had existed and done business on its own account.\nUnder s. 140a of The Companies Act, G and N, in the absence of any valid stay of proceedings, were required to file the amalgamation agreement and the approving order with the Registrar, who, in turn, was obliged to act upon it. The filing of a notice of appeal did not stay such proceedings, nor invalidate them. The result was that the whole purpose for which the order was made was fulfilled, a certificate of amalgamation was issued, and rights and interests had been acquired by other persons against and in the amalgamated company, upon the strength of that certificate.\nThe Act contained no provision for the revocation of such a certificate. The Appellate Division had no power to revoke it, nor did it, by its order, purport to do so. The setting aside of the approving order did not have and could not have the effect of dissolving the amalgamated company, or of restoring the separate corporate existence of G and N. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division could have no effect and ought not to have been made.\nPer Judson and Spence dissenting: The Appellate Division was correct in its view as to the effectiveness of the material put before the G shareholders; these shareholders had far less accurate information or explanation than they were entitled to in order to permit them to come to an intelligent judgment as to whether or not they should vote in favour of the proposed amalgamation and for that reason the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.\nThe allegation that F, because of his purchase of shares of the amalgamated company on the open market, had lost any right to appeal to the Appellate Division failed; he had simply invested in those shares for whatever they were worth and had not in any way elected to approve the transaction which he was now attacking.\nAn application for an order approving an amalgamation, pursuant to s. 140a of The Companies Act, was an application to the court exercising ordinary jurisdiction as such and was not an application to any person in the position of a persona designata; therefore the provisions of The Extra-curial Orders Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 105, did not apply and an appeal lay as of right under the provisions of s. 26 of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164. Esso Standard (Inter-America) Inc. v. J. W. Enterprises Inc., [1963] S.C.R. 144, followed.\nFinally, the appellants had taken the position that when the respondent did not apply for any stay of proceedings and since the circumstances had so altered that the decision of the Appellate Division was vain, it was now impossible to return to the position prior to the argument of the appeal. However, to allow this appeal would involve the restoration of the order approving the amalgamation and that would be a gross injustice to minority shareholders who might well have proceedings in contemplation or even under way. Their rights should not be foreclosed or even in any way affected by any judgment of this Court allowing an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division which was a correct decision.\nThe order approving the amalgamation agreement did not order the proponents of the scheme to do anything. They took the responsibility of filing the amalgamation agreement and order with the Registrar after their solicitor had been served with a notice of appeal and after that notice of appeal had been filed. There was a right of appeal to the Appellate Division. It was no answer to say when that appeal was successful that nothing could be done and that the dissenting shareholder must accept an accomplished fact even when he did not apply for a stay. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed; the respondent would have to take such proceedings as he deemed fit to effect the remedy he desired, such proceedings to be in the Courts of Alberta.\nCommissioner of Provincial Police v.

Pattillo, Q.C., and E. D. Arnold, Q.C., for the appellants.\nH. Fogler, respondent, in person.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2], setting aside an order which had been made approving, pursuant to s. 140a of The Companies Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 53, as amended, the amalgamation, as one company, of Gridoil Freehold Leases Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Gridoil\") and Norcan Oils Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"Norcan\") under the name of Gridoil Freehold Leases Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \"the amalgamated company\").\nGridoil was incorporated as a public company under the laws of the Province of Alberta on September 21, 1950, and was engaged in the business of the development and production of and exploration for oil and natural gas in Western Canada. Norcan was incorporated, under a different name, as a private company under the laws of the Province of Alberta on August 2, 1957. It was inactive until 1962. In April of that year it became a public company and shortly prior thereto had commenced operations, its business being the development, production of and exploration for oil and natural gas in Western Canada.\nAt the time the two companies entered into an amalgamation agreement Gridoil had authorized capital consisting of $270,000 divided into 3,000,000 shares, each with a par value of nine cents, of which 2,234,871 were issued and outstanding.\nAt that time Norcan had an authorized capital of $3,000,000 divided into 3,000,000 shares, each with a par value of one dollar, of which 1,141,248 were issued and outstanding.\nThe boards of directors of both companies consisted of exactly the same persons and each company had the same president and vice-president as the other. The four persons who constituted the two boards of directors controlled 58.6 per cent of the shares of Gridoil issued and outstanding and 61.6 per cent of the shares of Norcan issued and outstanding.\nExcluding the shares controlled by the directors, over 90 per cent of the Gridoil shares were owned by residents of the United States and approximately 60 per cent of the Norcan shares were similarly owned. Gridoil shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange, but Norcan shares were not.\nBoth companies held reservations and crown and freehold leases in Western Canada and in the Northwest Territories. They shared the same office premises, the same management and the same staff. The directors of the two companies decided that an amalgamation was desirable and that the method which should be adopted to determine the relative participation in the shares of the amalgamated company of the respective shareholders of the two companies should be upon the basis of an independent valuation of the properties of the two companies. Such a valuation was made by an independent firm of geological and engineering consultants in Calgary. On the basis of the valuation it was proposed by the directors that the shareholders of Gridoil should receive one share of the amalgamated company for each share of Gridoil and that the shareholders of Norcan should receive nine shares of the amalgamated company for each share of Norcan.\nAn amalgamation agreement, dated December 3, 1962, was entered into between the two companies which, inter alia, provided for the share interests in the amalgamated company on that basis.\nAuthority for the amalgamation of two or more Alberta companies into one company is contained in s. 140a of The Companies Act. This section was first enacted in c. 10, Alberta Statutes 1959. The relevant portions of it are as follows:\n140a. (1) Any two or more companies, including holding and subsidiary companies, may amalgamate and continue as one company.\n(2)The companies proposing to amalgamate may enter into an amalgamation agreement, which shall prescribe the terms and conditions of the amalgamation and the mode of carrying the amalgamation into effect.\n(3)The amalgamation agreement shall further set out\n(a) the name of the amalgamated company, (b) the place within the Province at which the registered office of the amalgamated company is to be situated,\n(c) the amount of the authorized capital of the amalgamated company and the division thereof into shares,\n(d) the objects for which the amalgamated company is to be established,\n(e) the names, occupations and places of residence of the first directors of the amalgamated company,\n(f) the date when subsequent directors are to be elected,\n(g) the manner of converting the authorized and issued capital of each of the companies into that of the amalgamated company, and\n(h) such other details as may be necessary to perfect the amalgamation and to provide for the subsequent management and working of the amalgamated company.\n(4)The amalgamation agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of each of the amalgamating companies at general meetings thereof called for the purpose of considering the agreement, and if three-fourths of the votes cast at each meeting are in favour of the amalgamation agreement,\n(a) the secretary of each of the amalgamating companies shall certify that fact under the corporate seal thereof, and\n(b) the amalgamation agreement shall be deemed to have been adopted by each of the amalgamating companies.\n(5) Where the amalgamation agreement is deemed to have been adopted the amalgamating companies may, if a copy of the agreement has been submitted to the Registrar and approved in writing by him, apply to the court for an order approving the amalgamation.\n(6) Unless the court otherwise directs, each amalgamating company shall notify each of its dissentient shareholders, in such manner as the court may direct, of the time and place when the application for the approving order will be made.\n(7) Unless the court otherwise directs, notice of the time and place of the application for the approving order shall be given to the creditors of an amalgamating company in such manner as the court may direct.\n(8) Upon the application, the court shall hear and determine the matter and may approve the amalgamation agreement as presented or may approve it subject to compliance with such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, having regard to the rights and interests of all parties including the dissentient shareholders and creditors.\n(9) The amalgamation agreement and the approving order shall be filed with the Registrar, together with proof of compliance with any terms and conditions that may have been imposed by the court in the approving order.\n(10) On receipt of the amalgamation agreement, approving order and such other documents as may be required pursuant to subsection (9), the Registrar shall issue a certificate of amalgamation under his seal of office and certifying that the amalgamating companies have amalgamated.\n(11) On and from the date of the certificate of amalgamation, the amalgamating companies are amalgamated and are continued as one company hereinafter called the \"amalgamated company\", under the name and having the authorized capital and objects specified in the amalgamation agreement. (12) The amalgamated company thereafter possesses all the property, rights, privileges and franchises and is subject to all the liabilities, contracts and debts of each of the amalgamating companies, and all the provisions of the amalgamation agreement respecting the name of the amalgamated company, its registered office, capital and objects shall be deemed to constitute the memorandum of association of the amalgamated company.\n***\n(19) An amalgamated company shall, for the purposes of the other provisions of this Act, be deemed to be a company incorporated under this Act within the meaning of clause (g) of section 2, so far as the nature of an amalgamated company will permit.\nSection 2 (g), which is referred to in subs. (19) above, provides as follows:\n(g) \"company\" includes any company incorporated under this Act and an existing company;\n\"Existing company\" is defined in s. 2 (p):\n(p) \"existing company\" means a company lawfully incorporated or registered under any Act or Ordinance respecting companies at any time in force in the Province prior to the first day of October, 1929, and subject to the legislative authority of the Province;\nThe amalgamation agreement was submitted to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and received his approval on January 9, 1963.\nThe amalgamation agreement was submitted to the shareholders of each company at meetings held on January 15, 1963.\nAt the Gridoil meeting 96.3 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the agreement. Of the shares voted, excluding those controlled by the four directors, 78.5 per cent were in favour of it.\nAt the Norcan meeting 99.8 per cent of the votes cast were in favour of the agreement. Of the shares voted, excluding those controlled by the four directors, 99.2 per cent were in favour of it.\nApplication was then made for approval of the agreement. Notice was given to the dissentient shareholders in the manner directed by the learned judge before whom the application was to be made. He dispensed with notice to creditors.\nAt the hearing on February 12, 1963, only one person appeared to oppose the application, this being the respondent Fogler. The position which he took was that the ratio between the participation of Gridoil and Norcan share- holders in the amalgamated company was unfair to the Gridoil shareholders.\nThe learned judge granted an order approving the amalgamation agreement, which was entered on February 13. No application was made for any stay of proceedings under the order, nor was any intimation given by the respondent of his intention to make such an application.\nOn February 15 the respondent filed a notice of appeal. Rule 610 of the Rules of Court of the Supreme Court of Alberta provides as follows:\n610. An appeal shall not operate as a stay of execution or of proceedings under the decision appealed from except so far as the Court or judge or master appealed from, or any judge of the Supreme Court, may order; and no intermediate act or proceedings shall be invalidated except so far as the court appealed from may direct.\nThe solicitor representing Gridoil and Norcan, upon being served with the notice of appeal, notified the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies of this fact. Thereafter he proceeded to file with the Registrar the amalgamation agreement and the approving order pursuant to the requirements of subs. (9) of s. 140a. The Registrar issued a certificate of amalgamation, pursuant to subs. (10), on February 18, certifying that Gridoil and Norcan were that day amalgamated as one company under the name of Gridoil Freehold Leases Ltd.\nThe respondent's appeal came on for hearing on October 17, 1963, and judgment was delivered on February 24, 1964, allowing the appeal and setting aside the approving order.\nThe learned Chief Justice, whose reasons were concurred in by Johnson J.A., held that the material submitted to the shareholders of Gridoil was insufficient to enable them to judge of the fairness and propriety of the scheme because (1) it did not disclose the figure as to the revaluation of the oil and gas properties of that company and (2) it did not disclose that Gridoil had accumulated tax credits of $2,000,000, resulting from drilling and exploration expenses incurred by it in previous years, which might, under certain circumstances, be used by the amalgamated company against future taxable income.\nThe explanation given before us with respect to both of these items was that the material in question could not be furnished if Gridoil were to comply with the requirements of the American Securities Exchange Commission and that, in view of the fact that of the issued shares of Gridoil not controlled by its directors over 90 per cent were owned in the United States and the fact that Gridoil shares were listed on the American Stock Exchange, such compliance was highly desirable.\nPorter J.A., who delivered separate reasons for allowing the appeal, held that the material furnished by the companies was insufficient to enable either the shareholders or the Court to determine whether or not the transaction was provident.\nIn view of the conclusions which I have reached with respect to this appeal, I express no opinion as to the nature of the material which should be submitted to shareholders when they are summoned to a meeting to consider the approval of an amalgamation agreement. Section 140a itself contains no statutory requirement in this regard.\nTo me the vital elements in relation to this appeal are:\n1. that the Registrar, acting upon the strength of an order which the learned judge who made it had jurisdiction to make and which was, therefore, valid until set aside, issued, as he was required to do by the statute, a certificate that Gridoil and Norcan had been amalgamated into one company;\n2. that, upon such certificate being issued, Gridoil and Norcan then became one company, which company thereafter possessed all the property rights, privileges and franchises and became subject to all the liabilities, contracts and debts of each of the amalgamating companies;\n3. that thereafter the amalgamated company has existed and done business on its own account, including:\n(1) the acquisition, either alone or in participation with other companies, of 14,701 net acres of petroleum and natural gas rights in Alberta and Saskatchewan, at a total cost to the amalgamated company of over $500,000;\n(2) the acquisition, by way of participation in farmout agreements and joint ventures with 56 other companies, of over 200,000 net acres of petroleum and natural gas rights in those two provinces and in the Arctic Islands at a cost to the amalgamated company of over $50,000; (3) the expenditure of over $1,500,000 for drilling and development of the petroleum and natural gas rights acquired since the amalgamation;\n(4) the obtaining of a production loan from the bank, of which $775,000 remains outstanding;\n(5) the incurring of trade obligations of which approximately $250,000 remains outstanding.\nAs I read s. 140a, Gridoil and Norcan, in the absence of any valid stay of proceedings, were required to file the amalgamation agreement and the approving order with the Registrar, who, in turn, was obliged to act upon it. The filing of a notice of appeal did not stay such proceedings, nor invalidate the same.\nThe result is that the whole purpose for which the order was made was fulfilled, a certificate of amalgamation was issued, and rights and interests have been acquired by other persons against and in the amalgamated company, upon the strength of that certificate.\nThat being so, it is necessary to consider what is the effect of the order on appeal setting aside the order which approved the amalgamation agreement.\nThe approving order was not one which affected only the position of the parties to the proceedings which led up to it. It was an order from which, when filed with the Registrar, by the terms of the statute, legal consequences must flow, which inevitably affected the rights of other persons. Under the specific provisions of s. 140a, upon receipt of the amalgamation agreement and the order approving it, the Registrar was not only empowered, but legally obligated, to issue a certificate of amalgamation, and, thereafter, the two companies were amalgamated into one amalgamated company, which was authorized to carry on business, including the making of contracts with other persons. Any such person was entitled to rely upon the certificate as sufficient basis for the capacity of the amalgamated company so to do.\nThe Companies Act contains no provision for the revocation of such a certificate. In my opinion the Appellate Division had no power to revoke it, nor did it, by its order, purport to do so. The setting aside of the approving order did not have and could not have the effect of dissolving the amalgamated company, or of restoring the separate corporate existence of Gridoil and Norcan. Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division could have no effect and ought not to have been made.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed. In the light of all the circumstances of this case I do not think that either party should be entitled to receive costs in this Court, or in the Court below.\nThe judgment of Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[3] made on March 23, 1964. By that order the Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Cairns dated February 12, 1963, in which Mr. Justice Cairns approved the amalgamation agreement between the two appellant companies. I propose to deal with the merits of the appeal and then to discuss certain preliminary objections put forward by counsel for the appellants.\nThe order of Cairns J. was made without written reasons. I think the Court below assumed, and I am ready to assume, that the amalgamation agreement was approved upon the argument advanced to this Court. In the Court of Appeal reasons were delivered by the Chief Justice of Alberta and by Mr. Justice Porter. Mr. Justice Johnson concurred with the Chief Justice. All agreed in allowing the appeal and quashing the order approving the amalgamation agreement. Porter J.A., citing s. 140a of The Companies Act of Alberta, stated that under that section a shareholder who dissents from the views of only three-quarters of the members whose votes were cast at a meeting may be forced to exchange his shares for shares in the amalgamated company and continued:\nHe may thus be coerced into taking the shares in the new company by a relatively small percentage of shares and shareholders of the old company. This is not, however, to be done without the approval of the court in terms as follows:\nPorter J.A. then quoted s. 140a(8), and continued:\nIt will be observed that the statute itself gives no guidance and imposes no limits as regards the grounds on which this judicial discretion is to be exercised. The approval of the transaction is left entirely to the discretion of the court: Hayes v. Mayhood, 18 D.L.R. (2d) at 505. Unlike the requirements of section 138, the requisite majority cannot by itself compel the amalgamation. It must have the approval of the court whereas under section 138 the compulsory purchase is complete unless the dissentient shareholder moves to the court to order otherwise. It is clear that section 140a(8) requires the judge to review the facts and circumstances and approve of the transaction if, in his opinion, it is fair and provident. To exercise that discretion he must decide whether a prudent man properly informed would regard the transaction as provident.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nPorter J.A. cites In re Bugle Press Ltd.[4], at p. 276, for the proposition that business people are much better able to judge their own affairs than the Court is able to do and therefore the Court is accustomed to pay the greatest attention to what commercial people who are concerned with a transaction in fact decide, but pointed out that in the same case it was emphasized that those who proposed the amalgamation controlled 90 per cent of the holding and that under such circumstances their views could not serve as a guide to the propriety of the transaction as would the opinion of a majority of shareholders interested in only one of the amalgamated companies. That is the situation in the present case where those proposing the amalgamation hold 61 per cent of the capital stock of Norcan and 58.6 per cent in the capital stock of Gridoil.\nPorter J.A. continued by showing that in the case of Norcan, and leaving aside the shares held by the promoters, only 18 per cent of the shareholders in fact voted for the amalgamation, and in the case of Gridoil, leaving aside the promoters' shares, only 12 per cent voted for the amalgamation, and then stated:\nWith so small a percentage of the disinterested shareholders voting the first inquiry for a court should be to determine whether the information which was given to the shareholders prior to the meeting was such as to enable them to form a judgment as to whether they should or should not attend the meeting. \"Did the circular issued to the shareholders disclose sufficient information to enable them to judge of the fairness and propriety of the scheme?\" (Carruth v. Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., [1937] 2 All E.R. 422.)\nAfter a detailed analysis of the material, Porter J.A. concludes:\nNo court can determine whether this merging transaction is fair and no shareholder can make a decision without having knowledge of all the facts which a prudent man disposing of one stock and acquiring another would require to weigh and consider before coming to a decision. The necessary facts will vary with the characteristics of the companies involved but in companies of the kind being dealt with here they may well include, for example, the following: book value for historical purposes, demonstrated earnings capacity, liabilities current and long term, cash flow, provisions for depreciation and depletion, market activities, the speculative potential of the acreage of an exploratory company, proper estimates of reserves, and their marketability, as well as the benefits that might accrue to the shareholders in the future operations of the merged company that would not be available if the companies were not merged.\nIn my view the material before the learned judge was so lacking in essential facts that it could not form the basis for the exercise of discretion.\nSmith C.J.A. said in his reasons:\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Porter J.A. which sufficiently outline the facts, I am in agreement with the result which he has reached but I might base my decision upon somewhat narrower ground.\nHaving then examined the material and authorities upon the subject, he concludes:\nMy view is that the proxy statement sent to the shareholders of Gridoil was insufficient because of the omission (1) of the figure as to the revaluation of the oil and gas properties of that company, and (2) of a reference to the tax credits of $2,000,000.00 referred to by Porter J.A. Under these circumstances, my view is that the shareholders were not enabled to exercise an intelligent judgment upon the merits of the proposed amalgamation. I do not consider that the directors in the proxy statement were \"honestly putting forward to the best of their skill and ability a fair picture of the Company's position\" (In re Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. [1936] 1 Ch. 587, Clauson J. at 618) or that the proxy statement \"disclosed sufficient information to enable\" the shareholders to \"judge of the fairness and propriety of the scheme.\" (Carruth v. Imperial Industries Ltd. [1937] 2 All E.R. 422.)\nSmith C.J.A. also quoted Masten J.A. in Re Langley's Ltd.[5], at p. 132:\n\u2026and that every shareholder affected by the proposed scheme receives such fair, candid and reasonable notice of the proposed arrangement as will afford him proper and adequate opportunity for its consideration prior to the meeting.\nDespite the very able argument of learned counsel for the appellants, I have not been convinced that the Court of Appeal for Alberta was not exactly correct in its view as to the effectiveness of the material put before the Gridoil shareholders to permit them to make an intelligent appraisal of the proposed amalgamation. In the 1960 directors' report to the shareholders of Gridoil under date May 5, 1961, it was said in part:\nDuring the past two years water flooding and other engineering operations were carried out in the Company's major producing field. In 1960 the Company's engineer was able to evaluate the results of these operations and he estimated the recoverable oil reserves to be 4,500,000 net barrels after royalties, an increase of 2,500,000 barrels over the previous estimate of 2,000,000 barrels. This major revision in the oil reserves was discussed with appropriate officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington and they approved the upward revision of oil reserves as calculated by the Company's engineer.\nThe 1961 directors' report to shareholders dated April 27, 1962, was in a similarly optimistic vein. Then the proxy statement upon the proposed amalgamation, after having recited that it was proposed that one share of the old Gridoil stock should be surrendered for one share of the new stock as against the proposal that one share of Norcan should be surrendered for nine shares of the new stock, continued:\nThe above ratio was determined on a basis of estimates of the value of the assets of the companies including estimates of value by independent geologists and engineers with respect to oil and gas properties of the companies and of Canadian Williston Minerals Ltd. owned 63.4% by Norcan. The net earnings of the companies were not given any weight in determining the basis of exchange. Such estimates of value of the oil and gas properties of the companies are not necessarily indicative of the fair market value thereof. On the basis of the present outstanding shares the ratio of value per share of Gridoil and Norcan was determined to be approximately 1 to 9 which became the basis for the exchange.\nWith the notice of special general meeting of shareholders and a proxy statement as to Gridoil there were forwarded to its shareholders under date December 21, 1962, two letters from S. C. Nickel as president. In one of those letters, it was said in part:\nAlthough the Company's cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 1962 was $245,846, your management has found it necessary to restrict normal drilling and exploration activities because of insufficient working capital. Also sinking fund requirements in respect of the 5 1\/2% Notes beginning in 1964 are likely further to restrict the amount of funds available for future exploration. Norcan on the other hand has substantial working capital and holds $710,000 principal amount of 5 1\/2% Notes of the Company which would be acquired by the Company and cancelled prior to the effective date of the amalgamation, resulting in the sinking fund requirements being satisfied until 1968. The amalgamation of Gridoil and Norcan would result in a much greater and more diversified spread of oil and gas properties.\nThe second letter under the same date is very short and simply advises that the statement in the 1960 annual report that \"this major revision in the oil reserves was discussed with appropriate officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington and they approved the upward revision of oil reserves as calculated by the company engineer\" was an incorrect statement. Also included amongst the material forwarded to shareholders in the proxy statement were statements of book value which purported to show that the shares in Gridoil Freehold Leases Ltd. were of a minus 15 cents book value. A shareholder seeing this dire picture might well have determined to take the 1 for 9 distribution proposed in the amalgamation without any further investigation and have refrained from attending the meeting or exercising his vote. Only a small percentage of shareholders did attend the meeting apart from the shares controlled by the promoters. I am in agreement with the Chief Justice of Alberta when he said:\nIf the valuation of the oil and gas properties of Gridoil was accurate, that company had a surplus instead of a substantial deficit.\nPorter J.A. remarks:\nDowngraded as Gridoil was by the contents of the circular, many shareholders may well have elected to stay away from the meeting and take their loss.\nA further and in my opinion a very important consideration is the fact that in the Gridoil proxy statement there was no mention of a $2,000,000 allowance under the Income Tax Act which could be deducted from income before the imposition of tax. But, in the statement which went to the Norcan shareholders, this item is not overlooked but rather is emphasized in the following terms:\nTax credits of some $2,000,000 resulting from drilling and exploration expenditure incurred by Gridoil in prior years may be used by the amalgamated company under certain circumstances against future taxable income as it is expected that no income tax would be payable by the amalgamated company for a number of years.\nThis omission from the Gridoil proxy statement was explained by William L. James in his affidavit sworn on April 17, 1964:\n28. The above mentioned second sentence concerning the tax credit was not included in the President's letter to the shareholders of Gridoil for the following reasons:\nOn the basis of their discussion with the S.E.C. officials Gridoil's representatives were satisfied that the S.E.C. would not permit the inclusion of the said sentence in the President's letter to the shareholders. Furthermore the unclaimed drilling and exploration expenditures were not considered to be a significant factor in the valuations, as it was anticipated that the amalgamated company in the normal course of its operations would create large tax deductions in its own right, and it was questionable whether the tax credits of Gridoil would ever have any value to the amalgamated company. In the result, these Gridoil tax credits have to date had no value to the amalgamated company. In its first fiscal period (February 19, 1963 to December 31, 1963), the amalgamated company incurred drilling and exploration expenditures of some $860,000 in excess of its taxable income without using any of Gridoil's unclaimed expenditures. The directors have approved a drilling and exploration budget of $1,700,000 for 1964 which is considerably more than the credits which can be used in that year. The prevailing general practice in dealing with the acquisition of this type of tax credits is to value them on the basis of 5 cents to 10 cents on the dollar provided that they will be required as a deduction from taxable income in the near future. Because the Gridoil tax credits may never be required by the amalgamated company their value is considerably less than five cents on the dollar. Therefore they were not considered a significant factor in valuing the assets of Gridoil.\nI am not convinced by that explanation. It would seem to me that the tax credit was thought sufficiently attractive to emphasize in the proxy statement to the Norcan shareholders and it is rather a sad admission if Mr. James is now permitted to come along and swear that it really wasn't of any importance at all. Secondly, I share a view which I understand was expressed by Porter J.A. during the appeal that no S.E.C. requirements or regulation should prevent shareholders in Canada having proper notice of such an important matter when considering the proposed amalgamation.\nIt is not my intention to go through all of the material in great detail. I may summarize by saying that I am convinced that the shareholders of Gridoil had far less accurate information or explanation than they were entitled to in order to permit them to come to an intelligent judgment as to whether or not they should vote in favour of the proposed amalgamation and for that reason I am ready to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta.\nI turn now to three preliminary matters brought up by counsel for the appellants. Firstly, the appellant alleges that the respondent lost any right to prosecute his appeal to the Appellate Division of Alberta because he had in September of 1963 purchased 3,000 shares of stock in the amalgamated company. These shares were purchased on the market and were not the purchase of treasury shares from the amalgamated company. Counsel cites in support of that view, Verschures Creameries Ltd. v. Hull and Netherlands Steamship Co. Ltd.[6]; Honey Dew Ltd. v. Ryan et al.[7], and Banque des Marchands de Moscou (Koupetschesky) v. Kindersley et al.[8] and seeks to distinguish Lissenden v. Bosch Ltd.[9]. Having considered those cases and others, I am of the opinion that the present situation does not exhibit an example of a person who had an election between two different courses and who could therefore choose either but who could not choose both. When Fogler purchased shares of the amalgamated company on the open market, he was simply investing in those shares for whatever they were worth and wasn't in any way electing to approve the transaction which he now attacks.\nThe second matter urged by way of preliminary objection, is that the Appellate Division erred in allowing the appeal from the Honourable Mr. Justice Cairns on the basis that that order was made by the learned judge as a persona designata and that under the provisions of the Alberta Extra-curial Orders Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 105, s. 7, no appeal lies from the judgment, order, or decision of a judge under s. 2 of the Act unless an appeal is expressly authorized by the Act giving the jurisdiction or special leave to appeal is granted by the said judge or judge of the Supreme Court. Section 140a of the Alberta Companies Act gives no such right of appeal and no leave was obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nSection 140a(5) of the Alberta Companies Act provides:\nWhere the amalgamation agreement is deemed to have been adopted the amalgamating companies may, if a copy of the agreement has been submitted to the Registrar and approved in writing by him, apply to the court for an order approving the amalgamation.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nSubsections (6), (7) and (8) continue to deal with the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164, in s. 26(b) (iv) provides that the Appellate Division has jurisdiction and power subject to the provisions of the rules of the court to hear and determine\n(iv) all appeals or motions in the nature of appeals respecting a judgment, order, or decision of (A) a judge of the Supreme Court.\nI accept the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Re Hynes and Schwartz[10], that when a judge is given juris- diction to make a decision, in that case on an appeal from the architects' board, and no right of appeal is given in the statute then the only appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal may be by virtue of The Judges' Orders Enforcement Act (the counterpart in Ontario of The Extra-curial Orders Act of Alberta), and Cook v. Westgate[11], that it is elementary law that there no right of appeal exists unless it is given by statute. I am, however, of the opinion that the matter was settled by the decision of this Court in Esso Standard (Inter-America) Inc. v. J. W. Enterprises Inc.[12], where the Court by dismissing the appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, reported as Re International Petroleum Ltd.[13], approved the jurisdiction of that Court. There, the Court was considering the provisions of s. 128 of the Companies Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1952, c. 23. That section in subs. (1) provided for giving notice \"in such manner as may be prescribed by the Court in the province in which the head office of the transferor company is situate\u2026\" and further provided for the jurisdiction of the Court. Nothing in the section gave a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision in first instance. Laidlaw J.A., giving judgment for the majority, said at p. 711:\nMr. Robinette submitted \"that where jurisdiction is conferred by a Dominion statute on the Supreme Court of Ontario the effect is to confer jurisdiction on both branches of the Supreme Court of Ontario with the result that the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction conferred upon it for this purpose by the Judicature Act, and that Act in s. 26(2) provides that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction as provided by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature\". I accept that submission. I think that the words \"the Court\" as used in s. 128 of the Companies Act confers jurisdiction on the High Court of Justice as one branch of the Supreme Court of Ontario and also on the Court of Appeal as the other branch of that Court, and that by virtue of s. 26 of the Judicature Act an appeal lies to this Court from the orders made in Court by Wells J., a Judge of the High Court of Justice.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nI am therefore of the opinion that the application to the Court provided in s. 140a of The Companies Act of Alberta is an application to the court exercising ordinary jurisdiction as such and is not an application to any person in the position of a persona designata, that therefore the provisions of The Extra-curial Orders Act of the Province of Alberta do not apply and that an appeal lay as of right under the provisions of s. 26 of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164. The third preliminary objection is one which presents some considerable difficulty. By r. 610 of the Alberta Rules of Court, an appeal does not operate as a stay of execution, or of proceedings under decisions appealed from, except so far as the court or judge, or master appealed from, or any judge of the Supreme Court may order, and further, no intermediate act or proceeding shall be invalidated except in so far as the court appealed from may direct. In the present case, no application was made by the appellant in the Appellate Division, here the respondent, Fogler for stay of execution. The Companies Act of Alberta in s. 140a(9) provides that the amalgamation agreement and the approving order shall be filed with the Registrar together with proof of compliance with any terms and conditions that may have been imposed by the court in approving the order. The Court did not impose any conditions. The order of Cairns J. approving the application for amalgamation was dated February 12, 1963, and was entered on February 13, 1963. The order was filed with the Registrar under the provisions of the said s. 140a(9) and the Registrar thereupon in pursuance of the said s. 140a issued a certificate dated February 18, 1963, under his seal of office certifying that Gridoil and Norcan were that day amalgamated as one company under the name Gridoil Freehold Leases Ltd. Subsection (11) of s. 140a of The Companies Act provides:\n(11) On and from the date of the certificate of amalgamation the amalgamating companies are amalgamated and are continued as one company hereinafter called the amalgamated company under the name and having the authorized capital and objects specified in the amalgamation agreement.\nSubsection (19) of the said section provides:\n(19) An amalgamated company shall for the purpose of the other provisions of this Act be deemed to have been a company incorporated under this Act within the meaning of clause (g) of s. 2 so far as the nature of an amalgamated company will permit.\nIn pursuance of the said certificate of amalgamation, the amalgamation was immediately carried in full force and effect. Neither Gridoil nor Norcan has since the date of the said certificate operated as a continuing corporation. The amalgamated company has been in full operation. By April 1, 1964, all shares of Norcan had been exchanged for the shares of the amalgamated company except 49,964 shares registered in the name of 322 shareholders. Since the amalgamation on February 18, 1963, many shares of stock of the amalgamated company have changed hands on the stock exchange and otherwise. Since that date, the amalgamated company acting in the normal course of business has acquired either alone or in participation with other companies 14,701 net acres of petroleum and natural gas rights in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan at a total cost to the amalgamated company of $503,674; has acquired 201,721 net acres of petroleum and natural gas rights in the said provinces and in the Arctic Islands by way of farm-out agreements at a cost of $54,134 and have expended the sum of $1,556,535 for drilling and development of petroleum and natural gas rights. The amalgamated companies have obtained a production loan of $800,000 from the Bank of Montreal in December 1963 of which amount the sum of $775,000 remained outstanding. It has cancelled $710,000 of Gridoil's 5 1\/2 per cent convertible sinking fund redeemable notes formerly owned by Norcan, has incurred trade obligations and liabilities in the normal course of business and the sum of $250,000 presently remains outstanding and unpaid in respect of such trade obligations and liabilities. 1,309,435 shares of Gridoil which were owned by Norcan have been cancelled in accordance with the terms of the amalgamation agreement. In view of these circumstances and under the provisions of the Alberta Companies Act hereinbefore recited, counsel for the appellant takes the position that when the respondent did not apply for any stay of proceedings and since the circumstances have so altered that the decision of the Appellate Division is vain, it is now impossible to return to the position prior to the argument of the appeal. Counsel points out that the Appellate Division did not set aside the certificate of amalgamation granted by the Registrar. It is true that Mr. Justice Porter's reasons for judgment conclude with the sentence \"the order approving the merger should therefore be set aside\".\nThe formal order of the Appellate Division simply provided:\nIt is adjudged that the appeal from the said order of the Honourable Mr. Justice J. M. Cairns be allowed and the said order be set aside. Of course the question arises whether this Court should be concerned with this problem. Rule 601 of the Rules of Court of Alberta provides in part:\nThe Court shall have power to draw inferences of fact and give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made and to make such further order or other order as the case may require.\nCounsel for the appellant in urging this objection relied, inter alia, upon Commissioner of Provincial Police v. The King ex rel. Dumont[14], where Duff C.J. said at p. 320:\nAfter the judgment of the Court of Appeal allowing the appeal the Commissioner of Police very properly complied with the order and delivered up the licences and number plates. The argument on behalf of the appellant in support of the Commissioner's authority being as I have said quite without substance I think a reasonable interpretation of what occurred is that the Commissioner acquiesced in the judgment of the Court that the suspension was invalid and that he was not entitled to retain the licence and number plates. From that point of view, the appeal has no practical object. Even if the appellant's technical objection to the proceedings by way of mandamus had been well founded, the licences and number plates would still remain in the hands of the respondent; the purported suspension would still remain a void act and the only question for discussion on appeal would be the academic technical question with regard to the propriety of proceedings by mandamus and the question of costs.\nI am of the opinion that this decision is not in pari materia. At the time the Appellate Division heard the appeal of the present respondent, the amalgamation order was in effect and was being complied with. The appeal was therefore not academic and the Appellate Division, in my view, had the right to make the order which it did make.\nIn The King ex rel. Tolfree v. Clark[15], this Court refused leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario affirming the dismissal by Hope J. of an application in the nature of quo warranto for an order that the respondents show cause why they did unlawfully exercise or usurp the office and liberties of a member of the legislature of Ontario. After the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the then present legislative assembly had been dissolved. Duff C.J. said at p. 72:\nAdmittedly the application by way of quo warranto was for the purpose of obtaining a judicial pronouncement upon the validity of the statute of 1942 extending the life of the Legislative Assembly, as well as section 3 of the Legislative Assembly Act. Nevertheless, the direct and immediate object of the proceeding was to obtain a judgment fore- judging and excluding the respondents from sitting and exercising the functions of members of the \"then present\" Legislative Assembly; and obviously, the Legislative Assembly having been dissolved since the delivery of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, such a judgment could not now be executed and could have no direct and immediate practical effect as between the parties except as to costs. It is one of those cases where, the state of facts to which the proceedings in the lower Courts related and upon which they were founded having ceased to exist, the sub-stratum of the litigation has disappeared.\nAgain, the situation in that case was not as in the present case; the amalgamation was approved by Cairns J. and at the time of the decision in the Appellate Division and now is in full effect. In Coca-Cola Company of Canada v. Mathews[16], this Court refused to entertain an appeal where the amount of the judgment was $350 plus costs of the trial, and the parties had agreed that the appellant would pay to the respondent the amount of the judgment and costs in any event of the result of the appeal to this Court.\nIn my view, there is no reason for allowing the appeal and affirming the order of Cairns J. All that is involved in this appeal is the question of whether that order was properly made. I agree with the Appellate Division that it was not so made. What the consequences of this may be is a matter which perhaps should be determined by the Supreme Court of Alberta and that Court would appear to have such power under r. 601 supra. For this Court to allow the appeal would involve the restoration of the order of Cairns J. and that would be a gross injustice to minority shareholders who might well have proceedings in contemplation or even under way. Their rights should not be foreclosed or even in any way affected by any judgment of this Court allowing an appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division which I believe was a correct decision.\nThe order of Cairns J. approving the amalgamation agreement did not order the proponents of the scheme to do anything. They took the responsibility of filing the amalgamation agreement and order with the Registrar after their solicitor had been served with a notice of appeal and after that notice of appeal had been filed. There was a right of appeal to the Appellate Division. It is no answer to say when that appeal was successful that nothing could be done and that the dissenting shareholder must accept an accomplished fact even when he did not apply for a stay. I therefore am of the opinion that this Court should dismiss the appeal and then the respondent will have to take such proceedings as he deems fit to effect the remedy he desires, such proceedings being in the Courts of Alberta.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed, no order as to costs, JUDSON and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Arnold & Crawford, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Prothroe, Gibbs, McCruden & Hilland, Calgary.\n[1] (1964), 47 W.W.R. 257, 43 D.L.R.

B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to s. 25(b) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 38. At the trial after the indictment was read and before a plea was entered, the appellant moved to have the indictment quashed for duplicity. The County Court judge quashed the indictment on that ground. The basis for his judgment being that by the definition in s. 14.012 of the regulations, \u201cdead animals\u201d could mean either animals not properly killed or diseased animals. The Crown then moved for an order of mandamus directing the County Court judge or some other judge of the County Court to proceed with the trial on the indictment as framed. The order was granted and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court, and argued that mandamus did not lie in this case, and secondly, that the indictment was void for duplicity.\nHeld (Cartwright and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Judson and Ritchie JJ.: There was no duplicity on the face of the indictment. It charged only the one offence of selling dead animals, and regulation B.14.012 did no more than define two different modes of committing the same offence. The phrase \u201cdead animals\u201d was not a synonym for meat. A butcher sells meat, not \u201cdead animals\u201d.\nMandamus was available to the Crown in this case. The cases of Re McLeod v. Amiro, 27 O.L.R. 232, R. v. Justices of Middlesex (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516 and R. v. Hannah and MacLean, 77 C.C.C. 32, did not touch the problem in the present case where the indictment was quashed before plea and no trial was held. The trial judge can be compelled to give a decision on the merits and it was no answer to such an application to say that he had exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the indictment and that such a decision could not be reviewed. The trial judge had the power to deal with the form of the indictment and he was acting within his jurisdiction when he erroneously quashed the indictment. He was there to try the charge. It was proper, in the circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The phrase \u201cdead animal\u201d is, for the purpose of the regulations, given two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings. The indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of that phrase were set out in it. Regulation B.14.010, read, as it must be to render it intelligible, with the definition of \u201cdead animal\u201d, creates two distinct offences and not one offence which could be committed in two modes. The indictment was therefore void for duplicity.\nOn the assumption that the trial judge\u2019s decision that the indictment was void for duplicity was wrong in law, mandamus did not lie.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: There is no doubt that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy by which a superior Court may direct any inferior tribunal to do some particular thing which appertains to its duty and which it has declined to do, and where, as in the present case, there is no other remedy available. But the argument of the Crown that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear this case on the merits, could not be supported. The trial judge did not decline jurisdiction but accepted it and, as part of the legal merits of the case, found that the indictment was void for duplicity. His decision was a decision upon the legal merits. Consequently, mandamus to compel him to do his duty did not lie despite the fact that the lower Courts were of the opinion that he was in error in the performance of his duty.\nThe indictment, furthermore, was void for duplicity.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the granting of an order of mandamus by Grant J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Spence JJ. dissenting. J.R. Maurice Gautreau, for the appellant.\nT.D. MacDonald, Q.C., and Arthur C. Whealy, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant Raymond Joseph Kipp was charged with the offence of selling as food, dead animals or parts thereof in violation of the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. He was committed for trial after a preliminary hearing and he elected to be tried under Part XVI of the Criminal Code by a judge without a jury.\nAt the trial after the indictment was read and before a plea was entered by the appellant, his counsel objected to the form of the indictment. The County Court Judge quashed the indictment on the sole ground that it was void for duplicity. The Crown then moved for an order of mandamus directing the County Court Judge or some other Judge of the County Court Judges\u2019 Criminal Court for the County of Carleton to proceed with the trial of the accused on the indictment as framed. Grant J. made this order and also set aside the quashing of the indictment[1]. The Court of Appeal affirmed the order of Grant J. Kipp now appeals with leave of this Court.\nI agree with Grant J. that this indictment is not void for duplicity. It reads as follows:\nThat he, the said Raymond Joseph Kipp, between the 9th day of August, A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D. 1961, at the then Town of Eastview in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts thereof in violation of Section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations made by Order-in-Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the 8th December, 1954, as amended by Order-in-Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July, 1961, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b) of Section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act, Statutes of Canada 1952-53, Chapter 38.\nRegulation 14.010 simply provides that \u201cNo person shall sell as food a dead animal or any part thereof.\u201d\n\u201cDead animal\u201d is defined in Regulation B.14.012 as follows:\nB.14.012 For the purpose of Section B.14.010 and B.14.011, \u201cdead animal\u201d means a dead animal that (a) was not killed for the purpose of food in accordance with commonly accepted practise of killing animals for the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or\n(b) was affected with disease at the time it was killed.\nTo me it is plain that there is no duplicity on the face of this indictment. It charges only the one offence of selling dead animals or parts thereof, and Regulation B.14.012 does no more than define two different modes of committing the same offence. I cannot accept the phrase \u201cdead animals\u201d as a synonym for meat. A butcher sells meat, not \u201cdead animals\u201d.\nIt is common ground that the Crown has no right of appeal from this erroneous quashing of the indictment. The only remaining question is whether an order of mandamus should issue directing the County Court Judge to proceed with the trial. Again, for the reasons given by Grant J., I am of the opinion that it should.\nThe appellant relies on Re McLeod v. Amiro[2]; The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex[3]; and Rex v. Hanna & McLean[4]. These are cases involving appeals from summary convictions which in the opinion of the reviewing court were finally but erroneously decided on the merits. The cases merely hold that such decisions are not reviewable by way of mandamus. They do not touch the problem in the present case where an indictment is quashed before plea and no trial is held. All that the Crown is seeking is an order directing the County Court Judge to proceed with the trial. If he proceeds with the trial and gives a decision, that decision is open to appeal and is not reviewable on mandamus. But he can be compelled to give a decision on the merits and it is no answer to such an application to say that he has exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the indictment and that such a decision cannot be reviewed.\nThe use of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d in this context does not help one towards a solution. There is no dispute that the judge had the power to deal with the form of the indictment and that he was acting within his jurisdiction when he quashed the indictment. But he made an error in quash- ing this indictment. He was there to try the charge. As the matter stands now, unless the order of mandamus issues, the case as framed cannot be tried and it should be so tried. It is proper, in the circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus. I approve of the reasons of Grant J. on this point in their entirety[5].\nI would dismiss the appeal. This being an indictable offence, there can be no order as to costs either here or in the Court of Appeal.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The proceedings in the courts below out of which this appeal arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence.\nTwo questions were fully argued before us, (i) whether in the circumstances mandamus lies, and (ii) whether the learned County Court Judge erred in holding that the indictment was void for duplicity.\nOn the first of these questions I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence. As he points out, the decision that mandamus does not lie renders it unnecessary, for the disposition of this appeal, to deal with the second question; I think, however, that it is desirable to express an opinion upon it because if this appeal be allowed the respondent will be free to prefer a new indictment in the same words as that which was quashed by Gibson C.C.J. and the Judge before whom it comes for trial, in the absence of any expression by this Court, would, no doubt, follow the judgment of Grant J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, holding that the indictment as framed was not void for duplicity.\nThe wording of the indictment is set out in full in the reasons of my brother Spence. The important words are:\n\u2026did unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations\u2026\nRegulation B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations reads as follows:\nB.14.010\u2014No person shall sell as food a dead animal or any part thereof. The phrase \u201cdead animal\u201d is defined in Regulation B.14.012 which reads as follows:\nB.14.012 For the purpose of sections B.14.010 and B.14.011, \u201cdead animal\u201d means a dead animal that\n(a) was not killed for the purpose of food in accordance with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or\n(b) was affected with disease at the time it was killed.\nIt is obvious that the words of Regulation B.14.010, standing alone, cannot have been intended to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. The words are clear and simple English words; they are unambiguous and if applied literally would bring about the result that every retail dealer in the country commits an indictable offence whenever he makes a sale of meat to a customer. Butchers do not sell parts of live animals.\nThe definition section, quoted above, makes this plain. The phrase \u201cdead animal\u201d is, for the purpose of the regulation, given two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings. I agree with Gibson C.C.J. that the indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of the phrase \u201cdead animal\u201d were set out in it. So read, the words of the charge to which the appellant was called upon to plead were as follows:\n\u2026did unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts thereof which were not killed for the purpose of food in accordance with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or which were affected with disease at the time they were killed.\nThe question is whether these words describe but one offence which may be committed in two modes or describe two different offences.\nCounsel for the respondent relies on ss. 492 and 500 of the Criminal Code, which, so far as relevant read as follows:\n492 (1) Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.\n(2) The statement referred to in subsection (1) may be\u2026\n(b) in the words of the enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable offence,\u2026 (6) Nothing in this Part relating to matters that do not render a count insufficient shall be deemed to restrict or limit the application of this section.\n* * *\n500. (1) A count is not objectionable by reason only that\n(a) it charges in the alternative several different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative in an enactment that describes as an indictable offence the matters, acts or omissions charged in the count\u2026\nThe effect of the corresponding sections dealing with offences punishable on summary conviction was fully considered in the reasons of this Court in Archer v. The Queen[6] and the effect of the sections quoted above was dealt with as follows in the unanimous judgment of this Court in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[7]. After quoting the relevant portions of ss. 492 and 500 the reasons continue:\nIt is clear since the judgment of this Court in Archer v. The Queen that these provisions do not render a count good if the words of the enactment which are adopted in framing the count describe more than one offence.\nThere is no difficulty in stating the applicable principle of law; if the indictment in one count charges more than one offence it is bad for duplicity. The question as to which there is room for differences of judicial opinion is whether in a particular case the words of a count describe one offence which may be committed in different modes or describe more than one offence.\nIn the case at bar, in order to support the submission that only one offence is charged, it is necessary to define the single offence which is committed (a) when a butcher sells parts of a perfectly healthy animal killed, for example, by being run into by a motor vehicle and therefore not \u201cin accordance with commonly accepted practice\u201d and, (b) when a butcher sells parts of a diseased animal.\nGrant J. deals with this point as follows:\nHere, as in Gatto v. The King (1938) S.C.R. 423, there is only one offence charged, namely, that of selling.\nThe difficulty I have in accepting this is that selling meat, simpliciter, is not an offence at all. To suggest that there is only one offence, \u201cselling meat for food in contravention of the regulations\u201d, would be to beg the question which is whether the prohibitions as to the sale of meat for food contained in the regulations create more than one offence.\nThe one offence cannot be \u201cselling meat for food which is unfit for human consumption\u201d because as in case (a) suggested above, the flesh of an animal might be perfectly fit for human consumption but its sale nonetheless forbidden because of the manner in which it was killed.\nIn my opinion, Regulation B.14.010, read, as it must be to render it intelligible, with the definition of \u201cdead animal\u201d, creates two distinct offences and I agree with Gibson C.C.J. that the indictment was void for duplicity. It follows that I would allow the appeal.\nI base my judgment on the two grounds, (i) that Gibson C.C.J. was right in law in holding that the indictment was void for duplicity and (ii) that, even on the assumption that his decision was wrong in law, mandamus does not lie.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and of Grant J. and direct that the application for an order of mandamus stand dismissed. I would make no order as to costs in any Court.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario made on October 18, 1963, dismissing an appeal from the order of Grant J. made on May 27, 1963. By the latter order, Grant J. had issued a mandamus requiring Gibson C.C.J. to hear and determine a charge against the appellant.\nThe appellant had been charged before Gibson C.C.J. on an indictment which read as follows:\nthat he did, between the 9th day of August, A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D. 1961, at the then Town of Eastview in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations made by Order in. Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the 8th December, 1954, as amended by Order in Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July, 1961, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b) of section 25 of the Food and Drugs Act, Statutes of Canada 1952-53, Chapter 38,\nOn the commencement of the trial before Gibson C.C.J. counsel for the appellant raised two points of law:\n(1) whether the indictment is void for duplicity, and (2) whether the pertinent regulations were in force during the time covered by the alleged offence or offences.\nCounsel later withdrew the second objection but after argument Gibson C.C.J., in written reasons, allowed the first objection and concluded his judgment with the words \u201cthe bill of indictment is, therefore, quashed\u201d.\nCounsel for the appellant in this Court based his appeal upon two propositions: firstly, that mandamus does not lie when the trial judge quashes an indictment on the preliminary objection that the charge is void for duplicity, and secondly, that the charge being void for duplicity, even had Grant J. jurisdiction, he should not have allowed the mandamus.\nIt is my purpose in these reasons to deal only with the first ground as I am of the opinion that is sufficient to dispose of the appeal to this Court.\nCounsel for the Attorney General of Ontario submits in reply to the first ground the following propositions: firstly, that mandamus, generally speaking, lies to compel the execution of a public duty where no other specific remedy for enforcing the performance of that duty exists. Secondly, that in the present case there is no other remedy available. Thirdly, that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear a case on the merits where he has wrongly declined jurisdiction on a preliminary point of law, notwithstanding that his decision therein can be judicial in character.\nThere can be no doubt that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy by which the superior Court may direct any inferior tribunal to do some particular thing which appertains to its duty and which it has declined to do: The Queen et al. v. Leong Ba Chai[8]; Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 2, pp. 84-5.\nThe writ will not issue when there is other specific remedy available: The Queen v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[9], (in Re Nathan 1884). It would appear that in the present case there is no other remedy available for the reconsideration of the judgment of Gibson C.C.J. As I have said, he concluded his judgment by quashing the bill of indictment. The sole right of appeal by the Attorney-General is found in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code and it is \u201cagainst a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court\u2026\u201d\nIn Regina v. Leveille[10], the accused, a married woman, although only 16 years of age, was charged with having stolen goods in her possession. When she came before the municipal court her counsel moved that she should be tried in the Social Welfare Court due to her age despite her marital status. The judge upheld the motion and declined jurisdiction. Rinfret J. at p. 99, said:\n(I quote the translation from page 100):\nIt is clear from the judgment of the Municipal Court judge, at p. 10 of the record, that this was not a judgment of acquittal.\nThe consequence is unavoidable: in the circumstances the Crown has no right of appeal.\nIn Rex v. Hansher and Burgess[11], a County Court judge in general sessions quashed the indictment. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal. Masten J.A., at p. 74, said:\nThe nature and effect of the order in question appears to be procedural merely and does not acquit the accused of the charge which stands against him and the Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a new indictment: R. v. Bainbridge (1918) 30 C.C.C. 214 at 231.\nThe Attorney-General\u2019s difficulty is in the support of his third proposition. In Re McLeod v. Amiro[12], Riddell J. considered an application by way of mandamus to compel a division court judge to reopen an appeal from a police magistrate\u2019s conviction and to hear and adjudicate upon the same. When the appeal before the division court judge commenced, counsel for the appellant took objection to the information as insufficient in form and substance. No evidence was taken and the division court judge acceded to the argument of counsel for the appellant and allowed the appeal on the sole ground that the information was insufficient. At p. 234, Riddell J. said:\nIt is, of course, contended in the present case that if the Court below decides on a preliminary point without going into the merits, there is no real decision on the case, and mandamus will lie.\nNo doubt\u2014but we must be sure that the point upon which the decision rested was preliminary in reality and not on the merits.\nIt is in the view that what the learned judge decided was preliminary, that both the applicant and his solicitor swear that \u201cthere was no argu- ment before the said judge of the legal merits of the case\u2014the only question being argued was the question of the insufficiency of the information and complaint\u201d. And, it is pointed out that the Code (sec. 753) expressly provides that no judgment shall be given in favour of the applicant upon an objection to the information and complaint which objection was not taken before the magistrate. The learned Judge was, in my opinion, wrong in the view he took of the appeal (I am of course speaking only upon the material before me, and the facts may be quite different); but he has the same power to go wrong that any other Judge has.\nThat such a decision is not on a matter preliminary, but on the merits, is, to my mind, quite clear.\nIn coming to that conclusion, Riddell J. relied upon the well-known and oft-quoted case of The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex[13]. There, the appellant had been convicted before a metropolitan police magistrate under a charge of breach of a statute which made punishable as a rogue and vagabond \u201cevery person\u2026using any subtle craft or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose on any of His Majesty\u2019s subjects\u201d. The conviction described the offence omitting the words \u201cby palmistry or otherwise\u201d. On appeal to the Middlesex Sessions, counsel for the appellant commenced with an objection that the omission of the above words made the conviction bad. The justices after hearing the point argued retired and on their return the assistant judge gave, it was alleged contrary to the view of the majority, a decision quashing the conviction on the objection taken against it. An application was made for a mandamus but the court composed of Mellor J. and Lush J. dismissed\nHowever, they declined to adopt either course and I think they are not the application. Mellor J., at p. 520, having discussed the remedy of mandamus, said: amenable to our control, for they have exercised their jurisdiction, and it is a cardinal rule when jurisdiction is vested in magistrates or any body of men, which they may exercise so long as they act within their authority, that however erroneously they decide, we cannot supervise their decision.\nLush J. said at p. 521:\nThey returned, and they found the conviction bad on the face of it. That is a decision upon the legal merits of the case. If they decided upon the merits of the appeal, the legal merits, or the merits of the matters of fact, we cannot order them to rescind that decision. We are not a Court of Appeal from decisions of the magistrates, and, however erroneously they may have decided, we have no power to interfere. Those two judgments have been followed in a series of cases in the Courts throughout Canada. The judgment in McLeod v. Amiro has been criticized and counsel for the Attorney\u2011General in this Court sought to distinguish it on the ground that it was an appeal while the decision of the learned county court judge in this case was at trial, but I can see no valid distinction here as despite the fact that it was an appeal the appeal took the form of a trial de novo in the McLeod case. Again, it is submitted, the McLeod case was the decision of a single judge and against the weight of authority; it was, however, the decision of Riddell J., a very great judge, and has been quoted and adopted by many courts of appeal and by this Court: Re Ault[14]; Re Sigurdson[15]; Re R. v. Spiers[16]; R. v. Stacpoole[17]; R. v. Lebrecque et al.[18]\nAlthough it was decided upon consent and without argument on behalf of the accused, at p. 234 Riddell J. said: \u201cAmiro, through his counsel, consents: and a consent is also filed signed by the learned Judge,\u201d in my view, that certainly does not lessen the authority of the decision. Counsel who applied for the grant of the mandamus was present and evidently argued it extensively. Finally, it is said that the decision was overruled by Regina ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall[19].\nIn the latter case, the accused was charged before the magistrate with a breach of s. 400 of the Air Regulations. On the opening of the accused\u2019s trial, his counsel made an objection that the charge was barred by s. 693 (2) of the Code as it had been laid more than 6 months after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose. Counsel for the informant submitted that the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 23, providing for a 12-months\u2019 limitation was the effective provision. After hearing argument the magistrate reserved his decision, accused pleaded not guilty, and evidence was taken. The magistrate later delivered reasons that because of the Code, s. 693(2), he lacked jurisdiction to try the accused and he endorsed the information \u201cno jurisdiction\u201d. The informant appealed to the county court of the County of York and his appeal was dismissed on the ground that no appeal lay. The Attorney-General for Ontario obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario and on that appeal Morden J. said at p. 79:\nThe right of appeal from summary convictions is one created by statute and is of strict law, and unless such a right is clearly given, it does not exist.\nAnd at p. 80, speaking of the judgment of Cartwright J. in this Court in R. v. Karpinski[20]:\nIn any event in that case the magistrate did not decline jurisdiction as was done here and I am unable to equate a denial of jurisdiction with an acquittal.\nIn view of my opinion that no appeal lay to the County Court from the Magistrate\u2019s ruling, it is unnecessary, in fact it would be improper, to decide the second question upon which leave was granted to appeal to this Court.\nAnd at p. 81:\nIf the Magistrate persists in his opinion that he has no jurisdiction, then mandamus would be the proper remedy\u2026\nThe learned justice in appeal cited a number of cases, inter alia, McLeod v. Amiro, but did not indicate whether he disagreed or agreed with those decisions.\nIn my view, the distinction between the present case on one hand and Regina ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall and the many other cases cited by counsel for the Ontario Attorney-General is that in each of the latter the court declined jurisdiction and did so usually in express words. In the present case, the court accepted jurisdiction. It was an ordinary case of a trial of an indictable offence where there had been a proper commitment for trial on preliminary hearing. The trial judge, Gibson C.C.J., commenced the trial and as part of the legal merits of the case found that the indictment was void for duplicity. Therefore, the decision in The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex was applicable. There the justices allowed the appeal because the conviction was bad on the fact of it; as Lush J. said, \u201cThat is a decision upon the legal merits of the case\u201d. I am of the opinion that those words are exactly applicable to the actions of Gibson C.C.J. in this case. His decision was a decision upon the legal merits. Therefore, the learned county court judge having accepted jurisdiction and acted on it, mandamus to compel him to do his duty does not lie despite the fact that Grant J. and the Court of Appeal for Ontario were of the opinion that he was in error in the performance of his duty.\nAs Riddell J. said in McLeod v. Amiro at p. 236:\nIt makes no difference if the learned Judge misconstrued sec. 753 of the Code\u2014he has the power, untrammelled by me, to make mistakes: and I can find no reason why a misconception of the meaning of a statute is any worse than a misconception of a common law principle or equitable rule.\nMcDonald J.A. in the British Columbia Court of Appeal said in Rex v. Hanna & McLean[21]:\nWhen a Court has entered upon a case and has given a decision, however outrageous, it seems to me impossible to say it has refused jurisdiction. To take that course is simply to sit in appeal on a tribunal and to make mandamus another form of appeal. Although, as stated above, Courts have often taken that course, I think that on the weight of authority it cannot be justified. In order to justify awarding a mandamus to a County Court Judge who has given a judgment, however absurd, the Court must say that his judgment is no judgment, but a complete nullity\u2026 In my opinion the County Court Judge has jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of this appeal; he did enter upon it; he was entirely wrong I think, in the course he took, for the plain intention of the Criminal Code is that he ought to have tried the case on the merits. Nevertheless, I have concluded that Robertson J., for the reasons given in his judgment and on the authorities above mentioned, was right in holding that he was powerless to compel the Judge in those proceedings to do otherwise than he has done.\nIn that case, the respondent had been convicted by a police magistrate on the charge of dangerous driving. He appealed to the County Court judge pursuant to the provisions of the Code and when the appeal came on he moved to quash on the ground that the evidence as disclosed by the magistrate\u2019s notes did not justify the conviction. The County Court judge looked at the depositions, refused Crown\u2019s counsel the right to call witnesses and quashed the conviction on that ground.\nIn Dressler v. Tallman Gravel & Sand Supply Ltd.[22], the appellant laid an information against his employer under The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20, charg- ing that the respondent had unlawfully failed to pay him overtime rates. Upon the matter coming on before the magistrate for trial, he, without hearing any evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the ground that the information was in reference to an offence which took place more than six months before the institution of proceedings and also that the information was void for duplicity. The employee appealed by way of stated case and the respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that no appeal lay and that the appellant\u2019s proper procedure was to move for mandamus. By majority decision in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba the respondent\u2019s motion was granted and the stated case quashed. On appeal to this Court, the court adopted the dissenting judgment of Tritschler J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. Locke J. giving the judgment of the Court quoted from the judgment of the learned justice in appeal and said at p. 569:\nAs to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way of stated case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds of law which appeared to him sufficient.\nWith these conclusions, I agree and, with the greatest respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the stated case, as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.\nIn the present case, I am of the opinion that the learned County Court judge did not decline his jurisdiction but accepted it and that therefore no mandamus lies. To the objection that this will result in there being no way of reviewing the allegedly erroneous decision of the County Court judge, it must be pointed out that such result need not be fatal. As was said by Masten J.A. at p. 174, in Rex v. Hansher & Burgess, supra, the Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a new indictment. Boyd J. in Re Ratcliffe v. Crescent Mills & Timber Company[23] said at p. 333:\nThat the plaintiff has no right of appeal in this case under the Division Courts Act may be a defect of legislation but it does not enlarge the remedy by mandamus. And in High, on Extra-Ordinary Remedies, 3rd ed., at p. 186, the learned author states:\nSo when a court of appellate jurisdiction has dismissed an appeal, upon the ground that the act allowing appeals in such cases was unconstitutional and void, the writ will not go to compel the court to revise its actions and to reinstate the appeal. And this is true, even though the party aggrieved may have no other remedy to review the action of the court, since the absence of another adequate or specific remedy is not of itself ground for relief by mandamus. (The underlining is my own.)\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal.\nSince drafting these reasons I have had the opportunity of perusing the reasons of my brother Cartwright. I agree with his conclusion that the indictment was void for duplicity and I concur in the disposition of the appeal which he proposes.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMichael, Wentzell & Gautreau, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur Whealy, Ottawa.\n[1] [1963] 3 C.C.C. 72, 40 C.R. 366.\n[2] (1912), 27 O.L.R. 232, 25 C.C.C. 230, 8 D.L.R. 726.\n[3] (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516.\n[4] (1941), 57 B.C.R. 52, 77 C.C.C. 32, 3 W.W.R. 753, 4 D.L.R. 584.\n[5] [1963] 3 C.C.C. 72, 40 C.R. 366.\n[6] [1955] S.C.R. 33, 20 C.R. 181, 110 C.C.C. 321, 2 D.L.R. 621.\n[7] [1963] S.C.R. 500 at 517, 40 C.R. 52, 2 C.C.C. 148.\n[8] [1954] S.C.R. 10, 1 D.L.R. 401.\n[9] (1884), 12 Q.B.D. 461.\n[10] (1960), 32 C.R. 98.\n[11] [1940] O.R. 247, 74 C.C.C. 73, 3 D.L.R. 478.\n[12] (1912), 27 O.L.R. 232, 25 C.C.C. 230, 8 D.L.R. 726.\n[13] (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516.\n[14] (1956), 18 W.W.R. 428, 24 C.R. 260, 115 C.C.C. 132.\n[15] (1915), 25 Man.

The apparent purpose of such examination related to the respondent's own return of income and not to the returns of any of his clients, and it was not inspired by any suggestion of improper conduct on his part. The permission was refused on the ground that a solicitor and client privilege existed. There was no waiver by any of the clients of their privilege. The procedure laid down in s. 126A of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, was followed, and the books and records were seized, sealed and placed in the custody of the sheriff. The respondent then applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the determination of the question whether his clients had a solicitor-client privilege in respect of those books and records. The Court ruled that such a privilege did exist in respect of all the documents and they were ordered returned to the respondent. An appeal from this decision was quashed by the Court of Appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Deputy Attorney General then applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the trial judge's order and, alternatively, for leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal. Held: Both applications should be dismissed.\nSection 126A of the Income Tax Act was a complete code in itself for deciding the question of solicitor-client privilege relative to documents of a client in the possession of a solicitor. The section, which contains no provision for an appeal, contemplates a speedy determination of the issue of the claim of privilege and thereafter a prompt delivery of possession of the document involved, either to the solicitor or to the officer of the Department. Once that has been done the whole matter has not only been determined, but completed and any order which could be made on an appeal, assuming that an appeal lies, could not have a direct and immediate practical effect, as the document would no longer be in the hands of the custodian. If the order directed delivery to the officer, he would, by the time the appeal was heard, have had the opportunity to inspect it. If delivery was ordered to be made to the solicitor, the Act contains no provision requiring him to surrender it again to the officer or to the custodian.\nAPPLICATIONS by the Crown for leave to appeal from a judgment of Sullivan J. of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,[1] and from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.[2] Applications dismissed.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., for the applicant.\nC. C. Locke, Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014Two applications have been made by the Deputy Attorney General of Canada (hereinafter referred to as \"the applicant\") for leave to appeal to this Court, pursuant to s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe respondent, Eric Brown, is a barrister and solicitor, practising his profession in the City of Vancouver. On August 24, 1962, an officer of the Department of National Revenue attended at his office and asked him for permission to examine his trust account books and records kept by him. The apparent purpose of such examination related to the respondent's own return of income and not to the returns of any of his clients.\nIt should be stated at the outset that it is clear that the respondent is a barrister and solicitor in good standing and of high repute and that the proposed examination was not inspired by any suggestion of improper conduct on his part, but was to be made in the course of what both counsel described as a \"spot check\" of lawyers' records.\nAfter considering the request, the respondent refused permission, on the ground that his clients had a solicitor and client privilege in respect of those books and records. The officer thereupon seized the documents in question, placed them in a sealed package, which was marked for identification, and then delivered them into the custody of the sheriff of the County of Vancouver.\nOn September 5, 1962, the respondent applied, pursuant to the provisions of s. 126A of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended, for the determination of the question whether the clients had a solicitor and client privilege in respect of the documents which had been seized. He also communicated to the Minister of National Revenue, as he was required to do by subs. (14) of that section, the names and addresses of the clients last known to him in respect of whom the privilege had been claimed. This list contained the names and addresses of all the respondent's clients for whom he held funds in trust.\nThe Minister did not communicate with any of the persons whose names were contained in the list to advise that a claim of privilege had been made on his behalf and to afford an opportunity of waiving the privilege as contemplated by subs. (14). The reason was the highly laudable one that such a communication, addressed to each of the respondent's clients for whom he held trust funds, would, in all likelihood, have had a serious effect upon the respondent's standing with his clients. In the result, however, none of the respondent's clients was aware of a claim of privilege having been made on his behalf, unless the respondent communicated with them, as to which there is no evidence before us.\nThe matter came on for hearing before Sullivan J., who held that a solicitor and client privilege did exist in respect of all the documents in question and who ordered, pursuant to subs. (5) (b) (i) of s. 126A, that the sealed package be delivered by the sheriff to the respondent forthwith. The learned judge found that the privilege existed with respect to all of the contents of the respondent's trust account books and records and he did not deem it necessary, in the light of the evidence adduced at the hearing, to inspect them.\nApplication for leave to appeal from the order[3] of Sullivan J., which was made on September 24, 1962, was made to this Court by notice filed on December 6, 1962. Upon it appearing that an appeal had been taken from the order to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, that application was adjourned. Thereafter the Court of Appeal[4], upon a motion to quash the appeal launched by the respondent, quashed the appeal, on the ground that the Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, it being the view of the majority that in hearing the application Sullivan J. was acting as persona designata and there was no statutory provision for any appeal from his decision.\nThe applicant has now renewed its application for leave to appeal from the decision of Sullivan J., as being a decision of the \"highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed\", within the wording of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. Alternatively, the applicant now seeks leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia that it did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the order of Sullivan J.\nIn so far as the latter application is concerned, despite the fact that the application for leave has been made, counsel for both parties submitted that no appeal did lie to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia because, this being a statute enacted by the Federal Parliament, a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia could only have been given by the terms of a Federal statute and no such right had been provided. Whether or not that submission is sound was not determined in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, which reached its decision for different reasons, and, for the reasons hereinafter given, I do not think it is necessary to decide it here.\nSection 125 of the Income Tax Act requires every person carrying on a business and every taxpayer to keep proper books and records of account. Section 126 enables a person, authorized by the Minister of National Revenue, to examine the books and records and any account, voucher, letter, telegram or other document which relates, or may relate, to information that is, or should be, in the books or records, or the amount of tax payable under the Act.\nSection 126A was enacted in 1956, by c. 39 of the Statutes of Canada of that year, and it deals with documents which are in the possession of a solicitor for which he claims a solicitor and client privilege. The extent of that privilege depends upon the law of the province in which the document is situated. The section provides for the placing of the documents, in a sealed package, in the possession of a custodian and for a speedy reference of the issue, as to the existence of the privilege claimed, to a judge of a superior court having jurisdiction in the province where the matter arises, or to a judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThe judge who hears the application must hear it in camera and he is required to deal with it summarily. He is further required to order either that the document in question be delivered by the custodian to the solicitor, if he holds that a privilege exists, or be delivered to an officer, or a person designated by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, if he holds that a privilege does not exist.\nThe section contemplates, not only a decision as to the existence of a solicitor and client privilege, but also a disposition of the custody of the document involved, in accordance with that decision.\nThe section contains no provision for an appeal.\nThe relevant provisions of s. 126A are as follows:\n126A. (1) In this section\n***\n(b) \"custodian\" means a person in whose custody a package is placed pursuant to subsection (3) ;\n***\n(e) \"solicitor-client privilege\" means the right, if any, that a person has in a superior court in the province where the matter arises to refuse to disclose an oral or documentary communication on the ground that the communication is one passing between him and his lawyer in professional confidence.\n***\n(3) Where an officer is about to examine or seize a document in the possession of a lawyer and the lawyer claims that a named client of his has a solicitor\u2014client privilege in respect of that document, the officer shall, without examining or making copies of the document,\n(a) seize the document and place it, together with any other document in respect of which the lawyer at the same time makes the same claim on behalf of the same client, in a package and suitably seal and identify the package; and\n(b) place the package in the custody of the sheriff of the district or county in which the seizure was made or, if the officer and the lawyer agree in writing upon a person to act as custodian, in the custody of such person.\n(4) Where a document has been seized and placed in custody under subsection (3), the client, or the lawyer on behalf of the client, may (a) within 14 days from the day the document was so placed in custody, apply, upon 3 days' notice of motion to the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, to a judge for an order\n(i) fixing a day (not later than 21 days after the date of the order) and place for the determination of the question whether the client has a solicitor-client privilege in respect of the document, and\n(ii) requiring the custodian to produce the document to the judge at that time and place;\n(b) serve a copy of the order on the Deputy Attorney General of Canada and the custodian within 6 days of the day on which it was made, and, within the same time, pay to the custodian the estimated expenses of transporting the document to and from the place of hearing and of safeguarding it; and\n(c) if he has proceeded as authorized by paragraph (b), apply, at the appointed time and place, for an order determining the question.\n(5) An application under paragraph (c) of subsection (4) shall be heard in camera, and on the application\n(a) the judge may, if he considers it necessary to determine the question, inspect the document and, if he does so, he shall ensure that it is repackaged and resealed; and\n(b) the judge shall decide the matter summarily and,\n(i) if he is of opinion that the client has a solicitor-client privilege in respect of the document, shall order the custodian to deliver the document to the lawyer, and\n(ii) if he is of opinion that the client does not have a solicitor-client privilege in respect of the document, shall order the custodian to deliver the document to the officer or some other person designated by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation,\nand he shall, at the same time, deliver concise reasons in which he shall describe the nature of the document without divulging the details thereof.\n***\n(7) The custodian shall\n(a) deliver the document to the lawyer\n(i) in accordance with a consent executed by the officer or by or on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada or the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, or\n(ii) in accordance with an order of a judge under this section; or\n(b) deliver the document to the officer or some other person designated by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation\n(i) in accordance with a consent executed by the lawyer or the client, or\n(ii) in accordance with an order of a judge under this section.\n***\n(11) The custodian shall not deliver a document to any person except in accordance with an order of a judge or a consent under this section or except to any officer or servant of the custodian for the purposes of safeguarding the document. (14) Where a lawyer has, for the purpose of subsection (2) or (3), made a claim that a named client of his has a solicitor-client privilege in respect of information or a document, he shall at the same time communicate to the Minister or some person duly authorized to act for the Minister the address of the client last known to him so that the Minister may endeavour to advise the client of the claim of privilege that has been made on his behalf and may thereby afford him an opportunity, if it is practicable within the time limited by this section, of waiving the claim of privilege before the matter comes on to be decided by a judge or other tribunal.\nI agree with the view expressed by Lord J.A., in the Court of Appeal, that, in cases to which the section is applicable,\nSection 126A is a complete code in itself for deciding the question of solicitor-client privilege relative to documents of a client in the possession of a solicitor.\nIt is, of course, clear that the privilege involved is that of the client and not the solicitor and the application to a judge for which the section provides may be made by the client, or by the lawyer on his behalf.\nThe section contemplates a speedy determination of the issue of the claim of privilege and thereafter a prompt delivery of possession of the document involved, either to the solicitor or to the officer of the Department. It seems to me that once that has been done the whole matter has been not only determined, but completed, and that any order which could be made on an appeal (assuming that an appeal lies) could not have a \"direct and immediate practical effect\", to use the words of Chief Justice Duff in The King on the Relation of Tolfree v. Clark[5]. The document in question would no longer be in the hands of the custodian. If the order appealed from directed delivery to the departmental officer, he would, by the time the appeal was heard, have had his opportunity to inspect the document. If the order appealed from directed delivery to the solicitor, the Act contains no provision which would require him, after the document has been restored to him, to surrender it again to the departmental officer or to the custodian.\nWe were advised that in the present case, following the delivery of the documents to the solicitor, pursuant to the order of Sullivan J., they were voluntarily returned to the custody of the sheriff, pending an appeal, but I do not see how such a voluntary delivery can clothe the Appellate Court with power to make a new direction regarding their disposition. They are no longer in the hands of the custodian, pursuant to subs. (3). Furthermore, the custodian, under subs. (7), is obligated to deliver the document only upon a consent, or in accordance with the order of a judge under the section.\nIn the light of the foregoing, and assuming, without deciding, that this is a case in which an appeal could be brought to this Court, I do not think that it is one in which leave should be granted.\nAssuming that the appeal were to be heard, the only issue which could be determined would be as to whether the learned judge was right in holding that the respondent was properly entitled to claim, on behalf of his clients generally, a solicitor and client privilege in respect of all his trust account records. Assuming that this Court did not agree that all such records, per se, were necessarily privileged from production, this would not finally determine the matter. It is each individual client who possesses a privilege, if one exists. Circumstances may vary and the position of each client who desired to claim privilege would still require to be considered. The order which this Court would have to make in such event would be that the position of each client of the respondent, who did not waive a claim to privilege, be examined separately and so the matter would be back practically where it started, more than two years after it began.\nIn so far as granting leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia is concerned, as previously mentioned, neither counsel contended that an appeal did lie to that Court. If leave were to be granted to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal, even if we were to reach the conclusion, on the appeal, that an appeal did lie to the Court of Appeal, the matter would then have to be referred back to that Court to hear the appeal upon the merits. Even if that appeal were to succeed, the Court of Appeal would be faced with the same problems in formulating an order as those which I have already outlined. For these reasons, in my opinion, this is not a proper case for the granting of leave to appeal to this Court and I would dismiss both applications with costs.\nApplications dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the applicant: E.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1964: May 14; 1964: May 15; 1964: October 06.\nPresent: Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nMines and minerals\u2014Petroleum and natural gas lease\u2014Ten year term and as long thereafter as oil or gas produced from leased land\u2014Where gas from gas well not sold or used royalty payment to extend lease as if gas being produced\u2014Subsequent amendment of lease providing for pooling to establish spacing unit\u2014Well drilled on pooled lands capped because of lack of market\u2014Royalty paid after expiry of ten year term\u2014Whether lease continued beyond expiration of primary term.\nBy a petroleum and natural gas lease, dated July 2, 1948, the respondent K leased the north west quarter of a certain section of land to the appellant. It was provided by cl. 2 that the lease was to be for a term of 10 years and \"as long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land hereunder \u2026\" It was further provided by cl. 3(b) that where gas from a well producing gas only was not sold or used, the appellant might pay as royalty $100 per well per year and, if it did so, it would be considered that gas was being produced within the meaning of cl. 2. The appellant filed a caveat against the land covered by the lease on July 6, 1948. In 1952 the lessor entered into a royalty trust agreement with Prudential Trust Co. as trustee, under which he assigned to the trustee a percentage of the gross royalty or share of production from any well or wells that might be drilled upon any part of the north west quarter, to be held and distributed by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the agreement.\nAt all times material since July 2, 1952, the relevant orders and regulations prescribed a spacing unit for a gas well as 640 acres, with power to the Oil and Gas Conservation Board, in a case in which, in its opinion, it was proper to do so, to prescribe a spacing unit of any size or shape or within any boundaries. On July 1, 1954, an area within which the north west quarter was situate was designated by the Board as a gas field. In that field during the months April to June, 1958, the policy of the Board was not to grant a licence for the drilling of a well unless the applicant had the right to produce from an entire spacing unit. In January 1957 the appellant entered into a contract with Trans Canada Pipe Lines Ltd., whereby it dedicated all its gas in this field obtained from the Devonian formation for sale to that company; Trans Canada, however, was not obligated to take any gas until the latter part of 1959.\nOn November 8, 1957, the lease was amended by the addition to it of cl. 14(A). Under this clause the lessee was given the right to pool or combine the land covered by the lease with other adjoining lands to form a drilling unit, when such pooling or combining was necessary in order to conform with governmental regulations. The clause also provided that drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from any land in the unit should have the same effect in continuing the lease in force and effect as if such operation or production were upon or from the leased land.\nIn addition to its lease of the north west quarter, the appellant held a petroleum and natural gas lease in respect of the south half of the section from one P, who agreed to the addition of his lease of a clause similar to cl. 14(A). A company controlling the petroleum and natural gas rights in respect of the north east quarter of the same section entered into a pooling and joint operating agreement with the appellant. The latter, on May 1, 1958, obtained a licence to drill a well on legal subdivision 7 of the section, which was not a part of the north west quarter. A well was drilled and completed early in June 1958 as a gas well. There being no market for the gas, the appellant applied to the Board for permission to cap the well and such permission was granted on June 13.\nOn April 28, 1958, the respondent K had granted to the respondent company an option to acquire a petroleum and natural gas lease in respect of the north west quarter, and on July 7, 1958, the company filed a caveat in respect of its interest under this option. On July 9, 1958, the appellant forwarded to Prudential a cheque for $100, as representing a royalty payment then due on the capped well, pursuant to cl. 3(b) of the lease, for the period June 5, 1958, to June 5, 1959; these moneys were distributed by the trust company on December 20, 1958.\nK wrote to the appellant on July 15, 1958, stating that the lease had expired and asking that the caveat filed by the appellant be removed. In November 1958 the respondent company caused notice to be served upon the appellant, pursuant to s. 144 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 170, requiring it to remove its caveat or else to commence proceedings in respect of the same. An action was commenced following the receipt by the appellant of that notice. The appellant forwarded a further $100 cheque to Prudential in May 1959 and these funds were distributed by it in November 1960.\nThe trial judge held that the lease of July 2, 1948, had expired and was of no force and effect; this decision was affirmed on appeal by a unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division. A further appeal was brought to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nClause 14(A) did not have the effect of enabling the appellant to treat a capped gas well anywhere on the unit as being equivalent to one located on the north west quarter, but, even if it did, payment of the $100 royalty after the primary term had expired was not effective to continue the term of the lease thereafter. At the time the primary term came to an end, no oil, gas or any other mineral was being produced from any part of the unit, nor was there any gas which could be considered as being produced as a result of the operation of cl. 3(b). That clause did not impose upon the appellant any obligation to pay a $100 royalty in respect of a non-producing gas well. The appellant had a choice to pay or not to pay and the clause only became operative \"if such payment is made\". If the appellant sought to continue the lease in operation after the primary term, by the combined operation of cl. 3(b) and cl. 2, then it was essential that it should have paid the royalty before the primary term expired.\nThe appellant's argument, based on cl. 14, that compliance with statutory provisions requiring it to cap the well should not constitute a cause for termination of the lease failed. The failure of the appellant to produce gas within the primary term, so as to extend that term, was not caused because of the need to comply with any statute or regulation, but was caused solely by the fact that there was no market or use for it.\nThe argument based upon cl. 18 also failed because, while the clause postponed certain obligations on the part of the appellant, in certain events, it did not purport to modify the provisions of the habendum clause. That clause imposed no obligation upon the appellant to produce oil, gas or other mineral from the leased land. It only provided that the primary term could be extended if oil, gas or other mineral was produced. If none of those substances were produced within the primary term, the lease terminated at the expiration of that term.\nSimilarly, the appellant could not derive any assistance from cl. 15, which provided that breach by the appellant of any obligation under the lease \"shall not work a forfeiture or termination of this lease nor because for cancellation or reversion hereof \u2026 save as herein expressly provided\". There was no question of any breach by the appellant of any obligation under the lease.\nThe position of the respondent K was not affected by his acceptance of a portion of the two royalty payments made by the appellant after the primary term had expired. No question arose as to election or waiver of forfeiture. The lease contained within itself a provision which operated automatically to terminate it upon the expiration of the primary term.\nShell Oil Co. of Canada v.

Mayson, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. H. Laycraft, Q.C., and D. O. Sabey, for the defendant, respondent, Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd.\nW. B. Gill, for the defendant, respondent, Kanstrup.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014By a petroleum and natural gas lease, dated July 2, 1948, the respondent Kanstrup leased to the appellant (whose name at that time was Rio Bravo Oil Company, Limited) the North West Quarter of Section 9, Township 39, Range 22, West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, hereinafter referred to as \"the North West Quarter\".\nThe relevant provisions of that lease are as follows:\n1. Lessor in consideration of Two Hundred Forty dollars ($240.00) of lawful money of Canada, the receipt of which is acknowledged by Lessor and the convenants and agreements hereinafter contained, has granted, demised, leased and let and by these presents does grant, demise, lease and let exclusively unto Lessee for the purpose and with the exclusive right of drilling wells, operating for and producing therefrom oil, gas, casinghead gas, casinghead gasoline and related hydrocarbons including the right to pull any and all casing with rights of way and easements for passage over and upon and across said land, and for laying pipe lines, telephone, telegraph and power lines, tanks, powerhouses, stations, gasoline plants, ponds, roadways and fixtures and structures for producing, saving, treating and caring for such products and housing and boarding employees and any and all other, rights and privileges necessary, incident to or convenient for the economical operation on said land for the production of oil, gas, casinghead gas, casinghead gasoline and related hydrocarbons and erection of structures thereon to produce, save, treat and take care of said products, all that certain tract of land described as:\nThe North West Quarter of Section Nine (9) Township Thirty Nine (39) Range Twenty Two (22) West of the Fourth Meridian as described in Certificate of Title Number 177 H 121 and subject to the reservations, exceptions and conditions contained in the existing Certificate of Title. For the purpose of determining the amount of any money payment hereunder, said land shall be considered to comprise 160 acres even though it actually comprises more or less.\n2. Subject to the other provisions herein contained, this lease shall be for a term of 10 Years from this date (called \"primary term\") and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is produced from said land hereunder, or as long thereafter as Lessee shall conduct drilling, mining or re-working operations thereon as hereinafter provided and during the production of oil, gas or other mineral resulting therefrom.\n3. The royalties reserved by Lessor are:\n***\n(b) On gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substance, produced from said land and sold or used off the premises or in the manufacture of gasoline or other product therefrom, the market value at the well of one-eighth of the gas so sold or used, provided that on gas sold at the wells the royalty shall be one-eighth of the amount realized from such sale; where gas from a well producing gas only is not sold or used, Lessee may pay as royalty $100.00 per well per year, and if such payment is made it will be considered that gas is being produced within the meaning of Paragraph 2 hereof;\n***\n6. If operations for drilling are not commenced on said land on or before one year from the date hereof, the lease shall then terminate as to both parties, unless on or before such anniversary date Lessee shall pay or tender to Lessor or for deposit to Lessor's credit in the Royal Bank of Canada at Alix, Alberta which bank and its successors are Lessor's agents and authorized to deduct its service charge, if any, from deposits hereunder and shall continue as such agents and depository for any and all sums payable under the lease regardless of changes in ownership of said land, of the oil and gas thereunder, or of rentals to accrue hereunder, the sum of $160.00 Dollars ($160.00) which shall be known and operate as delay rental and shall cover the privilege of deferring the commencement of drilling operations for a period of one (1) year. In like manner and upon like payments or tenders annually, the commencement of drilling operations may be further deferred for successive periods of one (1) year each during the primary term\u2026.\n***\n14. Compliance with any now or hereafter existing law enacted by the Parliament of Canada or Legislature of the Province of Alberta or any other lawmaking body, or with orders, judgments, decrees, rules, regulations made or promulgated by the Parliament of Canada or Legislature of the Province of Alberta, or any other law-making body, boards, commissions or committees purporting to be made under the authority of any such law, shall not constitute a violation of any of the terms of this lease or be considered a breach of any clause, obligation, covenant, undertaking, condition or stipulation contained herein, nor shall it be or constitute a cause for the termination, forfeiture, revision or revesting of any estate or interest herein and hereby created and set out, nor shall any such compliance confer any right of entry or become the basis of any action for damages or suit for the forfeiture or cancellation hereof; and while any such purport to be in force and effect they shall, when complied with by Lessee or its assigns, to the extent of such compliance operate as modifications of the terms and conditions of this lease where inconsistent therewith.\n15. The breach by Lessee of any obligation hereunder shall not work a forfeiture or termination of this lease nor be cause for cancellation or reversion hereof in whole or in part save as herein expressly provided. If the obligation should require the drilling of a well or wells, Lessee shall have sixty (60) days after the receipt of written notice by Lessee from Lessor specifically stating the breach alleged by Lessor within which to begin operations for the drilling of any such well or wells; and the only penalty for failure so to do shall be the termination of this lease save as to forty (40) acres for each well being worked on or producing oil or gas to be selected by Lessee so that each forty (40) acre tract will embrace one such well.\n***\n18. All obligations under this lease requiring Lessee to commence or continue drilling or to operate on or produce oil or gas from the demised premises shall be suspended while, but only so long as, Lessee is prevented from complying with such obligations, in part or in whole by strikes, lockouts, acts of God, federal, provincial or municipal laws or agencies, unavoidable accidents, delays in transportation, inability to obtain necessary materials in open market, inadequate facilities for the transportation of materials or for the disposition of production, or other matters beyond the reasonable control of Lessee whether similar to the matters herein specifically enumerated or not, or while legal action contesting Lessor's title to said land or Lessee's right in said premises by virtue hereof shall be pending final adjudication in a court assuming jurisdiction thereof, or while oil produced in or adjacent to said area is seventy-five cents per barrel or less at the well, or when there is no available market for the same at the well, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary. Time consumed in cleaning, repairing, deepening, or improving any producing well or its necessary appurtenances shall not be deemed or considered as an interruption of the covenant requiring continuous operation. Lessee need not perform any requirement hereunder the performance of which would violate any reasonable conservation and\/ or curtailment program or plan of orderly development to which Lessee may voluntarily or by order of any governmental agency subscribe or observe. This agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties and no implied covenants of any nature (except covenants of title and quiet enjoyment ordiarily implied in a grant), shall be read into this lease.\nA caveat in respect of the lease was registered by the appellant against the title of the respondent Kanstrup to the North West Quarter on July 6, 1948.\nOn March 19, 1952, the respondent Kanstrup entered into a royalty trust agreement with Prudential Trust Company Limited as trustee, under which he assigned to the trustee the 121\/2 per cent gross royalty or share of production from any well or wells that might be drilled upon any part of the North West Quarter, to be held and distributed by the trustee pursuant to the terms of the agreement.\nAt all times material since July 2, 1952, the relevant orders and regulations have prescribed a spacing unit for a gas well as 640 acres, with power to the Oil and Gas Conservation Board, in a case in which, in its opinion, it was proper so to do, to prescribe a spacing unit of any size or shape or within any boundaries.\nOn July 1, 1954, an area in the province within which the North West Quarter was situate was designated by the Board as \"the Nevis Field\", which was recognized in the oil and gas industry as being a gas field. In that field, during the months April to June, 1958, the policy of the Board was not to grant a licence for the drilling of a well unless the applicant had the right to produce from an entire spacing unit. On January 18, 1957, the appellant entered into a contract with Trans Canada Pipe Lines Limited, whereby it dedicated all its gas in the Nevis Field obtained from the Devonian formation for sale to that company. Trans Canada Pipe Lines Limited was not obligated to commence taking delivery of gas from that field from the appellant until the latter part of the year 1959.\nOn November 8, 1957, the lease was amended by the addition to it of cl. 14(A). The amendment was effected by a letter from the appellant to the respondent Kanstrup, which read as follows:\nOn the 2nd day of July, A.D. 1948, you, as Lessor, entered into a Petroleum & Natural Gas Lease with Rio Bravo Oil Company, Limited (now Canadian Superior Oil of California, Ltd), as Lessee, covering the North West Quarter (NW\/4) of Section Nine (9), Township Thirty-nine (39), Range Twenty-two (22), West of the Fourth (4th) Meridian, reserving unto the Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal, and containing One Hundred and Sixty (160) acres more or less.\nAs this land is included in the Nevis gas area we would like to amend the subject Petroleum & Natural Gas Lease by the addition thereto of a new clause, which will be clause 14(A) and will be entitled, \"POOLING DUE TO REGULATION\". The subject clause reads as follows:\n14 (A). POOLING DUE TO REGULATION\nThe Lessee is hereby given the right and power at any time and from time to time to pool or combine the said lands, or any portion thereof, with other lands adjoining the said lands, but so that any one such pool or unit (herein referred to as a \"Unit\") shall not exceed one drilling unit as hereinbefore defined, when such pooling or combining is necessary in order to conform with any regulations or orders of the Government of the Province of Alberta, or any other authoritative body, which are now or may hereafter be in force in relation thereto. In the event of such pooling or combining, the Lessor shall, in lieu of the royalties elsewhere herein specified, receive on production of leased substances from the said unit, only such portion of the royalties stipulated herein as the area of the said lands placed in the unit bears to the total area of lands in such unit. Drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from any land included in such unit shall have the same effect in continuing this Lease in force and effect during the term hereby granted, or any extension thereof, as to all the said lands, as if such operation or production were upon or from the said lands, or some portion thereof.\nThe purpose of this clause is to provide, as the clause indicates, for pooling due to regulation and such is necessary in this particular area because of the fact that the spacing unit for a gas well is Six Hundred and Forty (640) acres and the Nevis area appears to be purely a gas area with very little possibility of oil being found. We desire to pool this quarter section with the remainder of the lands in Section Nine (9) for the purpose of forming a Six Hundred and Forty (640) acre spacing unit with the object of drilling a well in the section. Our geological information indicates that Legal Subdivision Seven (7) of the said Section Nine (9) is the best possible location on the said Section, and in consideration of you agreeing to the within amendment we will pay you the sum of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars.\nWe would greatly appreciate your kind consideration of this matter and if the amendment to the subject Lease is agreeable to you, would you be kind enough to signify your agreement by signing this letter at the place indicated at the lower left-hand corner of this page, retaining one copy for your records and returning the remaining copies to us and the Lease will be deemed to be amended accordingly.\nThe respondent Kanstrup signed this letter, acknowledging and agreeing to the amendment of the lease.\nIn addition to its lease of the North West Quarter, the appellant held a petroleum and natural gas lease in respect of the South Half of Section 9, Township 39, Range 22, West of the Fourth Meridian, from one Peterson, who agreed to the addition to his lease of a clause similar to cl. 14(A), which has been cited above. The petroleum and natural gas rights in respect of the North East Quarter of the same section were controlled by Trans Empire Oils Ltd., which company, on March 7, 1958, entered into a pooling and joint operating agreement with the appellant.\nOn May 1, 1958, the appellant obtained a licence to drill a well on Legal Subdivision Seven of Section 9, which is not a part of the North West Quarter. A well was drilled on that legal subdivision and completed early in June, 1958, as a gas well. Almost immediately thereafter, on June 9, the appellant applied to the Board for permission to cap the well because of there being no market for the gas. Approval was granted by the Board on June 13.\nOn April 28, 1958, the respondent Kanstrup had granted to the respondent Scurry-Rainbow Oil Limited an option to acquire a petroleum and natural gas lease in respect of the North West Quarter, this lease being what is described in the industry as a \"top lease\". This option was open for acceptance within a period of one-half year from its date, or on or before, but not after, a date 30 days from the date of receipt of notice by the optionee from the optionor of the termination, cancellation or expiration of the existing petroleum and natural gas lease affecting the North West Quarter. Under its terms the respondent company could acquire a petroleum and natural gas lease in respect of the North West Quarter for a term of 10 years.\nOn July 7, 1958, the respondent company filed a caveat against the title of the respondent Kanstrup to the North West Quarter in respect of its interest under this option. On July 9, 1958, the appellant forwarded to Prudential Trust Company Limited a letter with a cheque for $100, as representing a royalty payment then due on the capped well on Legal Subdivision Seven, pursuant to cl. 3(b) of the lease, for the period June 5, 1958, to June 5, 1959. These moneys were distributed by the trust company on December 20, 1958.\nOn July 15, 1958, the respondent Kanstrup wrote to the appellant, stating that the lease had expired and asking that the caveat filed by the appellant be removed.\nOn or about November 28, 1958, the respondent company caused notice to be served upon the appellant, pursuant to s. 144 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 170, requiring it to remove its caveat or else to commence proceedings in respect of the same. The present action was commenced following the receipt by the appellant of that notice.\nOn or about May 26, 1959, the appellant forwarded a further $100 cheque to the Prudential Trust Company Limited. These funds were distributed by it on November 20, 1960, after this action had been commenced.\nThe question in issue is as to whether the lease of the North West Quarter, by the respondent Kanstrup to the appellant, expired at the expiration of the primary term of 10 years provided for in cl. 2 of the lease, or whether it continued beyond that period either as a result of the operation of other clauses in the lease or as a result of the election by the respondent Kanstrup to waive the operation of cl. 2.\nThe appellant's first contention is that the lease was continued in force by the combined operation of cls. 14(A), 3(b) and 2 of the lease. The argument is that the well drilled by the appellant on Legal Subdivision Seven, by virtue of cl. 14(A), was a well within the meaning of the latter portion of cl. 3(b), which reads:\nwhere gas from a well producing gas only is not sold or used, Lessee may pay as royalty $100.00 per well per year, and if such payment is made it will be considered that gas is being produced within the meaning of Paragraph 2 hereof;\nThe appellant then submits that the payment of a royalty of $100 per year in respect of the capped well on Legal Subdivision Seven would place the appellant in the same position as if gas were being produced within the meaning of cl. 2 of the lease, and so continue it in operation beyond the primary term. The respondents contend that cl. 14(A) never became applicable in the circumstances of this case, because pooling never became necessary in order to comply with any governmental order or regulation, and in support of this submission they rely upon the decision of this Court in Shell Oil Co. of Canada v. Gibbard[2].\nIn considering the appellant's first contention, I am prepared to agree with the view expressed in the Appellate Division[3] that that case is distinguishable in that in the present case the letter from the appellant to the respondent Kanstrup, containing the terms of cl. 14(A), showed that the appellant intended the clause to be construed as providing for pooling, to enable the appellant to establish a 640 acre spacing unit, to enable it to obtain a licence from the Board to drill a well on the section of which the North West Quarter was a part.\nIt should be noted, however, that, whereas in Shell Oil Co. of Canada v. Gibbard, supra, and also in the case of Shell Oil Co. v. Gunderson[4], cl. 9 of the leases in question in those cases was a part of the lease when the lease was executed, in the present case cl. 14(A) (which is identical in its wording with cl. 9 of the leases under consideration in those two cases) was subsequently added to the lease at the appellant's request. That being so, I think it is necessary first to consider the effect of the lease as it stood before it was amended and then to consider how far its provisions were altered by the addition of the new clause.\nPrior to the addition of cl. 14(A), the respondent Kanstrup had obligated himself, under cl. 2 of the lease, to a term of 10 years and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral was produced from \"the said land hereunder\"; i.e., from the North West Quarter. Clause 3(b) further provided that, where gas from a well producing gas only was not sold or used, the appellant might pay as royalty $100 per well per year and, if he did so, it would be considered that gas was being produced within the meaning of cl. 2. It is obvious that the only kind of well to which cl. 3(b) could apply was a non-producing gas well on the North West Quarter.\nThe object of cl. 14(A) was, as the appellant's letter stated, \"for the purpose of forming a Six Hundred and Forty (640) acre spacing unit with the object of drilling a well in the section.\"\nClause 14(A) stipulated that the pool or unit should not exceed one drilling unit (a term which was not defined in the lease) and gave the right and power to pool in order to conform with governmental regulations or orders. The appellant acquired, by this clause, the power to pool the North West Quarter with the balance of the section, so as to be able to establish to the Board the existence of a proper spacing unit, in order that it might obtain the necessary licence to drill a gas well on the section. The appellant did obtain the necessary drilling licence on the basis of its control of the section and the clause, therefore, fulfilled its purpose.\nThe effect of pooling is defined in the clause and it is twofold:\n1. The royalty payable \"on production of leased substances\" is varied so as to give to the lessor only a fraction of the royalty which he would have been entitled to receive had there been a producing well drilled on his own land and no pooling. The numerator of that fraction was the number of acres in the North West Quarter and the denominator was the total area of the drilling unit.\n2. \"Drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from\" any land in the unit is to have the same effect in continuing the lease in force and effect as if such operation or production were upon or from the North West Quarter.\nIt is the second of these consequences which is of interest here. In so far as drilling operations are concerned, they were completed within the primary term. They had the effect of fulfilling the drilling obligation of the appellant contained in cl. 6 of the lease. There was, however, no production of any of the leased substances, within the primary term, from any part of the 640 acre drilling unit. It is only drilling operations on or production of leased substances from any land other than the North West Quarter which, under the terms of cl. 14(A), would be effective to continue the lease on the North West Quarter in force. The wording of that clause does not extend beyond the effect which it gives to operations of that kind. It does not say that a non-producing gas well, not on the North West Quarter, is to be equivalent to a non-producing gas well on the North West Quarter, so as to entitle the appellant to rely upon the latter portion of cl. 3(b), nor can any such provision be implied in a clause which limits the right to pool to a situation in which pooling is necessary in order to comply with governmental orders and regulations.\nHowever, even if cl. 14(A) did have the effect of enabling the appellant to treat a capped gas well anywhere on the unit as being equivalent to one located on the North West Quarter, I agree with the learned trial judge that payment of the $100 royalty after the primary term had expired was not effective to continue the term of the lease thereafter. At the time the primary term came to an end, no oil, gas or any other mineral was being produced from any part of the unit, nor was there any gas which could be considered as being produced as a result of the operation of cl. 3(b). That clause did not impose upon the appellant any obligation to pay a $100 royalty in respect of a non-producing gas well. The appellant had a choice to pay or not to pay and the clause only became operative \"if such payment is made.\" If the appellant sought to continue the lease in operation after the primary term, by the combined operation of cl. 3(b) and cl. 2, then it was essential that it should have paid the royalty before the primary term expired. The appellant was aware that gas would not be produced within the primary term some time before the primary term expired. The well on Legal Subdivision Seven had been capped by it in the early part of June 1958, and it was the appellant which sought for and obtained a Board order for the closing of that well.\nThe next argument raised by the appellant is based upon cl. 14 of the lease. It is contended that, as the appellant was precluded by law from blowing gas from its well into the air, and as it was bound by a Board order to keep the well capped, compliance with these legal requirements should not, under this clause, constitute a cause for the termination of the lease.\nIn my opinion, the error in this argument is that the cause for the termination of the lease was the failure by the appellant to produce gas from the well within the primary term, and not the need to comply with any laws, orders or regulations. Production of gas was not taken from the well because of the economic fact that the appellant had no market for it at the time the primary term expired. When cl. 2 of the lease refers to oil, gas or other mineral \"produced\" from the said land, read in the context of the whole of the lease, this means produced for sale or use, and not produced to be blown into the air. The order for the capping of the well was made by the Board at the appellant's own request and that request was made because of the absence of a market for gas produced from the well.\nThe position was, therefore, that the failure of the appellant to produce gas within the primary term, so as to extend that term, was not caused because of the need to comply with any statute or regulation, but was caused solely by the fact that there was no market or use for it.\nThe appellant also relies upon cl. 18, the force majeure provision, which states, inter alia, that all obligations under the lease requiring it to commence or continue drilling or to operate on or produce oil or gas from the demised premises should be suspended \"when there is no available market for the same at the well.\" I will assume, for the purposes of this argument, that \"the same\" relates back to the words \"oil or gas\" at the beginning of the clause, and is not limited by the reference to \"oil\" which immediately precedes the words above quoted. The answer to this argument is that, while the clause postpones obligations, in certain events, it does not purport to modify the provisions of the habendum clause. That clause imposed no obligation upon the appellant to produce oil, gas or other mineral from the North West Quarter. It only provided that the primary term could be extended if oil, gas or other mineral was produced. If none of those substances were produced within the primary term, the lease terminated at the expiration of that term.\nFor the same reasons I do not think that the appellant derives any assistance from cl. 15, which provides that breach by the appellant of any obligation under the lease shall not work a forfeiture or termination of the lease or be cause for cancellation or reversion thereof, save as expressly provided. There is here no question of any breach by the appellant of any obligation under the lease. The lease provided for a specified primary term and for its continuance thereafter in certain events. The fact that those events did not occur does not constitute any breach on the part of the appellant of any of its obligations under the lease. Finally there is the question as to whether the receipt by the respondent Kanstrup of a portion of the two $100 payments made by the appellant after the primary term had expired affects his legal position. The appellant contends that Kanstrup elected to continue the lease by accepting these payments, which he received from Prudential Trust Company Limited, and that he cannot contend that the lease terminated because the payment was not made prior to the expiration of the primary term.\nAs already noted, the distribution by the trust company of the first payment was not made until December 20, 1958. Prior to that Kanstrup had already written to the appellant on July 15 contending that the lease had expired and asking for the removal of the appellant's caveat.\nIn my opinion no question arises in this case as to election or waiver of forfeiture by the respondent Kanstrup. This lease contained within itself a provision which operated automatically to terminate it upon the expiration of the primary term. Thereafter there were no steps required to be taken by Kanstrup in order to bring it to an end. There was no election for him to make. There was no obligation on the part of the appellant to make any royalty payment in respect of the capped well, even assuming that cl. 3(b) was applicable to it. There was no default on the part of the appellant in not paying that money before the primary term had expired. There was, therefore, no forfeiture to relieve against.\nIn connection with this aspect of the case, I agree with the views expressed by Frank Ford J.A. in East Crest Oil Co. Ltd. v. Strohschein[5].\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & Macdonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Scurry-Rainbow Oil Ltd.: Chambers, Saucier, Jones, Peacock, Gain & Stratton, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent, Kanstrup: W.

L'une des cons\u00e9quences de cet accident fut que Leblanc et ses quatre passagers, tous les cinq membres des Forces canadiennes, furent bless\u00e9s.\nPlus de deux ans apr\u00e8s cet accident, l'appelante poursuivit les intim\u00e9s en Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier. Elle all\u00e9gua que, pour des raisons propres \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9fendeur, cet accident leur \u00e9tait imputable et leur r\u00e9clama \u00e0 titre de dommages le paiement d'une somme de $4,661.28 d\u00e9taill\u00e9e comme suit: $3,145.05 d\u00e9bours\u00e9s pour soins m\u00e9dicaux prodigu\u00e9s \u00e0 ces militaires et $1,516.23 \u00e0 eux vers\u00e9s pour solde durant la p\u00e9riode de leur indisponibilit\u00e9.\nContestant cette r\u00e9clamation en fait et en droit, les intim\u00e9s plaid\u00e8rent particuli\u00e8rement et sp\u00e9cialement qu'en droit cette action \u00e9tait tardive, ill\u00e9gale et nulle, qu'il n'y avait aucun lien de droit entre eux et l'appelante et que les dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s ne pouvaient \u00eatre l\u00e9galement accord\u00e9s parce qu'indirects et d\u00e9coulant nullement de l'accident.\nAdvenant le jour de l'enqu\u00eate et audition, les intim\u00e9s admirent les faits et le quantum mais non le droit, l'appelante gardant le fardeau d'\u00e9tablir particuli\u00e8rement l'existence et la validit\u00e9 de son action contre les intim\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s avoir argument\u00e9 oralement, les parties soumirent des m\u00e9moires et, le 19 septembre 1963, M. le Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier rendit un jugement faisant droit aux pr\u00e9tentions des intim\u00e9s et rejetant l'action de l'appelante. De l\u00e0 l'appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nII importe de bien d\u00e9finir la base juridique sur laquelle la Couronne entend justifier son action, telle que pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e par elle en Cour de premi\u00e8re instance comme en cette Cour, au d\u00e9bat engag\u00e9 entre les parties.\nLa Couronne ne pr\u00e9tend pas exercer, par voie de subrogation conventionnelle ou l\u00e9gale, l'action pour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles que pouvaient prendre ces militaires contre les intim\u00e9s. Une telle action eut \u00e9t\u00e9 vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l'insucc\u00e8s; le subrog\u00e9 n'a d'autres droits que ceux de celui auquel il est subrog\u00e9 et, en l'esp\u00e8ce, l'action des militaires pour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 prescrite au moment o\u00f9 l'action de la Couronne fut intent\u00e9e. Art. 2262 para. 2 C.C.\nLa Couronne ne pr\u00e9tend pas non plus fonder cette action sur une loi sp\u00e9ciale, telle par exemple la Loi sur l'Indemnisation des employ\u00e9s de l'\u00c9tat, S.R.C. 1952, c.134. On notera cependant que, dans les cas o\u00f9 elle s'applique, cette loi contient \u00e0 l'article 8(3) une disposition sp\u00e9ciale subrogeant la Couronne aux droits de la victime d'un accident ou des personnes \u00e0 la charge d'icelle lorsque l'une d'elles d\u00e9cide de r\u00e9clamer \u00e0 la Couronne une indemnit\u00e9.\nEnfin, l'appelante n'invoque pas le principe d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, source de l'action de in rem verso voulant que nul ne doit s'enrichir au d\u00e9triment d'autrui. Une telle action eut aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l'insucc\u00e8s. Il faut, pour l'ouverture de l'action que l'enrichissement du d\u00e9fendeur et l'appauvrissement du demandeur soient l'un et l'autre d\u00e9pourvus de cause. Celui dont l'obligation l\u00e9gale est \u00e9teinte par prescription ne s'enrichit pas du fait qu'un tiers peut acquitter la dette ainsi prescrite. La condition du d\u00e9biteur ne doit pas \u00eatre rendue pire parce qu'un tiers a pay\u00e9 sa dette et tel serait le cas si le droit du tiers \u00e0 l'action de in rem verso survivait \u00e0 l'extinction, par prescription ou autrement, de l'obligation l\u00e9gale du d\u00e9biteur de payer sa dette \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier. (Voir les raisons donn\u00e9es et autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par le Juge Mignault, aux pages 691 et seq., dans Regent Taxi and Transport Company v. Congr\u00e9gation des Petits Fr\u00e8res de Marie[1]). De plus, comme on le signale dans Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, tome 7, p. 57, No. 761:\nL'appauvrissement a une cause d'abord lorsqu'il r\u00e9sulte d'une prestation ou d'un service en ex\u00e9cution d'une convention ou d'une obligation l\u00e9gale ou naturelle.\nEn l'absence de toute convention et de toute obligation de l'appauvri, l'appauvrissement a encore une cause quand il r\u00e9sulte d'un travail fourni par lui ou du prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 des prestations ou services d'autrui en vue de se procurer un avantage personnel. Il a travaill\u00e9 ou d\u00e9pens\u00e9 pour lui-m\u00eame, courant pour son propre compte les bonnes chances et les mauvaises de son initiative. Peu importe qu'il \u00e9choue et se trouve en perte. Les tiers enrichis par contre-coup ne peuvent \u00eatre actionn\u00e9s de in rem verso.\nIl s'agit, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'appelante en son factum et \u00e0 l'audition, d'une demande en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, exclusivement fond\u00e9e sur l'article 1053 du Code Civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, en r\u00e9paration d'un pr\u00e9judice que les intim\u00e9s lui auraient caus\u00e9 \u00e0 elle directement et \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration duquel elle aurait contre eux une action directe. Elle invoque la nature de la relation juridique entre la Couronne et les militaires, statutairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par l'article 50 de la Loi de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier \u00eatre celle de ma\u00eetre et serviteur, et soumet que son pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9siderait dans le fait m\u00eame de l'indisponibilit\u00e9 ou privation des services de ces militaires durant la p\u00e9riode requise \u00e0 leur r\u00e9tablissement. L'indisponibilit\u00e9 ou la privation des services du serviteur suffirait per se pour donner une action directe au ma\u00eetre sans qu'il lui soit n\u00e9cessaire d'all\u00e9guer et prouver en plus et sp\u00e9cifiquement que cette indisponibilit\u00e9 ou privation de services ait eu des cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles et dommageables,\u2014comme il peut arriver dans le cas d'une perturbation dans le service. L'appelante n'invoque pas les paiements pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s comme base juridique d'une action en demandant le remboursement parce qu'ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sans contrepartie, mais comme mesure dans l'appr\u00e9ciation en esp\u00e8ces du pr\u00e9judice qu'elle aurait subi du seul fait de la privation des services. On reconna\u00eetra bien dans une telle action la plupart sinon tous les traits pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans Salmond On Torts 13e \u00e9d. pp. 630 et seq. de l'action per quod servitium amisit, en laquelle on assimile \u00e0 la privation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 la privation du serviteur. Dans The King v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company,[2] M. le Juge Rand, r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle donnant au ma\u00eetre ce droit d'action, disait au bas de la page 197:\nAs it has been many times remarked, this right is an anomalous survival from social conditions in which the servants belong to the household and their relation to the master was more of the nature of status than contractual. But with the evolutions of individualism the economic and remedial position of the employee has long since changed and as it is to-day as ample to protect his interests as those of the employer. Such an anachronism should, therefore, be held to the precise limits within which it has been established.\nAdmise dans les provinces r\u00e9gies par la Common Law, l'action per quod servitium amisit n'existe pas dans le Droit Civil de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec. L'appelante l'admet. Aussi bien, d\u00e9clare-t-elle, est-ce au droit civil du Qu\u00e9bec, qui s'applique en l'esp\u00e8ce, qu'il faut recourir pour d\u00e9cider la question. Cependant, et nonobstant la justesse de cette d\u00e9claration, l'appelante, \u00e0 mon avis, nous a virtuellement demand\u00e9 de donner effet aux vues exprim\u00e9es par cette Cour dans des causes r\u00e9gies par la Common Law et o\u00f9 l'action intent\u00e9e \u00e9tait une action per quod servitium amisit, soit: A.G. of Canada v. Jackson[3]; The King v. Richardson[4] et Nykorak v. A.G. of Canada[5]. Dans ces arr\u00eats, on a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 et appliqu\u00e9 l'article 50 de la Loi de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier comme ne cr\u00e9ant pas un droit d'action au profit de la Couronne mais comme \u00e9tablissant un lien juridique de ma\u00eetre et serviteur entre elle et son militaire et, d\u00e8s lors, la Cour a ensuite appliqu\u00e9 les r\u00e9gles gouvernant en pareil cas sous le r\u00e9gime de la Common Law. Certes, s'il faut retenir, pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause r\u00e9gie par le droit civil, cette interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 50, il ne s'ensuit pas qu'il nous soit permis d'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce les r\u00e8gles de la Common Law gouvernant les cas o\u00f9 se pr\u00e9sente l'incidence de la relation juridique de ma\u00eetre et serviteur. Aussi bien, sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 50, ces arr\u00eats ne trouvent aucune application en la pr\u00e9sente cause et, pour cette raison, il n'y a pas lieu d'en poursuivre ult\u00e9rieurement la consid\u00e9ration.\nSuivant l'appelante, la proposition voulant que le ma\u00eetre priv\u00e9 des services de son serviteur par la faute d'un tiers ait, du seul fait de cette privation, une action directe en indemnit\u00e9 contre ce tiers, en vertu de l'art. 1053 C.C., serait une proposition qui ne souffre pas de difficult\u00e9 depuis l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Regent Taxi supra, dont le principe, ajoute-t-elle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 par l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Driver v. Coca-Cola Limited[6] et adopt\u00e9 dans quatre arr\u00eats rendus depuis Regent Taxi, supra, dont deux de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier: Her Majesty the Queen v. The Montreal Transportation Commission[7], Fournier J. et Her Majesty the Queen v. L\u00e9vis Ferry Limited[8], Fournier J.; l'autre de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure: Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada v. Cit\u00e9 de Hull[9]; et le dernier de la Cour du banc de la reine: Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada v. Dallaire et al.[10]\nNotons imm\u00e9diatement qu'on ne peut trouver, aux raisons donn\u00e9es au soutien des quatre arr\u00eats pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, aucune assistance; les Juges de premi\u00e8re instance ou d'appel qui les ont formul\u00e9s se sont content\u00e9s de citer la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Regent Taxi, supra, s'y soumettant sans aucuns commentaires sauf, parfois, certains sugg\u00e9rant que les vues exprim\u00e9es en cette d\u00e9cision ne correspondaient pas \u00e0 celles qu'ils pouvaient avoir. Aussi bien, je ne crois pas manquer de respect en disant que ces arr\u00eats n'ont d'autre valeur que celle de celui sur lequel ils se fondent.\nObservons ensuite que la question qui se pr\u00e9sentait dans Driver, supra, diff\u00e8re de celle qui se pr\u00e9sente en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'appelante voit cependant un obiter dictum supportant ses pr\u00e9tentions dans l'extrait suivant des raisons de jugement de notre coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge en chef, apparaissant au premier paragraphe de la page 204:\n\u00c9videmment, la situation pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente, si la victime n'\u00e9tait pas morte. Car, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans cette cause de Regent Taxi, supra, le mot \u00ab autrui \u00bb \u00e0 l'art. 1053 ne signifie pas seulement la victime imm\u00e9diate d'un d\u00e9lit ou d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, mais aussi toute personne qui, comme cons\u00e9quence d'un tort caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une autre, souffre un dommage. Mais, tel n'est pas le cas qui nous occupe, vu que la victime est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e comme cons\u00e9quence de l'accident.\nA mon avis, il ne faut voir en ce passage qu'une constatation et non une approbation des vues exprim\u00e9es dans Regent Taxi, supra.\nEnfin, et contrairement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante, je suis d'opinion que la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Regent Taxi, supra, n'a pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me et que le d\u00e9bat auquel il a donn\u00e9 lieu reste ouvert. Seul le Juge en chef Anglin, avec le concours du Juge Smith, aurait accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour privation de services. Pour sa part, le Juge Lamont exprima l'avis qu'entre la communaut\u00e9 et le Fr\u00e8re Gabriel, l'un de ses membres, il n'y avait pas de relation juridique de ma\u00eetre et serviteur; ceci \u00e9tant d\u00e9cisif de la question, ce qu'y ajouta le Juge Lamont en s'appuyant, par ailleurs, exclusivement sur la jurisprudence et la doctrine de la Common Law, me para\u00eet \u00eatre obiter dictum. Quant aux Juges Mignault et Rinfret, ils enregistr\u00e8rent une forte dissidence. A mon avis, il n'y a pas eu majorit\u00e9 en cette Cour sur le point qui nous occupe. De toutes fa\u00e7ons, le m\u00e9rite des vues qu'on y a exprim\u00e9es fut remis en question par un appel au Conseil Priv\u00e9. L'on sait que cet appel fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur une question de prescription. Quant au probl\u00e8me qui nous occupe, le Conseil Priv\u00e9[11], apr\u00e8s en avoir signal\u00e9 l'importance et la complexit\u00e9, refusa de se prononcer pour en r\u00e9server la d\u00e9termination dans une cause o\u00f9 cette d\u00e9termination serait essentielle \u00e0 la disposition de l'appel, ainsi qu'il appert \u00e0 la page 164.\nTheir Lordships having come to this clear opinion upon this part of the case, feel grave doubts as to the advisability or propriety of expressing any opinion upon the remaining question. The importance of that question admits of no doubt, and its difficulty is apparent in the division of judicial opinion; but, unfortunately, any view which their Lordships have formed (and whether clearly or otherwise) would involve no decision upon the point, for the case is determined in any event by the date on which the proceedings were commenced.\nIn these circumstances, would it be advisable or proper that a view, unnecessary to the decision of the case, should be expressed upon so vexed a question? Their Lordships think not. They are of opinion that no opinion should be expressed by their Lordships upon the question until it comes before them upon an appeal in which they can deal with it as the sole factor for consideration, unhampered by any other competing question which would be decisive of the case.\nAussi bien, dans une conf\u00e9rence intitul\u00e9e \u00ab La responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec \u00bb, rapport\u00e9e au Livre-Souvenir des Journ\u00e9es du Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, p. 333, le Juge Mignault pouvait-il dire, \u00e0 la page 335, que la question restait ouverte, et est-ce \u00e0 bon droit que M. le Juge Dumoulin de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier l'a consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme telle, en l'esp\u00e8ce, comme il l'avait fait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans Her Majesty the Queen v. Poudrier et Boulet Limited[12].\nExcluant de la consid\u00e9ration, comme il se doit, l'action per quod servitium amisit de la Common Law, je crois qu'\u00e0 moins de faire abstraction de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il nous faut envisager le recours de l'appelante comme \u00e9tant une action directe dirig\u00e9e par le ma\u00eetre contre le responsable d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit causant des l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles \u00e0 son serviteur, pour \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 des sommes qu'il a d\u00e9bours\u00e9es \u00e0 cette occasion au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du serviteur. Si faits ex gratia, il est \u00e9vident que ces d\u00e9bours\u00e9s n'offrent aucune base juridique au recours du ma\u00eetre. Le probl\u00e8me na\u00eet plut\u00f4t lorsque ces d\u00e9bours\u00e9s sont faits en satisfaction d'une obligation, contractuelle ou statutaire, dont le ma\u00eetre devient alors le d\u00e9biteur et l'employ\u00e9 le cr\u00e9ancier. Si l'accident r\u00e9sulte, non pas d'un cas fortuit ou de la n\u00e9gligence de la victime, mais de la faute d'un tiers, le ma\u00eetre a-t-il contre ce tiers une action personnelle fond\u00e9e sur l'article 1053 du Code Civil pour se rembourser des sommes qu'il doit ainsi obligatoirement verser au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de son serviteur. La gravit\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences de la solution devient plus manifeste si l'on con- sid\u00e8re que les prestations auxquelles le ma\u00eetre peut s'\u00eatre oblig\u00e9 peuvent comprendre, outre la continuation du salaire, des soins m\u00e9dicaux, indemnit\u00e9s journali\u00e8res, pension d'invalidit\u00e9 ou de retraite, ou autres prestations.\nLe probl\u00e8me qui nous occupe a donn\u00e9 lieu et donne encore lieu, en France, \u00e0 de grandes controverses. On para\u00eet l'avoir solutionn\u00e9, au moins en ce qui concerne le recours de l'\u00c9tat dont le fonctionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit. Mais c'est en adoptant assez r\u00e9cemment une l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale subrogeant l'\u00c9tat aux droits du fonctionnaire,\u2014comme c'est le cas sous le r\u00e9gime de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur l'Indemnisation des employ\u00e9s de l'\u00c9tat, supra\u2014qu'on est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 le solutionner. Sirley, Lois et Arr\u00eats 1946-48 p. 1610 No. 27; Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale 1959, L\u00e9gislation, p. 219, art. 11; A. Carpentier, Codes et Lois, 3e Partie, Droit Administratif, 23 mai 1951 p. 5. Deux arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents de la Cour de Cassation sur le recours de l'\u00c9tat pour obtenir le remboursement des soldes et indemnit\u00e9s vers\u00e9es \u00e0 un militaire pendant son indisponibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9montrent bien que ce recours de l'\u00c9tat, en France, ne se fonde pas sur les articles 1382 et 1383 C.N.\u2014lesquels ne diff\u00e8rent gu\u00e8re de notre article 1053 C.C.\u2014mais sur la subrogation l\u00e9gale \u00e9dict\u00e9e par cette l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9ciale. Cour de Cassation, Chambres Civiles, 1-2 1960, 2e section civile, p. 90 no 135; Cour de Cassation, Chambres Civiles, 1-2 1961, 2e section civile, p. 111 no 155. Une telle l\u00e9gislation n'existe pas dans le Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec. Nous avons, par ailleurs, relativement \u00e0 d'autres situations, des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales, tel l'article 7 de la Loi des Accidents du Travail, S.R.Q. 1941, c.160, subrogeant l\u00e9galement l'employeur ou la Commission des Accidents du Travail aux droits des ouvriers victimes d'accidents, ou leurs d\u00e9pendants, contre le responsable et tel aussi l'article 2584 du Code Civil d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant, dans le cas d'assurance contre le feu, que l'assureur, en payant l'indemnit\u00e9, devient cessionnaire des droits de l'assur\u00e9 contre ceux qui ont caus\u00e9 le feu ou la perte. Autant de dispositions dont l'inutilit\u00e9 appara\u00eet si l'employeur, la Commission ou l'assureur avaient un recours personnel en vertu de l'article 1053 du Code Civil pour se rembourser des prestations statutaires ou contractuelles auxquelles ils ont satisfait. Et si, excluant la pr\u00e9sence des ces dispositions, il faut conclure que l'employeur, la Commission ou l'assureur n'ont pas cette action \u00e0 titre personnel contre le responsable, on ne con\u00e7oit gu\u00e8re de raisons valables pour qu'il en soit autrement pour l'appelante dans le cas qui nous occupe.\nLes recherches pousuivies depuis 1929, ann\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de Regent Taxi, supra, pour solutionner le probl\u00e8me, ont fourni des pr\u00e9cisions nouvelles aux motifs juridiques sur lesquels on fonde la n\u00e9gation d'une telle action. Dans une chronique apparaissant dans Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale 1958, \u00e0 la page 179, on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement le cas de l'employeur qui s'adresse \u00e0 l'auteur d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit pour lui r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats parce qu'en ex\u00e9cution de son contrat avec son employ\u00e9 ou du statut de ce dernier, il doit verser \u00e0 celui-ci certaines sommes en raison de l'accident dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Bref, et ainsi qu'il appert des extraits suivants, on pr\u00e9cise que l'exclusion de ce recours se fonde sur le fait que les sommes ainsi vers\u00e9es par l'employeur ne repr\u00e9sentent pas de dommage au sens de ce mot suivant l'article 1053, du Code Civil, et sur l'absence du lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la faute de ce tiers et l'exigibilit\u00e9 des prestations de l'employeur, lesquelles deviennent exigibles \u00e0 l'occasion de l'accident, sans qu'on ait \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper aucunement si celui-ci r\u00e9sulte d'un cas fortuit, d'une n\u00e9gligence de la victime ou de la faute d'un tiers.\nA la page 185:\nEn effet, celui qui acquitte une obligation en vertu d'un contrat qu'il a conclu, ou d'un statut r\u00e9glementaire qui organise son fonctionnement, ne subit pas de dommages parce qu'il ne subit pas de l\u00e9sion, ni dans ses droits, (ce qui est \u00e9vident), ni dans ses int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n***\nEn d'autres termes, il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 d'un dommage au sens de l'article 1382 C.N. parce que le paiement trouve sa cause dans l'ensemble des stipulations du contrat ou du statut. Remarquons-le, nous ne comprenons pas le mot \u00abcause\u00bb dans le sens de cause efficiente, de source du paiement, nous le prenons dans le sens de cause finale, de motif d\u00e9terminant de ce paiement, dans le sens des articles 1108 et 1131 C.N.\nLes articles 984 et 989 C.C. correspondent \u00e0 ces articles 1108 et 1131 C.N. Et l'auteur continue:\nQuand un individu s'engage par contrat ou par statut \u00e0 payer une certaine somme, il ne le fait pas contrairement \u00e0 ses int\u00e9r\u00eats, mais bien au contraire, en vue de donner satisfaction \u00e0 ceux-ci. Comment peut-on soutenir qu'en payant ce \u00e0 quoi il est ainsi tenu, il subit un dommage dont il peut demander \u00e0 d'autres r\u00e9paration?\n***\nA fortiori doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi lorsqu'il s'agit d'obligations soumises \u00e0 une condition, dont la naissance est suspendue au hasard. Le d\u00e9biteur \u00e9ventuel court l'al\u00e9a de voir se r\u00e9aliser la condition de voir sa dette \u00e9ventuelle se transformer en une dette imm\u00e9diatement exigible; mais il a volontairement couru cet al\u00e9a, parce qu'il courait, en compensation, la chance de ne pas voir se r\u00e9aliser la condition, et de n'avoir aucun paiement \u00e0 faire. Il a voulu, dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat, courir ce risque et cette chance, cet al\u00e9a. Il ne subit pas de pr\u00e9judice dont il puisse demander r\u00e9paration si le risque se r\u00e9alise, pas plus qu'il ne profite d'un enrichissement injuste si la chance lui sourit.\nEt \u00e0 la page 184:\n\u2026; d'autre part, le contrat ou le statut pr\u00e9voit ce versement d\u00e8s qu'un accident se produit, sans se pr\u00e9occuper si celui-ci est d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute d'un tiers ou r\u00e9sulte d'un cas fortuit. La faute du tiers n'est donc que l'occasion d'une d\u00e9pense qui trouve essentiellement sa source dans ce contrat.\nDans His Majesty the King v. Canadian Pacific Railways, supra, on trouvera, bien qu'il s'agissait d'une cause r\u00e9gie par la Common Law, un raisonnement substantiellement similaire, particuli\u00e8rement aux raisons de notre coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge en chef Taschereau.\nL'auteur de la chronique pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e d\u00e9clare bien que l'entreprise, priv\u00e9e par accident d'un employ\u00e9, pourra invoquer, sur le fondement de l'article 1382 C.N., contre le responsable, le trouble qui en r\u00e9sultera pour elle dans son fonctionnement mais, dit-il en citant Mazeaud et Tunc et autres autorit\u00e9s, si l'action peut \u00e9tre admise, il faudra \u00eatre tr\u00e8s prudent. Il faut qu'il s'agisse de personnes \u00abirrempla\u00e7ables\u00bb et, ajoute-t-il, la plupart du temps, l'entreprise est organis\u00e9e de telle sorte que la perte, temporaire ou d\u00e9finitive, d'un collaborateur ne lui causera pas de pr\u00e9judice.\nD'o\u00f9 l'on voit que, dans le Droit Civil, l'indisponibilit\u00e9 du serviteur ou la privation de ses services ne suffit pas per se et sans plus \u00e0 constituer un dommage donnant lieu, en droit, \u00e0 r\u00e9paration et, qu'\u00e0 elles seules, les prestations impos\u00e9es contractuellement ou statutairement au ma\u00eetre au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du serviteur ne peuvent servir de fondement ou mesure d'un dommage, mais comme on le sugg\u00e8re dans Marty et Raynaud, Droit Civil, 1962, tome 2, p.383, le dommage, s'il existe, doit \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 dans l'incidence de la privation, temporaire ou pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, des services \u00abet dans leurs cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier dans chaque esp\u00e8ce.\u00bb\nTel qu'engag\u00e9 entre les parties, le d\u00e9bat, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare l'appelante en son factum, \u00abpose la question de l'existence dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec d'une action directe en indemnit\u00e9 au profit de la Couronne dont le pendant\u2014quoique l'analogie ne soit pas parfaite\u2014serait, pour les provinces de la Common Law, l'action per quod servitium amisit.\u00bb A cette question, je donnerais une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative et, limitant \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce les consid\u00e9rations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je dirais que l'appelante n'a pas r\u00e9ussi, comme elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire, \u00e0 justifier son recours en le basant uniquement sur l'article 1053 du Code Civil.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, appelante: E.

Les dispositions de l'art. 596 (b) prescrivent en termes bien clairs que la cause est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e pour audition et d\u00e9cision comme s'il s'agissait d'un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la Cour d'appel ayant rejet\u00e9 l'appel, l'accus\u00e9 avait droit d'interjeter appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada en vertu de l'art. 597A du Code Criminel.\nSur le m\u00e9rite, l'accus\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses griefs.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE), PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nCriminal law\u2014Capital murder\u2014Conviction affirmed by Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Minister remitting case to Court of Appeal for further hearing\u2014Whether further appeal to Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 55\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.),c. 51, ss. 596, 597.\nThe accused, whose conviction on a charge of capital murder was upheld by this Court, applied for clemency. The Minister of Justice remitted the case for further hearing to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 596 of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal proceeded to decide the matter as though it were an appeal by the accused and dismissed the appeal. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere is no analogy between s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act and s. 596 (b) of the Criminal Code. Section 596 (b) prescribes in clear terms that the case is remitted for hearing and determination as if it were an appeal by the convicted person. In the present case, the Court of Appeal having dismissed the appeal, a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was opened to the accused under s. 597A of the Code.\nOn the merits, the accused has failed to establish that his grounds of appeal were well founded.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], rejetant un appel d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour par le Ministre de la Justice.

Le bureau de placement m'a envoy\u00e9e pour trouver du travail dans l'\u00e9tablissement situ\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la banque.\n\u2014Quel bureau de placement? Il est situ\u00e9 sur la rue Jean Talon.\n\u2014Finalement avez-vous parl\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu'un relativement \u00e0 du travail? Oui, avec le \u00ab g\u00e9rant \u00bb.\n\u2014Savez-vous le nom de la Compagnie? Je ne sais pas, mais je pense qu'on s'occupe de moteurs Diesel et aussi de moteurs \u00e9lectriques, o\u00f9 les femmes embobinent les moteurs. C'est le m\u00eame groupe de b\u00e2timents \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cette banque. Le nom: Electric Products.\n\u2014Quelle heure \u00e9tait-il? Je ne sais pas exactement, mais je pense qu'il \u00e9tait 11.30. A cause des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pr\u00e8s de la banque je n'avais pas de go\u00fbt pour aller nulle part, mais j'ai pens\u00e9 comme \u00e7a; qu'il fallait aller \u00e0 l'adresse indiqu\u00e9e puisque le bureau m'y avait envoy\u00e9e. Comme \u00e7a, je suis all\u00e9e et je me suis pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux bureaux.\n\u2014Avant d'aller aux bureaux pour chercher du travail, est-ce que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d'un incident malheureux? Oui.\n\u2014Dans vos propres termes, dites-nous ce que vous avez vu? Moi je suis arriv\u00e9e avec l'autobus et quand je suis descendue j'avais l'intention de me rendre \u00e0 la compagnie qui porte le nom Electric Products.\n\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il est arriv\u00e9 avec ce policier du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit? Je sais exactement que le policier du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche est descendu en premi\u00e8re.\n\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il est arriv\u00e9 avec ce policier du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche?

Celui-ci a ouvert la porte de sa voiture et il \u00e9tait en train de sortir. Son revolver \u00e0 la main.

Moi j'ai vu qu'\u00e0 cause de ces coups le premier policier est disparu, cette rafale a continu\u00e9 sur la voiture; apr\u00e8s, le deuxi\u00e8me policier du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit a port\u00e9 sa main sur l'estomac et il est tomb\u00e9 \u00e0 terre.\n\u2014Est-ce que le sang a coul\u00e9 beaucoup? Oui. Il a port\u00e9 sa main sur l'estomac et du sang jaillissait sur sa main.\n\u2014Est-ce qu'il y avait un revolver dans la main du policier? Oui. Je ne sais pas s'il voulait tirer ou non, mais il y avait un revolver dans sa main.\n\u2014Combien de rafales avez-vous entendues? Seulement une.\n\u2014Est-ce que les deux policiers sont tomb\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite de cette m\u00eame rafale de coups? Oui.\n\u2014Est-ce que vous pouvez dire qui a tir\u00e9? Je ne sais pas. J'ai vu l'homme avec l'habit de P\u00e8re No\u00ebl et d'autres aussi \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui, mais je ne sais pas qui a tir\u00e9.\n\u2014Quelle \u00e9tait la grandeur du P\u00e8re No\u00ebl? Il \u00e9tait plus grand que mon mari, qui mesure 5'8\", mais il \u00e9tait plus petit que ce M. Parisse, qui est 6'4 1\/2. Il \u00e9tait approximativement un pouce de moins grand que M. Parisse, alors 6'3.\n\u2014Combien de personnes se trouvaient devant la banque au moment de la fusillade? Au moins trois.\n\u2014Avez-vous d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la m\u00eame chose aux policiers qui vous ont interrog\u00e9e?

She was the only person in charge of the premises and serving customers until about 11.30 A.M., when the noon hour staff began to enter. I also swear that on the following morning, Friday, December 14, I arrived in my car in front of the Coffee Pot at 9:30 A.M., where I picked up Harold Green, who was waiting outside the restaurant, and gave him a lift in my car to Chomedey, where I dropped him off. I left him in Chomedey at about 10:05 A.M., December 14, 1962.\nFrank Grilly\nMontreal, July the 4th, 1964\nConsid\u00e9r\u00e9 au regard des dispositions de l'article 596 du Code, il est clair que ce renvoi du Ministre de la Justice est celui qu'autorise le paragraphe (b) de cet article 596.\n596. Sur une demande de cl\u00e9mence de la Couronne, faite par ou pour une personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de proc\u00e9dures sur un acte d'accusation, le ministre de la Justice peut\na) prescrire, au moyen d'une ordonnance \u00e9crite, un nouveau proc\u00e8s devant une cour qu'il juge appropri\u00e9e, si, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate, il est convaincu que, dans les circonstances, un nouveau proc\u00e8s devrait \u00eatre prescrit;\nb) \u00e0 toute \u00e9poque, d\u00e9f\u00e9rer la cause \u00e0 la cour d'appel pour audition et d\u00e9cision par cette cour comme s'il s'agissait d'un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e; ou\nc) \u00e0 toute \u00e9poque, soumettre \u00e0 la cour d'appel, pour conna\u00eetre son opinion, toute question sur laquelle il d\u00e9sire l'assistance de cette cour, et la cour doit donner son opinion en cons\u00e9quence.\nDans une requ\u00eate subs\u00e9quement produite au greffe de la Cour d'Appel, l'appelant demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'entendre, outre dame Helen Dallos et Frank Grilly, trois autres personnes, soit Armand Morin, Andr\u00e9 Gagnon et Jean-Paul Fournel. Cependant, advenant l'audition, l'appelant, d'une part, renon\u00e7a \u00e0 faire entendre Gagnon et Fournel, et la Cour, d'autre part, \u00e9tant d'avis que le t\u00e9moignage de Morin ne pouvait assister l'appelant, exer\u00e7a la discr\u00e9tion qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e au paragraphe (c) du dispositif du renvoi et refusa d'entendre ce t\u00e9moin. Quant \u00e0 Frank Grilly et dame Helen Dallos, les parties d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent s'en tenir \u00e0 l'affidavit de Grilly purement et simplement et \u00e0 celui de dame Dallos, sujet dans ce dernier cas au droit de la Couronne de contre-interroger.\nIl fut alors proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un tr\u00e8s bref interrogatoire de dame Dallos et la Cour du banc de la reine[4], apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les avocats des parties, examin\u00e9 le dossier et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, proc\u00e9da, le 17 septembre 1964, \u00e0 rendre jugement comme s'il s'agissait d'un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e et rejeta cet appel par un jugement unanime. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est de ce jugement.\nIl convient de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer d'abord \u00e0 l'objection faite par la Couronne \u00e0 la juridiction de cette Cour. Il n'y a pas d'appel, dit-on, \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada d'une d\u00e9cision rendue par un tribunal d'appel d'une province sur un renvoi fait en vertu de l'article 596 (b) du Code et, ajoute-t-on subsidiairement, au factum de la Couronne, si un tel appel existe, il ne peut \u00eatre question d'un appel de plano mais d'un appel qui doit \u00eatre permis \u00e0 la suite d'une requ\u00eate pour permission d'appeler. Au soutien de la n\u00e9gation de l'appel, on cherche \u00e0 faire une analogie entre les termes suivants de l'article 596 (b) du Code, \u00ab comme s'il s'agissait d'un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e \u00bb et les termes suivants de l'article 55(2) de la Loi sur la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada relatif aux questions d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 cette Cour par le Gouverneur en conseil \u00ab de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que dans le cas d'un jugement rendu sur un appel port\u00e9 devant la Cour \u00bb; on en d\u00e9duit que le renvoi autoris\u00e9 par l'article 596 (b) du Code n'est pas un appel mais que, par les termes ci-dessus de l'article, le Parlement a tout simplement indiqu\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre \u00e9tait celle r\u00e9gissant les appels ordinaires et que la conclusion de la Cour d'Appel sur un tel renvoi n'\u00e9quivaut en substance qu'\u00e0 une simple opinion et non \u00e0 un jugement. Pour disposer de cet argument, il suffit de dire, \u00e0 mon avis, que le renvoi autoris\u00e9 par l'article 55 de la Loi sur la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a pour objet l'obtention d'une \u00ab opinion \u00bb, ainsi qu'il appert du paragraphe 2 de cet article et que celui qu'autorise l'article 596 (b) du Code Criminel a pour objet l'obtention d'une \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb, ainsi qu'il appert du texte m\u00eame de l'article 596 (b). Il n'y a donc pas d'analogie. Les dispositions de l'article 596 (b) du Code prescrivent en termes bien clairs que la cause est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00ab pour audition et d\u00e9cision comme s'il s'agissait d'un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e \u00bb ou, suivant la version anglaise de l'article 596 (b) du Code, \u00ab for hearing and determination as if it were an appeal by the convicted person. \u00bb Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 592 du Code, les d\u00e9cisions que la Cour d'Appel peut rendre dans un appel interjet\u00e9 par la personne condamn\u00e9e sont, soit de rejeter l'appel purement et simplement ou l'accueillir, et, dans ce dernier cas, ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s ou prononcer un acquittement. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, la Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter l'appel, confirmant ainsi la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, et, d\u00e8s lors, les dispositions de l'article 597A du Code Criminel sont applicables:\n597A. Nonobstant toute autre disposition de la pr\u00e9sente loi, une personne\na) qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 mort et dont la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 est confirm\u00e9e par la cour d'appel, ou\nb) qui est acquitt\u00e9e d'une infraction punissable de mort et dont l'acquittement est \u00e9cart\u00e9 par la cour d'appel,\npeut interjeter appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada sur toute question de droit ou de fait ou toute question mixte de droit et de fait.\nIl s'ensuit que la pr\u00e9tention principale et la pr\u00e9tention subsidiaire de la Couronne ne peuvent \u00eatre admises.\nAu m\u00e9rite de l'appel, les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant, telles que formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audition, sont que la Cour d'Appel aurait err\u00e9 dans l'appr\u00e9ciation du renvoi du Ministre, dans l'appr\u00e9ciation de l'affidavit de Grilly et de la d\u00e9position compl\u00e8te de dame Dallos et qu'elle aurait aussi err\u00e9 en refusant d'entendre Morin. Et, ajoute-t-on, si les faits ainsi rapport\u00e9s par Grilly et dame Dallos et ceux dont Morin aurait pu t\u00e9moigner avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis aux jur\u00e9s, avec les directives l\u00e9galement appropri\u00e9es, ceci aurait raisonnablement accru la possibilit\u00e9 pour les jur\u00e9s de rendre un verdict de meurtre non qualifi\u00e9 ou voire m\u00eame un verdict d'acquittement.\nNonobstant toute la latitude accord\u00e9e au procureur de l'appelant pour lui permettre d'\u00e9tablir, si possible, le bienfond\u00e9 de ces griefs, aussi bien que le bien-fond\u00e9 du grief additionnel par lui soulev\u00e9 en r\u00e9plique, quant \u00e0 l'absence de directives au proc\u00e8s sur la question d'ivresse, nous sommes tous d'avis qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 ce faire.\nEn Cour d'Appel, M. le Juge en chef Tremblay, r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 ces t\u00e9moignages et parlant pour lui et pour tous ses coll\u00e8gues, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9:\nSur le tout, je suis absolument convaincu que si ces t\u00e9moignages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s, le verdict e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessairement le m\u00eame.\nC'est l\u00e0 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle nous en sommes arriv\u00e9s apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 attentivement les arguments faits de part et d'autre sur la port\u00e9e des t\u00e9moignages offerts par l'appelant.\nAvant de clore, il est peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 propos d'ajouter que du fait que les policiers aient pu inviter dame Dallos \u00e0 ne parler \u00e0 personne autre qu'\u00e0 eux, ainsi qu'elle en t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 la fin de sa d\u00e9position, on ne saurait inf\u00e9rer, sous les circonstances, qu'ils aient voulu ainsi l'emp\u00eacher de communiquer avec la d\u00e9fense.\nNous sommes tous d'opinion que cet appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs de l'appelant: D.

Ce jugement portait la date du 5 mars 1963. L'inscription en appel ne fut signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 I'intim\u00e9 que le 5 avril 1963, soit le jour suivant I'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'appel de trente jours prescrit par I'art. 1209 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile. L'intim\u00e9 fit alors une motion pour faire d\u00e9clarer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d'appel. La Cour d'appel consid\u00e9ra que I'appelant n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu'il portait et rejeta I'appel. Un appel de plano fut inscrit devant cette Cour. Par la suite, I'appelant fit une motion pour permission d'appeler et I'intim\u00e9 produisit une motion pour faire rejeter I'appel de plano. Ces deux motions furent entendues lors de I'audition de la cause.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe Juge en chef Taschereau et le Juge Abbott: Il n'y a aucun montant en jeu et tout ce que cette Cour pourrait accorder par son jugement serait de d\u00e9terminer seulement une question de d\u00e9lai. Le droit de juger qui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour d\u00e9pend non pas de la demande contenue dans I'action, mais de ce qui fait I'objet de la contestation de I'appel projet\u00e9 et dont est saisie la Cour. La motion pour faire rejeter I'appel de plano doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\nCette Cour a le droit d'accorder une permission d'appeler en vertu des dispositions de I'art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, mais dans les circonstances actuelles une telle permission ne peut pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Il n'y a aucune question importante qui autorise I'intervention de cette Cour suivant les normes \u00e9tablies par les jugements ant\u00e9rieurs.\nLe Juge Cartwright partage I'opinion que I'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe Juge Fauteux et le Juge Hall: Si la Cour venait \u00e0 la conclusion que le jugement dont est appel est mal fond\u00e9, il faudrait alors remettre la cause \u00e0 la Cour d'appel pour audition au m\u00e9rite. Le jugement a quo n'est donc pas un jugement prononc\u00e9 selon I'art. 36(a) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame \u00ab dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire o\u00f9 le montant ou la valeur de la mati\u00e8re en litige dans I'appel d\u00e9passe $10,000 \u00bb. La motion pour rejet d'appel doit donc \u00eatre admise. D'autre part, la demande pour permission d'appeler para\u00eet justifi\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Les circonstances de cette cause militaient pour consid\u00e9rer au m\u00e9rite, comme d'ailleurs il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de ce faire, le bien ou mal fond\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent appel.\nAu m\u00e9rite, la Cour d'appel, en pr\u00e9sence du dossier tel qu'alors constitu\u00e9, a eu raison de dire que I'appelant n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu'il porte. Il y a lieu, \u00e0 moins d'indices au contraire, de pr\u00e9sumer que la prononciation d'un jugement \u00e0 I'audience ou son d\u00e9p\u00f4t au greffe ont lieu \u00e0 la date inscrite au jugement. Il incombait donc \u00e0 I'appelant de repousser cette pr\u00e9somption lorsque cette question fut soulev\u00e9e devant la Cour d'appel. La Cour d'appel n'avait pas devant elle une preuve ad\u00e9quate pour lui permettre de conclure que le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu'il porte. Il s'ensuit que la computation du d\u00e9lai d'appel devait se faire \u00e0 compter de cette date et que I'inscription fut signifi\u00e9e apr\u00e8s I'expiration de ce d\u00e9lai.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], d\u00e9clarant I'appelant d\u00e9chu de son droit d'en appeler d'un jugement du juge Pr\u00e9vost. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nMelvin L. Rothman et Daniel Miller, pour le d\u00e9fendeur, appelant.\nJean Martineau, C.R., et Jacques Viau, C.R., pour le demandeur, intim\u00e9.\nLe jugement du Juge en chef et du Juge Abbott fut rendu par\nLE JUGE EN CHEF:\u2014L'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause a intent\u00e9 contre I'appelant une action qui a donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 un litige assez compliqu\u00e9. La cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue par M. le Juge Claude Pr\u00e9vost qui a maintenu I'action du demandeur avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement de M. le Juge Pr\u00e9vost n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 I'audience tel que I'autorise le para. 1 de I'art. 537 du Code de proc\u00e9dure, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le juge au proc\u00e8s qui l'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au greffe de la Cour sous sa signature. C'est le second paragraphe de l'art. 537 qui autorise ce mode.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur contre qui jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le 5 mars 1963, a port\u00e9 cette cause en appel mais n'a fait signifier l'inscription \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9-demandeur que le 5 avril 1963, soit le trente et uni\u00e8me jour apr\u00e8s que le jugement fut rendu. Les procureurs du pr\u00e9sent intim\u00e9 ont alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion le 10 avril de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine, demandant le rejet de cet appel comme tardif vu que, selon eux, les d\u00e9lais expiraient le 4 avril. Il y avait donc, \u00e0 cause de ce retard, d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit de se pourvoir. Devant la Cour inf\u00e9rieure, l'appelant a plaid\u00e9 que les d\u00e9lais ne devaient pas \u00eatre comput\u00e9s depuis la date d'inscription, mais bien depuis la date o\u00f9 les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es du prononc\u00e9 de ce jugement vu qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu s\u00e9ance tenante.\nLa Cour du banc de la reine[2] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'appelant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qui est indiqu\u00e9e et que, cons\u00e9quemment, cette derni\u00e8re doit \u00eatre tenue comme exacte. La Cour du banc de la reine ajoute que l'appelant Javitch a fait signifier son avis le trente et uni\u00e8me jour et que celui-ci doit \u00eatre tenu comme tardif et ill\u00e9gal. Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi v. Thomas[3]; Dame Gagn\u00e9 v. La Banque Provinciale du Canada[4]. La Cour a donc accord\u00e9 la motion de l'intim\u00e9 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l'appelant d\u00e9chu de son droit en appel qu'il avait form\u00e9, a refus\u00e9 d'entretenir son recours et a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa question primordiale en litige est de d\u00e9terminer si la Cour du banc de la reine a mal jug\u00e9 en d\u00e9cidant que le pourvoi en appel \u00e9tait tardif. Il n'y a aucun montant en jeu, et tout ce que cette Cour pourrait accorder par le jugement que nous serions appel\u00e9s \u00e0 rendre serait de d\u00e9terminer seulement une question de d\u00e9lai. Le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Tremblay v. Duke Price Power Co.[5] Il ne faut pas oublier que le droit de juger qui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 notre Cour d\u00e9pend non pas de la demande contenue dans l'action, mais de ce qui fait l'objet de la contestation de l'appel projet\u00e9 et dont est saisie la Cour. Vide Fiset v. Morin[6]. Dans cette cause la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas juridiction pour entendre cet appel. Il s'agissait de d\u00e9terminer le montant d'un cautionnement qui devait \u00eatre fourni. On en est unanimement arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y avait pas de montant en jeu suivant les dispositions de l'art. 39 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame du temps, qui est maintenant l'art. 36.\nL'appelant a produit une motion pour obtenir permission d'appeler, et l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement produit une motion pour faire rejeter l'appel de plano. Certainement que cette Cour a le droit d'accorder une permission d'appeler en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 41, mais je ne crois pas, dans les circonstances actuelles, qu'une telle permission doive \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Rien ne justifie, en effet, m\u00eame si le jugement ant\u00e9rieur \u00e9tait erron\u00e9, que cette demande soit accord\u00e9e. Je ne vois aucune question importante qui autorise l'intervention de cette Cour suivant les normes \u00e9tablies par les jugements ant\u00e9rieurs.\nIl s'ensuit donc que la motion pour permission d'appeler doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. Quant \u00e0 la motion pour faire rejeter l'appel de plano, il s'ensuit logiquement qu'elle doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens et que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 \u00e9galement avec d\u00e9pens. Il n'y aura pas de frais pour ou contre le mis-en-cause qui est registrateur de la Division d'Enregistrement de Montr\u00e9al.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014I agree in the result, reached by all the other Members of the Court, that the appeal should be dismissed, that the respondent should recover from the appellant the costs of the appeal, of the motion to quash and of the motion for leave to appeal, and that there should, be no order as to costs for or against the mis-en-cause.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux et Hall fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Par jugement en date du 5 mars 1963, M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, accueillant une action intent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, annulait une promesse d'achat d'une ferme au prix de $50,000 et ordonnait la radiation du bordereau enregistr\u00e9 sur cette ferme par l'appelant. Ce dernier appela de ce jugement; mais son inscription en appel dat\u00e9e du 4 avril 1963 ne fut signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 que le 5 avril 1963, soit le jour suivant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'appel de trente jours prescrit \u00e0 l'art. 1209 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile. C'est alors que le 10 avril suivant, l'intim\u00e9 fit motion pour faire d\u00e9clarer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d'appel. La Cour d'appel[7] consid\u00e9ra que ce d\u00e9lai de trente jours est de rigueur, que l'appel doit se former par la production d'une inscription et de sa signification dans ce d\u00e9lai de trente jours, sous peine de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, que l'appelant n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement du juge Pr\u00e9vost aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la date qu'il porte, que cette date doit \u00eatre tenue comme exacte et que la signification de l'inscription, faite trente et un jours apr\u00e8s la date du jugement, devait \u00eatre tenue comme tardive et ill\u00e9gale. Et la Cour apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi v. Thomas[8], Dame Gagn\u00e9 v. La Banque Provinciale du Canada[9], d\u00e9clara par un jugement unanime rendu le 16 avril 1963 que la motion de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e et que l'appelant \u00e9tait d\u00e9chu du droit \u00e0 l'appel qu'il avait form\u00e9, et cet appel fut rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, interjet\u00e9 de plano, est de ce jugement.\nPar la suite, l'appelant fit d'autres proc\u00e9dures. Le 12 septembre 1963, il demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'appel la permission de produire au dossier, comme exhibit A-1, un extrait du plumitif o\u00f9 il appara\u00eet que le jugement de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost, dat\u00e9 du 5 mars, fut produit au bureau du protonotaire le 6 mars et, comme exhibit A-2, une attestation du greffier de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure que ce jugement du juge Pr\u00e9vost avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu le 6 mars. En fait, l'appelant avait communiqu\u00e9, sans les produire, la teneur de ces pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 la Cour d'appel lors de l'audition sur la motion pour faire d\u00e9clarer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d'appel. Cette motion pour production d'exhibits fut rejet\u00e9e. Le 7 octobre 1963, l'appelant logea \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada une demande de permission d'appeler du jugement a quo; la consid\u00e9ration de cette demande fut ult\u00e9rieurement diff\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audition de l'appel au m\u00e9rite. Le 17 octobre 1963, l'appelant, invoquant les dispositions de l'art. 67 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'appel d'inclure au dossier les exhibits A-1 et A-2 et, en plus, un affidavit de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost \u00e9tablissant que le jugement de ce dernier n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience; cette demande fut accord\u00e9e, sauf en ce qui concerne l'affidavit en question, vu que celui-ci n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la Cour d'appel quand le jugement du 16 avril pronon\u00e7ant la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance fut rendu.\nD'autre part, l'intim\u00e9 demanda \u00e0 cette Cour d'annuler l'appel log\u00e9 de plano, all\u00e9guant que le jugement a quo n'est pas un jugement rendu dans une proc\u00e9dure o\u00f9 le montant ou la valeur de la mati\u00e8re en litige exc\u00e8de $10,000, mais qu'il s'agit tout simplement d'un jugement d\u00e9clarant la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d'appel sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au m\u00e9rite de la cause. La seule question en litige devant nous a trait au bien ou mal fond\u00e9 du jugement de la Cour d'appel, accueillant la motion l'intim\u00e9 pour faire d\u00e9clarer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit de l'appelant \u00e0 former un appel en Cour du banc de la reine. Dussions-nous conclure au mal fond\u00e9 de ce jugement, tout ce que nous pourrions faire serait de remettre la cause \u00e0 la Cour d'appel pour audition au m\u00e9rite. Gatineau Power Co. v. Cross.[10] Le jugement a quo n'est donc pas un jugement prononc\u00e9 \u00ab dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire o\u00f9 le montant ou la valeur de la mati\u00e8re en litige dans l'appel d\u00e9passe $10,000 \u00bb. Art. 36(a) Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame. Aussi bien cette motion de l'intim\u00e9 pour annulation de l'appel log\u00e9 de plano \u00e0 cette Cour doit \u00eatre admise avec d\u00e9pens.\nD'autre part, la demande de l'appelant pour permission d'appeler \u00e0 cette Cour me para\u00eet justifi\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e aux conditions ordinaires, soit frais \u00e0 suivre le sort de l'appel. L'importance du montant ou de la valeur de la mati\u00e8re en litige en premi\u00e8re instance, les circonstances relatives \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 du jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le point de d\u00e9part pour la computation des d\u00e9lais d'appel de ce jugement, la d\u00e9claration de la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de ce droit d'appel sont autant de circonstances qui, entre autres, militaient, \u00e0 mon avis, pour consid\u00e9rer au m\u00e9rite, comme d'ailleurs il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de ce faire, le bien ou mal fonde du pr\u00e9sent appel. Une telle demande fut accord\u00e9e par cette Cour dans Robert v. Marquis[11] o\u00f9 il s'agissait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de l'appel d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine accueillant une motion pour faire rejeter un appel au motif que l'inscription en appel \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale.\nApr\u00e8s audition sur le m\u00e9rite, cependant, je dois conclure que la Cour d'appel, en pr\u00e9sence du dossier tel qu'alors constitu\u00e9, a eu raison de dire que l'appelant n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le jugement du juge Pr\u00e9vost avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu'il porte.\nLe jugement de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost n'est pas accompagn\u00e9 des instructions que mentionne l'art. 538 C.P.C.; rien au dossier ne sugg\u00e8re une application des dispositions de cet article \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce. Par ailleurs, ce jugement de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost pouvait, suivant le premier alin\u00e9a de l'art. 537 C.P.C. \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, ou suivant le second alin\u00e9a du m\u00eame article, en le d\u00e9posant au greffe \u00e0 la date qu'il porte avec alors obligation du protonotaire d'en donner avis. Tenant compte de la maxime omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta, je crois qu'il y a lieu, \u00e0 moins d'indices au contraire, de pr\u00e9sumer que la prononciation \u00e0 l'audience ou le d\u00e9p\u00f4t au greffe ont lieu \u00e0 la date inscrite au jugement. Il incombait donc \u00e0 l'appelant de repousser cette pr\u00e9somption lorsque cette question fut soulev\u00e9e en Cour d'appel.\nAux termes m\u00eames de son inscription en appel, l'appelant lui-m\u00eame pr\u00e9cise qu'il appelle \u00ab from the judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal, Province of Quebec, rendered by Pr\u00e9vost J., on March 5, 1963 \u00bb. Quant aux entr\u00e9es au plumitif, exhibit A-1, elles se lisent comme suit:\n1963\nMarch 5.\u2014Jugement DONNE ACTE au demandeur de son offre et de son renouvellement d'offre de la somme de $2,000.00 en capital et de $213.90 en int\u00e9r\u00eat etc.\nJuge Pr\u00e9vost.\nProd. 6 March 1963.\nApril 4\u2014Inscription in Appeal sign, et rapp. M Philipp, Bloomfield and Co.\nIl est manifeste et admis que l'entr\u00e9e du 4 avril indiquant que l'inscription fut signifi\u00e9e le 4 avril est inexacte; le rapport du huissier fait foi que cette signification ne fut faite que le 5 avril apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai de l'appel. Si, par ailleurs, il faut retenir que l'entr\u00e9e apparemment faite le 5 mars indique que le jugement fut produit le 6 mars, il ne s'ensuit pas que le jugement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, comme il pouvait valablement l'\u00eatre, prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience le 5 mars. L'appelant l'a d'ailleurs reconnu par l'all\u00e9gation suivante apparaissant \u00e0 sa motion faite le 15 octobre 1963:\nWHEREAS in order that Defendant-Appellant's case be properly presented before the Supreme Court of Canada it is essential that an affidavit of the Honourable Mr. Justice Pr\u00e9vost establishing that the judgment in the Superior Court had not been rendered in open Court, form part of the said Joint Record.\nOn peut ajouter que rien au dossier ne sugg\u00e8re, qu'assumant que cet affidavit eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cisif de la question, on ne pouvait avec une diligence raisonnable l'obtenir et le produire en Cour d'appel lors de l'audition de la motion pour faire d\u00e9clarer la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d'appel. Il serait contraire aux principes r\u00e9gissant les appels de donner maintenant effet \u00e0 cet affidavit ou \u00e0 d'autres pi\u00e8ces offertes dans pareilles circonstances.

Au surplus, cet exhibit A-2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement produit au dossier, comme d'ailleurs l'exhibit A-1, ainsi qu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 aux raisons de jugement de M. le juge en chef Tremblay. Dossier conjoint, page 43. Ajoutons, enfin, qu'\u00e0 l'audition devant nous, l'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit en date du 3 octobre 1963, sign\u00e9 par le m\u00eame greffier, dans lequel celui-ci d\u00e9clare:\n1o. Le 16 avril 1963, j'ai sign\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 la demande des procureurs de monsieur Javitch, lettre qu'ils avaient eux-m\u00eames r\u00e9dig\u00e9s (sic) sur du papier \u00e0 lettre du protonotaire.\n2o. Dans cette lettre, il \u00e9tait dit que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure rendu dans cette cause l'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le 6 mars 1963 et que cela apparaissait dans le livre des d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n3o. J'ai depuis examin\u00e9 le dossier, l'original du jugement et le plumitif du protonotaire et, apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le tout, je r\u00e9alise que cette mention du 6 mars 1963 dans le livre des d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9s, mention que j'y ai moi-m\u00eame \u00e9crite, est erron\u00e9e parce que l'original du jugement est dat\u00e9 du 5 mars 1963 et parce qu'il n'y a rien ni au dossier ni dans les livres du protonotaire pouvant indiquer qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une autre date que celle qu'il porte.\nEt j'ai sign\u00e9.\n(sign\u00e9) Ovide Mercure\nLa r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cet affidavit est faite exclusivement pour d\u00e9montrer le danger qu'il y a de tenir compte de pi\u00e8ces irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement produites.\nEn somme, la Cour d'appel n'avait pas devant elle une preuve ad\u00e9quate pour lui permettre de conclure que le jugement de M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu'il porte. Il s'en suit que la computation du d\u00e9lai d'appel devait se faire \u00e0 compter de cette date et que l'inscription fut signifi\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration de ce d\u00e9lai.

Le secr\u00e9taire refusa de d\u00e9clarer si la Commission avait ou non la lettre en question, r\u00e9clama le privil\u00e8ge de l'art. 332 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile et \u00e0 cette fin produisit une lettre du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral se lisant ainsi: \u00ab Il est d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que les faits et documents recueillis au cours des enqu\u00eates faites par la Commission ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s \u00bb. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance rejeta l'objection de la Commission, consid\u00e9ra qu'il appartenait au juge et non au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9terminer si l'ordre public \u00e9tait en jeu, et qu'\u00e0 son avis tel n'\u00e9tait pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'appel. L'appelant obtint permission d'appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le Juge Abbott \u00e9tant dissident.\nLe Juge en chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Hall: L'article 332 rel\u00e8ve le fonctionnaire de l'obligation impos\u00e9e aux t\u00e9moins de r\u00e9pondre et de produire des pi\u00e8ces ou autres choses lorsque l'ordre public est concern\u00e9. Ce privil\u00e8ge n'est pourtant pas absolu. Il n'est \u00e9tendu aux personnes mentionn\u00e9es dans l'article que si et \u00ab lorsque le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral atteste par un \u00e9crit en la possession du t\u00e9moin, qui doit le produire, que l'ordre public est concern\u00e9 dans les faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire l'interroger \u00bb. L'attestation dans le cas pr\u00e9sent ne r\u00e9pond pas enti\u00e8rement et ad\u00e9quatement aux exigences de ces prescriptions. Les questions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ordonn\u00e9 au secr\u00e9taire de r\u00e9pondre n'indiquent pas par elles-m\u00eames que l'ordre public est en jeu. De plus, dans ses termes, l'attestation n'est pas reli\u00e9e aux faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire interroger le t\u00e9moin, mais constitue une formule g\u00e9n\u00e9rale apte \u00e0 valoir dans toutes les causes, sans \u00e9gard aux faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire interroger.\nLe Juge Abbott, dissident: L'intitul\u00e9 de la lettre mentionne sp\u00e9cialement les proc\u00e9dures dans lesquelles on tenta de la faire produire. Cette lettre autorise la Commission de se pr\u00e9valoir du privil\u00e8ge et son langage \u00e9tait suffisant pour d\u00e9signer la \u00ab class of communications \u00bb pour laquelle le privil\u00e8ge peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9, selon l'expression employ\u00e9e dans Duncan v. Cammell, Laird and Co., [1942] A.C. 624. Le secr\u00e9taire de la Commission avait donc le droit de se pr\u00e9valoir du privil\u00e8ge de refuser de t\u00e9moigner pour des raisons d'ordre public.\nLa jurisprudence des Cours du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9tablie depuis plus d'un si\u00e8cle supporte la proposition que c'est seulement le chef du d\u00e9partement qui est en position et qui a le droit de d\u00e9cider si la divulgation sera contre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, et qu'aucune Cour n'a le droit d'aller au-del\u00e0 de cette d\u00e9cision. Il faudrait une raison bien grave pour justifier une interf\u00e9rence avec cette jurisprudence. Il n'est pas possible de trouver cette raison dans le r\u00e9cent jugement de la Cour d'appel en Angleterre dans In Re Grosvenor Hotel (N\u00b0 2), [1964] 3 All E.R. 354.\nWitness\u2014Examination\u2014Bankruptcy\u2014Crown privilege\u2014Public policy\u2014Attorney General's certificate\u2014No reference to specific facts\u2014Whether invalid for vagueness\u2014Whether Court can go behind certificate\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 332.\nDuring the course of an examination of the secretary of the Quebec Securities Commission before the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy, the appellant, as liquidator of company M, sought the production of a letter alleged to have been written to the Commission by A at a time when the affairs of company M were being investigated by the Commission. The secretary refused to state whether or not the Commission had such a letter, claimed the privilege provided by art. 332 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in support of that claim produced a letter from the Attorney General of Quebec reading: \"It is of public interest that the facts and documents assembled in the course of inquiries by the Commission should not be disclosed\". The trial judge rejected the objection of the Commission and held that it was for the Court and not for the Attorney General to decide if public order was concerned, and that in this case it was not. This decision was reversed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: Article 332 of the Code of Civil Procedure exempts public officials from the duty to testify and produce documents where public order is involved, provided that the Attorney General's certificate states that this is so in relation to the particular facts in issue. The certificate in this case did not satisfy that requirement. The precise questions which the witness was ordered to answer did not indicate by themselves that public order was concerned. Furthermore, the certificate was not related to the particular facts on which the appellant wished to examine the secretary, but constituted a general formula capable of serving in all cases, regardless of the facts.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: The heading of the letter specified the legal proceedings in which the production of documents was being sought. The letter authorized the Commission to invoke the privilege and its language was sufficient to designate a \"class of communications\" for which the privilege could be claimed, as that term was used in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird and Co., [1942] A.C. 624. The secretary of the Commission was therefore entitled to claim the privilege of refusing to testify on grounds of public policy. The jurisprudence of the Quebec Courts established now for more than a century supports the contention that it is only the head of a Department of State who is in a position and who has the right to decide whether the disclosure will be against the public interest, and that no Court has the right to go behind that decision. It would require a very compelling reason to warrant any interference with that jurisprudence. It is not possible to find that reason in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in England in In Re Grosvenor Hotel (No. 2), [1964] 3 All E.R. 354.\nAPPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec, infirmant un jugement du Juge Hannen. Appel maintenu, le Juge Abbott \u00e9tant dissident.\nClaude Beauchemin, pour l'appelant.\nC. A. Geoffrion, C.R., pour l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement du Juge en chef Taschereau et des Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Hall fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014L'appelant, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 de syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s Exploration Co. Ltd., ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e la Compagnie, a produit entre les mains de H. B. Savage, syndic \u00e0 la faillite de la succession de feu J.-Antoine Mercier, ci-devant vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Compagnie, une r\u00e9clamation relative \u00e0 une somme d'environ $45,000 en esp\u00e8ces contenues dans un coffret de s\u00fbret\u00e9 \u00e0 la Mercantile Bank of Canada. Savage d\u00e9cida de rejeter cette r\u00e9clamation et Gagnon s'adressa \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, Division de Faillite, pour faire reviser cette d\u00e9cision.\nAux fins d'\u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa demande, Gagnon requit et obtint de la Cour une ordonnance autorisant l'interrogatoire du secr\u00e9taire de la Commission intim\u00e9e et lui enjoignant de produire certains documents en la possession de la Commission qui avait fait enqu\u00eate sur les affaires de la Compagnie et arr\u00eat\u00e9 la libre disposition de ces argents. Celui-ci, obtemp\u00e9rant \u00e0 cette ordonnance, fut entendu comme t\u00e9moin et produisit certains documents. Au cours de son interrogatoire, il refusa cependant de r\u00e9pondre lorsqu'on lui demanda si la Commission avait en sa possession l'original ou un photostat d'une lettre, dat\u00e9e le ou vers le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1958, \u00e0 elle adress\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e par Gilbert Ayers, pr\u00e9sident de la Compagnie. Dans cette lettre, Ayers aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il op\u00e9rait les fonds contenus dans ce coffret comme fonds corporatifs de la Compagnie et aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission la lib\u00e9ration de ces argents. Devant ce refus, Gagnon fit une requ\u00eate formelle pour obtenir de la Cour une ordonnance enjoignant au secr\u00e9taire de la Commission de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question ci-dessus et, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d'une r\u00e9ponse affirmative, de produire la lettre et relater les circonstances en entourant la remise \u00e0 la Commission. La Commission fit objection \u00e0 cette demande et, \u00e0 ces fins, son secr\u00e9taire produisit une lettre du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, adress\u00e9e au Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec, et ainsi libell\u00e9e:\nMinist\u00e8re du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nProvince de Qu\u00e9bec\nDossier n\u00b0 5388-62\nMontr\u00e9al, P.Q.\nle 12 f\u00e9vrier 1963\nMe Maurice D\u00e9sy, c.r.,\nPr\u00e9sident,\nCommission des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec,\n625 ouest, Boul.

II ne peut \u00eatre contraint de d\u00e9clarer ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 confidentiellement \u00e0 raison de son caract\u00e8re professionnel comme aviseur religieux ou l\u00e9gal, ou comme fonctionnaire de I'Etat lorsque I'ordre public y est concern\u00e9.\nIl en est de m\u00eame \u00e0 I'\u00e9gard d'un membre, officier ou employ\u00e9 d'une commission, d'un office ou d'un autre organisme dont les membres sont nomm\u00e9s par le lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil, lorsque le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou le solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province atteste, par un \u00e9crit en la possession du t\u00e9moin, qui doit le produire, que l'ordre public est concern\u00e9 dans les faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire l'interroger.\nLa requ\u00eate de Gagnon fut prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 pour \u00eatre \u00e9ventuellement accord\u00e9e le 11 mars 1963. En substance, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e9ra que bien que l'art. 332 C.P.C. s'appliquait aux proc\u00e9dures faites sous l'empire de la Loi de Faillite, il appartenait au Juge et non au Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de d\u00e9terminer, en derni\u00e8re analyse, si l'ordre public \u00e9tait en jeu et qu'\u00e0 son avis, tel n'\u00e9tait pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire rendue le 16 d\u00e9cembre 1963. MM. les Juges Taschereau et Badeaux, de la majorit\u00e9, exprim\u00e8rent l'avis, \u00e0 l'instar du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que l'art. 332 C.P.C. s'appliquait aux proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de faillite. Ils jug\u00e8rent, cependant, qu'au regard des dispositions de I'article, des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Duncan et al v. Cammell, Laird & Co. Ltd.[1],\u2014qu'ils distingu\u00e8rent de Regina v. Snider[2],\u2014et de la lettre ci-dessus du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l'objection de la Commission aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accueillie. Dissident, M. le Juge Hyde exprima l'avis que la formule utilis\u00e9e par le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour soumettre l'objection de la preuve est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ne r\u00e9pond pas aux exigences de l'art. 332 C.P.C. et, partant, ineffective pour valider l'objection.\nL'appelant a demand\u00e9 et obtenu la permission d'appeler \u00e0 cette Cour de cette d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine.\nLa question qui nous est soumise met en regard, en mati\u00e8re de preuve, un principe et l'une des exceptions \u00e0 ce principe. L'article 330 C.P.C. prescrit que le t\u00e9moin qui, sans raison valable, refuse de r\u00e9pondre ou de produire des pi\u00e8ces ou autres choses en sa possession concernant le litige peut y \u00eatre contraint par corps. Ces dispositions confirment et sanctionnent avec une s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ad\u00e9quate et n\u00e9cessaire une r\u00e8gle d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dont l'observance est essentielle \u00e0 l'administration de la justice. Apportant des exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle, le premier alin\u00e9a de l'art. 332 C.P.C. rel\u00e8ve particuli\u00e8rement de l'obligation impos\u00e9e au t\u00e9moin le fonctionnaire de l'\u00c9tat, lorsque l'ordre public est concern\u00e9. On reconna\u00eet, par cette exception, la primaut\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'\u00c9tat lorsque cet int\u00e9r\u00eat et celui du justiciable sont en conflit. Le second alin\u00e9a de cet art. 332 \u00e9tend le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ce privil\u00e8ge, commun\u00e9ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9 \u00ab Crown privilege \u00bb, aux personnes y mentionn\u00e9es et aux conditions y prescrites.\nCe privil\u00e8ge de la Couronne n'est pourtant pas absolu, en ce sens que le droit et la fa\u00e7on de l'invoquer, aussi bien que la validit\u00e9 de son exercice, demeurent sujets \u00e0 des prescriptions que pr\u00e9cise la jurisprudence. Dans Duncan et al. v. Cammell, Laird & Co. Ltd., supra, la Chambre des Lords, apr\u00e8s avoir not\u00e9 que l'ordre public pouvait \u00eatre concern\u00e9 en raison du contenu du document ou de la cat\u00e9gorie dont il fait partie, a jug\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel que la d\u00e9cision minist\u00e9rielle de faire objection \u00e0 la production soit prise par le Ministre, chef politique du Minist\u00e8re concern\u00e9, apr\u00e8s qu'il ait lui-m\u00eame vu et consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le document et form\u00e9 personnellement l'opinion que sa production serait, pour un motif apparaissant suffisamment \u00e0 l'objection, nuisible \u00e0 l'ordre public. Par ailleurs et dans la m\u00eame cause, on a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une objection minist\u00e9rielle validement formul\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas sujette \u00e0 revision par le pouvoir judiciaire; toutefois, cette d\u00e9claration, subs\u00e9quemment consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme obiter dictum a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e comme mal fond\u00e9e dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour d'Appel en Angleterre, soit dans In re Grosvenor Hotel, (No. 2)[3]. La d\u00e9cision de premi\u00e8re instance en cette cause est rapport\u00e9e \u00e0 (No. 2) [1964] 2 All E.R. 674 et celle de la Cour d'Appel[4] dans le Times du vendredi, 31 juillet 1964, p. 7. Ajoutons que, bien que les parties au litige se soient jointes dans une demande de permission d'appeler \u00e0 la Chambre des Lords, cette permission fut refus\u00e9e. En substance, le Ma\u00eetre du R\u00f4le, avec le concours de ses coll\u00e8gues, a rappel\u00e9 que ce sont les juges qui sont les gardiens de la justice et, a-t-il ajout\u00e9, si la confiance qu'on met en eux a un sens et doit avoir une port\u00e9e, ils doivent pouvoir raisonnablement s'assurer que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'\u00c9tat l'emporte sur celui du justiciable, ou \u00e0 tout le moins que l'objection minist\u00e9rielle n'est pas d\u00e9raisonnable comme c'est le cas, \u00e9videmment, lorsqu'il s'agit, par exemple, de documents concernant des secrets militaires, \u00e9changes diplomatiques, \u00ab cabinet papers \u00bb ou d\u00e9cisions politiques prises en haut lieu. Sans doute, les juges useront-ils d'une grande prudence et h\u00e9siteront-ils avant d'exercer ce pouvoir r\u00e9siduaire de revision: mais le fait que celui-ci leur est attribu\u00e9 implique n\u00e9cessairement que, si rares qu'ils soient, il se pr\u00e9sentera des cas o\u00f9 na\u00eetra le devoir de l'exercer. Et il va de soi que, dans chaque cas, varieront les faits invoqu\u00e9s pour le justifier; chacun devant \u00eatre jug\u00e9 \u00e0 son m\u00e9rite.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, il faut retenir avec ces principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux concernant le privil\u00e8ge de la Couronne, que les dispositions particuli\u00e8res du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'art. 332 n'\u00e9tendent ce privil\u00e8ge aux personnes y mentionn\u00e9es que si et \u00ab lorsque le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou le Solliciteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province atteste par un \u00e9crit en la possession du t\u00e9moin, qui doit le produire, que l'ordre public est concern\u00e9 dans les faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire l'interroger \u00bb. A mon avis\u2014et ceci me dispense de consid\u00e9rer toute autre question\u2014l'attestation \u00e9crite donn\u00e9e par le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui invoque l'exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle ne r\u00e9pond pas enti\u00e8rement et ad\u00e9quatement aux exigences des prescriptions ci-dessus. Partageant l'opinion de M. le Juge Hyde, je dirais que les questions pr\u00e9cises auxquelles le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ordonn\u00e9 au Secr\u00e9taire de la Commission de r\u00e9pondre, n'indiquent pas par elles-m\u00eames que l'ordre public soit en jeu et, comme le savant Juge, je suis d'avis que, dans ses termes, l'attestation du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral n'est pas reli\u00e9e, comme elle doit l'\u00eatre pour satisfaire \u00e0 la condition donnant droit au privil\u00e8ge, aux faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire interroger le t\u00e9moin, mais constitue une formule g\u00e9n\u00e9rale apte \u00e0 valoir dans toutes causes, sans \u00e9gard aux faits sur lesquels on d\u00e9sire interroger le t\u00e9moin.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance; avec d\u00e9pens en cette Cour et en Cour du banc de la reine.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014The material facts in this appeal, which are not in dispute, are fully set out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux which I have had the advantage of considering. During the course of an examination of the Secretary of the Quebec Securities Commission before the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy, the appellant, as liquidator of a mining company Mercedes Exploration Co. Ltd., sought the production of a letter alleged to have been written to the Commission on February 25,1958, by one Gilbert Ayers, when the affairs of the said mining company were being investigated by the Commission.\nThe Secretary of the Commission refused to state whether or not the Commission had such a letter in its possession, claimed the privilege provided for under art. 332 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in support of that claim produced and filed a letter dated February 12, 1963, signed by the Attorney General of Quebec. That letter read as follows:\nMinist\u00e8re du Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\nProvince de Qu\u00e9bec\nDossier n\u00b0 5388-62\nMontr\u00e9al, P.Q.\nle 12 f\u00e9vrier 1963.\nMe Maurice D\u00e9sy, c.r.,\nPr\u00e9sident,\nCommission des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec\n625 ouest, Boul.

The learned trial judge sitting in bankruptcy, held that in the circumstances the Commission was not entitled to invoke the privilege which it had claimed. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, Mr. Justice Hyde dissenting. The present appeal, by leave, is from that judgment. It raises two questions both relating to the interpretation and effect of art. 332 C.C.P. which reads:\n332. He cannot be compelled to declare what has been revealed to him confidentially in his professional character as religious or legal adviser, or as an officer of state where public policy is concerned.\nThe same shall apply to any member, officer or employee of a commission, board or other body the members of which are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, whenever the Attorney General or Solicitor-General of the Province certifies, by a writing in the possession of the witness, who must produce the same, that public order is involved in the facts concerning which it is desired to examine him.\nThe second paragraph of this article was added in 1958 by the statue 6-7 Eliz. II, c. 43. It extends to certain Crown agencies the privilege, which may be claimed by an \"officer of state\", of refusing to give evidence or produce documents on grounds of public policy. It also prescribes the authorization which the member or officer of such Crown agency must possess in order to claim the privilege.\nArticle 332 C.C.P. (then art. 275) was contained in the Code of Civil Procedure of 1867. It was retained in the revision of 1897 as art. 332. As I have said the second paragraph was added in 1958 but it does not appear to have introduced any new principle.\nThe two questions, to which I have referred, are these:\n1. Was the Secretary of the Commission, in virtue of the letter signed by the Attorney General, entitled to claim the privilege, provided for under art. 332 C.C.P., of refusing to testify on grounds of public policy?\n2. If his objection was validly taken, should the judge have treated it as conclusive?\nAs to the first of these questions, the letter of February 12, 1963, is signed by one of the ministers specified in art. 332. It is addressed to the President of the Quebec Securities Commission which is a Crown agency coming under the provisions of this article. The heading of the letter specifies the legal proceedings in which the production of documents was being sought and its authorizes the Commission to invoke the privilege provided for in the said article. The basis upon which the privilege was claimed is contained in the first paragraphs of the letter which reads:\nIl est d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public que les faits et documents recueillis au cours des enqu\u00eates faites par la Commission des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec ne soient pas divulgu\u00e9s.\nHyde J. in the Court below considered this letter insufficient as being too general in its terms and said: \"I consider that if the witness is to be excused from compliance with the order the certificate must state categorically 'that public order is involved in the facts concerning which it is desired to examine him'.\" His dissenting opinion was based upon this ground.\nThe letter of the Attorney General claimed the privilege with respect to \"documents recueillis au cours des enqu\u00eates faites par la Commission des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res du Qu\u00e9bec\". It seems to me that this language is sufficient to designate a \"class of communications\" for which privilege can be claimed, as that term was used by Viscount Simon in the Cammell Laird case[5]. The letter the production of which was sought falls within that class. On the whole, therefore, and with deference to those who hold the opposite view I am of opinion that the letter of the Attorney General entitled the Secretary of the Commission to claim the privilege of refusing to testify on grounds of public policy.\nAs to the second question, the principle enunciated in art. 332 C.C.P. appears to have been first considered by the Court of Queen's Bench of Lower Canada in Gugy v. Maguire[6]. In the opening paragraphs of his notes Meredith J., as he then was, says at p. 51:\nThe Judges of this Court are all, I believe, agreed in the opinion, that the Head of a Department of state cannot be compelled, at the instance of a private suitor, to produce an official document in his custody, when the production of the document would, on grounds of public policy, be inexpedient.\nThe question then arises: with whom does it rest to determine whether the production of a particular document is, on such general grounds, inexpedient?\u2014The majority of the Court hold that the Head of the Department having official custody of the paper is necessarily the proper person to determine the question, while one of the members of the Court (M. Justice Mondelet) maintains that it must be determined by the judge.\nThe general principles of law as well as the decisions of the Courts, both in England and the United States appears to me to be entirely in favour of the opinion of the majority of the Court. He then proceeded to review the cases bearing on the question which had been decided in England and the United States, including Beatson v. Skene[7], which is referred to by Viscount Simon in the Cammell Laird case, and which had been decided in 1860 some three years before. In his work \"De la Preuve\" Judge Langelier, relying upon the authority of the Gugy case, says at p. 351;\n840. Mais \u00e0 qui appartient-il de d\u00e9cider si la d\u00e9claration qu'on voudrait obtenir d'un fonctionnaire est contre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public? C'est au fonctionnaire lui-m\u00eame et non au juge.\nArticle 332 C.C.P. was next considered by the Court of Queen's Bench in Minister of National Revenue et al v. Die-Plast Co. Ltd. et al[8]. Casey J. delivered the principal reasons for judgment in which the other members of the Court concurred. After quoting the statement of Meredith J. in the Gugy case to which I have referred, Casey J. says at p. 349:\nSince the decision in the Gugy case there have been others in the same sense. Alain v. Belleau (1897) 1 P.R. 98; H\u00e9bert v. Latour (1914), 15 P.R. 5; Rheault v. Landry (1919), 55 S.C. 1, 20 P.R. 187, and Boyer v. Boyer (1946) P.R. 174.\nIt appears to me that these decisions constitute a jurisprudence which supports the contention that it is only the head of a Department of State who is in a position and who has the right to decide whether the disclosure will be against the public interest, and the further proposition that no Court has the right to go behind the decision\u2014in this case\u2014of the Minister of National Revenue. It would require a very compelling reason to warrant any interference with this jurisprudence and to justify an opinion contrary to that expressed in these decisions. Neither in the judgment a quo nor elsewhere have I been able to find such a reason.\nThese decisions were not questioned in the Court below, Hyde J. basing his dissent solely upon the ground that objection had not been taken in the proper form.\nArticle 332 C.C.P. does not appear to have been considered previously by this Court. I agree with Casey J. however, that it would require a very compelling reason to warrant any interference with this jurisprudence of the Quebec courts established now for more than a century. With respect I cannot find that reason in the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in England in In re Grosvenor Hotel (No. 2)[9] which is referred to by my brother Fauteux in his reasons. This view of the effect of the art. 332 C.C.P. certainly gives to a Minister of the Crown far-reaching power. It may well be that this is out of line with modern day conditions, as to which of course I express no opinion. If that be so, I think the remedy must be sought elsewhere than in the Courts.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppel maintenu avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE ABBOTT \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureur de l'appelant: C.
