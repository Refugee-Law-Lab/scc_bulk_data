Wallbridge, (1879) 2 S.C.R. 616\nDate: 1879-04-15\nWilliam Johnson Taylor (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nAdam Henry Wallbridge (Defendant) Respondent.\n1879: January 21, 22; 1879: April 15.\nPresent: Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nPrincipal and Agent\u2014Trustee and cestui que Trust\u2014Laches.\nIn 1847, the Plaintiff, W.J.T., before leaving Canada, conveyed certain lands, in which he had an interest as assignee of a contract to purchase, to his brother, G.T., one of the Defendants.\nIn April, 1851, G.T., in anticipation of a suit which was afterwards brought by one C. against W.J.T. in relation to the lands in question, without the knowledge of his brother, re\u2011assigned the property to him, and having paid the balance of the purchase money, a deed of the lot issued at G.T.\u2019s request to W.J.T., as such assignee. In October following a power of attorney was sent to, and executed by, W.J.T., who was then in California, in favor of G.T., to enable him (G.T.) to \u201csell the land in question, and to sell or lease any other lands he owned in Canada.\u201d\nIn 1856, G.T. conveyed the property to W., the Respondent, who had acted as solicitor for W.J.T., and had full means of knowing G.T.\u2019s position and powers, for an alleged consideration of $1000, and W. immediately reconveyed to G.T. one-half of the land for an alleged consideration of $200. In 1873, W.J.T. returned to Canada, and in January, 1874, filed a bill impeaching the transactions between his brother and W., seeking to have them declared trustees for him.\nHeld,\u2014(Reversing the judgment of the Court of Error and Appeal and affirming the decree of Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, Strong J., dissenting,) that W.J.T. was the owner of the lands in question, that he had not been debarred by laches or acquiescence from succeeding in the present suit, and that the transactions between G.T. and W. should be set aside.\nAPPEAL to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario, affirming an order of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, dated 2nd February, 1876, in a cause in the said Court of Chancery between William Johnson Taylor (Appellant) Plaintiff, and George Taylor, Adam Henry Wallbridge (Respondent), and George Simpson, Defendants.\nIn this case Plaintiff\u2019s bill sets forth: that in 1851 he was seized in fee simple, or well entitled to the north half of lot No. 8, in the 2nd Concession of the Township of Thurlow, and being out of Canada, he executed a power of attorney to George Taylor, dated 11th October, 1851, authorizing him \u201cto sell all\u201d the said land, as also to act as his attorney \u201cin the sale or leasing of any lands of which\u201d he was the owner in the Province of Canada, known as Canada West; that in the year 1856 one Joseph Canniff exhibited his bill of complaint in the Court of Chancery against Plaintiff, which Plaintiff believed alleged that Canniff had some estate, &c., in the said lands, and registered under said bill a lis pendens against said lands, and George Taylor, as such attorney and agent of Plaintiff, defended against said bill by Lewis Wallbridge and Adam Henry Wallbridge, co-partners and practicing solicitors; that under the said power George Taylor pretended to convey by indenture of grant, dated 29th December, 1856, the said land to Defendant Wallbridge, for the expressed consideration of $1,000, and said Wallbridge, by indenture of even date, conveyed back to George Taylor one half of the same, viz: the north seventeen acres and the south thirty-three acres of the said north half of said lot, for the expressed consideration of $200.\nThat Plaintiff left Upper Canada before 1851, and remained out of Canada continuously until October, 1873, when, for the first time, he returned to Canada; that the said power of attorney was executed by him in California and sent to George Taylor to enable him to act as trustee and agent for Plaintiff in the management and sale of the lands and premises therein mentioned. That the conveyance to Defendant Wallbridge, and the conveyance back to George Taylor, were \u201cmade in pursuance of a colorable and collusive agreement and understanding between the Defendants, to defraud Plaintiff out of said lands and to divide the same between the Defendants, both of whom at the time held a fiduciary position towards the Plaintiff\u2014the one as agent and the other as solicitor.\u201d That Defendants had, since the said pretended conveyances, bargained, sold and conveyed some portions of said lands to different parties, all which, so far as the abstract title of the said lot in the Registry Office showed (and Complainant had no knowledge of any other sales or conveyances thereof), Plaintiff was willing, and offered, to confirm the same. That Defendants had received and appropriated to their own use divers large sums of money, the proceeds of such sales, and neglected and refused to account to Plaintiff therefor and to pay same over to him.\nThat since Plaintiff\u2019s return to Ontario, George Taylor, as Plaintiff was informed and believed, executed, without any consideration whatever, an indenture of grant of part of said lands to George Simpson for his natural life, and Plaintiff alleged that the said George Simpson, before the execution of the said indenture, was well aware, or had actual notice of Plaintiff\u2019s rights and interests in said land; and Plaintiff submitted that said power of attorney did not warrant and empower Defendant, George Taylor, to grant, convey, and lease said lands to Adam Henry Wallbridge and George Simpson, and that the pretended consideration mentioned in the deed to Adam Henry Wallbridge, if paid at all, which Plaintiff denied, was grossly inadequate to the value of the said north half of the said lot; and Plaintiff prayed:\u2014 1. That the Defendants might be declared Trustees for him of the said lands, premises and moneys.\n2. That an account might be taken of the parcels or portions of the said lands and premises sold or conveyed, or leased, as aforesaid, and of the moneys which they received or ought to have received therefor.\n3. That they might be ordered to convey and assure, by proper assurances with all necessary parties, the remaining or unsold portions of the said lands and premises to the Complainant.\n4. That the Defendants might be ordered to account to Complainant for the moneys received by them, or either of them, or which should have been received by them, or either of them, for the said parcels or portions of said half lot so sold and conveyed, and for the rents, issues and profits which they received or ought to have received from the said lands and premises, with interest.\nThe Defendant George Taylor, in his answer, after setting forth that his mother purchased the said lands from King\u2019s College, and her connection with the said lands, states that she afterwards assigned her interest in said lands to him, in consideration of which he paid her the sum of $50, and that afterwards, in the year 1851, he assigned his interest in the said lands to the Plaintiff, setting forth the circumstances under which he alleges this was done.\nHe admits receiving the power of attorney.\nHe admits the suit by Canniff against Plaintiff, in whose name the title to said lands then stood, but alleges that he defended it, not as attorney and agent for Plaintiff, but on his own behalf, as the person beneficially entitled to said lands.\nHe alleges that the conveyances from himself to Adam Henry Wallbridge, and from Adam Henry Wallbridge to himself, were made immediately after the determination of that suit, in pursuance of an agreement previously entered into between his Solicitor, Adam Henry Wallbridge, and himself, the particulars of which he sets out.\nHe denies collusive agreement with Defendants to defraud Plaintiff of lands; admits that he has sold certain portions of the lands and received the purchase money; that about 15 years ago he did agree to give Defendant Geo. Simpson, his and Plaintiff\u2019s uncle, a life lease of about 15 acres of land in consideration of a nominal rent, and he then entered into possession, and that he, George Taylor, has since executed a life lease to him.\nHas always believed that Plaintiff had no title and never had any to said lands, except under the deed from the King\u2019s College to him, which, he submits, gave Plaintiff no beneficial interest in lands, but merely made him a trustee of the legal estate for him, George Taylor, and he submits that the legal estate was properly conveyed by him, as Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, to Defendant Adam Henry Wallbridge, but if it should be held that the legal estate did not pass to Adam Henry Wallbridge by said conveyance, and the same still remains in Plaintiff, he submits that Plaintiff ought to be declared a trustee of the legal estate for him, and ordered to convey the same to him by a good and sufficient deed. George Taylor further submits that he is a purchaser for value, and contends that Plaintiff never paid anything, and would never have had any claim had he, George Taylor, not taken the deed from King\u2019s College in his name.\nHe further submits that in any event he is entitled to a lien on said lands for the purchase money so paid by him.\nAdam Henry Wallbridge, by his answer, after setting forth the result of inquiries as to the land before the same came to Jane Taylor, says: That said Jane Taylor, on 3rd March, 1832, contracted in her own name with the Chancellor, President, and scholars of King\u2019s College, for the absolute purchase thereof in her own proper name.\nThat on the 26th Nov., 1839, Jane Taylor assigned the contract of purchase to Defendant, George Taylor; on the 30th October, 1841, George Taylor assigned the same to Plaintiff; on the 9th November, 1847, Plaintiff assigned same to George Taylor; on 12th April, 1851, George Taylor assigned same to Plaintiff; on or about the said month of April, 1841, a deed was issued by King\u2019s College in the name of Plaintiff, William Taylor.\nThat he, Adam Henry Wallbridge, furnished the money to pay the amount due the college, and the same was transmitted to Toronto, in the name of George Taylor, with instructions to have the deed made out in Plaintiff\u2019s name.\nThat before the time of the last mentioned transfer to Plaintiff, he had left Canada for the purpose of going to California, and he remained away from Canada until some time during last year.\nSubmits that Plaintiff could not have known, except by report or letter, that the land had been so transferred in his name, and he paid nothing to the college for the land.\nSubmits that the land, notwithstanding the title stood in the name of Plaintiff, was, in fact, the property of George Taylor, and that Plaintiff never, until within a short time, so far as he knows, or has been informed, set up any title thereto, or in any way claimed the same on the contrary, Plaintiff, shortly after deed was made to him by the College, transmitted to George Taylor the power of attorney to enable Defendant, George Taylor, to dispose of the land.\nSubmits that land was the property of George Taylor and not of Plaintiff, but stood in Plaintiff\u2019s name, with- out the Plaintiff\u2019s knowledge until informed, &c., and that Plaintiff was trustee for George Taylor, or of himself, Adam Henry Wallbridge, who paid the money.\nThat he received a deed from George Taylor, executed under said power of attorney, for good and valuable consideration paid by him therefor, and he claims to be an innocent purchaser for value, and denies collusion or intention to defraud charged in bill.\nThat George Taylor and he have been in possession of land 20 years and upwards; and he claims the benefit of the statute of limitations. That Plaintiff has acquiesced in his title by lapse of time and otherwise, and he is estopped from denying the title given under the power of attorney.\nThat the title is a registered title, and the deed under the power of attorney is also registered, and he claims the benefit of the registry laws. That he has sold part of the land to one John Hyslop and M. Thompson, who are interested in the suit and necessary parties.\nSubmits, if any secret trust or understanding between Plaintiff and George Taylor, he is not chargeable therewith or thereby, as he received his deed under the authority given by Plaintiff and without notice of any trust.\nThe following exhibits were fyled in the suit:\u2014\nEXHIBIT \u201cP.\u201d\nLetter from W.J. Taylor to the Bursar of King\u2019s College, 28th November, 1842, as follows:\n\u201cBelleville, 28th November, 1842.\n\u201cSIR,\u2014I have become the purchaser of north half of Lot No. 8, in the 2nd concession of Thurlow, from Jane Taylor, the original purchaser thereof from King\u2019s College.

Lease expired in 1826.\nJohn Taylor died, leaving a will by which he nominated his wife, Jane Taylor, his executrix, and his son John his executor. The will is dated 14th December, 1824.\nJohn Taylor, the son, died, leaving Jane Taylor, his mother, surviving him. In March, 1832, Jane Taylor paid the rent then in arrear. On the 3rd March, 1832, she, while executrix, contracted in her own name with the Chancellor, &c., of King\u2019s College to whom land had been transferred, for the absolute purchase thereof in her own name. On the 26th November, 1839, Jane assigned this contract of purchase to Defendant George Taylor. On 30th October, 1841, George Taylor assigned same to Plaintiff William J. Taylor. On the 9th November, 1847, William assigned same to George Taylor. On the 12th April, 1851, George assigned same to William. On the 24th April, 1851, King\u2019s College deeded same to William Taylor. On 11th October, 1851, William sent George a power of attorney in these words:\n\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that I, William Johnson Taylor, at present of Carson\u2019s Creek, County of Calaveras, State of California, United States of America, but formerly a resident of Kingston, in that part of Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s Dominion, known as Canada West, hath made, constituted and appointed, and by these presents, doth make, constitute and appoint George Taylor, of Belleville, in that part of Her Britannic Majesty\u2019s Dominion, known as Canada West, my true and lawful Attorney for me, and in my name and behalf to sell all that certain tract or parcel of land, known as lot number eight, second concession of the Township of Thurlow, in the Victoria District and Province of Canada, aforesaid. As also to act as my Attorney in the sale or leasing of any lands of which I am the owner in the said Province of Canada, aforesaid. Hereby ratifying and confirming the act or acts of my said Attorney.\n\u201cIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal at Carson\u2019s Creek, as aforesaid, this eleventh day of October, one thousand eight hundred any fifty-one.\n\u201cSigned and Sealed in presence of.\n\u201c(Signed) J.

On the 29th December, 1856, Adam Henry Wallbridge, in consideration of \u00a350, sells and conveys to George Taylor the north 17 acres and the south 33 acres of the north \u00bd of lot 8.\nThe following exhibits also were fyled in the suit:\u2014\nAnswer of William J. Taylor, dated 22nd November, 1852, in chancery suit of Canniff v. Taylor, and sworn to by George Taylor.\nAffidavit on production, made by George Taylor in same suit, dated 30th June, 1853.\nCopy of decree in same suit, dated 13th June, 1856.\nDeposition taken viv\u00e2 voce of George Taylor in suit of Canniff v. Taylor, 15th May, 1856, and also depositions of J.W.D. Moodie and T.J.W. Myers in same suit.\nJudgment roll in ejectment in suit of Doe v. Fairman, on verdict for Plaintiff; William Taylor comes into Court; possession prayed for and granted.\nThe other material facts of the case and the evidence relating to the transfer of the lot in question by the King\u2019s College, are hereafter given at length in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nThe case came on for examination of witnesses and hearing before Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot at Belleville, on the 10th day of November, 1874, and the Court gave a decree in favor of the Plaintiff.\nThe cause then came on before the Court of Chancery by way of re-hearing, and on the 2nd February, 1876, the Court made the following order:\n\u201c1. This Court doth order that the said decree be and the same hereby is reversed as against the said Defendant, Adam Henry Wallbridge, with costs of such re-hearing to be paid by the Plaintiff to the said Defendant forthwith after taxation thereof.\n2. This Court doth further order that the Plaintiff\u2019s bill of complaint be and the same is hereby dismissed out of this Court as against the Defendant Adam Henry Wallbridge, with costs to be paid by the said Plaintiff to the said Defendant forthwith after taxation thereof.\n3. And this Court doth further order that the deposit in Court of forty dollars, paid in by the Defendant, be forthwith paid out to him.\n4. And this Court doth further order that the Plaintiff do forthwith repay to the said Defendant Adam Henry Wallbridge, any amount which the said Defendant may have paid to him on account of the costs of this suit, or otherwise under the said decree payable by the said Defendant to the Plaintiff.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, this order was affirmed with costs.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. George D. Dickson, for Appellant:\u2014\nThe beneficial property was in William Johnson Taylor; and Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, who saw the Plaintiff, the Defendant George Taylor, and the Defendant Wallbridge, all of whom were examined before him as witnesses, and the evidence of all of whom is most material, was in a better position to form a judgment upon the facts than the majority of the Court of Appeal in Ontario, and the latter Court should not have disturbed the finding of the Court of first instance upon the facts.\nThe evidence shows that prior to the 28th November, 1842, the Plaintiff had purchased the land from the Defendant, George Taylor, and on the 28th November, 1842, applied to King\u2019s College to have his purchase recognised, and this was done. In 1847 the Plaintiff expected to go to California, and to enable the Defendant George Taylor to procure the deed from King\u2019s College, and to manage the property for Plaintiff, conveyed the property to him. After the execution of the conveyance, a Bill was filed in Chancery against the plaintiff by Joseph Canniff, setting up an agreement to sell the land to Canniff, and charging that the transfer by the Defendant George Taylor to the Plaintiff was in fraud of this agreement, and asking for specific performance of it. The Defendant George Taylor answered this Bill in the name of and as the agent of the Plaintiff; and, in the answer, states in substance that he applied for and got the conveyance as agent for the Plaintiff, and the transfer to the Plaintiff were bon\u00e2 fide and for consideration. The Defendant George Taylor, who is the Sheriff of the County of Hastings, has been ill for a number of years, and his memory has become impaired; but in 1856 was in perfect mental health, and was examined as a witness in the suit of Canniff v. Taylor. On the occasion of his examination in that suit he swore in the most positive terms that he had no interest in the suit if the Plaintiff was then alive, and that he assigned the land to the Plaintiff\u2014that this was bon\u00e2 fide, and not to avoid payment of the claims of creditors.\nIt is alleged by Respondents that the conveyance to Wallbridge was executed in pursuance of the bargain contained in the receipt of the 7th July, 1853, signed by A.H. Wallbridge. But such a bargain was not within the scope of the agent\u2019s power. It was substantially a bargain, as carried out, to divide the property between the Defendant Wallbridge and the Defendant George Taylor; and the power of attorney set out in Plaintiff\u2019s bill was obtained from him under the pretext of being required to enable the Defendant George Taylor to manage the Plaintiff\u2019s property in Canada, but in reality for the express purpose of enabling the Defendants Wallbridge and Taylor to divide the Plaintiff\u2019s land between them, and carry out the fraudulent scheme they had conceived.\nThe power of attorney was given by the Plaintiff to the Defendant George Taylor in 1851, and it was under this power of attorney that the land was conveyed to Defendant Wallbridge, who re-conveyed half of it to the Defendant George Taylor. At the time of the suit of Canniff v. Taylor, the Defendant Wallbridge was solicitor for the Plaintiff, and he cannot be a purchaser for value without notice, and to hold that Defendant Taylor was the beneficial owner, would be to enable them to profit by their own fraud.\nThere was no resulting trust here. This was not the case of a purchase by a stranger in the name of a trustee. This was a purchase by an agent in the name of his principal, and he cannot be heard against the principal to say that it was otherwise. In such a case the presumption of a resulting trust does not arise. The payment here was not proved to have been made with the money of George Taylor.\nIf the assignment was made by the Defendant George Taylor, intending to vest the property in the Plaintiff, then the purchase would be intended to have been completed for the benefit of the Plaintiff, and there would be no resulting trust. There is in the evidence no intimation made to the College that in any sense the purchase was intended to have been made for the benefit of George Taylor.\nThe Defendants cannot either defend under the statute of limitations, because they took possession in the Plaintiff\u2019s name in 1856, under the ejectment which George Taylor had obtained against Canniff.\nNo delay can be imputed to the Plaintiff until his return, and he filed his bill promptly thereafter. The learned counsel relied upon the following cases and authorities:\nGreenwood v. The Commercial Bank[1]; Brown v. Smart[2]; Marquis of Clanricarde v. Hennesy[3]; Lewis v. Thomas[4]; Sturges v. Morse[5]; In re Butler\u2019s Estate[6]; Blair v. Brownley[7]; Brown on Limitations[8]; Cole v. Lease[9]; Dart on Vendors[10].\nMr. Fitzgerald, Q.C., for Respondent:\u2014\nIt must be admitted that at one time, viz., in 1847, the Appellant conveyed his whole estate and interest in the lands in question to George Taylor. The consideration of \u00a3150, named in the conveyance of the 29th November, 1847, is to be presumed to have been paid by George, and thenceforward George was and continued to be the beneficial owner of the property in dispute. There is no evidence that the Appellant provided any part of the purchase money paid to the College, nor was it shown that George paid it by way of a loan to him, and the consideration of 5s., named in the transfer from George to William, dated 12th April, 1851, was only nominal.\nUpon reading all documents, it is clear that George was the owner, and that when George, without William\u2019s knowledge, got the deed issued in William\u2019s name, William became a bare trustee for George by the principle of resulting trust.\nThere must be evidence to rebut the presumption of law giving rise to the resulting trust; Lewin on Trusts[11]. The evidence of George Taylor in the Canniff v. Taylor suit, relied on by the Appellant here, does not do so. The conveyance to William was a contrivance at the time which was honest to defeat Canniff, and George\u2019s statement in that evidence that he had no interest in that suit must be considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances and the evidence in this case\u2014and is, after all, only \u201cevidence,\u201d and does not in any view amount to \u201cestoppel.\u201d The meaning that must be attached to it is only that he had put himself in his brother\u2019s power as to this land by the conveyance of 12th April, 1851, and taking the University deed in his name, that his brother William had control of the property till he got some instrument giving that control back to him (George), and that he had done so under legal advice and was speaking of the conveyances according to the advice he had received as to their operation. It must be assumed on the evidence that George promptly communicated what he had done to William who had no previous knowledge thereof, and asked him for the power of attorney, and that William assented. The return of the power of attorney from California in October, 1851, having regard to the length of time then required for communicating with a person there, supports this view. Were it otherwise the Appellant could have shown it to be so. Washburn v. Ferris[12].\nGeorge Taylor, being then the beneficial owner of the land, it was only necessary that he should obtain from the Appellant the power of attorney of October, 1851, which he did obtain, to enable him to deal with it for his own use. That power of attorney is sufficient in point of form to support the conveyance to Wallbridge of 1856.\nIn 1856, George Taylor, as equitable and beneficial owner, and also as the duly constituted attorney of William, in whom was the legal estate, was then competent to and did give a valid title to the said lands to Wallbridge, and Wallbridge did thereby acquire a valid title in fee simple to one half of the said lands, viz., 50 acres.\nEven if William was at the time of the sale and conveyance to Wallbridge the owner of the said lands, yet by virtue of the said power of attorney he gave to George Taylor full power to sell and convey the said 50 acres to Wallbridge in fee simple in the manner in which he did sell and convey the same to said Wallbridge, and William is now estopped from denying Wallbridge\u2019s title to the said 50 acres, and if there were any doubt the court would now order a conveyance from William, the trustee of the legal estate.\nThe evidence, moreover, shows that Wallbridge was a purchaser bon\u00e2 fide for value, without notice of any defect in the title of George.\nAs to Wallbridge being incapacitated from buying, the rule seems to be that the onus is cast upon the solicitor to prove that he paid full value, and the evidence shows that he did pay full value, for he only bought one half.\nIn any event the laches and acquiescence of the Appellant disentitle him to any relief as against Wallbridge, and by analogy to the rule under 25 Vic., c. 20, the absence of a Plaintiff from the country will not enable him in a Court of Equity to open up the transaction in question after so long a time, viz., 21 years after it took place, and 26 years after the Plaintiff left the country.\nThe Respondent relies also on the Statutes of Limitations as a complete bar to Plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nAfter such a lapse of time the onus is upon the Appellant to establish his case beyond all reasonable doubt, and this he has plainly failed to do, and in con- sidering a decision on an appeal, as in this case, the Higher Court will not interfere unless they are perfectly satisfied that the decision of the subordinate Court of Appeal is wrong.\nPer Lord Wensleydale, Mayor of Beverley v. The Attorney-General[13].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply:\u2014\nOn 27th November, 1856, we have an order of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench granting possession to the Appellant of the land in question, and any possession prior to that date cannot be invoked by Respondents.\nThe evidence, moreover, does not clearly prove that George did not pay the University with William\u2019s money, for we know that George had money the moment he exercised his power of selling William\u2019s lands. It is not a case where the evidence is clear and distinct as in Washburn v. Ferris[14]. As to a resulting trust, see Perry on Trusts[15]. There is only evidence of \u00a320 consideration paid by Wallbridge. It is not a fair consideration, as he admits the property to be worth \u00a3215. The evidence in the suit of Canniff v. Taylor is conclusive, for the issue then was the same as at the present time; was there any interest in George then?\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE, after stating the facts of the case, hereinbefore set out, proceeded as follows:\nThe Plaintiff relied on his documentary title, and Defendant claimed that the land was George Taylor\u2019s, held by William for him; and, if not George\u2019s, then the sale and conveyance by William, by his Attorney George, vested title in him. William denied that George had any interest in the land, and contended that the power of attorney did not authorize George to sell and convey the land, and, if it did, that the sale was not bon\u00e2 fide, but colorable with a view to defraud him, or, if bon\u00e2 fide, that George could only sell for cash, and not on the terms and in the manner it was sold.\nIt is not disputed that, however the right to the property came to Jane Taylor, the mother, she, on the 3rd March, 1832, contracted with the authorities of King\u2019s College for its absolute purchase in her own name, and by virtue of which the deed was subsequently made to William Taylor, as assignee, by the college.\nOn the 29th Nov., 1839, Jane Taylor assigned her interest in the land to Defendant, George Taylor. The deed by which this was accomplished expresses to be in consideration of \u00a3100 paid by George Taylor, the receipt of which is acknowledged, and the instrument contains a covenant by George Taylor, \u201cthat he will pay all the remaining instalments that are due on the said land to the scholars or corporation of King\u2019s College (though the deed does not appear to have been executed by George Taylor), and Jane Taylor thereby requested that the deed for said land should be made out and issued in the name of George Taylor, upon his paying the remaining instalments due on said land.\nOn the 30th Oct., 1841, George Taylor assigned by a similar instrument alleging the same consideration of \u00a3100, his interest in the said land, and though containing a similar covenant by William Taylor as to paying instalments, it was not executed by William Taylor.\nOn the 29th November, 1847, by a similar deed, containing a like covenant on part of George Taylor, William Taylor, in consideration of \u00a3150 to him paid by George Taylor, transferred to him the said contract and lands. This deed is executed by both William Taylor and George Taylor.\nOn the 12th April, 1851, George Taylor, by an instrument under seal, in consideration of five shillings to him paid by William Taylor, re-assigned and set over the said contract, and all benefit and advantage to be derived therefrom; to hold the same and the lands therein mentioned to him and his heirs, and requested that the deed for the same might issue to him. This document was witnessed by L. Wallbridge and the Defendant W.H. Wallbridge. And on the 24th April, 1851, the Chancellor, trustees and scholars of the University of Toronto, duly conveyed the said lands to the Plaintiff William Taylor.\nThis placed the legal title in the said lands, on the 24th April, 1851, in the Plaintiff, and this title remained unchanged until the 29th day of December, 1856, when a deed of that date was made and executed by W.J. Taylor by attorney George Taylor to Adam Henry Wallbridge, and which was registered 3rd January, 1857.\nThis deed purported to be made by and between William Johnson Taylor, of the City of San Francisco, in County of Calaveras, and State of California, but formerly of the Town of Belleville and County of Hastings, gentleman, of the first part; Adam Henry Wallbridge, of the Town of Belleville and County of Hastings, Esquire, of the second part; and witnesseth that the party of the first part for and in consideration of \u00a3250 of lawful money of Canada, to him in hand paid by the said party of the second part, had given, granted, bargained, sold, aliened, released, enfeoffed and conveyed all and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the Township of Thurlow, in the County of Hastings, being composed of the north half of Lot Number Eight, in the Second Concession of the Township of Thurlow and County of Hastings. To have and to hold in fee simple, with all appurtenances subject to original reservations. Covenants for seizen, good right and title to convey, quiet possession, freedom from incumbrances and further assurance. On the same 29th Dec., 1856, by a deed dated on that day and registered the said 3rd Jan., 1857, and purported to be made by and between Adam Henry Wallbridge, of the Town of Belleville, and County of Hastings, Esquire, of the first part; and George Taylor, of the Township of Sidney, and County aforesaid, Esquire, of the second part, it was witnessed that the said party of the first part, for and in consideration of the sum of fifty pounds of lawful money of Canada, to him by the said party of the second part in hand well and truly paid, had given, granted, bargained, sold, aliened, released, enfeoffed, conveyed and confirmed unto the said George Taylor, his heirs and assigns, the north seventeen acres and the south thirty\u2011three acres of the north half of lot number eight, in the second concession of the Township of Thurlow. Same covenants as in last deed.\nThe authority for making the deed of the 29th Dec., 1856, to Adam Henry Wallbridge is alleged to be under the power of attorney set out at length in the Plaintiff\u2019s bill, dated 11th Oct, 1851, whereby William J. Taylor constituted and appointed George Taylor his true and lawful attorney for him and in his name and behalf to sell all that certain tract or parcel of land known as lot No. 8, second concession of the Township of Thurlow, in the Victoria district and Province of Canada, as also to act as his attorney in the sale or leasing of any lands of which he was the owner in the said Province of Canada.\nThe legal title from the College being thus shown to have been in William, the first question we have to consider and determine is, was William under the deed from the College the beneficial as well as the legal owner, or was he only clothed with the legal estate for the benefit of George, the real owner? If William was a mere trustee, vested with the legal estate for George, the bene- ficial owner, and the transfer of the property was made to Defendant Wallbridge, by and at the instance of George, under the power of attorney from William, it is obvious William could have no right to have such disposal of the property interfered with, whatever may have been the consideration for, or agreement or arrangement between George and Wallbridge under which such transfer was made, and consequently could have no ground for maintaining the present suit.\nWe must, therefore, enquire, first, who was the beneficial owner under the deed from the College? If George, the case ends. If William, then was the transfer under the power a good and valid conveyance of William\u2019s interest to Wallbridge? As the documentary title indicates no trust the burthen of establishing that the property was held in trust necessarily rests on the Defendants. At the outset I can safely say that I have never, that I can remember, been called on to consider a case where the evidence was so contradictory and unsatisfactory as in this case\u2014the witnesses not only contradicting one another, but each, more or less, contradicting himself; and it is through this mass of conflicting statements that we have to grope our way to a conclusion.\nAfter giving this case more than ordinary consideration, I am constrained to the conclusion that the weight of evidence establishes, with as much certainty as one could expect to feel in a case where the whole evidence is so unsatisfactory, that the property in question was transferred by William to George on the eve of a contemplated departure from Canada to enable George, as his agent, the better to look after his interests and obtain for him the title from the College. It is not disputed that he had left George as his agent in charge of all his other large real estate, which George says amounted to $20,000, and that, as William says, he handed his papers to George on leaving. On 30th June, 1853, George himself swears as to the papers connected with this property, as follows:\nWilliam left Canada in December, 1850, and then left with me (George) the contract for purchase of the deed and the assignment to me.\nThis was in the controversy when George was putting William forward as solely interested in the land.\nAnd William says:\u2014\nI made a transfer of some property to George when I thought of going West; I had obtained an assignment at one time of the right my brother had in the land in dispute. I recollect the assignment from myself to George, which was made afterwards. I executed this to him as my agent.\nThis statement of William\u2019s appears to me to be as strongly confirmed as it very well could be by George, who on the 3rd March, \u201853, swore as follows:\u2014\nThe assignment from William Taylor to me was without consideration, and made to me because he (William) was going to California.\nAnd again, on the 15th May, \u201856, after testifying that he could not tell why Wallbridge advised him to assign to his brother, says:\u2014\nI had no reason, but that I had not paid my brother.\nAt another time he says:\u2014\nI think it was done so that I might be a witness.\nI think the weight of evidence likewise establishes that the re-transfer was not for the purpose of vesting the legal title in William, with a beneficial or resulting trust in favor of George, to enable George to appear as a disinterested and competent witness, as suggested by George, when, in fact and in truth, he was the reverse, but was made because William was the beneficial owner. This suggestion of George, that the transfer was made to enable him to be a witness is at variance with his answer: for in paragraph 2 he says he cannot now say why he assigned to Plaintiff; and it is not confirmed by Wallbridge, who assigns an entirely different reason. I am unwilling to think, without the clearest evidence, that any respectable solicitor could have advised a transfer for such a purpose, with a view, in contemplation of such evidence being given and the land thereby recovered, that a claim should be subsequently set up of a beneficial interest in witness.\nOn principles of public policy, I should hesitate long before I should be willing to admit that a party, who claims a resulting trust on the ground that he made a transfer of the property with a view to enable himself to testify in relation to it as a disinterested and competent witness in a suit pending, or in contemplation, in which the title to such property was in issue, and in such suit put himself forward as such disinterested witness, and was accepted on testifying that he had no interest in the property, could be allowed to set up what, if his contention is correct and successful, can, I think, be looked on in no other light than a fraud on the Court. I am, by no means, as at present advised, prepared to say that a party who has so put himself forward as having no interest in the property ought to be permitted to invoke the aid of the Court so deceived, or any other Court, to assist him in obtaining the fruits of his deception, by declaring that he then was and still is the beneficial owner, and that the owner put forward by him as the absolute owner had no beneficial interest in the property whatever, but that the title merely stood in his name as trustee. To give judicial sanction by giving efficacy to such a proceeding seems to me repugnant to the due and proper administration of justice. Weak and impotent, indeed, it appears to me, would be the law if a man could deal thus treacherously with its tribunals, and then constrain the same tribunals to give him the benefit and advantage of such treachery; but it is unnecessary to discuss this question further, as I cannot think that, if both Wallbridge and George knew that this suit, if gained, would inure to the sole individual benefit of George, the transfer could have been advised by Wallbridge, or made by George, under the idea that he should, as he certainly did do, appear in Court, offer himself as a disinterested and competent witness, and qualify himself as such by swearing on the voir dire that he had no interest in the property. Nor am I able to bring myself to the conclusion that the transfer was made for the reason assigned by Wallbridge. He says the assignment was made to William at his suggestion in view of litigation. On this all important point in his case we would naturally expect as part of his case a very clear and circumstantial account of this transaction, and satisfactory reasons assigned for advising a client to place his property in the name of a person of whose very existence at the time there was no certainty. But in his direct examination we find no particulars whatever given, and it is only on his cross\u2011examination we find the reasons brought out.\nIt is well to bear in mind that the assignment from George to William was on the 12th April, \u201851; and the deed from the College to William on the 24th April, \u201851, and that Mr. Wallbridge says the litigation took place after deed was obtained from the College, the first steps of which were taken by him, for he says:\u2014\nI first commenced an action against Fairman at the suit of the Plaintiff.\nAnd then, on his cross-examination, he gives his reasons for advising the transfer. He says:\u2014\nI think the bargain (that is the bargain between himself and George Taylor) was made with George Taylor about a month or six weeks before the deed issued from the College; no litigation was going on; I supposed it could be got without litigation at that time. I did not find out that we could not get the property without litigation until the month of May. Up to this time I thought we could get it without litigation.\nAnd he then says:\nIt was in view of litigation with Canniff that I advised the transfer to he made to the Plaintiff. Although I supposed there would be no litigation, I had the transfer made with a view to litigation. It was the litigation with Canniff that I sought to avoid. * * * By taking the deed from the College, I thought Canniff might prosecute for taking a title in litigation. The litigation I meant that was to be avoided by taking the deed from the College to William was the qui tam action against George Taylor.\nI do not regret being forced to say that I cannot accept this statement as affording a satisfactory or credible reason for suggesting the transfer. I think Mr. Wallbridge\u2019s memory must have failed him with respect to this. It is difficult for me to understand how any man, lay or legal, could be induced to believe, without corroborative evidence of an overwhelming character, that any sane lawyer could advise a client to put his property in the name of another with a view to litigation, when he thought that the property could be got without litigation, and when he supposed there would be no litigation, and put the title in the name of a person away in California, of whose whereabouts, or even of whose existence, there was at the time no certainty, and that, too, in the year 1851, when access to and communication with California was so different from what it is at this day; nor can I bring my mind to believe that without the knowledge or consent of William, a responsible man, having apparently large real estate in the country, though absent therefrom, any solicitor would suggest, or any honest man would act on the suggestion, that to enable the actual owner of land to escape a qui tam action, he would put the title in the name of an absent man, and so make him liable to the very prosecutions from which he desired his own client to escape, and subjecting him to consequences the real owner feared to meet, and that this same solicitor should, without any directions or authority from the party whose name had been so dealt with, institute and defend suits in his name, based on a title so acquired, and thereby expose this absent and innocent man, not only to a possible qui tam action, should he return to the country, but involve him in litigation as Plaintiff and Defendant, at law and in equity\u2014thereby subjecting him and his estate to possible penalties and heavy costs. A proceeding so unusual, and, if I may be permitted to say so, to my mind so unjustifiable, I cannot accept as the reason why the transfer was made from George to William, when I find in the evidence reasons assigned and testified to at the very time the transactions took place, when all was fresh and with surrounding corroborations, which afford a solution so much more reasonable and satisfactory. On the contrary, then, I think the reason for the transfer was, as George himself at one time swears, because he had not paid his brother for the land. In other words, as I construe his statement, because the land rightfully belonged to his brother. This view, without compromising anybody, fully justifies the advice of Mr. Lewis Wallbridge, which, as George says, was this:\nI swore in that suit that my brother was the owner, at the advice of Mr. Wallbridge;\nAnd I think the facts will justify the assumption that, in view of all the circumstances, a transfer was made to William, and so the legal title placed where the beneficial interest was, and thereby George was in a position honestly and truthfully to testify that he had no personal interest in the matter, and so was not interested in the result of the suit. That this was so, is somewhat corroborated by the fact that neither of the Defendants called Mr. Lewis Wallbridge, who must have known exactly what the transaction was, for George says:\nThe answer in the Canniff suit was made at the advice of Mr. Lewis Wallbridge;\nAnd strongly, by the direct evidence of George, who, speaking of the litigation in 1851, says:\nThe facts at the time were much fresher in my memory then than they are now. I was also examined as a witness before the Court at Toronto. The evidence I then gave was true, to the best of my belief. I swore, in that suit, that my brother was the owner, by the advice of Mr. Wallbridge. I swore, in that suit, if my brother was living, I had no interest; if dead, I would be interested as his heir-at-law;\nAnd more strongly by the sworn statements of George, made so far back as 1852 and 1856, when the facts, he says, were\u2014and we well know must have been\u2014so much fresher in his memory.\nOn the 22nd November, 1852, he went before the Court in the suit of Canniff v. Taylor as the avowed agent of William Taylor, and so expressed to be on the face of the answer, and as such agent defended the suit and caused to be put in William\u2019s answer these words (to the truth of which he swore), viz.:\nDefendant (William) by his agent, applied for and obtained the deed of said land from the College and paid the balance of principal and interest due the College thereon, as he humbly submits and insists he had a perfect right to do.\nIt is true, on 29th June, 1874\u201422 years after\u2014in paragraph 3 of his answer in this suit, he is made to swear:\nI defended the Canniff suit, not as agent and attorney for Plaintiff, but on my own behalf, as the person beneficially interested in the lands.\nAnd this statement of William\u2019s interest is put forward, not only in the face of the answer in the Canniff suit, but of his sworn deposition made on the 15th May, 1856, in which he says: I say, if my brother is dead, I have an interest in the suit; if he is not dead, I have no interest. At present, I am not aware he is dead.\nAnd again:\nAfter the last assignment was made to William, I made the payment on the said half lot No. 8 to the College (\u00a3148), and obtained the deed for the Defendant (William), and in the Defendant\u2019s (William\u2019s) name.\nI think I am bound to give credence to these sworn statements, made in 1852 and 1856, in preference to those made in 1874 and later.\nThere are other circumstances in the case which tend, with considerable force, to confirm the view that William was the owner, in addition to the fact stated by George that William had made several payments to the College, which statement would seem to be accurate, from the fact that the balance paid on 14th April, 1851, on account of principal and interest (\u00a3128 10s.), together with what the mother would seem to have paid, would not cover the amount of the purchase-money and interest; and it is not pretended that George or Wallbridge (if they paid anything) paid more than the amount mentioned in the receipts. The circumstances to which I refer are connected with the power of attorney and deed made under it. The power of attorney appears to me wholly at variance with Mr. Wallbridge\u2019s contention. His connection with the land he states thus:\nGeorge Taylor told me he had a pre-emption for the purchase of certain lands from the College. He wanted me to furnish the money and to take a half interest in the land.\nAnd as to the power of attorney, he says:\nGeorge had a power of attorney from William. He got it at my suggestion. I advised him to do this to get my share of the land.\nTo accomplish this, George would require simply an authority from William to convey the dry legal estate.\nThis power neither recognizes any interest of George in the land, nor does it give any direct authority to convey such legal estate; on the contrary, it authorizes George to do under it what, if Mr. Wallbridge is correct, it was never contemplated he should do, viz., \u201cto sell\u201d this land. But it is not confined to this land; it gives George a general power to act as his attorney in the sale or leasing of any lands of which he (William) was owner in the Province of Canada.\nThus, whilst the inconsistency of the writing with the statement of Mr. Wallbridge is established on the one hand, its consistency with the property being William\u2019s is made apparent on the other.\nLooking at the deed to Wallbridge executed under this power, we find the view that the land was the property of William, I think, still further strengthened. If the property was really George\u2019s and had been put in William\u2019s name, and behind his back, for the sole purpose of accommodating George and saving him from possible ulterior consequences, and authority had been obtained to use William\u2019s name merely to vest in Mr. Wallbridge his share, why did Mr. Wallbridge insert, or permit to be inserted, in the deed, made only for the purpose of divesting a trustee of a bare legal estate, and vesting it in his cestui que trust, or his assignee, covenants on the part of William for seizin, good right and title to convey, quiet possession, freedom from incumbrances, and for further assurances. Surely, all this indicates that the power of attorney was intended to accomplish more than Mr. Wallbridge would lead us to suppose, and the doings of George under it show plainly that he did not so consider it, for he appears to have sold and conveyed under its authority other lands with the full knowledge of Wallbridge, who says:\nI knew that George was selling lots on the hill under power of attorney obtained from William. George received the monies. I saw the monies paid to him. and corroborates with much force the contention of William, who, in his bill, alleges that the power of attorney was by him executed while in California and sent to the Defendant, George Taylor, to enable him to act as trustee and agent for him, the Plaintiff, in the management and sale of the said lands and premises therein mentioned; and who, in his evidence, on 10th November, 1874, says:\nI sent him the power of attorney because he asked me for it. When I gave him the power of attorney, I don\u2019t know that I thought he would sell it. I thought it being a wood lot he might want it to enable him to take care of it.\nAnd which is by no means inconsistent with the statement of George that:\nThe reason he (Plaintiff) sent me the power of attorney was because he was in debt. I wrote him, I think, for the power of attorney.\nAnd the conveyance under it, not being such an instrument as a bare naked trustee, and one made so without his knowledge or consent, ought to be called on to execute; but on the contrary, the power of attorney and the deed under it being just such instruments as a purchaser for value would naturally look for from a vendor selling on his own account in his own right, is it not a legitimate inference that the title was as the documents thus indicate? I may here say, with reference to this power of attorney, I cannot agree with an observation of one of the learned Judges in the Court below that the transactions of April, 1851, though effected in the absence and without the knowledge of the Plaintiff, \u201cwere promptly communicated to him.\u201d\nI cannot discover one title of evidence that there was, with the power of attorney transmitted any particulars whatever. George does not say he wrote the particulars, and Wallbridge says he never wrote to him, and the power itself, for the reasons I have assigned, affords, to my mind, strong evidence that such was not the case, or, if they had been, a power consistent with the transaction would have been transmitted for execution by William.\nThe same learned Judge assumes that the power of attorney was drawn in, and sent from, California; he says the instrument contains internal evidence of having been prepared abroad. Our attention has not been called to any such evidence, and the evidence in this case is directly the reverse. Mr. Wallbridge makes it apparent that this power of attorney was drawn in Canada, for he says:\nAnd the power of attorney was sent to be executed at my suggestion.\nAnd again he says:\nI never wrote to Mr. Taylor; I was instrumental in having power of attorney sent to him.\nAnd William says:\nI sent $1,000 to him (George) in 1851, when he sent the power of attorney.\nAnd he (William) says:\nI don\u2019t know where the power of attorney was drawn.\nWhich he must have known, if George had not sent it to him to be executed, and if he had had it prepared in California. I, therefore, much prefer adopting the conclusion I have suggested, as being perfectly reasonable and natural and involving no imputation of impropriety on any person, supported, as I think it is, by evidence direct and indirect, rather than the suggestions of either George or Mr. Wallbridge, which are, to my mind, the very reverse. I have dwelt at this very great length on this branch of the case, because I think it the turning point.\nAssuming, then, that William was the beneficial as well as the legal owner, was there a valid and binding sale and transfer by William to Wallbridge? It has been much pressed on Mr. Wallbridge\u2019s behalf that the balance due the College was paid by him. It is quite impossible to say with any degree of reasonable certainty who actually advanced the money to pay the balance due the College. William did not do it personally, though, if George\u2019s statement is true, William had made two or three payments to the College. George, William says, (and it is not disputed) was the sole manager of his property in this country; and it is not disputed that he sold property of William\u2019s to a very large amount, and it is obvious that large sums from this source, belonging to William, must have been from time to time in his hands, an account of which, though written for, William could never obtain; in addition to which, William appears to have remitted George $1,000 from California with the power of attorney, but there is no evidence that he appropriated any of these funds to pay this balance, unless, indeed, such an inference could be drawn from the statement in the answer in the Canniff suit, which George swore was true:\nThat this Defendant (William) by his agent, applied for and obtained the deed of the said land, and paid the balance of principal and interest due to the College, as he humbly submits he had a perfect right to do.\nIf William, by his agent, did pay, and that agent had funds belonging to William in his hands, the presumption would not be very violent, that the payment was made from such funds. Both George and Wallbridge, with equal positiveness in some statements, and equal doubtfulness in others, claim to have paid it. But, it seems to me impossible to discover from their contradictory and conflicting statements, whose money went to the College. It is useless to go through or comment on all these different inconsistent statements as to the payment of the money. As everything connected with this payment, apart from the papers, rests on the evid- ence of George and Wallbridge, it is only necessary, to show how very unreliable this evidence is (no doubt from failure of memory), to read from Wallbridge\u2019s testimony. He says:\nI paid it to George Taylor. I made no entry of it. I knew that Taylor swore he paid the money. I think I paid George Taylor on account of this land. I can\u2019t remember what I paid. I think I paid him \u00a3215\u2014the consideration money in the deed. I think Mr. Taylor got my brother Lewis to send the money to the College. It may have been my money; my impression is it was, but it is so long ago that I can\u2019t remember distinctly.\nBut by whomsoever advanced, the direct testimony of George and the written documents show it was transmitted to the College by George, for and on account of William, for the purpose of obtaining for him the deed, and that the College so understood it is plain, for the Bursar, in his letter to George enclosing the receipt for the money, says:\nThe deed will be made out and forwarded to William Johnson Taylor as soon as possible.\nIf, then, the property really belonged to William, I am at a loss to understand how it can be successfully contended that the sale or arrangement, whatever it was, between George and Wallbridge, and the transfer, under the power of attorney in evidence, to give it effect, can be held to bind William or divest him of his interest in the property.\nThe entire transaction was between George and Wallbridge, not in reference to William\u2019s property, but in reference to property they both assumed to belong to George, and in which, as they put their whole case, William had no beneficial interest. On what principle can such an attempted sale of, or bargain for, George\u2019s supposed interest or property be now turned into or sustained as a sale of William\u2019s property? Wallbridge purchased, and George sold half of his (George\u2019s) interest in the land. Neither George nor Wallbridge pretends to say that George sold, or proposed to sell, or that Wallbridge bought, or proposed to buy, any interest of William\u2019s. Both repudiated then, and repudiate now, that William had any right or interest to dispose of, but acted throughout, and have conducted their defence to this action, on the assumption that William had no beneficial interest in the property.\nIn his answer, Wallbridge claims to be an innocent purchaser for value, but, if his evidence is true, it was not of William\u2019s, but of George\u2019s, interest; but if these transactions between George and Wallbridge had had reference to William\u2019s interest, it seems to me impossible the transactions could stand. I think George and Wallbridge cannot be separated; the evidence shows, beyond all doubt, that George was acting throughout, not only under the advice, but, it may almost be said, under the direction of Wallbridge and his brother and partner, and that they were cognizant of all matters connected with the land, and not only advised but controlled their doings in relation thereto, more than George himself. It would be a useless waste of time to go through the evidence, in detail, of George and Wallbridge, and point out the extraordinary and manifold variances and inconsistencies, either as to the time when this alleged sale took place, the terms of the sale, or the alleged consideration. Some idea may be formed by briefly referring to a few irreconcilable statements. Wallbridge alleges the sale, or agreement for sale, was before the assignment from George to William. William says it was after litigation commenced, which was after the deed from the College; The written paper which contains, William says, the agreement, and is signed by both George and Wallbridge, and is in Wallbridge\u2019s handwriting, is dated 7th July, 1853, more than 2 years after the deed from the College, which is dated 24th April, 1851. Wallbridge says there was no writing in relation to it\u2014that the whole was verbal between him and George. The agreement in his own handwriting, and signed by him, is as follows:\n7TH JULY, 1853.\nReceived, from Adam H. Wallbridge, the sum of \u00a390 5s. 0d. on account of purchase of one half lot, No. 8, in the second concession of the Township of Thurlow and County of Hastings, which I have agreed to sell to him for two hundred and fifteen pounds, said Wallbridge to bear one half of the expense of the suit now going on respecting said half lot in the Court of Chancery and Queen\u2019s Bench, the remaining five hundred dollars to be paid this Fall. If the suit in Chancery does not terminate successfully, then each party to sustain half the loss, and said Wallbridge is not then to pay five hundred dollars.\n(Signed), G. TAYLOR.\n(Signed), ADAM H. WALLBRIDGE.\nWallbridge says the consideration was what he paid the College, and that he made no entry of what he paid. George says:\nMy agreement with Wallbridge had not been made before the proceedings were commenced. It was after the proceedings had commenced, and I had got disheartened about the costs that I made the arrangement with Wallbridge.\nAnd after the written agreement is brought to light, which is dated 7th July, 1853, and shows an entirely different transaction from any one of those put forward by George or Wallbridge, he says:\nI think the bargain was made before the deed was obtained from the College, and long before this document seems to be signed. I have no recollection whether this contains the bargain between us. I have no recollection that he was to pay me $500 the next Fall. It is in A.H. Wallbridge\u2019s handwriting. I don\u2019t know whether I received the money mentioned in the document.\nThough he had before stated \u201cI think the agreement or contract with Defendant was in writing;\u201d that he had a copy at home, and had it the previous night; that it was then at home, and that the agreement related to this land.\nAnd when produced, he says: The paper, writing now produced and shown me is the written agreement with Defendant, Wallbridge, and myself. It is signed by Mr. Wallbridge and myself.\nWallbridge says:\nI think the bargain was made with George Taylor about a month or six weeks before the deed issued from the College. No litigation was going on. I made the bargain with George Taylor before money was sent to College. My bargain with George Taylor was, that I was to pay the College and indemnify him against all costs of suit that might be brought against him respecting the land, and I was to get half the land. * * I do not think there was any memorandum in writing. The litigation took place after the deed was obtained from the College.\nAt another time, he says:\nI paid a balance of a note to Filliter to make up the amount of difference between the money I paid the College and the money going to Taylor. In making up the account I took the amount of the College money and the amount Taylor had paid on chancery suit, and paid the balance on the Filliter claim. I never searched my Bank account to see how I paid the money to Taylor.\nAgain, he says:\nI paid the money that went to the College. I paid it to George Taylor. I made no entry of it. I think I paid George Taylor money on account of this land. I can\u2019t remember what I paid. I think I paid him \u00a3215, the consideration money in the deed.\nGeorge says:\nMr. Wallbridge paid me no money for the half he got. I conveyed the whole lot to him, and he conveyed back the half to me. This was done at Wallbridge\u2019s advice. I do not think the money to pay the College was furnished by Defendant (Wallbridge.) My remembrance is that I furnished it myself.\nAnd on 15th May, 1856, he swears:\nThe amount I paid to the College was about \u00a3145.\nThe written paper shows the payment to have been on the 7th July, 1853, and for \u00a390 5s. 0d., instead of \u00a3143 7s. 1d., the amount paid the College. Both say nothing remained to be paid. The paper says $500 was still to be paid; and, if Wallbridge\u2019s account is correct. he paid the money in 1851; made no entry of it; had no writing to evidence his payment or his agreement in reference to this land, and, therefore, must have continued in that position till 29th December, 1856.\nThen, as to this bon\u00e2 fide purchase for value, it is difficult to understand how any prudent business man of ordinary capacity could make so large a purchase, and on such unusual terms, and pay so much money on account of it, and make no entry of any such payment; take no written memo of the agreement, or the terms of a transaction of so exceptional a character, and which the law required to be in writing to be binding and effective, and which could not be completed for an indefinite period, and so continue for years without any binding agreement, receipt, voucher or inditia of title, or payment of any kind, or even any entry in his own books; nor is it easy to be understood how Defendants, in the position these parties were\u2014their minds so much at variance as to the particulars of this transaction\u2014should appear before the Court without having examined their books and cash and bank accounts, and exhausted all other means of information calculated to sustain their contention. If they had such means of information, and did not choose to resort to them; or, if they had no such entries and no such accounts, no documents, no books to refer to, they cannot complain, if a transaction conducted so out of the usual and ordinary course of business, and left to rest on evidence so unsatisfactory, is not accepted.\nBut taking Wallbridge\u2019s contention in a way the most favorable to him, he has no case. The power of attorney gave no authority to George to make any one of the various arrangements spoken of by George and Wallbridge, and certainly gave no authority to give effect to an arrangement entered into, as Wallbridge persists in saying, not only before the title came to William from the College, but before George assigned to William, and, therefore, long before George had any authority from William to interfere with or dispose of any interest he may have had therein, and certainly the power gave no authority to George to convey the whole land to Wallbridge, or authority to Wallbridge to re-convey half to George.\nBut if the sale was in other respects unobjectionable, the transaction, it seems to me, could not stand. An attorney or trustee for sale is entirely disabled from purchasing the trust property. If George, and Wallbridge as attorney under him, were acting for William in securing the title, in recovering possession and effecting a sale of this property for William, they could not sell the property on William\u2019s behalf to themselves. The rule is now universal, that however fair the transaction, the cestui que trust is at liberty to set aside the transaction and take back the property. The law simply will not allow a man to be at the same time a seller and a buyer; therefore, any one intrusted with the sale of another\u2019s property, who directly or indirectly becomes the purchaser, commits, ipso facto, so far a fraud in the eye of the law that the owner may, at his election, avoid such sale.\nIn McPherson v. Watts[16], Lord Cairns, Ch., says:\nIt is here that the pointed observations by Lord St. Leonards, in this House, in the case of Lewis v. Hillman[17], become so very material. They were not observations laying down any new rule of law, for the same principles had already been applied in numerous cases, but what Lord St. Leonards said in that case, was this: Take the case of a sale of any kind, which is so fair, so reasonable as to price, so entirely free from anything else that is obnoxious, as to be capable of being supported, yet, if there has entered into that sale this ingredient, that the client has not been made aware that the real purchaser is his law agent\u2014if the purchase has been made in the name of some other person for that law agent\u2014that is a sale which cannot be supported. My Lords, so say I here. Assume, if you please, that in every respect as to price, and as to all other things connected with the sale, this was a sale which might have been supported had the McPherson family been told that Watt was the purchaser; in my opinion, it cannot be supported from the circumstance that that fact was not disclosed to them.\nThe defence of the Statute of Limitations is raised by the Defendant\u2019s answer.\nChief Justice Haggarty says it was conceded by the Respondent, the Defendant, on the argument, that the Statute of Limitations had no application to this case as a bar or otherwise, and I understood it was so admitted on the argument before this Court, but as some doubts have been expressed on this point, it is necessary for me to show why I think the Plaintiff\u2019s claim is not so barred.\nGeorge says:\nI dispossessed Canniff, and I went into possession; I cannot tell when.\nThe means by which he dispossessed Canniff was the suit against Fairman (Canniff\u2019s tenant), consequently it must have been after the date of that judgment\u201427th November, 1856\u2014that he went into possession.\nWallbridge says the land was in possession of Osborne (Canniff\u2019s tenant) when the deed was obtained from the College.\nGeorge is examined the 15th May, 1856, and says:\nI brought an ejectment against Plaintiff, Canniff, in my brother\u2019s name, by the advice of Wallbridge. The action of ejectment was brought in 1853; that was staid by injunction. Canniff is still in possession.\nThe deed from W.J. Taylor by his attorney, George, to A.H. Wallbridge, is dated the 29th December, 1856, and the bill was filed in this cause on the 25th April, 1874. I cannot conceive how he can claim a possessory interest in this land before the date of the deed to him, and before he had any possession, actual or constructive, and as the judgment in ejectment against Fairman, who held under Canniff hostile to all parties, was signed on the 27th November, 1856, and this was the first litigation brought in the name of William Taylor, as A.H. Wallbridge says by him, to get the possession, and under which possession was obtained, how then can he claim a title by possession before the possession was acquired? From all this, it is abundantly clear that neither Wallbridge nor George had 20 years possession; so this defence fails.\nBut it has been urged that the Plaintiff has acquiesced in the sale, and by lapse of time is now estopped from disputing the validity of the sale under the power of attorney. As there never was any sale of William\u2019s interest in this property, it is somewhat difficult to understand how the doctrine of acquiescence is to be applied to a case of this kind; but suppose it applicable, I am by no means prepared to dispute that, while in cases of expressed trust by act of the parties no time will be a bar, acquiescence for a long time in an improper sale may disable a person from coming into a Court of Equity to set it aside. I am, nevertheless, at a loss to conceive how it can be claimed there was any such acquiescence in this case. Lapse of time can only commence to run from the discovery of the circumstances\u2014until such discovery, or until such reasonable notice of what has happened has been given to the party injured, as to make it his duty, if he intends to seek redress, to make enquiry and to ascertain the circumstances of the case. No man can be supposed to acquiesce in that of which he was in entire ignorance. What are the circumstances under which we are asked to find an acquiescence in this case? The property being the property of William, then absent from the country, was, with other large property, placed by him in the charge of George, and George employed a solici- tor to assist him in the management and litigation connected with the property. William appears, from time to time, to have striven to obtain a knowledge of the state of his property and the doings of his agent, by writing for money and information which he was certainly entitled to, but which he appears to have sought in vain, for it is not pretended that the one or the other was ever sent him. In this state of ignorance as to his affairs, he appears to have returned in October, 1873, and then finds, that while absent, the deed had been obtained in his name, actions at law and equity had been brought in his name, and as the result of such litigations, possession of the property had been obtained in his name; but instead of all this being done for his benefit, he finds that his agent and his attorney in such litigations repudiate his right and his title, and setting up a right in his agent, had under color of a sale, not of his (William\u2019s) interest, but of an alleged interest of George, his agent, divided the property between themselves, by George, conveying the whole to Wallbridge, under an authority from William to George to sell his (William\u2019s) property, and Wallbridge re-conveying half back to George.\nThis would appear to be the first intimation that the principal had of any act or deed by his agent or attorney inconsistent with his interest or their duty. On the 25th April, six months after discovering the position of his property, he files this bill. Can it be said there has been laches, delay, or acquiescence; on the contrary, I think there has been the greatest promptitude after the facts appear to have come to his knowledge upon which the supposed acquiescence is founded.\nBut it has been argued that as the deeds from him to Wallbridge, and from Wallbridge to George, were on record, he could have discovered the transactions. This, to me, is simply a monstrous pro- position, as applied to an absent person who leaves an accredited agent behind him to look after his property in his absence, which agent employs an attorney to assist him and represent his principal in Court and out, both of whom he had a perfect right to expect were guarding his interest, and not invading his rights, and both of whom well knew that in his absence any examination of the records by him was simply impossible. To hold that the improper acts of agents or attorneys, under the authority confided to them, are to be considered as acquiesced in, because their principal does not cause, during his absence, a constant supervision to be kept over them, would be to enunciate a principle I have never yet heard propounded, and which, I humbly think, would entirely weaken, if not overturn, those principles by which the relation of principal and agent and attorney and client are governed.\nThough very unwilling to differ from the majority of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, for which Court, I need not say, I have the very highest respect, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the decree of Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot was right, and that his decision ought not to have been reversed.\nI, therefore, think the appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario reversed, and the decree of Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, dated 6th March, 1875, affirmed, with the costs of this appeal, and the costs of the re-hearing, and in the Court of Appeal of Ontario.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe Appellant, by his bill, impeaches a transaction which took place in the year 1851, the bill having been filed in 1874. This lapse of time, though by itself, under the circumstances of the case, it may have no conclusive effect as constituting either a statutory or equitable bar, ought, at least, to induce the Court to make every fair and reasonable presumption in favour of the validity of a transaction sought to be avoided after such gross delay, and to require strict proof from the Appellant in support of his case. That the Respondent has been prejudiced in his defence by the delay which has occurred is apparent from the fact that the mind and memory of his principal witness, George Taylor, has, in this long interval, become so impaired that his recollection of the circumstances attending the original bargain between himself and the Respondent is imperfect and indistinct.\nThe extraordinary perversion of this property, which was originally a leasehold interest, from the destination of it prescribed by the will of John Taylor, who devised it to be divided amongst his wife, his nephew, and such of his children as should reside on the farm\u2014a disposition with which the dealings of his widow and executrix, Jane Taylor, in surrendering the lease and entering into a contract of purchase, were entirely inconsistent\u2014calls for no explanation in this suit, for, as the learned Chancellor has observed in his judgment on the rehearing, it was not for the interest of any of the parties litigant to call in question this dealing with the land by Jane Taylor, the executrix, since they all claim under her contract of purchase with King\u2019s College.\nThe evidence shows sufficiently that the transfer of the 30th October, 1841, by George Taylor to the Appellant, was for value. That the consideration for this sale was $50, both George Taylor and the Appellant agree. They differ as to the fact of payment. The Appellant says he paid his brother this sum. George Taylor denies this, and in his evidence, both in this cause and in the former suit of Canniff v. Taylor, he swears his brother never did pay him. I think the fair inference from this evidence is in favour of the conclusion, which was arrived at by the majority of the Court of Appeals, that no money was ever paid by the Appellant.\nThe assignment of the 29th November, 1847, made by the Appellant to George, purports on its face to have been an absolute transfer of William Johnston Taylor\u2019s interest. There is no evidence to show that it was made in trust, or to enable George to deal with the property as William\u2019s agent, except that of the Appellant himself, whose oath in this respect is again contradicted by that of George. It is true that no valuable consideration was paid; but, if I am right in assuming that the proof establishes that no part of the price of the previous assignment to him had been paid by William, this makes no difference. I deny the proposition that a voluntary assignment, such as this, by itself, warrants the implication of a resulting trust[18]; the inference, on the contrary, strengthened here by the fact that the transaction was between persons in the relation of brothers, is that a gift was intended. But, even if there would be prim\u00e2 facie a resulting trust, the implication of such a trust might always be rebutted by the surrounding circumstances.\nThen, what have we here? A re-assignment of an executory contract of sale under which no money had been paid by the purchaser, and that, too, a sale of a property of which the price contracted to be paid appears to have been the full value. Under such circumstances, the fair presumption at this distance of time, when we find a re-assignment by the vendee to the vendor, is that a rescission of the contract was in- tended to be effected in an informal manner. All the assignments here are informal, and none of them state the true consideration upon their face. In the case of an ordinary contract of sale, when we find the vendee, six years after the contract, re-assigning to the vendor, no part of the purchase-money having been paid, and the vendor swearing that an absolute assignment was intended, I should think it was out of the question that the transaction itself raised a trust by implication. Then, this leaves it entirely a question upon the evidence, and, I think, the weight of testimony is greatly in favor of George Taylor\u2019s account of the matter. All the probabilities point to an intention merely to undo the transfer of 1841, so as to revest the interest in the land, under the contract with the College, in the unpaid vendor. It is upon this part of the case, the effect of the assignment of 1847, that, as it appears to me, the only difficulty arises, and I, at first, took a different view of the result of the evidence. Subsequent reconsideration has, however, led me to take the view I have just enunciated, which is, I think, demonstrated to be the correct conclusion in the admirable exposition of, and reasoning upon, the facts contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson.\nThen, if the interest in the land was absolutely vested in George by the assignment of 1847, I feel no difficulty about the proper result to be attributed to the subsequent transaction, either upon the facts, or as regards the law applicable to those facts. The evidence throws much more light on the facts connected with the assignment of the 12th April, 1851, by George to the Appellant, than on the other part of the case. At this date William was in California, whither he had gone in 1849. No communication was had with him relating to this transfer, and it cannot, therefore, be said for a moment to have had as its basis any con- tract or agreement between the brothers. It was entirely voluntary on the part of George, and was made, as stated by Mr. Wallbridge, at his suggestion, for reasons which he gives. He says:\nBy taking the deed from the College, I thought Canniff might prosecute for taking a title in litigation. The litigation I meant that was to be avoided by taking the deed from the College to William, was the qui tam action against George Taylor.\nAt the date of these transactions, in 1851, the penal clauses of the Statute of Maintenance[19] were in full force, and many qui tam actions for penalties incurred by dealing with lands in litigation, or the titles of which were in dispute, had been upheld, some under circumstances of peculiar hardship, considerations which soon afterwards led to a legislative enactment repealing those clauses. Much alarm and anxiety in dealing with land in any way in litigation or dispute, although under circumstances to which the Statute could not apply, was, as will be remembered by those engaged in the practice of the law at that time, created by the decisions I have referred to. That the Statute would not have had application, as it clearly would not, since the title to be acquired from the College could not have been a pretenced title within the Statute, makes no difference. The apprehension, though ill-founded, was not at that time altogether unreasonable, and there is nothing incredible, but very much the contrary, in Mr. Wallbridge\u2019s statement that it constituted the reason for taking the conveyance in the name of the Appellant, William Taylor, who, in California, would have been beyond the reach of an informer\u2019s action for penalties, even if such an action could have been maintained. The object being to take the conveyance in the name of William, the assignment was indispensable to attain that end, since the College officers would not have made the purchase deed to him without a transfer in the established form prescribed and alone recognized by them. The assignment preceded the conveyance by twelve days only, this last instrument being executed on the 24th April, 1851. The money was advanced by Wallbridge to George Taylor, and paid by the latter to the College.\nA power of attorney must have been soon afterwards forwarded to California, for it was executed by William Taylor, at Carson\u2019s Creek, in California, on the 11th October, 1851. Putting the power of attorney altogether out of the question, the transaction, always assuming that George acquired an absolute interest under the assignment of 1847, would have clearly been that of a purchaser paying his own purchase-money and taking the conveyance in the name of a stranger\u2014a transaction which, on the most elementary principles of equity, would have caused a trust to result by implication of law in favour of the real purchaser. The assignment was made merely to satisfy the formalism of the officers of the public body, the College; and the College, in all respects, so far as the law applicable to it is concerned, stood precisely on the same footing as if an ordinary purchaser from a private vendor had paid the purchase-money, and then appointed the conveyance of the land to be made to a third person, without any communication with that third person. As I have said, the legal effect of such a transaction depends on elementary principles which no one will dispute. Then, could the power of attorney in any way detract from the rights of George Taylor, if he became, as I maintain he did, by the operation of the resulting trust which arose, the cestui que trust of this land, and the true beneficial and equitable owner of the estate. So far from having any such effect, the power of attorney materially strengthens the position assumed by the Court of Appeal in this respect. It gave the real owner of the estate power to deal with the bare legal estate which was outstanding in a trustee, and was nothing more than a clumsy mode of attaining the same end which would have been reached by a more artificial process of conveyancing, if George Taylor, whom I hold to have been the real purchaser, had taken a conveyance in his brother\u2019s name, with a power of appointment in fee limited to himself. I regard the three instruments, the assignment of 12th April, 1851, the purchase deed, and the power of attorney as all parts of the same transaction, the object of which was to vest the legal estate (for the reason given by Mr. Wallbridge) in the Appellant for the behoof of George Taylor, with a power of free disposition over it reserved in favor of the latter. It was, no doubt, inartificially done, but the science of conveyancing, tested by English models, had not, at that time, attained much perfection in the country districts of Upper Canada; and, at all events, we are to judge these impeached transactions by their legal effect and good faith rather than by their symmetry.\nI have not noticed the effect of the evidence of George Taylor, in the suit of Canniff v. Taylor. It might have constituted an additional reason for taking the conveyance to William that it would, as it was thought, make George a good witness in that suit. Certainly, George Taylor then swore he had no interest in the land, which was, literally taken, untrue, if I am right in the view which I have taken of the character and effect of the various assignments; but, I think, we find a very sufficient explanation of this in the evidence given by George Taylor in this suit after he had entered into an amic- able compromise with his brother. He says: \u201cI swore to this, because I had made this transfer to him, the Plaintiff.\u201d In other words, he says he swore to this statement in ignorance, which, in a layman, might be pardonable, of that provision of the Statute of Frauds which exempts resulting trusts from its operation, and of those judicial decisions of English Equity Courts which have decided that when a man buys and pays his own money and takes a conveyance in the name of another\u2014a stranger\u2014a trust shall result for him who pays. This is all the utmost ingenuity can make of George Taylor\u2019s evidence, if we accept his explanation, given on his last examination as a witness in this cause, and it seems so reasonable, that I cannot bring myself to reject it; and to bind Wallbridge by evidence given behind his back, when he had no right of cross-examination, and was not in any way a party in the cause.\nAnother point remains to be noticed. It has been put forward as an argument that the deed had, according to the Respondent\u2019s own testimony, been taken in the Appellant\u2019s name to cloke what was apprehended to be an illegal transaction, and for that reason no trust arises by operation of law. To refute this argument the case of Childers v. Childers[20] was cited for the Respondent. Childers v. Childers, so far as I can discover, has no bearing on this objection; but in a case of Davies v. Otty[21] this precise point arose. There it was held that a conveyance which was made by a party in apprehension of a prosecution for felony, with a view to defeat the forfeiture and escheat of an estate in lands which would have followed a conviction, to a trustee on a secret parol trust to reconvey, should the fact turn out to be that no felony had been committed, did not become absolute and freed from the trust merely because the settlor had made the conveyance under the influence of a fear which proved to be chimerical, with an intent to defeat the rights of the Crown in the event of his conviction. Here, equally, there was no foundation for the apprehension under which George Taylor was advised and induced to take the deed in his brother\u2019s name, and consequently there is nothing to obviate his setting up the trust which arises from the payment of the purchase money. Upon these grounds, I am of opinion, that the proper decree was that made by the Court of Chancery on the re-hearing, and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, dismissing the bill with costs.\nHad I taken a different view of the facts in regard to what I consider the turning point of this case, the character of the assignment of 1847, I should, notwithstanding, have come to the same conclusion. This appeal, which, in the view of it which I have already stated, depends principally on a single question of fact, would, if the assignment of 1847 is regarded as having been made in trust for the Appellant, and the re-assignment and the conveyance are to be taken as vesting the estate in the Appellant as the true beneficial owner, have turned on questions of law as applied to the transactions between George Taylor, as the agent and trustee for the Appellant, and the Respondent. There could, I think, be no doubt but that the power of attorney enabled George to sell, and also to perfect a sale by a conveyance in the name of his brother, and that the authority to sell was not confined to a sale in one lot, but authorized a sale in separate parcels. This being so, I should have thought the sale to Mr. Wallbridge of one-half the lot in April, 1851, for a price which there is not a word of evidence to show was inadequate\u2014the fact, indeed, so far as there is any proof, being the other way\u2014entirely unimpeachable. For the evidence does not support, what is assumed as a fact in the judgment of one of the learned Judges in the Court below, namely, that at the time of the purchase or agreement to purchase by Mr. Wallbridge he was the attorney or partner of the attorney, for the Appellant. The only evidence on the point is that of Mr. Wallbridge, the Respondent, who says he did not enter into partnership with his brother until Feb. 1, 1853. Therefore, in April, 1851, he was as free to buy as any stranger. It is true that the receipt which constitutes the earliest written evidence of the sale is dated in July, 1853, and that the conveyance to the Respondent was not executed until the 29th December, 1856. Prim\u00e2 facie, no doubt, the contract of sale ought to be referred to the date of the memorandum, but it is only evidence of the agreement, not the agreement itself, and it is quite competent for parties, in order to show that a sale was made at a time when no professional or fiduciary relationship existed, and in order to refute a charge of equitable fraud, to prove by parol testimony that the true contract preceded the date of the written evidence in which it was afterwards recorded. We have, then, a sale to Mr. Wallbridge of one-half of this land in April, 1851, at a time when he was under no disability to purchase, as standing in the relationship of solicitor to the vendor. What is there in this evidence which should avoid such a sale? Nothing, except the circumstance that, when the conveyance came to be executed five years after the date of the sale, it was made to include, not only the half of the land which Wallbridge had purchased, but also the remaining half which he was to re-convey, and did re-convey, to the vendor\u2019s agent and attorney in the matter of the sale. Now, had the original agreement been fettered with this condition, I grant that it ought, if the objection to the sale had been raised in due time, to have constituted a ground for setting it aside. But there is nothing to show that it was any part of the agreement, and the memorandum of July does not recognize any such arrangement. If, therefore, it is now to have the effect retrospectively of avoiding the fair, honest and unimpeachable bargain of April, 1851, or of July, 1853, if that is the date which should be assigned to the contract, it can only be on the principle that the Respondent, having concurred with the agent, George Taylor, in offending against the rules of equity in carrying out an unimpeachable sale by a conveyance which had the effect of a breach of trust as regards other lands, is to have his own purchase annulled by way of penalty for his concurrence in such a breach of trust in respect of the other lands. The answer to such a position is contained in a simple reference to the rule that a Court of Equity never acts punitively, except in the matter of costs. If the original purchase by Mr. Wallbridge was free from the taint of any improper dealing with the lands for the benefit of the trustee, the relief against him, in respect of his concurrence in the breach of trust, was limited to the lands re\u2011conveyed to George Taylor.\nI have not dwelt much on the legal consequences of the fact that the true date at which to test this transaction is April, 1851, when the original bargain was made, and neither that of the written memorandum nor of the conveyance, because I consider the principle, that a valid contract having been entered into between parties who are, as it is phrased, at arm\u2019s length, is not subjected to the rules regulating contracts between solicitor and client, if that relationship should happen to spring up in the interval between the contract and the conveyance, to rest on rules of equity too clear and sound to need demonstration. The other principle, that to show a contract free from equitable fraud, it is allowable to prove that it was concluded at a date anterior to the written instrument by which it is evidenced, is also, I think, so clear on authority that it would be superfluous to quote cases to establish it.\nBut there is another consideration which seems entirely to have escaped the observation of one of the learned Judges in the Court below, who lays stress on Mr. Wallbridge being the Appellant\u2019s Attorney when he purchased. It seems to have been assumed that the incapacity of the solicitor to purchase is absolute. This is clearly not the law. All that the law requires in the case of such purchases\u2014unlike the case of a purchase by a trustee for sale for his own behoof\u2014is that the attorney purchasing shall have withheld from his client, the vendor, no information in his possession which may have influenced him in making the contract, and that he must prove he gave full value[22]. There is no suggestion that Mr. Wallbridge possessed any information affecting the value of the land which he ought to have communicated; and, as to inadequacy, the only evidence as to value, that of Mr. Wallbridge himself, is strong to show that not only was the price as much as the land was worth, but that his purchase has been far from a profitable one. So that, even if we fix the time of the sale at the date of the written memorandum, in July, 1853, when the Respondent had entered into partnership with his brother, the Appellant\u2019s solicitor, in the litigation with Canniff, I fail to see that, tested by those sound rules which Courts of Equity have laid down for the regulation of transactions between solicitor and client, there would be any ground for impeaching this purchase.\nLastly, I should, if the case depended on that alone, feel that I ought to agree with the learned Vice-Chancellor Blake in holding lapse of time (irrespective, of course, of the Statute of Limitations, which can have no application) a sufficient bar to the Appellant\u2019s suit. The Appellant might have known, at any time after the 3rd January, 1857, when the two deeds by which the legal estate was vested in Wallbridge and George Taylor, respectively, were registered, how his attorney had dealt with these lands. It is not, therefore, like the case of a concealed transaction. Where the means of knowledge exist. Courts of Equity, in cases of laches, attribute the same effect to lapse of time as when actual knowledge is proved. Numerous decisions of the Equity tribunals in Upper Canada\u2014and it is the law of that portion of the Dominion we are now administering\u2014show that much greater strictness has been applied there, particularly since 1849, when the Court of Chancery was re-organized, as regards laches in cases relating to real property, than that which prevails in England, and for the good reason that the constantly increasing value of lands would make the indulgence which is extended in England impolitic and inequitable in this Province. I am of opinion that the Appellant\u2019s omission, not only to pursue his rights, but even to make any specific enquiry as regards these lands for 18 years, ought alone to be fatal to his claims, even if they were in other respects well founded. And more especially ought this to be the result when, as in the present case, the Defendant has been prejudiced by, the loss of evidence.\nAs a Court of Equity, in considering the effect of lapse of time as an equitable bar, always acts in analogy to the positive rules of law in reference to the effect of time under the Statute of Limitations, I also agree with the learned Vice Chancellor that the Statute of Canada, 25 Vic., Cap. 20, passed in 1862, having repealed the provision in the Statutes of Limitations making absence from the Province a disability, the absence of the Appellant in California constitutes by itself no excuse for his laches.\nI am of opinion that the order of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe Appellant in this case seeks to set aside, as fraudulent, colorable and collusive, a conveyance made by the Defendant, George Taylor, as his attorney or agent, to the Respondent (Wallbridge) of certain parcels of land situate at or near Belleville, Ontario, and also a deed made by the Respondent, Wallbridge, to George Taylor, by which he re\u2011conveyed to the latter, at the same date of the conveyance from George Taylor to him, one-half of the land conveyed by George to him.\nJudgment by default was entered against Simpson, one of the Defendants; and George Taylor and the Appellant made a settlement, since the suit, in regard to the parcel of land held by him under the conveyance from Wallbridge. We have, therefore, only to deal with that part of the case which lies between the Appellant and the Respondent, Wallbridge. The latter, in his answer, claims that, although the title of the lands in question was in William, George had, at the time he conveyed to him, the beneficial interest, and that he, Wallbridge, having furnished the money to pay the amount due to the College to George, had also a beneficial interest in the land conveyed to William by the said College, and that, therefore, William was the trustee of George or himself.\nIf such were the case admitted by William, the title still remained in him, but only as such trustee, and, therefore, the conveyance to Wallbridge under the power of attorney would not be inequitable. We must, therefore, see whether that was the undoubted position of William. There is no evidence that he ever admitted that he was the trustee of George. There is nothing, I think, in the circumstances to sustain the position that he could be called the trustee of Wallbridge. The evidence that he, Wallbridge, ever paid any of the consideration for the deed from the College to William is contradictory. Wallbridge himself does not positively say he paid any of it, but on cross-examination leaves it too contradictory and doubtful to have any effect or weight. He says:\nI paid the money that went to the College. I paid it to George Taylor. I made no entry of it. I knew that George Taylor swore that he paid the money. I think I paid George Taylor money on account of this land. I can\u2019t remember what I paid. I think I paid him \u00a3215, the consideration money in the deed. I think Mr. Taylor got my brother Lewis to send the money to the College. It may have been my money. My impression is that it was; but it is so long ago that I cannot remember distinctly.\nThe fair presumption is, that under the circumstances, as so related by Wallbridge, if he advanced any money at all, it was to George, and not on William\u2019s credit; but it would be hard to conclude for a moment that, even by his own showing, there is any evidence to declare William his trustee; and George\u2019s evidence goes rather to negative the fact of any money being advanced by Wallbridge to pay the balance due on the land to the College. George says:\nI paid the money. I forget how I raised the money. It strikes me I got the money from Mr. Grass to pay the College. I have no distinct remembrance. I think, if Defendant Wallbridge gave me the money, he charged me with it. * *\nHe says again, on his cross-examination by Mr. Wallbridge:\nI do not think the money to pay the College was furnished by the Defendant Wallbridge. My remembrance is, that I furnished it myself. That part of the Respondent\u2019s (Wallbridge) answer, being unsupported by any reliable evidence, must be ruled out. The defence, on the other ground, is, that William, when the deed was made to him by the College, became the trustee of George, through the payment by the latter of the sum of \u00a3145, the balance due of the purchase-money\u2014by which the beneficial interest became vested in George, although the title went to William.\nTo determine that point, we must first see how the parties, George and William, then stood in relation to the land and to each other. To do this, I will start from the agreement made by Jane Taylor, the mother of William and George, to purchase from the College. That document bears date the 3rd of March, 1832. The consideration \u00a3100, of which \u00a310 were paid at the time, and the remainder was to be paid by annual instalments of \u00a310 each, with interest, from the 25th March in that year. Jane does not appear to have made any payment beyond the first \u00a310, but she, on the 26th November, 1839, assigned her interest in that agreement to George Taylor for the actual consideration of $50.\nUnder that assignment, the first act of George appears to have been a sale by him to William of his interest therein. The instrument made by the former to the latter is dated the 30th day of October, 1841, and the consideration agreed upon was $50. The Respondent Wallbridge contends that the consideration for the latter assignment was not paid, and, therefore, there is a resulting trust in favor of George, but, as will be seen, neither the law nor the evidence sustains that contention. First, as to the evidence, George says:\nAfter I held it (the agreement) some years, through the influence of my mother, I agreed to let Plaintiff have it, which I did. He agreed to pay me what I had paid, but he never did pay me. In his answer to interrogatories in chief, in the suit of Canniff against William, he makes, in substance, the same statements. Here there was a clear intention to part with all his interest\u2014not a mere conveyance without a consideration or use stated or declared. If it were true that William did not pay George, the latter might have had an equitable lien upon the land for the $50 William had agreed to pay him, if it were a purchase of land; but here it was merely an assignment of a a right to become the owner of it by paying the balance of the purchase money, and no equitable lien could arise. If, however, George assigned to William under an agreement that William was to be merely his agent to complete the purchase, he might, in case of the latter taking a conveyance to himself, have had an equitable demand on William, as being his trustee, to convey the land to him. There could, however, be no resulting trust in William merely from the failure on his part to pay George the $50. A resulting trust arises only where land is conveyed without any consideration alleged or paid, or, strictly speaking, where no use is declared, and where, by the evidence, it appears such was the intention of the parties to the conveyance. If A bargains to sell land to B for a certain sum, and that A gives a deed to B, I am not aware of any law by which A can claim a resulting trust in B, if the latter fails to pay the consideration money. Equity might decree a lien in A for the consideration money and any necessary further relief against B for the recovery of the consideration money, but here the remedy ends. The beneficial interest would remain in B, subject to A\u2019s equitable lien arising from the non-payment of the consideration money.\nWilliam, however, says in his evidence:\nI had obtained an assignment at one time of the right my brother had in the land in dispute. * * * I paid George $50 at the time I made the purchase, and got the assignment from him. The evidence is therefore so conflicting that, if the case depended on a determination of that disputed point, I would not feel justified in founding any judgment upon it in favor of the Respondent, who, in such a case, is bound to furnish evidence clear from reasonable doubt, which is not the case here. But in his viv\u00e2 voce examination in 1856, George makes this significant statement respecting his second transfer to William a few days previous:\nI cannot tell why Mr. Wallbridge advised me to assign to my brother. He advised me to do so and I followed his advice. I had no reason but that I had not paid my brother for the land. * * * * * My brother never paid me anything for it.\nFrom the whole of George\u2019s statements together I should feel inclined to conclude that, as he had been William\u2019s agent in the sale of his lands, he got the $50 in some shape, if not from William direct, for otherwise he would not have considered himself bound to make the last assignment for the reason he gave, that he \u201chad not paid\u201d his brother \u201cfor the land.\u201d\nI consider, then, that William, under the assignment from George, became legally and equitably his assignee of the right to complete the purchase from the College. William retained that right until, being about to leave the country, he, on the 29th of November, 1847, assigned to George. About a year after George\u2019s assignment to him, William himself, and by his attorney, Mr. Lewis Wallbridge (on the 28th November, 1842), wrote to the bursar of the College in respect to the land; informed him that he had become the assignee; that he was then able to pay \u00a325, and wished to learn the longest terms of payment; and whether he could get a deed on producing the assignment from George. No answer to this application was shown; but we can reasonably conclude that some satisfactory arrangement was made, for George, in his deposition before mentioned says: My brother had made two or three payments to the College.\nThe dates of these payments are not given; but they must have been made before William went to California. They appear to have been made to the knowledge of George, and he, during six years, treats William as having the beneficial interest; how, then, can he, or any one claiming under him, pretend for a moment there was any such agreement or understanding between him and William as would raise a resulting trust in the latter. William\u2019s position was fully admitted by the College, with the, at least, implied assent of George; and how could he claim any beneficial interest afterwards in the land? William held the right in question for over six years, and, being about to leave the country, made an assignment, as he alleges without contradiction, of the right in question to George, as his agent, without any consideration whatever. As to this position there can be no doubt, for both he and George unequivocally so state. George says, in his examination in Canniff v. Taylor:\nThe assignment from William Taylor to me was without consideration, and made to me because William was going to California.\nGeorge must, under this evidence, be considered the trustee of William; and I can, therefore, understand why it was that Mr. Wallbridge advised in 1856 a re-assignment to William, and the taking of the deed in his name from the College. Holding the trust for William, it would have been a fraud for George to have taken the conveyance to himself, and a title under the conveyance consequently defective. William and his mother together must have paid seventy or eighty pounds on account of the purchase-money; and no Court of Equity would have permitted George to hold the title to the land against his principal in such circumstances. He admits his agency from William, and it is shown by the latter and him that he sold thousands of dollars worth of William\u2019s lands. Mr. Wallbridge, knowing the facts and relationship of George to William in regard to his lands, might very properly feel that a title through George, under such circumstances, would be insecure.\nIndependently, therefore, of the positive statements of William and George, the other circumstances afford strong prim\u00e2 facie evidence that the conveyance by George was as agent or trustee of William. George, having so acquired the right in question in 1847, held it till the 12th of April, 1851, when he re-assigned to William, as he says, because he had never paid the latter anything for it. He must have considered the beneficial interest was in William, and having made the transfer to William, he is estopped from denying that beneficial interest.\nOn the 24th of the same month George paid the balance of the purchase money, interest and costs, amounting to about \u00a3145, and obtained a deed from the College to William.\nIt is contended for the Respondent, Wallbridge, that under the circumstances William became the trustee of George of the beneficial interest in the whole lot, and that he, Wallbridge, having received a conveyance from George of it, and having retained one-half of it, his title to it is good against William, and, if not, that the conveyance to him from William by George as his attorney or agent transferred William\u2019s title to him, both at law and in equity. In the first place, then, did the payment of the balance of the purchase money by George and the conveyance to William in consequence thereof create an executory trust in William and give George the beneficial interest?\nThe power was expressed to be to sell the land in question. Did that power necessarily give the power to convey? A parol power to sell would certainly not include a power to convey, and does the fact of the power being under seal make any difference? When special power is given to perform any prescribed duty or service, it necessarily implies a power to do all subordinate things that are necessary to the performance of that duty or service, and the principal would be bound to the same extent as if all that the agent did were specially stated in the power. After an exhaustive search I can find neither a case nor an authority that a power to sell, even under seal, gives one to convey. Authorizing one to sell or enter into a contract for a sale requires the reposing of much less confidence in an agent than the power to convey and receive the consideration money. No authority was cited in support of the proposition, although one of the grounds taken on the part of the Appellant. I do not, however, base my judgment on that objection; but if it were not rendered unnecessary by other considerations, I would feel bound, as at present advised, to decide against the power to convey. All the authorities concur in the proposition that an agent, constituted so for a particular purpose, and with a limited and circumscribed authority, cannot bind the principal by any act in which he exceeds his authority[23].\nIt is a well settled rule that all written powers, such as letters of attorney, or letters of instruction, shall receive a strict interpretation, and the authority is never extended beyond that which is given in terms, or is absolutely necessary for carrying the authority so given into effect[24].\nThe power to convey is in no way subordinate to the power to sell or to contract for a sale. The latter power can be exercised by entering into a contract binding on the principal, and may, therefore, be fully executed. The rights and obligations of the principal may thereby be totally changed, so that specific performance would be decreed. Personal property, passing by sale and delivery by an agent, binds the principal, who, by his delivery to the agent, gives him an implied authority to deliver to the purchaser. With real estate it is quite different; and authority to sell is not held to be an authority to make a feofment under the common law; and, by a parity of reasoning, the power to sell would not include one to convey. Payley[25] says:\nThe agent or solicitor of the vendor cannot, without special authority, receive and give a discharge for the purchase money, and the usual indorsed receipt is in equity no conclusive evidence of payment.\nSugden on vendors[26] says:\nA purchaser cannot safely pay the purchase money to the vendor\u2019s attorney without the seller\u2019s authority, although he is intrusted with the conveyance and is ready to deliver it up.\nFrom a full consideration of all the authorities, my judgment is irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that George had not, under the letter of attorney from William, anything more than a power to contract for a sale; and in the construction of written documents it would be wrong and dangerous to speculate as to \u201cthe belief of the Plaintiff,\u201d that \u201cthe power given included all that was necessary to pass the title to a purchaser,\u201d as suggested by one of the learned judges. If he had not the power to convey, it necessarily follows that his deed to Wallbridge would convey no interest. The general rule, that when an attorney or agent does any act beyond the scope of his power, it is void as between the appointee and the principal, which has always prevailed, and which is elementary in the doctrine of powers, is applicable to this case. The appointee is not bound to deal with the attorney or agent; but if he do, he is bound to inspect the power when in writing, and he is held to understand its legal effect, and must at his peril see that the attorney or agent do not transgress the prescribed boundary.\nThe subsisting authority in this case, and the only one, was the power of attorney; and as the execution of the deed to Wallbridge was by procuration, he was bound to look at and be governed by the authority given to the agent, and ignorance of its restrictive character is no legal or equitable excuse.\nThe next point to consider is that of the alleged constructive trust in William, under the deed to him.\nTo establish such a trust, parol evidence is admitted, and, also, to rebut the implication of it. It may be shown by evidence of the agreement of the parties, at the time of the purchase and payment; or it may be the result of proved facts from which a beneficial interest may be decreed in the party purchasing and paying for land, and who takes the conveyance to another. There is no doubt that \u201cwhere a man buys land in the name of another, and pays the consideration money, the land will be generally held by the grantee in trust for the person who pays the consideration money\u201d[27]; and, if George, when paying the balance of the consideration money, comes within that principle, he would, undoubtedly, have the beneficial interest.\nThe authorities all provide for cases where the purchase was made and the consideration paid by the purchaser, either in whole or some specified proportion of it; but I can find no case of a beneficial interest having been declared in favor of one who did not him- self purchase, but who only paid a part of the consideration money years after the purchase was made. The purchase in this case was made by Jane Taylor, nineteen years before the payment by George and the deed to William; and the latter had the right to complete the purchase ten years before that time. The first constituent of the rule is, therefore, wholly wanting, and I know of no law or principle by which one man can step in between two contracting parties, and, by an unauthorized payment of a balance of purchase-money, oust the purchaser. By paying only a balance he admits the legal position of the purchaser; and doing so, cannot be permitted to deny it, so as to obtain a beneficial interest, and thereby deprive the purchaser of his previous rights. Equity at once opens its eyes to such a transaction, and may properly inquire how a party so acting can expect to turn the purchaser from his rights, under the agreement, into a mere trustee for his beneficial interest. It has been said William and his mother only paid a small part of the purchase-money. Between them, as I have shown, they must have paid seventy or eighty pounds; but it matters not how much they paid, the principle is the same; and we are not required here to estimate the proportion. Suppose but fifty out of two hundred pounds remained due, would there be any other principle applicable? Under the agreement for the bargain and sale, the College became a trustee for, and was seized to the use of, William. The bargain vested the use to be executed on payment of the balance of the purchase-money. How, then, could George step in and divest William of his right under the agreement as before stated. There is no question of \u201clien\u201d in this case. The question of a grantor\u2019s \u201clien\u201d does not arise; and, besides, if George had an equitable \u201clien\u201d Wallbridge could not set it up; at all events, it is not set up in this suit. The claim here is not for a partial trust to the extent of the money paid by George, but for the whole beneficial interest. Had William no interest in the land under the payments he could claim credit for, and which George got the benefit of?\nIt is quite certain, if land be purchased by two, or by one for two, and each pays a part of the consideration money, but the conveyance is made to one, there is a constructive trust for the other to the extent of the proportion paid by him. To this, however, there is applicable a further rule which is, says Brown on Statute of Frauds[28].\nThat though there may be a trust of a part only of the estate by implication of law, it must be of an aliquot part of the whole interest in the property. The whole consideration for \u201cthe whole estate, or for the moiety, or third or some definite part of the whole, must be paid\u2014the contribution or payment of a sum of money generally for the estate, when such payment does not constitute the whole consideration, does not raise a trust by operation of law for him who pays it; and the reason of the distinction obviously is, that neither the entire interest in the whole estate, nor in any given part of it, could result from such a payment to the party who makes it, without injustice to the grantee, by whom the residue of the consideration is contributed.\nAnd for his doctrine he cites numerous United States decisions. He adds:\nUpon the same view it is held, that if the proportion paid towards the consideration, by the party claiming the benefit of the trust, cannot be ascertained, whether because its valuation is, from the nature of the payment, uncertain, or because the sum paid is left uncertain upon the evidence, no trust results by operation of law.\nIt must be admitted, however, that the amount paid by George is certain enough, but the proportion to the whole is not shown by the evidence, and the relative interest in the whole is, therefore, equally uncertain as in the other case, which would leave it, I think, subject to the same objection. It is unnecessary to say whether the doctrine first quoted should be considered authority or not, for, if the evidence fails to show the amounts paid by each, the authorities concur in saying that no trust exists.\nThe payment, I conceive, must have formed part of the original transaction. Washburn on real estate[29] says:\nBut where the husband paid part of the purchase money for land conveyed to the wife, but such payment was subject to the purchase and formed no part of the original transaction, no trust resulted in his favor.\nAgain:\nIf one pays only part of the purchase money and another another part, but the definite proportion cannot be fixed, no trust will result.\nAgain:\nSo where A bought land and paid for it and had the deed made to B, upon his agreement to repay the money at a future time, no trust was raised in favor of A. The intention of the parties to the transaction was, that B and not A should be the beneficial owner.\nAnd again:\nBut where one of two joint purchasers upon credit pays the whole debt, it does not raise a resulting trust in his favor. In carrying out the doctrine above stated, it has been held that the payment which raises a resulting trust, must be part of the transaction and relate to the time when the purchase was made. Any subsequent application or advance of the funds of another than the purchaser towards paying the purchase money will not raise a resulting trust.\nHe truly exhibits the principles acted upon generally in the United States, where transfers by deeds of bargain and sale are similar to those in this country, and I find no English authority but sustains the general statement of the law by him. In Blodgett v. Hildreth[30], it was held that it was unnecessary to show that the purchase money was actually paid at the time the conveyance was made, but that \u201cit would be sufficient to show that it was paid in pursuance of the contract by which the purchase was made.\u201d Brown on Statute of frauds[31] says:\nA resulting trust attaches only when the payment is made at the time of the purchase, and a subsequent advance will not have that effect.\nThe payment, then, by George, in my opinion, raised no trust in his favor, but if we take his own statements for a guide, it will be unnecessary to think long as to the legal effect of them. In his answer, under oath, in the cause of Canniff against William, as the agent of the latter in 1852, (the year after the deed to William,) he (George) says:\nThis Defendant (William) by his agent (George) applied for and obtained the deed of the said land from the said College and paid the balance of principal and interest due to the College thereon, as he humbly submits and insists he had a right to do.\nThese statements, having been made so soon after the date of the deed, and several years before George took any steps to obtain any title to the land for himself, are entitled to every favorable consideration when contrasted with his subsequent ones, made when it became necessary to sustain his alleged fraudulent transfer to Wallbridge. If he made the payment as agent of, or in the interest of, William, as his friend, he could safely say the latter had done so, and his statement above quoted to that effect is true, and his subsequent statement that he (George) paid the money is not in conflict therewith; and it will be observed that in all the subsequent references by George, in his examinations in Canniff v. Taylor, and in this suit, he does not in the slighest degree contradict the statements I have quoted from the answer he put in as William\u2019s agent, in 1852. I feel bound, therefore, to conclude that the statement, in the answer, that he paid the money as William\u2019s agent, is substantially true. He received the conveyance, by his own sworn statement, without consideration from William, for whom he subsequently acted as agent in his absence. The latter sent him $1,000 from California; and he sold thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of William\u2019s property; and he does not allege that he did not repay himself for any money advanced by him, if he really did advance it. If he did subsequently repay himself, he would be estopped from seeking to enforce the trust, if it ever existed. He could not play fast and loose; and having once received payment, his equitable interest was at an end, and he could not revive it, even by a tender back of the money. Situated as he was, he was bound, I think, to show he had not done so before seeking to establish a trust in William.\nTwo points yet remain. The first is can Wallbridge be held to be a purchaser without notice. His title being through the deed executed by George under the power, I do not see how it can be contended that he had not sufficient notice. He was the attorney in the ejectment suit against Canniff\u2019s tenant (Fairman) brought for William in 1851 immediately after his deed from the College, and so continued until the issue of the habere by him in December, 1856, under which the possession of the land was recovered for William. In about a month afterwards the conveyance of the whole lot is made to him. His knowledge of William\u2019s affairs and of George\u2019s dealings with them commenced as far back as 1851. George advised with him respecting the deed from the College. He says himself he had at one time in his possession the agreement of Jane Taylor to purchase and all the assignments of it. He was not, it is true, the attorney of William in Canniff\u2019s suit; but when he was such attorney in the ejectment suit, which was staid by an injunction in the former, and his right to proceed depended on the success of the equity suit, and the consequent dissolution of the injunction, it is too much to suppose, that in view of all the peculiar circumstances in evidence, he, Wallbridge, was unaware of the answer put in by George and of the statement therein, that the defendant by his agent had paid the balance of the purchase-money. George says it was he, Wallbridge, that retained Mr. Mowat in Canniff\u2019s suit; and he, as attorney of William, should have seen and approved of the answer. I can come to no other conclusion from what I have stated, and from a good deal more which need not be stated, that Wallbridge knew well all the circumstances, and, therefore, cannot be held an innocent purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice. Besides, the evidence that he ever paid anything for the land is too uncertain and contradictory\u2014his own statements conflict, as do those of George, and they contradict each other, and the receipt contradicts both. He swears he paid George \u00a3215 in one part of his examination, and then comes down to a doubtful thought that he paid him something. George swears he neither paid him the \u00a390 5s. mentioned in the receipt, or any part of the consideration money of his deed. He, Wallbridge, says he paid it all before the deed to William. The receipt two years afterwards is but for \u00a390 5s. If he paid it all about the time of, or before, the deed to William, how did it become necessary to pay \u00a390 5s. two years afterwards? The receipt, before mentioned, contains a provision for the payment of $500 of a balance the next fall; but if the suit in Chancery did not terminate successfully, each party was to bear half the loss, and the $500, in that event, were not to be paid. The suit in question did \u201cterminate successfully,\u201d but still no one pretends the $500 or any part of them were paid, and George swears they were not paid, nor the \u00a390 5s. either. This receipt and agreement clearly show that no money was paid at the time of the deed to William, and the evidence otherwise shows that no money was paid afterwards.\nThere are, too, further fatal objections. Wallbridge at the time of the conveyance to him was the adviser of George, acting as the agent of William, and thereby with full knowledge occupied a fiduciary relation to William, and, such as, in my opinion, should prevent his purchasing in the way he did. He advised the whole affair and knew, or was bound to have known, that under the terms of the power George had only authority to sell for cash, or at all events for a sum certain, and not to make the payment contingent upon the success of a suit. Besides, if he bought the half only, his taking a deed of the whole under an agreement to convey back immediately to George the other half, and thereby make his deed the conduit pipe of a transfer of William\u2019s title to his agent, George, would, independently of anything else, be sufficient to avoid the conveyance to him. It was, under any circumstances, a legal fraud, if nothing further, and one which equity is bound to condemn and frustrate. The bill only asks for a reconveyance of what remained unconveyed by Wallbridge; and the questions raised require, as in the words of Lord Redesdale in Hevenden v. Annesley[32] to decide\u2014\nWhether it would be good conscience to interfere in his (Appellant\u2019s) favor to take from the Respondent that which would be a defence at law.\nI consider we are bound not so to interfere, and if the objection that was raised as to the staleness of his claim, amounting to laches, is not permitted to obtain, our judgment should, I think, be for the Appellant. The evidence shows that the Respondent\u2019s title under the deed was obtained in 1856. The Appellant\u2019s bill was filed the 25th April, 1874. The Appellant\u2019s claim has not been barred by the Statute of Limitations. By, section 31 of chapter 88 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, the limitation of suits in equity, in respect of lands, is made the same as in law.\nSection 82 provides that,\nWhen any land or rent shall be vested in a trustee upon any express trust, the right of the cestui que trust, &c., to bring a suit against the trustee or any one claiming through him to recover such land or rent, shall be deemed to have first accrued * * * at and not before the time at which such land or rent shall have been conveyed, &c.\nSection 33 provides that,\nIn every case of concealed fraud the right of any person to bring a suit in equity for the recovery of any land or rent, of which he or the person through whom he claims may have been deprived by such fraud, shall be deemed to have first accrued at, and not before, the time at which such fraud shall, or with reasonable diligence might have been, first known or discovered.\nSection 34 contains a proviso exempting from the operation of section 33 cases of bon\u00e2 fide purchasers for valuable consideration.\nSection 35 exempts from the operation of the act the rule and jurisdiction of courts of Equity, \u201cin refusing relief on the grounds of acquiescence or otherwise to any person whose right to bring a suit may not be barred by virtue of this act.\u201d\nHow then does this legislation affect the rights of the Appellant?\nIn the first place his claim is not barred by the statute for a good reason. In the first place twenty years had not elapsed from the date of Respondent\u2019s conveyance before action, and taking the conveyance estops Wallbridge from saying the Appellant was not then in pos- session; and, secondly, there was a concealed fraud unknown to the Appellant until his return. The conveyance is not to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for valuable consideration, and, therefore, section 33 fully applies.\nArchbold v. Scully is a case of appeal in 1861 to the House of Lords[33], in which, under the Statute, the Plaintiff\u2019s legal remedy was barred several years before action, and the defence of the Statute and acquiescence and laches was set up. In delivering judgment Lord Wensleydale says:\nSo far as laches is a defence, I take it that, where there is a Statute of Limitations, the objection of simple laches does not apply until the time allowed by the Statute. But acquiescence is a different thing. It means more than laches * * * But the fact of simply neglecting to enforce a claim for the period during which the law permits him to delay, without losing his right, I cannot conceive to be an equitable bar. In this case I cannot say that anything has been done or permitted which falls under the definition of acquiescence.\nLord Chelmsford, in the same case, says:\nHave any laches or acquiescence, then, been established to disentitle the Appellant to the relief which he prays? Acquiescence in the sense of mere passive assent cannot be regarded as anything more than laches or delay, as Lord Cranworth said in the Rockdale Company v. King[34]: \u201cMere acquiesence, if by acquiescence is to be understood only the abstaining from legal proceedings, is unimportant. Where one party invades the rights of another, that other does not, in general, deprive himself of the right of seeking redress merely because he remains passive, unless, indeed, he continues inactive so long as to bring the case within the purview of the Statute of Limitations. In this case, however, there has been no substantial alteration in the condition of the Respondent, and there is nothing in the conduct of the Appellant beyond his having suffered so many years to elapse after the right accrued before its assertion. This, in my opinion, is not sufficient to disentitle him to the assistance of a Court of Equity to obtain the relief which he seeks.\u201d\nThe Appellant, in his petition, claims only a re-conveyance of the land remaining unsold, and in regard to that part, there being \u201cno substantial alteration in the condition of the Respondent,\u201d and nothing whatever in the conduct of the Appellant in the shape of delay to seek the assistance of the Court as soon as he returned and become aware of the transaction which he seeks to avoid, I cannot discover anything like acquiescence, or the slightest evidence of even mere laches or delay. I think, therefore, the Court is bound \u201cby good conscience to interfere in his favor;\u201d that the appeal should be allowed and judgment given in favor of the Appellant, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: George Dean Dickson.\nSolicitors for Respondent: Fitzgerald & Arnoldi.\n[1] 14 Grant 40.\n[2] 1 Grant\u2019s Er. & App. 148.\n[3] 30 Beav. 175.\n[4] 3 Hare 25.\n[5] 24 Beav. 541; 3 DeG. & J. 1.\n[6] 13 Equity Ir. p. 451.\n[7] 5 Hare 542.\n[8] 510.\n[9] 28 Beav. 562.\n[10] Vol. 1, p. 186, Vol. 2, p. 656.\n[11] 6th ed., 150.\n[12] 16 Grant 76.\n[13] 6 H.L. 332.\n[14] 16 Grant 76.\n[15] Vol. 1, sec. 162, p. 180.\n[16] L.R. 3 App. Cas. 263.\n[17] 3 H.L. 607\u2014630.\n[18] Young v.

J. on the ground that The Dominion Controverter Elections Act, 1874,\" was ultra vires.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of Meredith, C. J., 1st. That \" The Dominion Controverter Elections Act 1874\" is not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament and whether the Act established a Dominion Court or not the Dominion Parliament had a perfect right to give to the Superior Courts of the respective Provinces and the Judges thereof the power and impose upon them the duty of trying controverter elections of members of the House of Commons, and did not, in utilizing existing judicial officers and established Courts to discharge the duties assigned to them by that Act, in any particular invade the rights of the Local Legislaturas.\n2.

That the Dominion Parliament has the right to interfere with civil rights, when necessary for the purpose of legislating generally and effectually in relation to matters confided to the Parliament of Canada.\n4.

J., that \"The Dominion Controverted Election Act, 1874,\" established, as the Act of 1873 did, as respects elections, a Dominion Court.\nAPPEAL from a judgment rendered by Meredith, C. J., ([1]) in the Superior Court for Lower Canada District of Quebec, dismissing the preliminary objections of the Appellant to an election petition brought by the Respondent under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act 1874, against the return of the Appellant, as member of the House of Commons for the electoral District of Montmorency.\nThe main question which arose on the preliminary objections, and on this appeal, was, whether the Dominion Parliament could legally impose on the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, and the Judges thereof, the duty of trying Controverted Elections of members of the House of Commons.\nMr. Pelletier, Q. C., for Appellant:\u2014\nThe Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 did not create a Dominion tribunal but invested with new attributes the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec and its Judges. The federal principle has for its end to preserve and protect the autonomy of the provinces, and the British North America Act has enumerated the rights and duties of every one of them. By the 92nd section of that Act, in each province, the Legislature has an unlimited authority and a power beyond control to make laws in relation to the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts. If so the Federal Parliament cannot add to, take from, or extend the jurisdiction of provincial tribunals. All the Judges agree on this point. Wilson, J., in the Niagara case ([2]) holds that \"The Dominion Parliament has not the power to en large or diminish the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts.\" Meredith, C. J., in this case says: \u201cI do not question the proposition, that under the Act of Con federation the Dominion Parliament cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts.\" Stuart, J., in the case of Belanger v. Caron ([3]), says; \" There can be no doubt that the Dominion Parliament is prohibited from making laws in relation to any Court of this Province and in relation to the administration of justice by it.\" Casault, J., in the case of Guay v. Blanchet ([4]), says: \" To concede to the Federal Parliament the power to make the Provincial tribunals, for federal objects, federal courts, is to acknowledge that it has the right to determine the questions to be liti gated, and the jurisdiction, and the manner in which the Courts are to exercise it.\"\nMcCord J. in the Bellechasse case ([5]) held that the Parliament of Canada has no power to extend the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec. Now, the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec owes its existence to an Act of the Province of Quebec, and its jurisdiction is such as the Code of Procedure established and is circumscribed by the limits of the Province. There is nothing to show that this Court ever had before Confederation the power to try an election petition, and under sec. 92, No. 14, of the British North America Act, the Provincial Legislatures have no authority to legislate upon the subject of controverted elections for the House of Commons. This power exists in the Dominion Parliament but if the Dominion Parliament has no power to give to the Superior Court the jurisdiction of the Circuit or of other Courts, on what principle can they give to such a Court, whose maintenance and organization are' exclusively under the control of the Provincial Legislature, the exclusive jurisdiction which has always belonged to the House of Commons of pronouncing upon the validity of the election of its members? Suppose the Provincial Legislature had abolished the Superior Court immediately after the passing of this Act, would the Superior Court still be said to exist under this Act? A tribunal exists only when its judgments and decisions are invested with an authority which allows them to compel their execution. The judgment of the Superior Court is not valid outside of the limits of the Province, and unless this Act extends the jurisdiction of that Court beyond the territorial limits of the Province, the Court is powerless to decree that a member has not the right to sit in the House of Commons. I submit that the Dominion Parliament has not the power of extending the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court, and that an election petition against the return of a member for the House of Commons can only be tried by a Dominion Court.\nIt is also contended, a new court was created. Where do we find the elements constituting such a Court? Is it because the Act refers the petitions to the Superior Court, which exists already? Is it in the fact that the Court is presided, over by a judge holding no commission, but already appointed to hold the Superior Court, or because the officers directed to act are the officers of the Superior Court, provincial employees, over \"whom the Federal Government has no control? On the contrary, is it not evident that it was not the intention to create a new tribunal l as Mr. Justice McCord says, in the case 01 Deslauriers v. Larue in re The Controverted Election of Bellechasse ([6]):\" That the Dominion Controverted Elections Act 1874 does not intend to create a Dominion Court is apparent from the fact that it repeals the Controverted Elections Act 1873 which did create a Dominion Court, and that instead of substituting other provisions for the same purpose, it provides by section 3, that an election petition shall be tried by a provincial court as if such petition were an ordinary cause within its jurisdiction. From the difference between the two statutes, it is evident, not only that the Federal Parliament in passing the later one did not intend to create an additional court, as it had the power to do under section 101 of the British North America Act, but that it actually intended to not create one.\nSee also Mr. Justice Wilson's judgment in the Niagara case ([7]).\nBy the Act of 1873 the Judge, as an individual, was charged to try Controverted Elections, but the Act of 1874 says it is the Superior Court which is to try elections.\nBy section 30 of the Dominion Act, the Court is to report to the Speaker the result of the trial. What jurisdiction can he exercise to determine as to the right to a seat in a parliament held in another Province? Then we have the 11th and 13th secs. of the Act as to fixing the time and place of trial, all of which proves sufficiently that it was the intention of the Parliament to give this Court the additional jurisdiction to try election petitions.\nIt is said that under the 4th section a special tribunal has been created, from the fact that it is called \u201cCourt of Record.\" Supposing that such be the case, that tribunal would be imperfect; for the petition would be presented before the ordinary Superior Court, and in virtue of sections 11 and 13, the Superior Court only could fix the trial. This section, moreover, is only the reproduction of sec. 29 of 31 and 32 V., c. 125, and it was never contended there that these words had made a new or distinct tribunal of the Court of Common Pleas. It is the special Court, which the Judge presides over during the trial, which section 48 constitutes a Court of Record. The Courts to which Parliament has referred the Controverted Elections are still Provincial Courts. The provisions of this section have not deprived them of their character.\nSee Judge casault's judgment on this point in Guay v. Blanchet ([8]).\nAppellant further contends that the contestation of an election does not constitute a civil right and form de piano part of the jurisdiction of the civil courts of the Province of Quebec, and does not involve any civil plea, cause or matter, or any right, remedy, or action of a civil nature, such as contemplated by the laws from which the Superior Courts and the Judges thereof derive their jurisdiction.\nIt is a political right which the Respondent is praying the Court to have enforced; viz., that the Appellant be declared by the Court to be the legal representative of the electors of the constituency of Montmorency. This surely is not a civil but a political matter.\nThe learned counsel referred to the judgments of McCord J. in the Bellechasse case (not reported), and. of Casault, J., in the Levis case ([9]), and. commented at length on the cases therein cited in support of this branch of his argument; concluded by contending that, even if the Superior Courts had power to decide controverted elections on account of their original jurisdiction, that power would be in a latent state, since the Dominion Parliament cannot frame rules of procedure for Provincial Courts.\nMr. Langlois, Q. C, (the Respondent):\u2014\nThe first case I will rely upon is the case of Bruneau v. Massue ([10]). In that case Dorion, C. J., said that the J Judges as citizen were bound to perform all the duties which are imposed upon them by either the Dominion or the Local Legislature, provided neither Legislature had exceeded the limits of its legislative power.\" I contend that the only answer Judges can give to Parliament is that all their time is taken up in the discharge of the administration of justice and they are unable to execute their laws, but they can't say to parliament \" you have no right to call upon us to carry out your laws.\" But when, as in this case, the Judge says: \" I voluntarily execute powers given to me by an authority who has exclusive legislative power over the subject matter, \" I cannot see how it can be expected that this Court will say, this Judge wants to exercise a power he has no right to exercise.\nAs to the first objection that the Controverted Elections Act of 1874 does not create a Dominion Court. I admit that it does not specifically say that the Superior Court will be a Dominion Court but indirectly such a Court has been created under sec. 48. It is true it is the only section which says it is a Court of Record, but that is sufficient. It cannot be denied that the Dominion Parliament had the right to say that certain persons should perform the duties of trying election petitions. Now, this is all that has been done, for it is easy to ascertain who are the Judges of the Superior Courts, and, if so, they are empowered to act by this Statute, and they can do so constitutionally. As to the Dominion Parliament having no authority to enlarge the jurisdiction of Provincial Courts, I contend that giving to these judges the right to try election petitions does not enlarge their jurisdiction. The fact of a Judge of a Court exercising judicial powers in virtue of a Statute which the legislative body had power to pass, does not enlarge the jurisdiction of that Court. If so, any legislation on insolvency, and other matters exclusively under the control of the Dominion Parliament, would be enlarging the jurisdiction of the Courts, who are bound to administer the laws of the Dominion Parliament, as well as the laws of the Provincial Legislatures.\nWhether you call petitioning against the return of a member exercising a political or civil right, it is immaterial The only distinction in law matters is between civil and criminal matters. There is no political matter in law as distinguished from civil or criminal matters.\nThe last objection is that which has reference to the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament over procedure. I submit that if the Dominion Parliament has the right to legislate who shall try election petitions, the procedure must follow the whole subject. The exclusive power of the Provincial Legislatures as to the regulation of procedure can only extend to matters over which they have exclusive authority, viz., over civil matters, and certainly not matters over which the Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power, such as procedure in regard to insolvency.\nIt was also said that certain sections of the Act show that the duties assigned are to be performed by the Court, and not by the Judge. The answer to this objection is to be found in sec. 3 of the Act which declares that the expression the Court means any one of the Judges of the Court, and it may be well to remark that all the duties imposed may be discharged by one single Judge. The election cases of Montreal Centre ([11]) and of Argenteuil ([12]) were also relied upon.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nThis is an appeal from, the judgment of Mr. Chief Justice Meredith, dismissing the preliminary objections of the Appellant, and declaring u The Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874,\" to be not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament; and the correctness of this determination is the only question now in controversy.\nThis, if not the most important, is one of the most important questions that can come before this court, inasmuch as it involves, in an eminent degree, the respective legislative rights and powers of the Dominion Parliament and the Local Legislatures, and its logical conclusion and effect must extend far beyond the question now at issue. In view of the great diversity of judicial opinion that has characterized the decisions of the provincial tribunals in some provinces, and the judges in all, while it would seem to justify the wisdom of the Dominion Parliament, in providing for the establishment of a Court of Appeal such as this, where such diversity shall be considered and an authoritative declaration of the law be enunciated, so it enhances the responsibility of those called on in the midst of such conflict of opinion to declare authoritatively the principles by which both Federal and local legislation are governed.\nPreviously to Confederation, the Governor or Lieutenant Governor, Council and Assembly in the respective Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and Nexo Brunswick, formed a legislative body of the Province, subordinate, indeed, to the Parliament of the Mother Country and subject to its control, but, with this restriction, having the same power to make laws binding within the Province that the Imperial Parliament has in the Mother Country; and the propriety and necessity of such enactments were within the competency of the Legislature alone to determine. As the House of Commons in England exercised sole jurisdiction over all matters connected with controverted elections except so far as they may have restrained themselves by statutory restrictions, the several Houses of Assembly always claimed and exercised in like manner the exclusive right to deal with, and be the sole judges of, election matters, unless restrained in like manner, and this claim, or the exercise of it, I have never heard disputed; on the contrary, it is expressly recognized as existing in the Legislative Assemblies by the Privy Council in Th\u00e9 berge vs. Landry ([13]). When the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick sought \" to be \" federally united into one Dominion, under the Crown \" of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \" Ireland, with a constitution similar in principles \"to that of the United Kingdom,\" it became absolutely necessary that there should be a distribution of legislative powers, and so we find the exclusive powers of the Provincial Legislatures very specially limited and defined, while legislative authority is given to the Parliament of Canada to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by the act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is declared that, notwithstanding anything in the act, the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion of Canada shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next thereinafter enumerated. It will be observed that of the classes of subjects thus enumerated, either in respect to the powers of the Provincial Legislatures or those of the Parliament of Canada, there is not the slightest allusion, direct or indirect, to the rights and privileges of Parliament, or of the Local Legislatures, or to the election of Members of Parliament, or of the Houses of Assembly, or the trial of controverted elections, or proceedings incident thereto. The reason of this is very easily found in the Statute, and is simply that, before these specific powers of legislation were conferred on Parliament and on the Local Legislatures, all matters connected with the constitution of Parliament and the Provincial Constitutions had been duly provided for, separate and distinct from the distribution of legislative powers, and, of course, overriding the powers so distributed; for, until Parliament and the Local Legislatures were duly constituted, no legislative powers, if conferred, could be exercised.\nThus, we find that, immediately after declaring that there shall be one Parliament of Canada, consisting of the Queen, Senate and the House of Commons, the Imperial Act provides for the privileges of those Houses in these terms:\u2014\nThe privileges, immunities and powers to be held, enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons and by the Members thereof, respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by the Act of the Parliament of Canada, but so that the same shall never exceed those at the passing of this Act held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and by the Members thereof.\nAnd, after declaring what the constitution of the House of Commons shall be and defining the electoral districts of the four Provinces, it makes provision for the continuance of existing election laws until Parliament of Canada otherwise provides in these words:\u2014\nUntil the Parliament of Canada otherwise provides, all laws in force in the several Provinces at the Union relative to the following matters, or any of them, namely:\u2014The qualifications and disqualifications of persons to be elected or to sit or vote as Members of the House of Assembly or Legislative Assembly in the several Provinces, the voters at elections of such Members the oaths to be taken by voters, the Returning Officers, their powers and duties, the proceedings at elections, the periods during which the elections may be continued, the trial of controverted elections, and proceedings incident thereto, the vacating of seats of Members, and the execution of new writs in case of seats vacated otherwise than by dissolution, shall respectively apply to elections of Members to serve in the House of Commons for the same several Provinces ([14]).\nAnd by the 31 Vic., Cap. 23, it is enacted that:\nThe Senate and the House of Commons, respectively, and the Members thereof, respectively, shall hold, enjoy and exercise such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as at the time of the passing of the British North America Act 1867 were held enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the Members thereof, so far as the same are consistent with and not repugnant to the said Act, such privileges, &g. shall be deemed part of the General and Public Law of Canada and it shall not be necessary to plead the same, but the same shall, in all courts in Canada, and by and before all judges, be taken notice of judicially.\nIn England as is well known, before 1770, controverted elections were tried and determined by the whole House of Commons, or, for a time, by special committees, and by committees of privileges and elections. This was succeeded by the Grenville Act the principle of which was to select committees for the trial of election petitions by lot. This Act, in 1773, was made perpetual, but not without the expression of very strong opinions against the limitations imposed by it upon the privileges of Parliament ([15]).\nIn 1839, an act passed (Sir Robert Peels Act) establishing a new system upon different principles, and it was not till 1868 after Confederation, that the jurisdiction of the House of Commons, in the trial of controverted elections was transferred by statute to the courts of law. Very much the same course of procedure, up to and after the time of Confederation, prevailed in some if not all of the Provinces.\nBut in 1873 the Dominion Parliament passed an Act to make better provision respecting election petitions and matters relating to controverted elections and Members of the House of Commons and established Election Courts, the judges of which Were to be judges of Supreme or Superior Courts of the Provinces, provided the Lieutenant Governors of the Provinces, respectively should by order made by and with the advice and consent of the Executive Council thereof have authorized and required such judges to perform the duties thereby assigned to them, the intervention of the Legislature not being required, or, apparently, deemed necessary. This Act was repealed by the 37 Vic, cap. 10, \" An Act to make better provision for the trial of Controverted Elections of Members of the House of Commons, and respecting matters connected therewith.\" This last Act, it is now contended, is ultra vires. The constitutionality of the Act of 1873, though questioned, as I understand, by one judge in Quebec, is, I believe admitted, by all those who now think the Act of 1874 ultra vires to have been intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nIn determining this question of ultra vires too little consideration has, I think, been given to the constitution of the Dominion, by which the legislative power of the Local Assemblies is limited and confined to the subjects specifically assigned to them, while all other legislative powers, including what is specially assigned to the Dominion Parliament is conferred on that Parliament; differing in this respect entirely from the constitution of the United States of \u00c1merica, under which the State Legislatures retained all the powers of legislation which were not expressly taken away. This distinction, in my opinion, redness inapplicable those American authorities, which appear to have had so much weight with some of the learned judges who have discussed this question. And, as a consequence, too much importance has, I humbly think, been attached to section 101, which provides for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada and to sub-sections 13 and 14 of section 92 which vest in the Provincial Legislatures the exclusive powers as to property and civil rights in the Provinces and \"the administration \"of justice in the Provinces, including the constitution, \" maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts \" both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\"\nThe establishment of additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada was primarily I think, intended to apply, when deemed necessary and expedient, rather to the general laws of the Dominion than to matters connected with the privileges immunities and powers of the Senate and House of Commons, though., of course, those might, incidentally, if so provided, come within the jurisdiction of such tribunals; that the property and civil rights referred to L were not all property and all civil rights, but that the terms \"property and civil rights\" must necessarily be read in a restricted and limited sense, because many matters involving property and civil rights are expressly reserved to the Dominion Parliament of which the first two items in the enumeration of the classes of subjects to which the exclusive legislation of the Parliament of Canada extends are illustrations, viz.:\u20141. \" The public debt and property ;\" 2. \"The regulation of trade and commerce ;\" to say nothing of \" beacons, buoys, light houses, &c, \" navigation and shipping,\" \" bills of exchange and promissory notes,\" and many others directly affecting property and civil rights; that neither this, nor the right to organize Provincial Courts by the Provincial Legislatures was intended in any way to interfere with or give to such Provincial Legislatures, any right to restrict or limit the powers in other parts of the Statute conferred on the Dominion Parliament; that the right to direct the procedure in civil matters in those courts had reference to the procedure in matters over which the Provincial Legislature had power to give those Courts jurisdiction, and did not, in any way, interfere with, or restrict, the right and power of the Dominion Parliament to direct the mode of procedure to be adopted in cases over which it has jurisdiction, and where it was exclusively authorized and empowered to deal with the subject matter; or take from the existing courts the duty of administering the laws of the land; and that the power of the Local Legislatures was to be subject to the general and special legislative powers of the Dominion Parliament. But while the legislative rights of the Local Legislatures are in this sense subordinate to the right of the Dominion Parliament, I think such latter right must be exercised, so far as may be, consistently with the right of the Local Legislatures; and therefore the Dominion Parliament would only have the right to interfere with property or civil rights in so far as such interference may be necessary for the purpose of legislating generally and effectually in relation to matters confided to the Parliament of Canada.\nIt is, I think, to section 91, in reference to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and to sections 18 and 41, conferring privileges on the Senate and House of Commons, and legislative power over the trial of controverted elections and proceedings incident thereto that we must look to ascertain whether the Parliament of the Dominion, in enacting the 37 Vic. cap. 10, exceeded its powers, because, I think, all the other sections conferring legislative powers must be read as subordinate thereto and because I cannot discover that any of the other provisions apply, or were intended to apply, to the particular subject matter thus legislated on, and which, I think, it was intended should be alone dealt with by the Dominion Parliament in any manner it might deem most expedient for the peace, order and good government of Canada. I think that the British North America Act vests in the Dominion Parliament plenary power of legislation, in no way limited or circumscribed and as large and of the same nature and extent as the Parliament of Great Britain, by whom the power to legislate was conferred, itself had. The Parliament of Great Britain clearly intended to divest itself of all legislative power over this subject matter and it is equally clear, that what it so divested itself of, it conferred wholly and exclusively on the Parliament of the Dominion.\nThe Parliament of Great Britain with reference to the power and privileges of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, and with reference to the trial of controverted elections, has made the Parliament of the L Dominion an independent and supreme Parliament, and given to it power to legislate on those subjects in like manner as the Parliament of England could itself legislate on them. It is a constitutional grant of privileges and powers which cannot be restricted or taken away except by the authority which conferred it, and any power given to the Local Legislatures must be subordinate thereto.\nThe case of the Queen vs. Burah ([16]) enunciates a principle very applicable to this case. The marginal note is:\nWhere plenary powers of legislation exist as to particular subjects, whether in an Imperial or in a Provincial Legislature, they may be well exercised either absolutely or conditionally; in the latter case leaving to the discretion of some external authority the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect, as also the area over which it is to extend.\nAnd Lord Selborne, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\nBut their Lordships are of opinion that the doctrine of the majority of the court is erroneous, and that it rests upon a mistaken view of the powers of the Indian Legislature, and indeed of the nature and principles of legislation. The Indian Legislature has powers expressly limited by the act of the Imperial Parliament which created it. and it can, of course, do nothing beyond the limits which circumscribe those powers. But, when acting within those limits, it is not in any sense an agent or delegate of the Imperial Parliament, but has, and was intended to have, plenary powers of legislation, as large and of the same nature as those of Parliament itself. The established Courts of Justice, when a question arises whether the prescribed limits have been exceeded, must of necessity determine that question: and the only way in which they can properly do so, is by looking to the terms of the instrument by which, affirmatively, the legislative powers were created, and by which, negatively, they are restricted. If what has been done in legislation is within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited (in which category would, of course, be included any Act of the Imperial Parliament at variance with it), it is not for any Court of Justice to inquire further, or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions.\nWhether, therefore, the Act of 1874 established a Dominion Election Court or not I think the Parliament of the Dominion, in legislating on this matter, on which they alone in the Dominion could legislate had a perfect right, if in its wisdom it deemed it expedient so to do to confer on the Provincial Courts power and authority to deal with the subject matter as Parliament should enact; that the legislation, being within the legislative power conferred on them by the Imperial Parliament their enactments in reference thereto became the law of the land, which the Queen's Courts were bound to administer.\nI am at a loss to discover how the conferring of this jurisdiction on the Judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, and on those Courts, in any way interferes with or affects, directly or indirectly, the autonomy of the Provinces, or the right of the Local Legislatures to deal with such property and civil rights in the Provinces, and the administration of justice in the Provinces, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in such civil matters in those courts, as the Local Legislatures have a right to deal with, reading, of course, those matters so to be dealt with, as subject and subordinate to the superior powers and authority of the Dominion Parliament over all subjects not assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces, of which subjects pre-eminently prominent as beyond the jurisdiction or control of the Local Legislatures, stand the privileges, immunities and powers to be held, enjoyed and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the Members thereof, respectively, and all rights connected with the qualifications and disqualifications of persons to sit or vote as Members of the House of Commons the voters at the election of such Members the Returning Officers, the proceedings at elections, and the trial of controverted elections, and all proceedings incident thereto.\nTransferring this new and this peculiar jurisdiction vested in the House of Commons to the Supreme and Superior Courts, in other words, substituting those courts in place of the House of Commons in relation to these matters, with which the Local Legislatures have nothing whatever to do, can in no way, that I can perceive, militate against, or derogate from the right of the Local Legislatures to make laws in relation to all subjects or matters exclusively reserved to them. Nor can I discover that, in so substituting the Judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts the Parliament of the Dominion has in any way transcended its legislative powers. These courts are surely bound to execute all laws in force in the Dominion, whether they are enacted by the Parliament of the Dominion or by the Local Legislatures, respectively. They are not mere local courts for the administration of the local laws passed by the Local Legislatures of the Provinces in which they are organized. They are the courts which were the established courts of the respective Provinces before Confederation existed at Confederation and were continued with all laws in force \" as if the union had not been made,\" by the 129th sec. of the British North America Act, and subject as therein expressly provided, \"to be repealed abolished or altered by the Parliament of Ganada, or by the Legislatures of the respective Provinces, according to the authority of the Parliament, or of that Legislature under this Act.\" They are the Queen's Courts, bound to take cognizance of and execute all laws whether enacted by the Dominion Parliament or the Local Legislatures, provided always, such laws are within the scope of their respective legislative powers.\nIf it is ultra vires for the Dominion Parliament to give these courts jurisdiction over this matter, which is peculiarly subject to the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament, must not the same principle apply to all matters which are in like manner exclusively within the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament; and, if so, would it not follow, that in no such case could the Dominion Parliament invoke the powers of these courts to carry out their enactments in the manner they, having the legislative right to do so, may think it just and expedient to prescribe. If so, would it not leave the legislation of the Dominion a dead letter till Parliament should establish courts throughout the Dominion for the special administration of the laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada: a state of things, I will venture to assume, never contemplated by the framers of the British North America Act, and an idea to which, I humbly think, the Act gives no countenance; on the contrary, the very section authorizing the establishment by Parliament of such courts speaks only of them as \" additional courts for the better \" administration of the laws of Canada. \" It cannot I think be supposed for a moment that the Imperial Parliament contemplated that until an Appellate Court, or such additional courts, were established all or any of the laws of Canada enacted by the Parliament of Canada, in relation to matters exclusively confided to that Parliament, were to remain unadministered for want of any tribunals in the Dominion competent to take cognizance of them.\nWhether, then, this Act is to be treated as declaring the courts named Dominion Election Courts, or whether it is to be treated as merely conferring on particular courts already organized anew and. peculiar jurisdiction, is a matter, to my mind, of no great importance, as I think, while they have clearly the power of establishing a new Dominion Court, they have likewise the power, when legislating within their jurisdiction, to require the established courts of the respective Provinces, and the judges thereof, who are appointed by the Dominion, paid out of the treasury of the Dominion, and removable only by address of the House of Commons and Senate of the Parliament of the Dominion, to enforce their legislation.\nIf the Dominion Parliament cannot pass this Act, this startling anomaly would be produced, that, though with respect to the rights and privileges of Parliament the Dominion of Canada are invested with the same powers as at the passing of the Act pertained to the Parliament of Great Britain. and though exclusive jurisdiction over, and the exclusive right to provide for, the trial of controverted elections is specially conferred on the Dominion Parliament, and though the constitution of the Dominion is to be similar to that of Great Britain, there are, in connection with these privileges and these elections, matters with which there is no legislative power in the .country to deal l for it is very clear that, as there is no pretence for saying that the Local Legislatures have any legislative power or authority over the subject-matters dealt with by the Act, so nothing the Local Legislatures might say or do could affect the question, and, therefore, however desirable, it might be universally admitted, that just such a tribunal for settling these questions should be established in the very terms of this Act the Dominion would be in this extraordinary position, that no legislation m the Dominion could accomplish it, for the simple reason that, if legislated on, as has been done by the Dominion Parliament, the legislation would be ultra vires; any , legislation by the Local Legislatures would, if possible, be even more objectionable, they not having a shadow of right to interfere with the rights and privileges of Parliament, or the election of Members to serve therein, or to establish any tribunal whatever to deal with or affect either, as the whole and sole legislative power to intermeddle or deal with such rights and with elections and controverted elections is conferred on and vested in the Dominion Parliament alone.\nTo hold that no new jurisdiction, or mode of procedure, can be imposed on the Provincial Courts by the Dominion Parliament, in its legislation on subjects exclusively within its legislative power, is to neutralize, if not to destroy, that power and to paralyze the legislation of Parliament. The Statutes of Parliament from its first session to the last, show that such an idea has never been entertained by those who took the most active part in the establishment of Confederation, and who had most to do with framing the British North America Act the large majority of whom sat in the first Parliament. A reference to that legislation will also show what a serious effect and what unreasonable consequences would flow from its adoption.\nThere is scarcely an Act, relating to any of the great public interests of the country which have been legislated on since Confederation, that must not in part be held ultra vires if this doctrine is well founded for m almost all these Acts provisions are to be found, not only vesting jurisdiction in the Provincial Courts, but also regulating, in many instances and particulars, the procedure in such matters in those courts, as a reference to a number I shall cite will abundantly show.\nIn the first session of the Dominion Parliament in the Act respecting Customs, 81 Vic, cap. 6, by sec, 100, all penalties and forfeitures relating to the Customs or to Trade and Navigation, unless other provision be made for the recovery thereof, are to be sued for by -the Attorney-General, or in the name or names of some officer of Customs, or other person thereunto authorized by the Grovernor-in-Council, and if the prosecution be brought before any County Court or Circuit it shall be heard and determined in a summary manner upon information filed in such court. And by other sections, special provisions are made for the mode of procedure in reference to cases of this description, as also for the protection of the officers, entirely different from the procedure in ordinary civil cases.\nSo also by the Act respecting the Inland Revenue, 81 Vic, cap. 8, provisions are made for the protection of the officers of the Inland Revenue, whereby the proceeding\u2019s in the Provincial Courts are restrained and regulated. And by 31 Vic., c. 10, for regulating the Postal Service, the enactments of the Acts respecting Customs, more especially for the protection of officers, are extended and applied to officers employed in the Post Office.\nAnd in the Public Works Act, 31 Vic, cap. 12 sec 48 all costs in awards made by the arbitrators under that Act where the award is in favor of the claimant, shall be taxed by the proper officer of the Court of Queen's Bench, Supreme Court or Common Pleas in the Provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and, in Quebec, by a Judge of the Superior Court.\nSo by the 31st Vic., cap. 15, sec 7, of the Act to prevent unlawful training to the use of arms, provision is made for the protection of Justices and others acting under this Act, which regulates in a very special manner the procedure in all courts where such actions may be brought. So by the 31st Vic. cap. 17, an Act for the settlement of the affairs of the Bank of Upper Canada, authority was given to the Court of Chancery, or a Judge thereof, to make orders and directions with reference to the trust therein referred to.\nSo by the 31st Vic, cap. 23, an Act to define the privileges, &c, of the Senate and House of Commons, and to give necessary protection to persons employed in the publication of parliamentary papers, provision is made on certificate of Speaker of either House for the immediate stay of, and putting a final end to, all civil or criminal proceedings in any court in Canada.\nSo under the Trade Mark and Designs Act, 1868, in case any person not being the lawful proprietor of a design be registered as proprietor thereof, the rightful owner is authorized to institute an action in the Superior Court in Quebec, in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ontario and in the Supreme Courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and the course of procedure is pointed out and specially regulated,\nSo under 3l Vic., cap. 61, respecting fishing by foreign vessels, special provisions are made for the protection of officers by regulating the issuing of writs, and otherwise regulating the proceedings in informations and suits brought under the Act.\nSo with respect to the Act relating to aliens and naturalization, 31 Vic, cap. 66, duties are imposed on the Judges of any Court of Record in Canada and on the Provincial Courts therein named as to admitting and confirming aliens in all the rights and privileges of British birth, and directing the mode of procedure in such cases.\nSo by the Railway Act, 1868, 31 Vic, cap. 68, sec, 15, the duty of appointing arbitrators is imposed on a Judge of one of the Superior Courts in the Province in which the place giving rise to the disagreement is situated, So, also, by sub-section 13 as to ordering notices, and by sec. 15 as to appointing sworn surveyors; 19 as to taxing costs; 22, appointing, on death of arbitrator, I another; 24 and 25, vesting in Judge the summary power of determining the validity of any cause of disqualification urged against arbitrator; 27 and 28, power to Judge to issue warrant to Sheriff to put company in possession of land under award or agreement; and in many other matters in said Act quite distinct from the jurisdiction and procedure in ordinary civil cases.\n32 and 33 Vic., cap. 11, patents for inventions: Provision is made for actions for infringement and impeachment of a patent, and for power of courts and procedure and pleading in such cases.\nAnd notably, with respect to insolvency, by the first Insolvent Act 1869, and Act in amendment thereof of 1870, summary jurisdiction is given to judges and courts, and appeals to judges and from judges to courts, and Provincial Courts are clothed with powers and modes of procedure are given them, which the Local Legislatures could have no right to confer, as they have no right to legislate on the subject matter Of insolvency, And in Ontario the judges of the Superior Courts of Common Law and of the Court of Chancery, or any five of them, of whom the Chief Justice of Ontario, or the Chancellor, or the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas shall be one are required to make and settle such forms, rules and regulations as shall be followed in the proceedings in Chancery. And in Nova Scotia an entirely new jurisdiction is given in insolvency to the Probate Courts or judges of probate, which they never in any way before possessed.\nAnd as to banks and banking, 34 Vic, cap. 5., jurisdiction in a summary manner is given to the Superior Courts of Law and Equity to adjudicate as to the parties legally entitled to shares, and the mode of procedure is there pointed out.\nAnd as to the Public Lands of the Dominion, 35 Vic, cap. 23, a summary remedy is given to a judge of any court, haying competent jurisdiction in cases respecting real estate, to grant an order which shall have the force of a writ of Hab. Fac. Pos., upon proof to his satisfaction that land forfeited should properly revert to the Crown, to deliver up the same, &c, and the mode of procedure is provided by the Act.\n37 Vic, cap. 45, Inspection of Staple Articles, as to actions or suits against any person for anything done in pursuance of this Act limitations and restrictions are imposed and directions given as to procedure before and at trial and on giving judgment.\nI do not, of course, put forward this legislation as in itself in any way determining, or even as confirmatory of the right of the Dominion Parliament so to legislate, for it is too clear that if they do not possess the legislative power, neither the exercise nor the continued exercise of a power not belonging\" to them could confer it or make their legislation binding. But I put forward these Acts as illustrative of the powerlessness, or perhaps I should rather say helplessness, of the Dominion Parliament, if they have not the right to legislate without control in the most full and ample manner over all matters specially or generally confided to them by the Imperial Parliament, and over which all must admit they have sole control, without being met by so effectual an obstruction, in giving effect to such legislation, as by closing the Queen's Courts against the administration of laws so enacted by and under the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain, by virtue of which the Dominion and Provincial constitutions now exist and also as illustrative of the utter want in the Dominion if the Dominion Parliament does not possess it, of any legislative power to meet emergencies requiring legislative control in matters so unequivocally affecting the peace, good order and government of Canada, so clearly taken from the Provincial Assemblies and confided to the Parliament and Government of Canada.\nBut I have had no great difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that this Act substantially establishes as the Act of 1873 did as respects elections, a Dominion Court, though it utilizes for that purpose the Provincial Courts and their Judges. In considering the British North America Act, in the view just presented, as also the Dominion Act on the point to be now discussed, the following extract from the judgment of Turner, L. J., in Hawkins vs Gathercole ([17]) may not be inapplicable here. He says:\nBut, in construing Acts of Parliament, the words which are used are not alone to be regarded; regard must also be had to the intent and meaning of the legislature. The rule on this subject is well expressed in the case of Stradling vs. Morgan in Plowden's Reports, in which case it is said at page 204: \" The judges of the law in all times past have so far pursued the intent of the makers of statutes, that they have expounded Acts which were general in words to be but particular where the intent was particular.\" And, after referring to several cases, the report contains the following remarkable passage, at page 205: \" From which cases it appears that the sages of the law heretofore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in some appearance, and those statutes which comprehend all things in the letter, they have expounded to extend but to some things, and those which generally prohibit all people from doing such an act, they have interpreted to permit some people to do it, and those which include every person in the letter, they have adjudged to reach to some persons only, which expositions have always been founded upon the intent of the legislature, which they have collected, sometimes by considering the cause and necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another, and sometimes by foreign circumstances. So that they have ever been guided by the intent of the legislature which they have always taken according to the necessity of the mutter and. according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\nThe same doctrine is to be found in Eyston vs. Studd and the note appended to it, also in Plowden ([18]), and many other cases. The passages to which I have referred, I have selected as containing the best summary with which I am acquainted of the law upon this subject. In determining the question before us, we have, therefore, to consider, not merely the words of the Act of Parliament, but the intent of the Legislature, tobe collected from the cause and necessity of the Act being made, from a comparison of its several parts, and from foreign meaning and extraneous circumstances, so far as they can justly be considered to throw light upon the subject.\nIn seeking to discover the intention of the Dominion Parliament, if Parliament had no power to add to the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court, or in any way interfere with its procedure, one is struck at the outset with the strong, if not irresistible, inference that this raises that the intentions of Parliament must have been to establish an independent tribunal in the nature of a Dominion Court and not to add to the jurisdiction, or affect the procedure, of Provincial Courts, because, it must, I think, be assumed that Parliament intended to do what they have a right to do to legislate legally and effectively, rather than that they intended to do what they had no right to do, and which, if they did do, must necessarily be void and of no effect; and having established a Court by the Act of 1873 which it seems to be admitted is intra vires, is it reasonable to suppose that Parliament would repeal a valid enactment, and for the accomplishment of substantially the same object, substitute in its place a law beyond their powers to enact, and which, therefore, could be nothing but a dead letter on the Statute Book. But, as for the reasons I have stated I think even if a distinct and independent court is not created, the Act is not beyond the power of Parliament, I cannot invoke this inference, as it appears to me those holding the contrary opinion might and should do.\nBut, independent of all this, the Act seems to contain within itself everything necessary to constitute a court.\nThe jurisdiction is special and peculiar, distinct from, and independent of, any power or authority with which any of the courts, or the judges referred to in it, were previously clothed. The act conferring this jurisdiction provides all necessary materials for the full and complete exercise of such jurisdiction in a very special manner, wholly independent of, and distinct from, and at variance with the exercise of the ordinary jurisdiction and procedure of the courts.\nThe rights which are to be determined through the instrumentality of this new jurisdiction are political, rather than civil rights, within the usual meaning of that term or within the meaning of that term as used in the British North America Act, which, as I have said, applies, in my opinion, to mere limited civil rights, and thus we find them treated in the case of Th\u00e9 berge vs. Landry ([19]) which was an application to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Superior Court of Quebec under the Controverted Election Act, 1875, declaring an election void, which was refused.\nThe Lord Chancellor in that case speaks of the Quebec Controverted Election Acts thus:\nThese two Acts of Parliament, the Acts of 1872-75, are Acts peculiar in their character. They are not Acts constituting or providing for the decision of mere ordinary civil rights, they are Acts creating an entirely new and up to that time unknown, jurisdiction in a particular court of the colony, for the purpose of taking oat, with its own consent of the Legislative Assembly, and vesting in that court that very peculiar jurisdiction which, up to that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly,of deciding election petitions, and determining the status of those who claimed to be Members of the Legislative Assembly. A jurisdiction of that kind is extremely special, and one of the obvious incidents or consequences of such a jurisdiction must be that the jurisdiction, by whomsoever it is to be exercised, should be exercised in a way that should as soon as possible become conclusiv\u00e8 and enable the constitution of the Legislative Assembly to be distinctly and speedily known.\nNow, the subject matter, as has been said, of the legislation is extremely peculiar. It concerns the rights and the privileges of the electors, and of the Legislative Assembly, to which they elect Members. Those rights and privileges have always, in every colony, following the example of the Mother Country, been jealously maintained and guarded by the Legislative Assembly; above all, they have been looked upon as rights and privileges which pertain to the Legislative Assembly in complete independence of the Crown, so far as they properly exist, and it would be a result somewhat surprising and hardly in consonance with the general scheme of the legislation, if, with regard to rights and privileges of this kind, it were to be found that in the last resort the determination of them no longer belonged to the Legislative Assembly, no longer belonged to the Superior Court, which the Legislative Assembly had put in its place, but belonged to the Crown in Council with the advice of the advisers of the Crown at home to be determined without reference either to the judgment of the Legislative Assembly, or of that court which the Legislative Assembly had substituted in its place.\nThe object of the Act of 1873 and that of 1874 was the same, the recitals in both are precisely alike, and the provisions are in many respects substantially the same. That object was to establish and substitute entirely new tribunals for the trial of Election Petitions in lieu of the committees theretofore dealing with such matters, and both Acts alike contained all provisions necessary, not only to give such new tribunals full jurisdiction, but also all necessary and suitable provisions to enable them, and the judges thereof, effectually to exercise such jurisdiction, not only with reference to the principles but also to the rules and practice by which they should be governed and act in dealing with election petitions. The object of the two Acts being then precisely the same, the accomplishment of the desired result being by instrumentalities substantially much the same if as I understand it is, generally conceded by those that hold the Act of 1874 ultra vires, that the Act of 1873 established an independent Do N minion Court, and was within the power of the Dominion Parliament, I am somewhat at a loss to understand how it can be said that the tribunals established by the Act of 1874 are not equally within the power of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe judges cannot sit in controverted election matters under the general jurisdiction of their respective courts, for those courts have no jurisdiction in such cases, and therefore, in discharging the duties imposed by this Act they do not and cannot do so as judges of the respective courts to which they belong, but they act as Election Judges appointed by and under the Act, outside of and distinct from the jurisdiction they exercise in their respective Provincial Courts, which is left untouched by this Act.\nWithout relying too much on the Statute of 1873, which, though a repealed statute, being in pari material with that of 1874 might properly be referred to for the purpose of construing the latter ([20]), I think a careful and critical examination of the Act of 1874 will exhibit an evident intention that, as the first did, so does the last establish an independent Dominion Election Court.\nThis is more especially noticeable with reference to the enactments under the headings \"interpretation \"clauses,\" \" proc\u00e9dure,\" \"jurisdiction and rules of court,\" \" reception and jurisdiction of the judge \" witnesses,\" and the provision as to who may practice as agent or attorney or as counsel in such courts in the case of such petitions, and all matters relating thereto before the court or judge. I will only notice more particularly some of them, 1st. The power given to make rules. It provides that the judges of the several courts in each Province respectively, or a majority, which, in Ontario would include the judges of the Court of Error and Appeal, Queen's Bench, Common Pleas and Court of Chancery, shall make such rules, and until such rules are made \" the principles, practice and rules on which \" petitions touching the election of Members of the \" House of Commons in England are, at the passing \" of this Act, dealt with, shall be observed, &c.\" 2nd. As to the reception, expenses and jurisdiction of the judge. The judge is to be received not as a judge of the Superior Court in that character but as a judge of the Election Court, in like manner as if he were about to hold a sitting at nisi pries, or a sitting of the Provincial Court of which he is a member, showing that the Legislature did not contemplate that he was then actually about to sit as a member of the Provincial Court, but as being about to try an election petitions, and when about to do this he is to be treated as if he were about to hold a sitting of the Provincial Court of which he is a member, and when his powers in such a trial, and in other proceedings under this Act, are defined, he is not treated simply as a judge of one of the Superior Courts upon whom, as such, further jurisdiction is conferred, but similar powers, as such judge, are given him in the court held by him and that court so held by him is declared to be a Court of Record indicating I think very clearly, that the court was treated by the Legislature as distinct from a Provincial Court, and required this statutory declaration to make it a Court of Record, and that the judge was not to be considered as then acting as a judge of a Provincial Court nor the trial as a trial in such a court. The words of the clause are these ([21]):\nOn the trial of an Election Petition, and in other proceedings under this Act, the judge shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same powers, jurisdiction and authority as a judge of one of the Superior Courts of Law or Equity for the Province in which such election was held, sitting in term, or presiding at the trial of an ordinary civil suit and the Court held by him for such trial shall be a Court of Record.\nSo in like manner, are the witnesses treated as being subpoenaed, sworn and treated, not as being actually within the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts, but section 49 declares that they\nShall be subpoenaed and sworn in the same manner, as nearly as circumstances will admit as in cases within the jurisdiction of the Superior Courts of Law or Equity in the same Province; and shall be subject to the same penalties for perjury.\nSo, again, in the provision made for regulating the persons entitled to practice as attorneys or barristers before the tribunal thus established such tribunal is very clearly distinguished from the Provincial Courts The clause is this ([22]);\nAny person who, according to the law of the Province in which the petition is to be tried, is entitled to practice as an attorney at law or Solicitor, before the Superior Courts of such Province, and who is not a Member of the House of Commons, may practice as attorney or agent, and any person, who, according to such law, is entitled to practice as a barrister at law, or advocate, before such Courts, and who is not a member of the House of Commons, may practice as Counsel, in the case of such petition, and all matters relating thereto, before the Court or Judge in such Province.\nReading these special provisions in connection with the Act of 1873 and what has been said of the Act generally, I think it is not arriving at a forced or unnatural conclusion to say that that Parliament intended to establish Dominion Tribunals exceptional in their jurisdiction, perfect in their procedure, and with all materials for exercising such jurisdiction, and having nothing in common with the Provincial Courts; that these judges and courts were merely utilized outside their respective jurisdictions for giving full effect to these statutory tribunals to deal with this purely Dominion matter.\nAn objection has been suggested by a learned judge, for whose opinion I have the very highest respect and which has been treated as of much force by another learned judge of a different Province, and on that account I will notice it. it is said that if this is a court distinct from the courts of which the judges are primarily members, the judges have never been appointed thereto by the Crown, nor sworn as judges thereof, and therefore they are not judges of this new tribunal, if, as such, it exists. But, in my humble opinion, there is no force in this objection. The judges require no new appointment from the Crown, they are Statutory Judges in Controverted Election matters by virtue of an express enactment by competent legislative authority. The statutes make the judges for the time being of the Provincial Courts judges of these peculiar and special courts. The Crown has assented to that statute, therefore they are judges by virtue of the law of the Dominion and with the Royal sanction and approval. As to their not being sworn, the statute has not provided they should be sworn. If, being sworn judges already, the Legislature was willing to entrust them with the power conferred by this Act, without requiring them to be sworn anew, how does this invalidate the Act, and how can the judges refuse to discharge the duties thus by law imposed on them, because, it may be, the Parliament might, or ought to have gone further and required the judges to be specially sworn faithfully to discharge these special duties. Under the law of 1873, the judges in all the Provinces acted in what, it is admitted, were new Dominion Courts, without being specially appointed or sworn, the statute not requiring either, and I have yet to learn that their proceedings on that account ever have been or ever could be questioned.\nAs, then, I can see no reasons why the Dominion Parliament should not delegate to the Judges of the several Provinces, individually, or collectively, or both, whom they appoint and pay, and can by address remove, power to determine controverted elections, the doing of which, not being inconsistent, or in any way in conflict with their duties as judges of their respective courts, but, on the contrary, as shown by the present legislation of all the Provinces, in reference to controverted elections in the Local Legislatures, in so acting they are most suitable and proper tribunals, and as the Imperial Parliament has left it to the Parliament of Canad\u00e1 to provide for the trial of controverted elections and proceedings incident thereto, and they have discharged this duty by the Statute of 1874, utilizing existing judicial officers and established courts, by engrafting on, or establishing independent of those courts throughout their respective Provinces tribunals eminently qualified to discharge the important duties assigned to them, they have not, in so doing, in my opinion in any particular invaded the rights of the Local Legislatures, or brought the new jurisdiction, or the procedure under it, in any way in conflict with the jurisdiction or procedure of any of the courts of the Provinces; and therefore the Dominion Parliament in enacting the Act of 1874, have not, in my opinion, exceeded the express power conferred on them to provide for the trial of controverted elections and proceeding's incident thereto; and, therefore, I think this appeal must Be dismissed with costs and the case remitted to the court below, to be proceeded with according to the due course, of law.\nFOURNIER, J:\nL'unique question soumise par le present appel est de savoir, si le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait le pouvoir de passer l'acte des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9s de 1874.\nCette question dont on ne peut exag\u00e9rer l'importance a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e9s savamment discut\u00e9e et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e en sens inverse par les diff\u00e9rentes cours provinciales devant lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e.\nLes raisons donn\u00e9es de part et d'autre sont expos\u00e9es avec les plus grands d\u00e9veloppements, et sont certainement dignes de toute l'attention possible; mais apr\u00e8s la revue si complete qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par l'honorable juge en chef il n'y aurait aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 les r\u00e9sumer ici de nouveau. Pour cette raison je me contenterai de donner succinctement les principaux motifs qui m'ont fait adopter la m\u00eame conclusion que mes honorables coll\u00e8gues.\nC'est en 1873, que le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral exer\u00e7ant pour la premi\u00e8re fois, le pouvoir qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la section m\u00e9me de l'acte de l'Am\u00e9riqne Britannique du Nord, de l\u00e9gislater sur le sujet des elections contest\u00e9es a adop\u00e9\u00e9 et consacr\u00e9 par le statut 36 Vict., ch. 28, le principe de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer an pouvoir judiciaire la decision des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es qui jusqu'alors avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par les chambres ou leurs comit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exclusion des tribunaux ordinaires. La loi dont la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 est attaqu\u00e9e en cette cause a r\u00e9voquC le premier statut, en conservant toutefois le principe de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au pouvoir judiciaire ainsi qu'un grand nombre de ses autres dispositions\nPlusieurs des honorables juges appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cette question sont entr\u00e9s dans un examen critique tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des principales dispositions de ces deux lois, afin de prouver que la premi\u00e8re (celle de 1873) \u00e9tait constitutionnelle en cr\u00e9ant une cour sp\u00e9ciale d'\u00e9lection, en vertu de l'article 10 de l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord tandis que la seconde est inconstitutionnelle en assumant le pouvoir d'\u00e9tendre la juridiction de certaines cours provinciales \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es,\u2014sujet qui n\u00e9tait pas auparavant de leur competence.\nJe ne crois pas devoir entrer dans l'examen des raiSons invoqu\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir cette divergence; non plus que dans l'examen de cette autre question de savoir, si l'acte de 1874 ne constitue pas, comme celui de 1873, une cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et que partant la loi, se trouvant dans les limites du pouvoir accod\u00e9\u00e9 au Parlement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral par l'article 101 de cr\u00e9er des tribunaux additionnels cette loi doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre d\u00e9clare constitutionnelle.\nIl me suffira de dire que, si la proposition que le. gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut imposer de nouveaux devoirs aux cours et aux juges existant lors de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration est correcte, ces deux actes sont expos\u00e9s aux m\u00eames objections, car dans l'un et l'autre les tribunaux provinciaux et le personnel qui les compose sont soumis \u00e0 l'accomplissement de nouveaux devoirs. Il importe pen \"Dour la d\u00e9cision de la veritable contestation soulev\u00e9e dans ce d\u00e9bat, que les nouveaux devoirs judiciaires soient imposes aux juges et aux cours dans un cas, comme par l'acte de 1873, sous la denomination de cour d'\u00e9lection; ou qu'ils le soient dans l'autre, comme par l'acte de 1874, aux cours provinciales et aux juges sous les d\u00e9nominations par lesquelles ils sont design\u00e9s dans les lois provinciales qui leur ont donn\u00e9 l'existence. Au fond la question est toujours la m\u00eame, car que l'on prenne les juges collectivement comme cour, ou en leur qualit\u00e9 individuelle de membres de la cour, il faut toujours en venir \u00e0 la question de savoir quel pouvoir a le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de leur imposer de nouveaux devoirs.\nAussi la question se r\u00e9duit-elle pour moi, simplement \u00e0 savoir si le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a le pouvoir qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 si emphatiquement et si \u00e9nergiquement ni\u00e9 par certains honorables juges dont je respecte infiniment l'opinion, d'imposer de nouveaux devoirs aux juges et aux tribunaux provinciaux et m\u00eame d'\u00e9tendre leur juridiction s'il en est besoin. Je regrette d'avoir \u00e0 dire que j'entretiens sur ce sujet une opinion diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la leur.\nSi je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 faire cette d\u00e9claration, c'est qu'un nombre en cor\u00e9 plus consid\u00e9rable d'honorables juges out adopt\u00e9 cette mani\u00e8re de voir qui, du reste, me semble d'accord avec l'esprit et la lettre de Ia constitution\nSi la proposition que j\u2019\u00e9mets plus haut n\u2019\u00e9tait pas correcte, il s'ensuivrait n\u00e9cessairement que les auteurs de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration auraient omis de cr\u00e9er, pour l'ex\u00e9cutons des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, un pouvoir judiciaire coexistant avec le nouvel ordre de choses.\nCependant, comme nous l'indique le pr\u00e9ambule de l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, leur premier devoir \u00e9tait de doter l'union f\u00e9d\u00e9rale des provinces d'une constitution reposant sur les m\u00e9mes principes que celle du Royaume-Uni. Un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la constitution britannique, comme de tout gouvernement r\u00e9gulier, c'est la cr\u00e9ation d'un pouvoir judiciaire qui forme, avec les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatif et ex\u00e9cutif, les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments indispensables de tout gouvernement. Ontils commis une faute d'une aussi haute gravit\u00e9, pouvant avoir de si funestes consequences sur leur \u0153uvre, que celle de n'avoir pas pens\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'un pouvoir judiciaire? D'apr\u00e8s certaines opinions, cette \u00e9trange omission aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et il y aurait eu ainsi entre le ler juillet 1867 \u00e9poque a laquelle l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord est entr\u00e9 en force, et la r\u00e9union du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en novembre 1861 un interr\u00e8gne de quatre mois pendant lequel ii ne se serait pas trouv\u00e9 un soul tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour faire ex\u00e9cuter les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\nCependant des l'instant que Ia nouvelle constitution est entr\u00e9e en force, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral devenait propri\u00e9taire de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s publiques \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la c\u00e9dule 8 do l'acte do l\u2019Amerique Britannique du Nordi en memo temps qu'il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 par la 122e section de l'ex\u00e9cution des lois de douanes, d'accise et par la 41e sec. des lois \u00e9lectorales qui demeuraient en force.\nIl se serait donc, dans ce cas, trouv\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 soit de prot\u00e9ger ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, soit de collecter les revenus, l'acc\u00e8s aux tribunaux provinciaux lui \u00e9tant interdit.\nMais on r\u00e9pond \u00e0 cet argument en all\u00e9guant qu'une aussi grande faute n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, que bien an contraire, par l'article 101, le gouvernement du Canada est investi du pouvoir do cr\u00e9er une cour d'appel et des tribunaux additionnels pour la meilleure administration de ses lois, quo des pouvoirs suffisants sous ce rapport lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment parce que le pouvoir exclusif d'organiser des tribunaux pour les provinces \u00e9tait r\u00e9serve aux l\u00e9gislatures,\u2014qu'ainsi les deux gouvernements out chacun leurs attributions particuli\u00e8res et exclusives pour Ia creation do tribunaux. L'article 101 no justifie pas cette conclusion, ii n'\u00e9tablit pas dans le present un pouvoir judiciaire\u2014il no donne quo la facult\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir, suivant los besoins et los circonstances, une cour d'appel et des tribunaux additionnels pour la meilleure administration do ses lois. D'apr\u00e8s los termes do cette section ii en existait donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 pour l'ex\u00e9cution des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, puisque cette facult\u00e9 n'est donn\u00e9e quo pour \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e lorsque l'occasion le. requerra, comme dit l'article c'est-\u00e0-dire dans le cas ou les tribunaux existant deviendraient, pour une raison ou pour une autre, incapables de faire ex\u00e9cuter les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Si cette section n'admettait pas l'existence d'un pouvoir judiciaire f\u00e9d\u00e9ral elle eut \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement r\u00e9dig\u00e9e e il \u00e9tait aussi facile de d\u00e9crotter de suite l'existence dune cour d'appel ou de tout autre tribunal, que d'en permettre la creation dans l'avenir. Si la chose n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite c'est sans doute parceque on reconnaissait que le pouvoir judiciaire dont on conservait l'existence par la section 129 pourrait encore suffire aux besoins du pays pour longtemps, et on laissait prudemment \u00e0 l'avenir le soin d'exercer le pouvoir de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux tribunaux suivant les circonstances. Ce n'est certainement pas sur la section 101, qui n'accorde qu'un pouvoir facultatif, qu'on peut s'appuyer pour prouver que les auteurs de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration ont cr\u00e9e un pouvoir judicaire qui pouvait r\u00e9pondre aux besoins imm\u00e9diats de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. C'est par d'autres sections que l'organisation judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement \u00e9tablie et compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 entrer en existence en m\u00eame temps que l'acte constitutionnel lui-m\u00eame.\nCette organisation r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de diverses dispositions de l'acte de l'A. B. N. auxquelles je ferai allusion apr\u00e8s avoir mentionn\u00e9 celles sur lesquelles on s'appuie le plus fortement pour en contester l'existence.\nLes adversaires de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de la loi en question fondent leurs principaux arguments sur les sous-ss. 13 et 14 de la s. 92 attribuant exclusivement aux legislatures la juridiction sur La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils dans la province, et l'administration de la justice dans la province y compris Ta cr\u00e9ation, le main- tien et l'organisation de tribunaux de justice pour Ta province, ayant juridiction civile et criminelle, y compris la proc\u00e9dure\u2019 en mati\u00e8res civiles dans ces tribunaux, J'admets sans h\u00e9sitation le contr\u00f4le exelusif des l\u00e9gislatures sur ces deux categories de sujets. A elles seules appartient sans doute le droit de r\u00e9gler les droits civils L dans la province, comme l'organisation de tribunaux de justice pour la province; et le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral commettrait certainement un exc\u00e8s de pouvoir s'il l\u00e9gislatait sur ces mati\u00e8res pour la province. Mais s'en suit-il n\u00e9cessairement que ce dernier n'a aucune juridiction sur les droits civils ne concernant que la Pusssance en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, de m\u00eame que sur l'organisation et le maintien des tribunaux en autant que la Puissance y est int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Y atil pour celle-ci dans les deux paragraphes une exclusion absolue de toute juridiction? Je ne le pense pas. Il me semble, au contraire, que les termes m\u00eames s'opposent \u00e0 une interpretation aussi restrictive. En effet, les mots pour la province ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 Ta suite des pouvoirs donn\u00e9s sur les droits civils et l'organisation des tribunaux, restreignent bien pour les l\u00e9gislatures, l'exercice de ces pouvoirs aux limites de la province, mais ne comportent pas l'exclusion de l'exercice par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d'une juridiction semblable sur les diverses categories de droits civils qui lui sont attribu\u00e9s. Rien n'est plus clair ni plus certain que les l\u00e9gislatures n'ont pas une juridiction complete sur les droits civils. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, les termes droits civils, comprenant par opposition an droit criminel tous les droits dont un sujet peut jouir, il s'en suivrait que les provinces auraient une juridiction illimit\u00e9e sur tout ce qui ne d\u00e9pendrait pas du droit criminel. La distinction que l'on a voulu faire entre les droits civils et les droits politiques n'est fond\u00e9e sur aucune autorit\u00e9 positive. Les termes droits politiques n'ont pas dans le droit anglais une signification consacr\u00e9e par la loi ou par les d\u00e9cisions judiciaires. Pour exprimer la m\u00eame id\u00e9e Blackstone emploie indiff\u00e9remment les mots libert\u00e9 civile ou libert\u00e9 politique. Sa sub division des droits en quatre cat\u00e9gories na pas d'autre raison que celle d'en faciliter l'exposition, comme ii le dit:\" in order to \"consider them with any tolerable ease and perspicuity, i it will be necessary to distribute them methodically \"unnder proper heads.\" La d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Landry vs. Th\u00e9berge ([23]) n'a pas \u00e9tabli non plus, comme on le pr\u00e9tend, une distinction entre les droits civils et les droits politiques Lord Cairns dit en parlant des deux lois de Qu\u00e9bec sur les \u00e9lections contest\u00e9es, qu'elles n'avaient pas pour objet de pourvoir \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de droits civils ordinaires (of T\u00edtere ordinary civil rights); et ii qualifie aussi cette l\u00e9gislation comme extr\u00eamement particuli\u00e8re, (extremely peculiar), mais il ne dit pas qu'elle a pour objet de statuer sur les droits politiques comme sujet distinct des droits civils. Il ne fait m\u00eame pas usage des mots droits politiques dans son jugement. Le langage qu'il tient \u00e0 ce sujet est conforme \u00e0 ce que dit Blackstone au sujet de sa division des rights. Pour achever de d\u00e9montrer que les termes droits civils, dans le paragraphe 13, ne peuvent avoir la signification \u00e9tendue qu'on veut leur donner, ii suffit de rappeler que la banqueroute et la faillite, les brevets d'invention et de d\u00e9couverte, los droits d'auteurs, le mariage et le divorce et beaucoup d'autres sujets qui, sans nul doute, sont compris dans les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9riques de droits civils, sont cependant exclusivement du ressort du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nIl serait donc plus correct de dire, que le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif au sujet des droits civils a \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9 entre le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les l\u00e9gislatures, que de conclure qu'il est en entier du domaine exclusif de ces derni\u00e8res. Je ne puis pour ces raisons voir dans le paragraphe 13 d'obstacles \u00e0 l'exercice de la juridiction assume par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Le paragraphe 14 concernant l'organisation des tribunaux et la proc\u00e9dure n'a pas non plus l'effet d'enlever au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral toute juridiction sur les tribunaux provinciaux.\nL'on a compar\u00e9 la position des provinces dans la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Canadienne \u00e0 celle des Etats dans l'Union Am\u00e9ricaine, pour en conclure que les provinces ont une ind\u00e9pendance aussi complete que celle des Etats, et que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut exercer aucun pouvoir quelconque sur les tribunaux provinciaux, pas plus que ne pourrait le faire le Congr\u00e8s aux Etats-Unis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tribunaux d'Etats. S'il y a so as beaucoup de rapports analogie entre les deux constitutions, ii n'y en a certainement aucune dans le mode adop\u00e9\u00e9 pour la distribution du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif. Dans la constitution am\u00e9ricaine, on a adopt\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard un principe tout \u00e0 fait oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi dans l'acte de l'A. B. N.\nLes Etats en consentant \u00e0 entrer clans l'Union Am\u00e9ricaine out conserv\u00e9 leur position d'Etats souverains et ind\u00e9pendants, sous la deduction seulement des pouvoirs qu'ils out sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s an Congres. On a fait ici pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'inverse. Le parlement imperial, qui a organis\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat de chose actuel, a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ne donner aux provinces que des attributions d\u00e9finies et limit\u00e9es, laissant au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral moins les attributions r\u00e9serv\u00e9es, l'exercice de tous les pouvoirs de la souverainet\u00e9 compatibles avec l'\u00e9tat colonial. Ceci est evident d'apr\u00e9s la sec. 91.\nEn effet, \u00e0 part du pouvoir exclusif sur les sujets mentionnes dans les 29 paragraphes de l'article 91 le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est en outre rev\u00eatu d'une autorit\u00e9 souveraine sur tout ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement abandonn\u00e9 aux l\u00e9gislatures. Le commencement de l'article s'exprime ainsi sur ce sujet: \"Il sera loisible \u00e0 \" la Reine de l'avis et du consentement du S\u00e9nat et de la Chambre des Communes, de faire des lois pour la paix, l'ordre et le bon gouvernement du Canada, relativement \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res ne tombant pas dans les c cat\u00e9gories de sujets par le present acte exclusivement a assign\u00e9s aux legislatures des provinces; mais pour plus de garantie, sans toutefois restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 d des termes ci-haut employ\u00e9s dans cette section, ii est par le pr\u00e9sent d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que (nonobstant toute disposition contraire \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans le present acte) l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative exclusive du parlement du Canada s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 toutes les mati\u00e8res tombant dans les cat\u00e9gories do s sujets ci-dessous \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s. (Suivent les 29 paragraphes \u00e9non\u00e7ant ces divers sujets.)\nIl est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e9s ce texte que les attributions du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sont de deux sortes, les unes d\u00e9finies et \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans les 29 paragraphes, les autres ind\u00e9finies et consistant dans le pouvoir de faire des lois pour la paix, l'ordre et le bon gouvernement du Canada et n'ayant pas d'autres limites ou restrictions quo celles contenues dans les 16 paragraphes de l'article 92.\nComme ii n'\u00e9tait gu\u00e8re possible de faire une \u00e9num\u00e9ration compl\u00e8te de tous les pouvoirs et, sans doute, pour parer \u00e0 do graves inconv\u00e9nients, on s'est servi dans la r\u00e9daction de notre constitution, comme dans celle des Etats-Unis, d'un langage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral contenant en principe los pouvoirs conforts, laissant \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation future la t\u00e2che d'en compl\u00e9ter les d\u00e9tails. Pour l'interpr\u00e9tation de cet article on pout faire application des observations suivantes ([24]):\nIn the opinion which was delivered; the Court observed that the constitution unavoidably dealt in general language, and did not enter into a minute specification of powers, or declare the means by which those powers were to be carried into execution This would have been a perilous and difficult, if not an impracticable task: and the constitution left it to Congress, from time to time to adopt its own means to effectuate legitimate objects, and to mould and model the exercise of its powers, as its own wisdom and the public interest would require.\nMais le langage de l'article 91, Si g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu'il soit, est amplement suffisant pour conf\u00e9rer le pouvoir qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'on ne prouve qu'en cela ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis une infraction aux attributions sp\u00e9ciales des provinces.\nMais, bien au contraire, ii est admis de toute part que le sujet qui fait la mati\u00e8re de la loi attaqu\u00e9e n'est pas de Ia comp\u00e9tence des l\u00e9gislatures. D'apr\u00e8s la nature du sujet, comme d'apr\u00e8s la disposition contenue dans la sec. 41, toute juridiction est interdite aux l\u00e9gislatures concernant les contestations d\u00e9lections federales. Ainsi l'argument base sur le fait que les l\u00e9gislatures ont le pouvoir exclusif de r\u00e9gler la proc\u00e9dure ne peut avoir aucune valeur en face de la sec. 41 qui conf\u00e8re socialement au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral le droit non-seulement de statuer sur les contestations d\u00e9lections, mais encore celui d'en r\u00e9gler les proc\u00e9dures, et les proc\u00e9dures y incidents dit cet article. Aucune legislature ne pouvant \u00e9mettre la pretention de r\u00e9gler la procedure \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il n'y a donc pas eu dans ce cas usurpation de pouvoirs par la lot en question. Ce point me semble si clairement \u00e9tabli par le texte de la section quo je ne le crois pas susceptible d'\u00eatre mis en doute.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la sec. 91, suffisante suivant moi, pour justifier la passation de la loi attaqu\u00e9e, ii y a encore la sec. 129 qui donne en termes formels au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral les pouvoirs les plus \u00e9tendss sur les tribunaux en existence, savoir, ceux de les r\u00e9voquer, abolir ou modifier.\nSec. 129. Sauf toute disposition contraire prescrite par le pr\u00e9sent acte, toutes les lois en forc\u00e9 en Canada, dans la Nouvelle-Ecosse ou le Nouveau-Brunswick, lors de l'union, tous les tribunaux de juridiction civile et criminelle, toutes les commissions, pouvoirs et autorit\u00e9s ayant force l\u00e9gale, et tous les officiers judiciaires, administratifs et minist\u00e9riels en existence dans les provinces \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque do l'union continueront d'exister dans les provinces d'Ontario, de Qu\u00e9bec, do la Nouvelle-Ecosse et du Nouveau-Brunswick respectivement, comme si l'union n'avait pas eu lieu; mais ils pourront, n\u00e9aumouns, (sauf les cas pr\u00e9vus par des actes du parlement do la Grande-Bretagne ou du parlement du Royaume-Uni de la Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande, \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s, abolis ou modifies par le parlement du Canada, ou par la l\u00e9gislature do la province respective, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du parlement ou do cette l\u00e9gislature, en vertu du pr\u00e9sent acte.\nPouvait-on employer un langage plus fort et plus complet pour donner juridiction sur ces tribunaux? Je ne le pense pas. L'effet de cette section, \u00e0 laquelle ils doivent leur existence actuelle, est \u00e9videmment de les soumettre au pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif du gouvernement-f\u00e9d\u00e9ral tout aussi bien, ii est vrai, qu'\u00e0 celui du gout vernement local, et de les rendre de fait, communs \u00e0 ces deux gouvernements pour l'administration des lois par eux adopt\u00e9es dans les limites de leurs pouvoirs respectifs.\nPuisqu'ils sont sujets \u00e0 la condition de pouvoir \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s, abolis ou modifi\u00e9s par l'un ou l'autre de ces gouvernements, ces tribunaux ne sont donc pas, comme on l'a affirm\u00e9 si positivement, assujettis uniquement \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 des l\u00e9gislatures locales. Les termes de cette section ne permettent pas de doute sur le pouvoir du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d'imposer de nouveaux devoirs aux juges et aux tribunaux, puisqu\u2019il a le pouvoir de les r\u00e9voquer, abolir, ou modifier, c conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 du parlement en vertu du present acte.\" C'est sans doute \u00e0 cause du pouvoir ainsi r\u00e9serve qu'on a attribu\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par les sections 96 et 106 la nomination des juges et le paiement de leur salaire, s'ils eussent d\u00fb \u00eatre au service exclusif des gouvernements locaux on aurait laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux-ci le choix et le paiement du salaire d'officiers auxquels le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne pouvait imposer aucun devoir.\nAinsi chaque fois que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral passe une Ioi sur un sujet qui est de sa comp\u00e9tence, imposant aux juges on aux cours de nouveaux devoirs, il exerce le pouvoir qu'il a par cette section de modifier les tribunaux et cette loi doit recevoir son ex\u00e9cution tout aussi bien que celles des gouvernements locaux, dont les pouvoirs sur les tribunaux, en vertu de cette section, ne diff\u00e8rent point de ceux du parlement, \u00e0 l'exception seulement que chacun d'eux ne peut les exercer que dans les limites de ses attributions sp\u00e9ciales. Ils sont enfin les tribunaux de Sa Majest\u00e9 charg\u00e9s de faire ex\u00e9cuter toutes les lois auxquelles elle a donn\u00e9 sa sanction en vertu de la nouvelle constitution.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans la loi en question comme l'une de celles auxquelles la juridiction contest\u00e9e est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e, \u00e9tant en existence lors de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration est en cons\u00e9quence devenue comme toutes les autres sujette \u00e0 subir les modifications que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pourrait juger convenable de lui imposer. En serait-il de m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une cour cr\u00e9\u00e9e depuis? C'est une autre question et comme elle ne pet pas \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e dans cette cause, je ne crois pas devoir m'en occuper.\nPartant du point de vue que j'ai adopt\u00e9, il ne m'a pas sembl\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire non plus de m'occuper de la question, de savoir si, en outre des dispositions de l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, les cours de premi\u00e8re instance n'ont pas comme attribution inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 leur constitution, une juridiction suffisante pour d\u00e9cider des contestations d'\u00e9lections dans be cas o\u00f9 le parlement, au lieu d'adopter la loi actuelle, eut simplement renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exercice de sa juridiction exclusive sur ce sujet. J'ai limit\u00e9 mes observations \u00e0 la seule question de savoir s'il n'a pas de fait be pouvoir de conf\u00e9rer cette juridiction aux cours provinciales. Trouvant dans les dispositions de l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, cit\u00e9es plus haut, une complete justification du pouvoir exerc\u00e9, je n'ai pas cru devoir aller plus loin.\nDe ce qui proc\u00e8de, je conclus: 10. que les paragraphes 13 et 14 de la section 92 n'ont pas l'effet d'enlever au parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral la juridiction qu'il a exerc\u00e9e en adoptant la loi en question; 20. que les pouvoirs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la section 91 et ceux de la section 41 sont suffisants pour autoriser cette l\u00e9gislation; 30. que la section 129 lui donne le droit de faire ex\u00e9cuter par les cours provinciales la loi dont il s'agit, aussi bien que toutes les autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales adopt\u00e9es dans les limites de ses attributions.\n[TRANSLATED.]\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nThe sole question submitted by the present appeal is, whether the Federal Parliament had the power to pass the Controverted Elections Act of 1874.\nThis question, the importance of which it is impossible to exaggerate, has been very learnedly discussed, and decided in different ways by the several Provincial Courts before whom it has been raised.\nThe reasons given on both sides are set out with the greatest fulness, and are certainly worthy of every possible consideration; but, after the thorough review of them by the Chief Justice, there would be no advantage in giving another summary of them here. For this reason I shall content myself with giving briefly the principal reasons which have made me adopt the same conclusion as that of my honorable colleagues.\nIt was in 1873 that the Federal Parliament, exercising, for the first time the power conferred on it by the 41st section of the British North America Act to legislate on the subject of contested elections, adopted and established by Statute 36 Vic,, c. 28, the principle of referring to the judicial power the decision of contested elections, which, until then had been decided by the Houses of Parliament, or their committees, to the exclusion of the ordinary tribunals. The law, the legality of -, which is attacked in this case although it has revoked the first statute, retains the principle of reference to the judicial power, as well as a large number of its other provisions.\nSeveral of the honorable judges called on to decide this question have entered into a very detailed critical examination of the principal provisions of these two laws, in order to prove that the first (that of 1873) was constitutional in creating a special Election Court, in virtue of Article 101 of the British North America Act while the second is unconstitutional in assuming the power to extend the jurisdiction of certain Provincial Courts to the decision of contested elections a subject matter with which they were not before competent to deal.\nI do not think it necessary to enter into an examination of the reasons brought forward to establish this distinction; nor into an examination of this other question, namely, whether the Act of 1874 did not constitute, as did that of 1873, a Federal Court, and, in consequence thereof, the law being ultra vires of the power given to the Federal Parliament by sec. 101 of creating additional tribunals should be declared constitutional.\nIt is sufficient for me to say that, if the proposition that the Federal Government cannot impose new duties on the courts and judges existing at the time of Confederation is correct these two Acts are open to the same objections, for in both, the provincial tribunals and the personnel which compose them, have the performance of new duties devolved on them. It matters little for the decision of the real issue raised in this discussion, whether the new judicial duties have been imposed on judges and on courts in one case, as has been done by the Act of 1873 under the denomination of an Election Court, or whether, in the other case, such duties have been imposed, as has been done by the Act of 1874, on provincial courts and on judges under the names by which they are designated in the provincial laws which have given them existence. The question, nevertheless, remains the same, for whether the judges are taken collectively as a court, or in their quality of individual members of the court it always comes back to the question as to whether the Federal Parliament had the power to impose upon them new duties.\nThus, the question seems to me to be reduced simply to one whether the Federal Parliament has the power, which has been so emphatically and energetically denied to it by some honorable judges, whose opining I greatly respect, to impose new duties on provincial Judges and tribunals, and even to extend their jurisdiction, if necessary. I regret to be obliged to say that on this subject I entertain an opining diametrically opposed to theirs.\nIf I do not hesitate to make this declaration it is because a still larger number of honorable judges have adopted this view which besides seems to me in accord with the spirit and letter of the constitution.\nIf the proposition which I have above laid down be not correct, it necessarily follows that the authors of Confederation have omitted to create for the execution of federal laws, a judicial power co-existing with the new order of things.\nThe preamble of the British North America Act indicates, however, that their first duty was to endow the federal union of the Provinces with a constitution based on the same principles as that of the United Kingdom One of the essential elements of the British Constitution, as of every regular government, is the creation of a judicial power, such power and the legislative and executive powers forming the three indispensable elements of every government. Have they committed a mistake of such a very grave nature as never to have thought of the creation of a judicial power? In the opinion of some, this strange omission was made, and thus there existed between the 1st of July, 1867, when the British North America Act came into force and the meeting of the Federal Parliament, m November, 1867, an interregnum of four months, during which time there could not be found a single tribunal competent to execute the federal laws.\nNotwithstanding this, from the moment the new constitution came into force, the Federal Government became proprietor of all the public properties enumerated in Schedule 3 of the British North America Act at the same time that it became charged with the execution of the laws relating to customs and excise, and, by the 41st section, of the electoral laws which remained in force. It would have found itself therefore during such interregnum, under the impossibility either of protecting its properties or of collecting its revenues, recourse to the Provincial Courts being forbidden\nBut this argument is answered by alleging that such a great mistake has not been committed; that, on the contrary, by section 101 the Government of Canada is invested with the power of creating a Court of Appeal and additional tribunals for the better administration of its laws; that ample powers in this respect were given to it, precisely because the exclusive power of organizing tribunals for the Provinces was reserved to the Legislatures, and that thus the two governments have each their peculiar and exclusive rights of creating tribunals.\nIn my opinion section 101 does not justify this conclusion. It does not in terms establish a judicial power ; it only gives the right to establish as circumstances and requirements might demand, a Court of Appeal and additional tribunals for the better execution of the laws. According to the terms of this section there were tribunals already existing for the execution of federal laws, since this power is given to be exercised only \u201cfrom time to time \" in the words of the section, that is to say, in the event of the existing tribunals becoming, for any reason, incapable of executing the federal laws. If this section was not intended to recognize the existence of a federal judicial power, it would have been differently drawn it would have been just as easy to have directed the immediate creation of a court of appeal, or of any other tribunal, as to have allowed their creation at some future time. If this was not done, it was, doubtless, because the judicial power, whose existence was preserved by sec. 129, was recognized as being still sufficient for the requirements of the country for a long time, and the power to create new tribunals was prudently left to be exercised in the future according to circumstances. Certainly sec. 101, which gives only an optional power, cannot be relied on to prove that the authors Of Confederation created a judicial power suitable to the immediate needs of Confederation. It is by other sections that a judicial organization has been effectively established and completed in such a manner as to come into existence at the same time as the constitutional act itself\nThis organization depends upon various provisions of the British North America Act to which I shall allude after having mentioned those on which reliance is most strongly placed for contesting its existence.\nThe opponents of the constitutionality of the law in question found their principal arguments on sub-sections 13 and 14 of section 92, giving to the legislatures exclusive jurisdiction over \" property and civil rights in the province,\" and \" the administration of justice in the province,\" including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts.\nI admit, without hesitation, the exclusive control of the legislatures over these two classes of subjects. To them alone belongs, without doubt, the right of regulating civil rights in the province, as well as the organization of courts of justice for the province, and the Federal Parliament would certainly exceed its power if it were to legislate on these matters for the province. But does it necessarily follow that the latter has no jurisdiction over civil rights which concern only the Dominion in general, as well as over the organization and maintenance of courts in so far as the Dominion is interested? Do these two paragraphs contain an absolute exclusion of all jurisdictions in the Dominion Parlierment? I do not think so. It seems to me on the contrary, that these very terms are opposed to an interpretation so restricted. In fact the words i in the province,\" following the enumeration of the powers given over civil rights, and the organization of courts effectually confine the exercise of these powers to the limits of the Province, but do not go so far as to exclude the exercise by the Federal Parliament of a similar jurisdiction over the different classes of civil rights which are confided to it. Nothing is clearer nor more certain than that the legislatures have not a complete jurisdiction over civil rights. If such were the case the term \" civil rights,\" comprehending, in opposition to the criminal law (droit criminel), all the rights which a subject can enjoy, it would follow that the provinces would have an unlimited jurisdiction over everything not belonging to the criminal law. The distinction which some have wished to make between civil rights and political rights is not founded on any positive authority. The term \"political rights\" has not in English jurisprudence (droit anglais) a technical meaning established either by law or by judicial decisions. To express the same idea, Blackstone uses, Indifferently, the words civil liberty \" or \"political liberty.\" His subdivision of rights into four classes was for no other reason than to facilitate the discussion of them as he puts it: \"in order to consider them with any tolerable ease and perspicuity it will be necessary to distribute them methodically under proper heads.\" Neither has the decision of the Privy Council in the cause of Landry v. Th\u00e9berge ([25]) established as is pretended, a distinction between civil rights and political rights. Lord Cairns says, in speaking of the two laws of Quebec relating to contested elections that their object was not to provide for the decision of \" mere ordinary civil rights,\" and he describes also this legislation as e extremely peculiar,\" but he does not say that its object was to legislate on political rights as a subject distinct from civil rights. He does not even make use of the words \u201cpolitical rights in his judgment. The language which he makes use of on the subject is in conformity with what Blackstone says on the subject of the division of rights. To show conclusively that the term c civil rights in sub-section 13, cannot have the extensive meaning which it is desired to give it, it is sufficient to recall to mind that bankruptcy and insolvency patents of invention and discovery, the rights of authors, marriage and divorce, and many other subjects, which, without any doubt, are comprised in the general term \"civil rights,\" are, notwithstanding, exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament.\nIt would, therefore, be more correct to say that the legislative power over the subject of \u201ccivil rights\u201d has been divided between the Federal Parliament and the legislatures, than to conclude that it is wholly within the exclusive domain of the latter. I cannot for these reasons see in sub-section 13 obstacles to the exercise of the jurisdiction assumed by the Federal Parliament.\nNor has sub-section 14, concerning the organization of courts and procedure the effect of depriving the Federal Parliament of all jurisdictions over provincial Courts.\nThe position of the provinces in the Canadian Confederation has been compared with that of the United States in the American Union in order to draw there-from the conclusion that the provinces have an independence as complete as that of the States, and that the Federal Government cannot exercise any right whatever over Provincial Courts, any more than could the Congress of the United States, with respect to the courts of the States. If there be, in many respects, an analogy between the two countries, there is certainly none whatever in the mode adopted for the distribution of the legislative power. In the American Constitution a principle altogether opposed to that which has been followed in the British North America Act has been adopted. The States, in consenting to enter the American Union, preserved their position of sovereign and independent States, under the limitation only of the powers specially delegated to Congress. Here precisely the reverse has been done. The Imperial Parliament which has created the existing state of things, has judged it right to give to the provinces only defined and limited powers leaving to the Federal Government, after deducting the powers thus reserved, the exercise of all the powers of sovereignty compatible with the Colonial state. This is evident from section 91. In fact, besides the exclusive power over the subjects mentioned in the 29th sub-section of section 91 the Federal Gouvernement is, in addition, invested with a sovereign authority over everything which has not been specially ceded to the legislatures. The beginning of the section expresses itself thus on the subject:\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons to make laws for the peace order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared, that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada ex-tends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next herein after enumerated.\n(Then follow the 29 sub-sections setting forth the different subjects.)\nIt is evident, according to this section, that the powers of the Federal Parliament are of two kinds the one defined and enumerated in the 29 sub-sections the other undefined and consisting of the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, and having no other limits or restrictions than those contained in the 16 sub-sections of section 92.\nAs it was scarcely possible to make a complete enumeration of all the powers, and, no doubt to avoid grave inconveniences, use was made in drawing our Constitution, as in that of the United States, of general language, containing in principle the conferred powers leaving to future legislation the task of completing the details. To interpret this section the following observations can be applied:\u2014\nIn the opinion which was delivered the court observed that the Constitution unavoidably dealt in general language, and did not enter into a minute specification of powers, or declare the means by which those powers were to be carried into execution This would have been a perilous and difficult, if not an impracticable task: and the Constitution left it to Congress, from time to time, to adopt its own means to effectuate legitimate objects, and to mould and model the exercise of its powers as its own wisdom and the public interest would require ([26]).\nBut the language of section 91, general though it may L be, is amply sufficient to confer the power which has been exercised; at any rate, in the absence of proof that in doing so there has been committed an infringement on the special powers of the provinces. But, on the contrary it is admitted on all sides that the subject matter of the law which is attacked is not within the jurisdiction of the legislatures. From the nature of the subject, as well as by the provisions of sec. 41, all jurisdiction over contested federal elections is denied to the legislatures. Thus the argument based on the fact that the legislatures have the exclusive power of regulating procedure can have no weight in face of sec. 41, which confess specially on the Federal Parliament the right not only to legislate respecting contested elections, but, in addition, that of regulating their procedure, \" and proceedings incident thereto,\" says the section. No legislature being able to set up the pretension of a right to regulate the procedure with respect to this matter, three is then in this case no usurpation of powers by the law in question. This point seems to me so clearly established by the wording of the section that I do not believe it susceptible of doubt.\nIndependently of section 41, sufficient, in my opinion, to justify the passing of the law which has been called in question, there is, besides, section 129, which gives in formal terms to the Federal Government the most extensive powers over the courts in existence, namely, those of repealing, abolishing or altering them.\nExcept as otherwise provided by this Act, all laws in force in Canada Nova Scotia or New Brunswick at the union, and all courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and all legal commissions, powers and authorities, and all officers, judicial, administrative and ministerial, existing therein at the union, shall continue in Ontario. Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, respectively, as if the union had not been made; subject, nevertheless,(except with respect to such as are reached by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain\u00bb or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the legislature of the respective Province, according to the authority of the Parliament, or of that legislature under this Act.\nCould stronger or fuller language be used to give jurisdiction over these courts? I think not. The effect of this section, to which they owe their very existence, is evidently to place them under the legislative power of the Federal Government as well as it is true under that of the Local Government, and to make them in fact common to both these governments for the administration of the laws adopted by them within the limits of their respective powers.\nSince they are subject to the condition of being repealed, abolished or altered by either of these governments, these courts are not, therefore, as has been asserted so positively, subject solely to the authority of the Local Legislatures. The terms of this section leave no doubt as to the power of the Federal Government to impose new duties on the judges and courts, since it has the power of repealing, abolishing, or altering them \u201caccording to the authority of the Parliament under this Act.\" It is no doubt on account of this reserved authority that the Federal Government was given by sections 96 and 100 the appointment of the judges, and was charged with the payment of their salaries. If they were to remain under the exclusive control of the Local Legislatures and not subject to the performance of any duties which might be imposed by the Dominion Parliament, their appointment and the payment of their salary would most likely have been left to the Local Government. Thus each time the Federal Parliament passes a law on a matter within its jurisdiction, imposing on the judges or on the courts new duties it exercises the L power given it by this section of altering the courts, and this law should be executed as fully as those of the local governments, whose powers over the courts, in virtue of this section do not differ from those of Parlierment, with the sole exception that each of them can exercise these powers only within the limits of its special powers (attributions sp\u00e9ciales). The Courts are, in fine, the tribunals of Her Majesty, charged with the execution of all the laws to which she has given her sanction in virtue of the new Constitution.\nThe Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, designated in the law in question as one of those on which the contested jurisdiction is conferred, being in existence at the time of Confederation, became, in consequence, like all the others, liable to undergo the alterations which the Federal Government might think right to impose on it. Would it be the same with respect to a court created since? That is another question, and as it cannot be raised in this cause, I do not think it necessary to consider it. Nor, taking the view which I have adopted, has it seemed to me necessary to consider the question whether, outside of the provisions of the British North America Act the courts of original jurisdiction have not, as an inherent element of their Constitution, sufficient jurisdiction to decide contested elections in the event of Parliament instead of adopting the existing law, having simply abandoned the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction over this subipot I have limited my observations to the sole question as to whether it had not, in fact, the power to confer this jurisdiction on provincial courts. Finding in the provisions of the British North America Act, above cited, a complete justification of the power exercised, I have not thought it necessary to go further.\nFrom what precedes, I draw these conclusions: 1st. That paragraphs 13 and 14 of section 92 have not the effect of depriving the Federal Parliament of the jurisdiction which it has exercised in adopting the law in question. 2nd. That the general powers of section 91 and those of section 41 are sufficient to authorize this legislation. 3rd. That section 129 gives it the right to require the provincial courts to execute the law in question, as well as the other federal laws adopted within the limits of its powers.\nHENRY, J:\nThe determination of the issue raised by the preliminary objection in this case, to the authority of the learned judge who presided at the trial of the petition, touching and questioning, as it does, the power of the Parliament of Canada to pass the act under which that trial was being had, being most important, demanded and has received my most diligent study and consideration. I have carefully read and weighed all the judgments upon the subject delivered in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, as well as the several statutes bearing upon it, and will endeavor, briefly, to give the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nAfter mature consideration of the legitimate sources from which the power to try the merits of an election petition against the return of a Member of the House of Commons, which is now questioned, is derived, I have arrived at the conclusion that much has been written many arguments used, positions taken, and theories advanced that are wholly unnecessary.\nArguments have been advanced from premises which do not exist the determination of which cannot affect those that do and upon which latter alone we are bound to decide. Some learned judges contend for the existence of an inherent power in Imperial and Provincial Courts to try such petitions, and that that power always existed though in a latent condition; being controlled in England by the assertion of the House of Commons of its exclusive jurisdiction which, by degrees, became universally acknowledged as the law of the land, as being within the law and custom of Parliament; and in the several Provinces of the Dominion, by the assumption of a similar jurisdiction, and by statutes at different times passed. That, so existing, but its exercise prevented it would assert itself at any moment when the controlling power was removed by legislative enactment By other learned judges the correctness of this theory is disputed, and lengthy and exhaustive arguments are advanced to establish the position that such a jurisdiction or power never existed. I do not think the settlement of that controversy at all necessary in the present case. In considering the issue before us we are not driven to draw analogies in regard to the courts in England and those of the several united Provinces when we have sufficient otherwise upon \"which to base our judgment It will be sufficient for us and I think we are bound to rest it on the statutes immediately applicable to the issue before us.\nWe have, in the united Provinces, a written constitution embraced in the Imperial Statute, passed in 1867, for the object of uniting them. That statute contains the germs and distribution of the legislative functions and powers to be exercised in the general Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures and to it we are irresistibly turned for guidance and direction.\nIn framing that Act, one of the first considerations would be and no doubt was, to prevent, if possible, conflict in legislation, as between the general and local legislatures; but no one can read it without seeing, from the necessarily peculiar distribution of the legislative powers, the difficulty of doing so. The present case is a proof of it, as appears by the antagonistic judgments given in relation to the question at issue. I cannot better exhibit the difficulty \"just referred to, and the opportunity offered by the necessarily peculiar provisions for the distribution of legislative powers to raise a question of conflict, than by a reference to the matter of \"civil rights.\" I need not define here what may be included by that comprehensive term. It is sufficient for my present purpose to claim that a large portion of the \" civil rights\" are, legitimately and without question, affected, controlled and guarded by Dominion legislation which interferes with and excludes local legislation on many branches of \"civil rights,\" although by the distribution of legislative powers \" civil rights in the Province \" is, by sub.-sec. 14 of section 92 awarded specially to the Local Legislatures.\nThere is but a small minority of the subjects given expressly to the Dominion Parliament that do not affect \" civil rights within the Province,\" and its whole legislation in respect of them is clearly an authorized invasion of the powers of local legislation conferred by the general term \" civil rights in the Province.\" The whole purview of the act, with a proper consideration of its objects, is evidence of its policy to limit local legislation to those \u201ccivil rights in the Province,\" not included specially or otherwise in the powers given to the Dominion Parliament.\nIn the construction of one part of the Act, it is not less our duty than our privilege to take into consideration every part of it, and when an apparent conflict is presented, we are bound to give weight to arguments drawn from a due appreciation of the objects which are apparent on the face of it, and, if possible, so to construe it as to give effect to all its provisions, and not so as to leave, unnecessarily, some of them inoperative. The opening clause of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, provides that: I It shall be lawful \"for the Queen by and with the advice and consent of \"the Senate and House of Commons to make laws for the \"peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of s subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\" This is followed by a declaration that the annexed statement of powers should not restrict the general provision of the clause.\nHad there been no limitation in this clause the power \" to make laws for the peace, order and good govern-\" ment of Canada\" would have embraced every subject of legislation that could be presented, but there being a limitation, it is necessary to ascertain the nature and extent of it. It withholds from Parliament the right to legislate i in regard to matters coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the Provinces.\" It will be observed that the words of this clause \u201cby this Act\u201d do not refer us specifically to section 92 or its provisions, but generally to the Act, to ascertain what is e exclusively \"awarded to the Local Legislatures. We must look at the whole Act, and apply the result as the proper deduction from the otherwise comprehensive and unlimited powers given by the clause to the Parliament of Canada\nTaking, then, the Act, and considering it in all its objects and bearings, what are the necessary deductions to be made for those matters exclusively given by it to the Local Legislatures\u2014for it is only such as have been so exclusively given that form the exception.\nSub-section 13 of section 92 gives to the Local Legislatures the exclusive right to legislate in regard to \u201cProperty and civil rights in the Province,\" and sub-section 14 \" The administration of \"justice in the \u201cProvince,\" including\u201d the Constitution, maintenance \" and organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil a and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in c civil matters in those courts \"'\nWhat, then, does the term civil rights in the Province include? This, I take it, would, if not controlled and limited by other provisions of the Act include every question of civil rights arising between individuals in each Province, but no one could reasonably contend that legislation on the subjects of \" The regulation of trade and commerce,\" Navigation and shipping,\" Bills of exchange,\" \" Weights and Measures,\" \" Interest,\" Legal tender,\" \"Bankruptcy and insolvency,'' and many others, including \" Marriage and divorce,\" by the local authorities, would not, taking the whole Act, be ultra vires although otherwise coming within the scope and comprehension of the provision \" Civil rights within the Province.\"\nLegislation by the Dominion Parliament on such subjects is legitimate and binding, and the Provincial Courts are bound to determine the \u201ccivil rights of parties\" in the Province solely by it. I make these references to explain why, in my view we should not construe the first clause of sec. 91 merely by subsections 13 and 14 of section 92 but by the whole purview and object of the Act.\nBeing so guided, what are the local legislative powers under sections 13 and 14? Deducting the indirect and incidental powers of legislation given by the Act to Parliament, the Local Legislatures have the exclusive right to legislate only in regard to the remainder. The question here, then, is, to which of the two Legislatures is given the power of legislating as to the trial of contested elections? In reply, let me say that that subject is not only given to Parliament, but excluded from the powers of the Local Legislatures. It is a subject, therefore, the latter cannot touch. It is not questioned but that Parliament has the power of dealing generally with the whole subject It has that, not only under the provisions of the first clause of section 91 before cited but by section 129 of the Imperial Act, which provides for the continuance of all laws, etc., existing at the union. s subject, nevertheless, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Provinces, according to the authority of the Parliament, or of that Legislature under this Act.\"\nBy the terms of the clause just cited all laws were continued in force but in regard to the trial of contested elections to the House of Commons there was no statutory provision applicable, although such had previously existed in the several united Provinces. The first preamble to the Act is as follows: \" Whereas the Provinces \" of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one \" Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom \" of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution \" similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom;\" and the third preamble alleges the expediency of providing for \" the constitution of the legislative authority \" in the Dominion.\" The conclusion is irresistible from the suggestions contained in the preambles just referred to and from the whole scope and meaning of the Act that it was intended to leave no subject requiring legislation unprovided for; and that in the powers given all should be included; and, in the distribution, either Parliament or the Local Legislatures should deal with every subject. This consideration is of value when dealing with the present and other cases of a similar kind.\nThe question here is, however, not strictly one of a conflict of legislation, for, as to it, the Parliament alone has legislated; nor is it claimed, that with reference to the subject-matter in question, any Local Legislature could deal; nor, in reference to the general subject, that any l\u00e9gislative prerogative of the Local Legislatures has been invaded. The right of the Parliament 10 deal with the general subject of the trial of contested elections is admitted; but it is objected, that in so dealing with it as to give to the Provincial Courts power to. try them, and in framing the procedure it has trenched on the prerogatives of the Local Legislatures to which were committed the right to deal with civil rights in the Province,\" and \" the ad-\" ministration of justice in the Province, including the \"constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts.\"\nTo determine the point it becomes necessary, first, to ascertain the true meaning of the two sub-sections 13 and 14.\nFirst then as to ucivil rights.\" \"we are told in some of the judgments to which I have referred that the rights involved in contested elections are not civil but political ones, and a judgment of the Privy Council is cited in support of that doctrine.\nThe answer I give to that proposition is that, although in France in the United States and other countries political rights are, in some regards, looked upon as differing from ordinary civil rights, there is no such distinction ordained In England where \"civil rights \" covers and includes those which the learned judges call political only. I have read the judgment of the Privy Council referred to and can find in it no warrant for the allegation made in regard to it.\" Political \" rights are not mentioned as such but the judgment is founded on the denial of the right of the Sovereign to review the judgment of a court under local statutes substituting it, in the trial of contested elections, for the committee of the Legislative Assembly; and vesting in that court a v very peculiar jurisdiction, which, up to \" that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly.\" The judgment, so far from distinguishing between political and civil rights, refers to those involved as civil rights, but not \u201cordinary civil rights.\"\nThe right of the Local Legislatures to legislate as to civil rights as I have before stated is subordinated to those civil rights not affected by Dominion powers of legislation and to those in the Province and not including matters of a general character.\nThe 14th section gives local authority to deal with \"administration of justice in the Province\" which I construe to mean the power of legislating for the administration of justice in the Province in regard to the subjects given by the Act, and, to that extent only, to provide for \"the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts,\" including the procedure necessary for the administration of justice in reference to those and kindred subjects. I have not failed to notice the comprehensiveness of the provision, including as it does procedure in civil matters in those courts These words I hold must be considered with the context and with the objects and other provisions of the Act, and common sense and reason suggest how inartificial and incomplete the legislation must be that would confer unlimited power on the Dominion Parliament to deal with a subject such as the trial of contested elections and leave the necessary procedure to give effect to its legislation to Local Legislatures which one or more might not enact at all, or in such a way as to be useless or by such measures as would, in one Province, be essentially different from those in others. To contend that such was intended by the Act would, in my opinion, be a libel on the intelligence of the British Parliament. Although the contention against the right of the Dominion Parliament to provide for the procedure in contested election cases would apparently involve the absurdity I have just stated, such a position could not arise; for, in cases where the machinery in the Provincial Courts is defective for the trial of contested elections the Local Legislature has clearly no power to supply it. The right, therefore to provide for the procedure in contested election cases is a necessary adjunct to the right to legislate at all in respect to them.\nParliament, then, having, as I have endeavored to maintain plenary powers over the whole subject, had it the power to impose on the Provincial Courts the duty of trying contested elections?\nSection 129 of the Imperial Act, before mentioned, provides for the continuance of laws as existing at the union. The only law then existing in regard to the trials of contested elections resulted from the inherent parliamentary right of the House of Commons to deal with them. No statute had then been passed to delegate the authority to a committee of the House or any other court. The right of the House of Commons to receive petitions against the returns of its Members, and deal with them, was nevertheless as effectual as any statute could have made it and was such a law as, under the provisions of the latter clause of the section might be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada.\" By the provisions of that section, as well as by the first clause of section 91 and section 41, the Dominion Parliament derived full authority to deal with the trial of contested elections. When having so dealt with the subject, no person, high or low, can violate its legislation. Everyone is bound by its provisions and prescriptions, unless, indeed, they conflict with the Imperial Act, by usurping the powers of the Local Legislatures. I have shown that the Local Legislatures have no power over the subject and therefore in that respect no such usurpation nor conflict could arise; but the contention is, that as the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts with the procedure therein in civil matters is given by sub-section 14 of section 92 the Dominion Parliament cannot, directly or indirectly, add to their functions or duties or in any way add to the scope of their jurisdiction. I cannot draw any such conclusion from the Imperial Act. In the legislation as to the large majority of the subjects comprised in the 29 specifically and unquestionably given by section 91 to the Dominion Parliament, the power is found of directly adding to the functions, duties and jurisdiction of those courts; and, as the power to legislate in regard to contested elections is just as fully given by the Imperial Act, why should any distinction be drawn or attempted? The only difference that I can discover is in the M in which the power has been given, while none appears in substance.\nIf, in one case, the power exists why not in the other? If there is no incompatibility in the Provincial Courts in the one case, and none has been found or suggested I am at a loss to discover why there should be any in the other. The Local Legislatures even had they the power, have intervened no prohibitory legislation. The courts entertain, and adjudicate on, all matters presented to them under the common law and local statutes and until it is shown that whilst so doing, the additional duty of trying contested elections is incompatible with their other duties and obligations, I have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that they are equally authorized, as well as bound, by the provisions of the Dominion Acts, which are, in this case, objected to as ultra vires.\nThe Dominion Parliament, in the exercise of its plenary powers, had the right to impose the duty in question, the exercise of which, as far as I have been able to discover, does not in the slightest degree trench upon the legislative rights of the Local Legislatures, or conflict with the position of those courts in relation to their duties in regard to the other subjects, which by the constitution the Local Legislatures can impose on them.\nBy this conclusion effect is given to the spirit and, I think, also, the letter of the Imperial Statute in question, which a contrary one would not give. I do not forget that under the Imperial Statute the Dominion Parliament might establish independent tribunals for the trials of election contests, as was done on one occasion in Nova Scotia, under the Act of 1873, but, although I acted as one of the judges of the special court at that time, I was not insensible to the objections which might be raised to such a tribunal, appointed ad hoc by the Government of the day to try the merits of a contest between a Government supporter and an opponent To give public satisfaction in such, as in all other cases, the judicial tribunal must be free even from the slightest suspicion of weakness or bias. I have been gratified to witness the success that has been achieved in this respect from the transfer to the ordinary legal tribunals in England, and in this country, of the trial of election contests * but at the same time, would not give my sanction to an Act which is ultra vires. I am glad therefore, to be able to decide that the one in question is not so, and, consequently, I am of the opinion the appeal herein should not be allowed, and that the judgment herein of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Quebec should be affirmed with costs. TASOHEREAU, J:\nUpon the Respondent's motion to quash, this appeal, I am of opinion that the appeal lies, and that this motion must be dismissed. The preliminary objections would, if allowed, have been final and conclusive, and have put an end to the petition, and the appeal has been duly filed before the Act of last Session came into force ([27]). So that under section ten of the said Act the appeal stands, and the motion to quash must be dismissed.\nUpon the abstract question submitted to us in this case whether the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 is ultra vires or not I am of opinion that the said Act is not ultra vires. This question has been so fully and ably discussed, not only by my brother judges who have just delivered their opinions but also in the Provincial Courts by so many of the learned judges thereof, that any attempt on my part to review all the points raised in the different causes where the question has been mooted, would not, I feel, throw any new light on the subject and could not but be as tedious as of doubtful usefulness. I will therefore give as briefly as possible the reasons upon which I base my opinion that the said Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874 is constitutional.\nIt is admitted and is beyond doubt that the Parliament of Canada has the exclusive power of legislation over Dominion controverted elections. By the lex Parliamentaria, as well as by the 41st, 91st and 92nd sections of the British North America Act, this power is as complete as if it was specially and by name contained in the enumeration of the federal powers of section 91, just as promissory notes, Insolvency, &c, are. It is also admitted that if this Act of 1874 like the one of 1873, has created a new Dominion Court in each Province for the trial of controverted elections its legality is unimpeachable. The learned chief justice of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, whose judgment is now submitted to us has declared the Act constitutional, and within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, chiefly, as it appears to me, upon the ground that such a new Dominion Court is virtually created thereby. The Appellant contends that such is not the case, and that it is upon the Provincial Superior Courts as they are established, that this Act imposes the duties of trying the Dominion controverted elections. He contends that Parliament had not the power to do this and has thereby encroached upon the privileges of the Provincial Legislatures, to whom alone, he alleges, is given, by the British North America Act, the right to legislate upon the administration of justice, and the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts. I will not consider whether or not the Controverted Elections Act creates a new court in each Province for the trial of election petitions; for me the question is of no importance, as I am of opinion that Parliament had the right to impose this duty upon the Provincial Courts as they exist I say that if it has created new courts, the act is constitutional and this is admitted; but I go further, and I distinctly base my judgment on the question upon this broader ground that, admitting for the sake of argument, that it has not created new courts but has given these trials to the Provincial Courts, as they are constituted, it had the power to do so.\nGreat stress is laid by the Appellant, in support of his contention, on the 101st section of the British North America Act, by which the Dominion power is authorized to create additional courts for the better administration of the laws of the Dominion. But I do not see how that clause can be construed as restricting in any way the rights which the Dominion power has under the other parts of the Act. This right to create courts, it seems to me, is only a discretionary power, to be exercised when thought needful or necessary, but not at all obligatory on the Dominion. It does not follow that because it has the right to create new courts it cannot have resort to the courts already established for the execution of its laws. The Dominion from 1867 to 1875 did not exercise that power except in 1873, as regards controverted elections. Yet, can it be pretended that from 1867 to 1875 there were no tribunals to execute each and every one of the Dominion laws. I venture to think, that if the Imperial authority had had the intention to free the local courts from all federal authority in the manner contended for by the Appellant they would not have left the Dominion for a single instant without its tribunals and would have created federal courts by the B. N A. Act itself, or they would, at least have commanded the creation of these courts and not left it as a mere discretionary power. I do not see more force in the Appellant's contention that because in 1873 Parliament created a special tribunal for the trial of election petitions, it has granted that such a course was necessary and admitted that it had not the right to impose this duty on the Provincial Courts. This it seems to me, is not an argument at all on the question. First. I do not see such an admission in the fact of creating a new court. It might do so, without admitting that it was obliged to do so, and then, admitting that there was such an admission, supposing the admission even to have been in clear and unequivocal terms, I do not see what effect it could have on my judgment in this case. An interpretation by the Parliament of Canada of the B, N. A. Act is surely not binding on this, or on any court of justice. It is for the judicial power to decide whether the interpretation put on the Constitutional Act by either the Parliament of the Dominion or the Legislatures of the Provinces is correct or not and it is so whether they read the law as granting them a right, or read it as refusing them such a right. I do not see how a court of justice can admit its right to say that the Parliament was wrong in assuming a certain power, and at the same time draw an inference that the Parliament had not this or any other power, simply because it denied to itself that power. In either case whether the Parliament was right or wrong, is to be decided by the courts of justice.\nNow, as to the question itself:\nIn my opinion, for the administration of its laws Parliament can either have recourse to the Provincial Courts already in existence or create new courts as it chooses. But says the Appellant the administration of justice, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts in virtue of section 92 sub-Section 14 of the B. N. A. Act is vested in the exclusive powers of the Provincial Legislatures, and under that section the Dominion Parliament cannot in any way increase or decrease, give or take away from, or in any manner interfere with the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts. This, in my opinion, is a radically and entirely false and erroneous interpretation of this sub-Section 14 of section 92 of the Act and I think that it is an interpretation altogether opposed to the other parts as well as to the spirit of the Act, and which if it was to prevail, would lead to serious consequences; I think that to decide that the Federal Parliament can never or in any way add to or take from the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts, would be curtailing its powers to an extent, perhaps, not thought of by the Appellant, and that it would destroy, in a very large measure, the rights and privileges which are given to the federal power by sections 91 and 101 of the Act. I take for one instance the criminal law. the constitution maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts of criminal jurisdiction is given to the Provincial Legislatures, as well as the constitution, maintenance and organization of courts of civil jurisdiction, yet, cannot Parliament, in virtue of section 101 of the Act create new courts of criminal jurisdiction, and enact that all crimes, all offences shall be tried exclusively before these new courts? I take this to be beyond controversy.\nYet, would not that be altering, diminishing, in fact, taking away all the Provincial Criminal Court's jurisdiction?\nCould not the Parliament, as it has done declare that such and such offences shall be triable before the Courts of Quarter Sessions, or that such and such offences shall be triable only before the Superior Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction? Can it not alter these laws and say for instance, no larceny under ten pounds shall be tried at Quarter Sessions? Is this mere procedure? Does not that affect the jurisdiction of the courts s Cannot Parliament as it has done authorize in certain cases a change of venue, and say, for instance, that an offence otherwise triable at Quebec shall be tried at Montreal? How to do so, is procedure, but the change of venue itself, the taking away from one court the right it had to try such offence, the giving to another court the right to try such offence, does not that affect jurisdiction? Cannot Parliament enact that such an offence heretofore indictable shall hereafter be tried under the Magistrate's summary jurisdiction? or take away from the Magistrate's jurisdiction whatever offence it pleases? Surely all this would affect jurisdiction. Yet, I think that Parliament has the right to so legislate and order; \u2014\u2014and as it has been remarked by Mr. Justice Johnston, in Ryan vs. Devlin ([28]) the Parliament can add. a new offence to the criminal laws and leave the trial of it to the Provincial Courts. It has done so by the Post-Office Acts, by the Banking Acts, by the Railway and Customs Acts, by the Blake Act, by the Criminal Acts of 1869, and various other Acts, and it had the right to do so. It had the right and it has done so, to make corrupt practices, under the Election Act, indictable offences and to enact that such offence should not be treble at Quarter Sessions. It may amend all these laws, and, for instance, say that such corrupt practices will be treble at Quarter Sessions. But, says the Appellant, Parliament has all these powers because it has complete and exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure in criminal matters, But, may I ask him, is not its jurisdiction over the House of Commons controverted elections and all proceedings incident thereto as complete and exclusive? And, if I pass to the civil laws that is to say, other laws than the criminal laws I see in the B. N. A. Act many instances where Parliament can alter the jurisdiction of the Provincial Civil Courts.For instance, I am of opinion, that Parliament can take away from the Provincial Courts all jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency, and give that jurisdiction to Bankruptcy Courts established by such Parliament; I also think it clear that Parliament can say for instance that all judicial proceedings on promissory notes and bills of exchange shall be taken before the Exchequer Court or before any other Federal Court This would be certainly interfering with the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts But I hold that it has the power to do so quoad all matters within its authority So it has the power, and it has done so by the Public Works Acts to enact that the monies due on expropriations by the Crown shall be deposited in the Provincial Courts and to order and reg\u00falate how these courts are to distribute such monies. I read sub sect. L 14 of sect. 92 of the B. N. A. Act as having no bearing on the jurisdiction of the courts in the matters not left to the Provincial Legislatures. Strictly speaking and read by itself without reference to the other parts of the Act, it may not clearly be so restricted but if the Appellant's contention was to prevail and his interpretation received, the powers of the Federal Parliament under sections 41 91 101 and others of the Act would not be so complete as, I believe, the Imperial authority has intended them to be. The authority of the federal power, it seems to me over the matters left under its control is exclusive, full and absolute Whilst, as regards, at least, some of the matters left to the Provincial Legislatures by sect. 92 the authority of these Legislatures cannot be construed to be as full and exclusive, when, by such construction the federal power over matters specially left under its control would be lessened, restrained or impaired. For example, civil rights, by the letter of sub sect. 13 of sect. 92 are put under the exclusive power of the Local Legislatures, yet this cannot be construed to mean \u201call civil rights \" but only those which are not put under the federal authority by the other parts of the Act.\nSo, the administration of justice is given to the Provinces it is true but that cannot be understood to mean all and everything concerning the administration of justice. Parliament, for instance, has the right, as I have said to establish a Bankruptcy Court for a Province yet, that would concern the administration of justice in such Province.\nIf for instance this Controverted Election Act had been passed before Confederation if when the Confederation Act came into force the courts had had the trial of the House of Commons elections can it be pretended that Parliament would not have the power to take away that jurisdiction from the Provincial Courts and give it to the House of .Commons itself, or to any special court created under sect. 101 of the Act? Yet would that not be interfering with the administration of \"justice, or with the courts in the Provinces s Certainly, it would. But, quoad a matter put under its authority, and in that way, Parliament has such a right. And sect. 129 of the B. N. A. Act puts it beyond doubt, in my opinion, when it says that all Courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, existing at the union, can be abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the legislature of the respective Province, according to the authority of the Parliament or of that legislature, under the Act\nThe clause, it is true, says: \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by this Act, \" but I fail to see where it is otherwise provided by the Act so as to affect the question now before us. A distinction is made by the Appellant which seems to me to arise from a confusion or misconstruction of terms. The learned chief justice, whose judgment is now before this court, is of opinion, that had the House of Commons simply resigned its jurisdiction over controverted elections, without substituting any court in its place for trying such elections, the Civil Courts would have been de facto invested with complete jurisdiction over these election petitions. I entirely agree with this opinion. The Superior Court for the Province of Quebec, for instance, having superior original jurisdiction over all civil pleas, causes and matters ([29]) would have had in that case to try these petitions. \" But,\" says the Appellant, \" that could not be, because the right to sit in the House of Commons is a political right; it is not a civil right; it does not fall under civil law.\" The answer to this is, it seems to me, easily found. The Quebec Statute does not say that the Superior Court has jurisdiction only in matters falling L under the civil law, but it says that it has jurisdiction over all civil pleas causes and matters whatsoever, using clearly, as well remarked by Chief Justice Meredith in this case, the terms \"civil pleas, causes and matters s in contradistinction with criminal pleas, causes and matters.\nIt can surely not be pretended that an election petition is a criminal plea, cause or matter. Then, it is a civil plea, cause or matter. It must be the one or the other. I do not see why the Appellant speaks of civil law. He cannot find that word once in sect. 92 of the B.N.A. Act, defining the powers of the Provincial legislatures. I doubt if it can be found in the whole Act. Civil rights is the word used. Well, civil rights, sometimes with us called the liberties of the subject do not all arise from the civil law. For instance, the right of the subject accused of a crime to be tried by his peers is a civil right, yet the exercise of that right falls under the criminal not the civil law. So, a political right, whatever the Appellant means by these words, is a civil right, though not an ordinary civil right. It is a civil right, springing from the public or the constitutional law.\nThe civil law does not include all the civil rights of the subject, whilst the civil rights of a. subject include, amongst others, the civil law, the right to be governed by that law. But, enough about civil rights and civil law: they have, it seems to me, very little to do with the case supposed, which, I take it, depends on what is meant by the civil jurisdiction of the Superior Court. Now, I repeat it, when the Quebec Statute gives jurisdiction to the Superior Court over all civil pleas, causes and matters whatsoever, it intends to give it jurisdiction over all cases where the means taken to recover or obtain justice is not a criminal proceeding, or a procedure under the criminal law of the land. And I say it again, an election petition is not such a criminal law proceeding. It seems, therefore, to me clear that, had Parliament abandoned its privileges over controverted elections, without referring them specially to any court, they would have fallen on the civil courts of ordinary jurisdiction, be-cause the trial of a political right on an election petitions is a civil plea, cause or matter, just as much as the trial on a controverted municipal election, for instance, for a municipal election, like an election for the House of Commons, is not a part of the civil law.\nBy renouncing its privileges over the controverted elections of its members, which, it is granted they had a right to do the House of Commons has made of election petitions and of the trial of these controverted elections, an ordinary civil plea, cause or matter, which it would always have been had it not been for these privileges The Appellant sees another objection to the proposition, that, without special legislation upon the mere giving up of these privileges by the House of Commons the civil courts would have had to try the election petitions. He says that it would have been impossible for the courts of justice in that case to execute their judgments. That does not seem to me to be an argument. If the House of Commons, even now, chose to disobey a judgment of an election court, I do not see how the court could enforce its judgment; of course, it cannot be presumed that the House of Commons will act against the law, but the presumption would have been the same, for what would, in that case have been the law? The last contention of the Appellant is based upon the words of sub-section 14 of the 92nd section of the B. N. A. Act, which give to the Provincial Legislatures the exclusive control over procedure in civil matters in the Provincial Courts. Upon this, I have nothing to add. to what has been said in this case by the learned Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court, who held that these words must be understood to mean procedure in civil matters within the powers of the Provincial Legislatures. Section 41 of the Act specially gives to the federal authority the right to legislate upon the controverted elections of the House of Commons and the proceedings incident thereto. Thus, the laws made by Parliament on the proceedings on election petitions are binding on the Provincial Courts. They cannot be deemed to be an interference with the powers of the Provincial Legislatures, since these legislatures have no power, no control over these proceedings, or the procedure on these petitions.\nFor all these reasons, I am of opinion, that the judgment appealed from, declaring the Controverted Elections Act of 1874 constitutional, is right, and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs. I need hardly say that if, in my remarks, I appear to have had the Province of Quebec more particularly in view, it is because the case submitted to us comes from that province, but my remarks on the B. N. A. Act must be taken as applying generally to all the provinces.\nI have only one word to add. It has been said, that, if this Act is constitutional, the control of the Local Legislatures over the Provincial Courts is reduced to a very small compass. Well, in the first place, I do not think so; then, I may call the attention of those who should be inclined to think too much of the powers of the local legislatures, under our Constitutional Act over the Courts of Justice, to the fact that, by simply refusing to name and pay the judges, the federal authority can, when it pleases, virtually abolish any of the Superior Courts in any of the Provinces, or can control any changes in the constitution and Organization of these courts which the Local Legislatures would be inclined to enact as regards the number of their judges. Yet, by the strict letter of sub sect. 14 of sect. 92 of the B. N. A. Act the constitution and organization of these courts is put under the exclusive power of these Local Legislatures. This, again, shows that this clause cannot be read by itself, and that, for a sound interpretation of its terms, the whole Act must be taken into consideration.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nI concur in the Opinion of the learned Chief Justice Meredith, to the effect that the 13th and 48th sections of the act constitute the court for trial of the election petitions a separate and distinct court from the courts of superior jurisdiction in the provinces. The 67th section of the act supports this view, and by force of the 3rd section, which declares that in the act, and for the purposes thereof, the expression \" the court\" shall mean, not only the courts of superior jurisdiction after-named, but also \"any of the judges thereof, \" whenever a judge sits in a matter arising under the act, he sits as a court constituted by the act but it is by no means necessary, as it appears to me, for the determination of this case that these points should be established so to be.\nIt cannot, in my opinion, admit of a doubt, that the Dominion Parliament can, in respect of all matters within their control, impose judicial duties upon the judges of the superior courts in the several provinces in excess of those exercised by them in the discharge of their ordinary functions, and their so doing constitutes no invasion of the rights of the local legislatures. I am of opinion also that it is incorrect to speak of the transfer by the Dominion Parliament of the right to hear and determine all questions arising upon election petitions to the courts of superior original civil jurisdiction, existing in the several provinces, as constituting an enlargement of the jurisdiction of those courts, in the sense of being an interference with the special jurisdiction given by the British North America Act to the local legislatures to constitute and organize provincial courts. Such transfer is but the adding an additional subject to those entertained by the courts in the exercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, and which subject, the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Commons over it being removed, fell naturally within the competency of courts of superior and original civil jurisdiction to entertain, from the very nature of their institution as courts of original jurisdiction. And, finally, I am of opinion, that the prescribing the manner in which the jurisdiction so transferred shall be exercised, that is to say, prescribing the procedure to be adopted, constitutes no invasion of, nor any interference whatever with, the powers and jurisdiction conferred by the British North America Act upon the local legislatures.\nUpon these latter points I should not have thought it necessary to add anything to what fell from me in the Niagara case, in the Court of Common Pleas, in Ontario ([30]), if it was not for the disapproval of that judgment expressed by several of the learned judges in the other provinces, before whom the same question has arisen. The objections urged to that judgment are, that the trial of an election petition is not a civil matter at all that the rights thereby brought in question are not civil rights at all, that, in contradistinction, they are purely political rights and matters. That the Courts of superior original civil jurisdiction, even in England, would not have competency to entertain or assume jurisdiction in these matters as was suggested in the judgment they would have, if the Parliament had passed an act merely abandoning, on behalf of the House of Commons, the exclusive jurisdiction it had asserted and maintained over the subject matter.\nWith the greatest respect for the opinions of those learned judges with whom I have the misfortune to diner I am unable to see that a right is less a civil right, because it is connected with that particular part of our civil polity which relates to the protection of the citizen in his rights arising out of our system of parliamentary representation. \u201cThe right to offer oneself as a candidate\u2014the right to be placed on the voters' list\u2014the right to vote\u2014the right, in fact, to enjoy political rights,\" are all admitted, in one of the judgments to which I refer, to be civil rights, and so, I presume, the wrongful assertion of, or the interference with the rightful exercise of any of these rights is a civil wrong.\nIf the right to offer oneself as a candidate be a civil right, the right of a qualified candidate to exclude a disqualified one must surely be equally so, and so must, likewise, be the right to exclude a person from voting who has not the legal qualification, or, having it, has corruptly sold it. For my part, I cannot permit myself to doubt that to return, as elected, a person not qualified by law, or who has not, in fact, had a majority of legal votes, is a civil wrong, or that, ex converso, the. right of a legally qualified candidate to enjoy the fruits of his candidature and to take the position to which he has been legally elected, and to call in question all illegal votes and to exclude from the position to which he has legally been elected a person who has wrongfully been returned as elected, is a civil right; and these are the rights which form the subject of enquiry upon an election petition. But it is said that we are concluded by authority, and that the Privy Council in England, by their judgment in Landry vs. Th\u00e9berge ([31]), has clearly and fully pronounced these rights to be political and not civil.\nThere is nothing in that case, in my judgment, to support this contention. The question there was, whether the Quebec Controverted Elections Acts of 1872and 1875, which enacted that judgment upon the trial of controverted elections rendered by the authorities to which those acts transferred the right of trying such cases should not be susceptible of appeal, ousted the prerogative jurisdiction of the Privy Council in appeal? And the court held that the appeal was well taken away, upon the ground that, as these acts dealt not with mere ordinary civil rights and privileges, but with rights and privileges of a peculiar character, namely, the rights and privileges, not only of candidates but of electors and of members of the Legislative Assembly, which rights have always, in every colony, following the example of the Mother Country, been jealously guarded by the Legislative Assembly in complete independence of the Crown it was quite competent for the legislature to delegate the authority formerly exclusively exercised by the Legislative Assembly to Her Majesty's courts of civil jurisdiction, or to any of the judges thereof, to the exclusion of all appeal to the Crown in Council the court saying:\nIt would be singular if the determination of these cases in the last resort should no longer belong to the Legislative Assembly, nor to the court which the Legislative Assembly had put in its place, but belonged to the Crown in Council\nThere is not a word here about the rights dealt with not being \u201ccivil rights,\" nor anything from which it can be collected that the Privy Council was of opinion they were not. There is no contrast whatever made or alluded to, as between \"civil\" and \" political\" rights, but there is, as it appears to me, a contrast plainly enough drawn between mere ordinary civil rights, as to which a question could fairly arise as to the power of a provincial legislature to exclude the right of appeal, and those peculiar civil rights over which the Legislative Assembly in imitation of the British House of Commons, has asserted and maintained exclusive control in complete independence of the Crown, which exclusive control it was held to be competent for the Legislature to delegate, and to assert for the substituted authority equal independence of the Crown.\nThe Parliament, having transferred this subject, over which the House of Commons formerly exercised exclusive control, to the cognizance of civil tribunals seem to me, if it were necessary to appeal to such an argument to indicate that they entertained no doubt that the rights over which control was so transferred were civil rights for it is the pride of our constitution to keep our civil courts, and the judges thereof, aloof from all interference in political subjects and discussions, and it is scarcely to be conceived that the parliament would transfer the investigation of those rights from the political to a civil tribunal, if it had thought that the subject matter placed under the cognizance of the civil tribunal did not involve any enquiry into civil rights.\nIn support of the proposition, that courts of original jurisdiction, even those courts in England, could not assume or exercise jurisdiction of the rights in question, even though Parliament should, by an Act of Parliament merely abandon and disavow all exclusive and every jurisdiction of the House of Commons over the subject matter Rowland's manual of the constitution has been referred to.The following extract, however, from that work, in which the author gives an account of the manner in which the exclusive control of the House of Commons was assumed asserted and vindicated until it became embodied in the constitution seems to me to lead rather to a contrary conclusion. He says at pp. 203-4-5:\nThe power to decide in controverted elections was exercised by the Crown up to the reign of James First. In his first Parliament the Commons entered into a contest with him, asserting their own right to decide upon election returns. James convoked the Parliament by a Royal Proclamation, in which he admonished the electors that the Knights for the counties should be selected out of the \"principal Knights or gentlemen of sufficient ability, and for Burgesses that choice he made of men of sufficiency and discretion. He commanded that express care be taken that there be not chosen any bankrupts or outlawed but such only as were taxed to the subsidies and had ordinarily paid and satisfied them. That sheriffs do not direct any precepts to ruined and decayed boroughs, and that the inhabitants of cities and boroughs do hot seal any blanks, leaving to others to insert the names, but do make open and free elections according to law He notified that all returns should be brought into chancery there to be filed of record, and if any be found contrary to the proclamation they were to be rejected as unlawful and insufficient, and the city or borough was to be fined for the same, and if it be found that they had committed any gross or willful default or contempt in their election return or certificate that then their liberties were to be seized into his hands and forfeited. If any person take upon himself the place of a knight, citizen or burgess, not being duly elected, returned and sworn, then every person so offending to be fined and imprisoned for the same.\nThe Commons lost no time after the meeting of Parliament in questioning the right assumed by the king in his proclamation to have the returns of members decided in chancery.\nSir Francis Goodwin was elected for Bucks, but his return was refused by the Clerk of the Crown because he was outlawed. On a second election Sir J. Fortescue was elected. A. motion was made in the House that a return be examined and Goodwin be received as member. The Clerk of the Crown attended at the bar by order of the House with the return, and the House resolved, after debate, that Goodwin was lawfully elected and returned. The Clerk of the Crown was ordered to file the first return, and Goodwin took the oath of supremacy and his seat, The Lords desired a conference which the Commons declined and sent a message that in no sort should they give account to the Lords of their proceedings.\nThe Lords replied that, acquainting His Majesty with the return, His Highness conceived himself engaged and touched in honor that there might be some conference of it between the two Houses. Upon this message, so extraordinary and unexpected the House appointed a committee to consider what should be delivered to His Majesty, and through the Speaker, the House represented to the King that the Sheriff was no judge of the outlawry neither could take notice it was the same man; and, therefore, could not properly return him outlawed. The King reminded the Commons that he had no purpose to impeach their privilege. The difficulty was, after considerable discussion, solved, on a conference held in the King's presence, and, by his command, with the judges, who, conceding that the Commons was a court of record and judge of returns, although not exclusively of the chancery, suggested that both Goodwin and Fortescue should be set aside and a new writ be issued\nThis compromise was joyfully accepted by the Commons, and no attempt was afterwards made to dispute their exclusive jurisdiction over the returns of their members.\nNow, the House of Commons, having in this manner, as a court of record, and as a compromise with the King's courts, acquired the jurisdiction it assumed, until in 1770, by the Greenville Act, the jurisdiction was conferred by the legislature upon a committee of 11 members can it be doubted that if the British Parliament should pass an act of Parliament, whereby, upon behalf of, and in the name of the House of Commons, it should abandon, abjure and disavow, all further control over the return of its members the right to enquire into those returns would revert to the King's courts?\nWith great deference I think there can be no doubt that it would, and I am of opinion that, under a like act of the Dominion Parliament the courts of superior original jurisdiction in the several provinces of the Dominion would from the nature of their institution as courts of original jurisdiction, have the like power, and therefore these courts had competency to accept cognizance of the matter. In fine, I entertain no doubt that the right to enquire into the legality of the returns of members of the House of Commons, not relating to a matter over which any jurisdiction is conferred upon the local legislatures, but to civil rights, which, by the constitution, were wholly under the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Commons it was competent for Parliament to transfer to the civil tribunals in the several provinces, having superior original jurisdiction, cognizance of all rights arising out of election petitions and that so doing constitutes no invasion of or encroachment whatever upon the rights conferred upon the local legislatures, and that, inasmuch as parliament may transfer such cognizance absolutely, it may do so qualifiedly, or sub modo, by defining the mode in which the cognizance shall be exercised, which, by prescribing the mode of procedure, is what has been done. Neither is such prescribing of the mode of procedure an invasion of or encroachment upon, the rights of the local legislatures, for the 14th sub-section of sec. 92 of the British North America Act must plainly be read as conferring upon the local legislatures the right to prescribe procedure in civil matters, only in respect of these matters, which, by the 13th subsection, were placed under the exclusive control of the local legislatures.\nTo hold that the local legislatures could prescribe, or in any respect interfere with, the manner in which a matter over which they have no jurisdiction whatever, shall be conducted or enquired into, involves, in my opinion a manifest contradiction in terms. I am of opinion, therefore, that the act is not in any particular ultra vires, and that the appeal, which calls in question its validity should be dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitor for Appellant: H.

C. P. L. C.\nS. on the 1st August, 1868, transferred to Appellants (Plaintiffs,) as trustees of S's. creditors, his interest in an unexpired lease he had of a certain hotel in Montreal, known as the Bonaventure building, and in the furniture. On 1st April, 1870, A. P., the proprietor, after cancelling, with the consent of all concerned, the several leases of the said building and premises, gave a lease direct for a term of ten years to one G., at $6,000 a year, of the building, and also of the furniture belonging to S's. creditors, and on the same day by a notarial deed, \u201cagreement and accord,\" A. P. promised and agreed to pay to Appellants, as trustees of S\u2019s. creditors, whatever he would receive from the tenant beyond $5,000 a year. In February, 1873, the premises were burned, with a large proportion of the furniture, and Appellants received $3,223 for insurance on fixtures and furniture, and $791, being the proceeds of sale of the balance of the furniture saved. The lease with G. was then cancelled, and A. P., after expending a large amount to repair the building, leased the premises to L. P. & Co. for $6,000 a year from October, 1873. Appellants thereupon, as trustees of S's. creditors, sued Respondents representing A. P., and called upon them to render an account of the amount received from G. & L. P. & Co. above $5,000 a year. The Superior Court of Montreal held that Appellants were entitled to what A. P. had received from L. P. & Co. beyond $5,000 ; and on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side,) this judgment was reversed.\nHeld,__Affirming the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side,) that the lease to G. terminated by a force majeure, and that the obligation of A. P. to pay Appellants the sum of $1,000 out of the said rent of $6,000 ceased with the said lease.\n2. That the fact of Appellants having alleged themselves in their declaration to be the \"duly named trustees of S's. creditors,\" did not give them the right to bring the present action for S's. creditors, the action, if any, belonging to the individual creditors of S. under Art. 19, C. C. P. L. C.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side), Province of Quebec, rendered on the 22nd June, 1877.\nThe facts of the case are the following : -\nOn the 10th February, 1866, Mr. Pinsoneault leased a building in the City of Montreal, known as the Bonaventure building, to Thomas L. Steele for 7 years from 1st May, 1866, that is to say, up to the 1st May 1873, at the rate of $3,250 a year, and on the 1st November, 1868, two years afterwards, this lease was extended for another period of seven years, from the 1st May, 1873, that is to say, up to the 1st May, 1880, the rent stipulated for the extended term being $5,000. On the 1st August, 1868, Steele, who had made improvements, transferred his interest under the above lease and in the furniture to the appellants, P. D. Brown, Alexander Holmes, John Barry and Henry Millen, \"acting as \"Trustees for and on behalf of divers firms and persons, \"creditors of the said Thomas L. Steele, under a certain \"paper writing or memorandum of agreement made \"and entered into by and between the said Thomas L. Steele, and his creditors, and hereunto annexed,\" to secure a sum of about $14,000.\nThe appellants thereupon, in their capacity of Trustees, sublet the premises to parties who, by reason of various assignments, were, on the 1st April, 1870, represented by one Oviatt. By notarial agreement of 1st April, 1870, the late Alfred Pinsoneault and appellants consented to cancel and set aside all the above mentioned leases, and consented that the hotel and furniture, (except the billiard tables,) should be leased by Pinsoneault to one F. Gerriken, from 1st April, 1870, to 1st May, 1880, at an annual rent of $6,000. To this agreement Mr. Oviatt intervened, and consented to the cancellation of the leases, and to the new lease to Gerriken. The subtenants also intervened and consented to the arrangement.\nOn the same date, 1st April, 1870, Pinsoneault leased the hotel and property to Gerriken for the time above mentioned, ten years and one month, from 1st April, 1870, at an annual rent of $6,000, payable quarterly, and on the same day a notarial compromise or transaction, called acte d\u2019accord, was also passed between the late Pinsoneault and the appellants.\nThis acte d\u2019accord, after reciting that it had been agreed that the old leases should be cancelled and that a new lease of the building and of the furniture belonging to the Estate Steele should be granted to Gerriken for ten years at $6,000 a year, Mr. Pinsoneault to pay over to the Estate Steele, the difference between the rent under the old and that under the new lease, proceeds as follows ;-\nNow these presents, and I the said Notary, witness, \" that the said party of the first part agrees with the \"said party of the second part, that the said Alfred \"Pinsoneault will pay over and account for to the said \"parties of the second part the difference between the \" said rental, so payable by the said Thomas L. Steele \" ($5,000), and the amount of rental payable hereunder \" ($6,000), by even and equal quarterly payments after \" the first day of May next, on which day one month's \"rent becomes due, the proportion whereof is to be \"handed over to the said parties of the second part, as soon as received by the said Alfred Pinsoneault, immediately on receipt thereof by the said Alfred Pinsoneault from the then tenant or tenants of said premises.\" * * * * It is further agreed that, upon \"the expiration of the said lease to the said Frederick \" Gerriken, the said Alfred Pinsoneault shall deliver over \"to the said parties of the second part the several articles \" of furniture mentioned in the said lease in the state \" and condition in which they then shall be found to \" be, and the said parties of the second part hereby \"acknowledge to have received from the said Alfred Pinsoneault the sum of twelve hundred and seventy\" three dollars and fourteen cents in advance of the \" proportion of the said several instalments so to be\" come payable to the parties hereto of the second part \" hereunder, which said amount is to be deducted from \" the first payments which shall fall due to them here\" under, and the same shall bear interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum until fully paid.\"\nThe building was partially destroyed by fire on the 17th March, 1873, and a large portion of furniture was burnt. On the 27 April, 1873, the furniture and effects remaining after the fire were sold by auction, and the proceeds, viz : $791, were paid to Steele's Trustees.\nThe appellants claimed from the Insurance Companies about 5,000. They obtained $3,223 by way of compromise, for loss on the improvements made by Steele and for loss of rental.\nOn the 29th August, 1873, Mr. Pinsoneault caused a notarial protest to be served on the appellants. This protest, after reciting the main facts of the case, the fire, the receipt by the appellants of the proceeds of the sale of what remained of the furniture, proceeds as follows:\nThat the said improvements in said hotel had been \"insured by the said Trustees and representatives \"of the said Estate Steele, who agreed, after the said fire \"to hand over the amount of said insurance to the said \"Alfred Pinsoneault, to enable him to replace the said \"improvements in their original condition before the \" fire.\n\"Wherefore, I, the said Notary, at the request aforesaid, and speaking as aforesaid, do hereby notify the \"said Trustees and representatives of the said Estate \"of the said Thomas L. Steele that unless, within fifteen \"days from the date hereof, they put in the hotel furniture of the same description and nature as that \"belonging to them and which was in the said hotel \"before the fire as aforesaid, and unless they pay him, \"the said Alfred Pinsoneault, an amount sufficient to \" place the said improvements in the same condition \" in which they were before the fire, he will consider \" the arrangements between them at an end and act accordingly.\"\nThe appellants took no notice of this protest.\nSubsequently, on the 2nd September, 1873, Pinsoneault brought an action against Gerriken to have the lease declared resiliated on account of the fire, and the following admission was fyled in this case ;\nThat, in the action of Pinsoneault vs. Gerriken en resiliation of lease, Gerriken pleaded that the lease \"was already destroyed from the date and by the effect \"of the fire, whereupon Pinsoneault prayed acte that \"he was free to consider lease resiliated for the future, \"which acte was granted to him by the Court.\"\nMr. Pinsoneault expended after the fire, $10,292, and on 3rd Oct., 1873, gave a lease to Linton, Popham & Co., for seven years for $6,000 a year. The appellants received their proportion of what Pinsoneault had been paid up to the time of the fire.\nThe action was brought in the Superior Court, Montreal, by the Appellants, Philo. D. Browne, et al, acting in their quality of Trustees duly named of the creditors of Thomas L. Steele, against the Respondents, children and legal representatives of the late Alfred Pinsoneault, to enforce the notarial contract (acte d\u2019accord) entered into between the appellants esqualite and their late father, and claimed an account from the respondents for the rent by them, or their auteur, received from Gerriken and from Cooper, Linton and Popham, the tenants occupying the building in question during the period extending from the 1st February, 1873, to the 1st May, 1875.\nThe respondents pleaded that under the acte d'accord Mr. Pinsoneault's liability was to terminate with the lease to Gerriken, and that the appellants treated the fire as having terminated that lease, by having received the proceeds of what remained of the Steele furniture, and by claiming from the Insurance Company and compromising with them for the insurance on the improvements and on the rental, which amounts they retained and refused to give up to Mr. Pinsoneault, although called upon to do so by the notarial protest of the 29th day of August, 1873, and they concluded that they are not liable to account for any rent from and after the date of the fire.\nAfter issue joined, the appellants, on the 10th May, 1875, brought an incidental or supplementary demand, setting up that the respondents themselves had f been paid by the new tenants, Linton & Co., under the lease, additional rent, making in all $6,000 for the whole year, from the 1st May, 1874, to the 1st May, 1875, taking conclusions to the same effect as in the principal action.\nTo this supplementary demand the respondents pleaded the same plea precisely as in the principal action.\nOn the 23 November, 1875, judgment was rendered in the Superior Court (Johnson, J.) holding the respondents liable to account for any rent received from Gerriken by the late Alfred Pinsoneault between the 1st February and the 1st May, 1874, and liable, also, for the proportion of rent received by themselves from Linton & Co., from 1st May, 1874, till the 1st May, 1875, and condemning respondents to render an account of said rents within fifteen days of the date of the judgment, and in default thereof, to pay the sum of $1,000, which was the proportion of rent coming to appellants from the amount paid by Linton & Co., to respondents.\nNo account was rendered by respondents, and on the certificate thereof, the case was inscribed on the principal and on the incidental demand. On 31st January, 1876 the final judgment was rendered against respondents for $1,000, the proportion of rent coming to appellants on the whole sum of $6,000 received from Linton & Co., as rent from 1st May, 1874, to 1st May, 1875.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) this judgment was reversed, and the appellants (plaintiffs) thereupon appealed to this Court.\nMr. Robertson, Q. C. for Appellants:-\nThe acte d\u2019accord contains no such condition as is set up in the plea, namely, that Pinsoneault was to pay over the $1,000 to the 1st May, 1880, \"on condition \"that the lease to the said Gerriken should continue in \" force for that period of time.\"\nThere is no evidence of record to show the lease to Gerriken from Pinsoneault was cancelled by judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe plea alleges Gerriken took an action in the Superior Court, under the No. 7, to have the lease resiliated, which action is still pending, and that Pinsoneault brought an action en resiliation and in damages, under the No. 2,705, which is still pending. The admission (No. 4) admits that Pinsoneault took an action in August, 1831, under the No. 1,731, for the resiliation of the lease, and admission No. 11, that Gerriken took his action en resiliation at the time mentioned in the plea, but no copy of judgment en resiliation was fyled, and no proof of resiliation whatever was produced, nor even alleged in the pleadings ; nor is there anything to support the statement in the third considerant of the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench that the lease to Gerriken was annulled by judgment \" of the Superior Court.\" Nor is there any proof before this Court when, or in what action, such judgment in resiliation was rendered; nor whether it was for the force majeure assumed in the judgment now appealed from, or for non-payment of rent, or for the reason set up in the plea, namely, \"that the premises were \" becoming damaged.''\nA resiliation, brought about by Pinsoneault and Gerriken, voluntarily, on the day after the lease, or by reason of actions instituted 18 months after it, to which the now appellants were not parties, should not bind the appellants, or free the now respondents, from their obligation to hand over the proportion of rent received from Linton & Co., under the new lease.\nIf a force majeure prevented rent from accruing from the date of the fire down to the 1st May, 1874, Pinsoneault and the appellants must suffer proportionally ; but when the premises were repaired, and rent began to run under the lease to Linton & Co., the obligation to hand over to appellants their proportion continued in force.\nBy the acte d\u2019accord Pinsoneault was to pay over \"the difference between the said rentals of $5,000 and $6,000,\" and this was to be paid immediately on receipt thereof by the said Alfred Pinsoneault from the then tenant or tenants of the said premises.\nIt was not stipulated as a condition that, if Gerriken ceased to be tenant, the appellants5 rights should cease, and Pinsoneault be entitled to the whole rent. The consideration given by the now appellants to Pinsoneault extended over the whole period of the long lease, and so the agreement to pay over the proportion of rent must be held to extend over the same period. Hence the importance of this appeal, which will practically decide the right of the appellants to obtain $1,000 per annum during the whole period of the long lease.\nThe notice, served on the appellants, of the 9th August, 1873, by the Notary Philips, was to the effect that if they \" did not put in the hotel furniture of the \" same description and nature as that belonging to them \" and which was in the said hotel before the fire, and \"unless they pay him, the said Alfred Pinsoneault, an \" amount sufficient to place the said improvements in \"the same condition in which they were before the fire, \" he will consider the arrangements between them at \" an end, and act accordingly, and will hold them liable \" and responsible for all costs.\"\nMessrs. Linton & Cooper's lease, as appears by its terms, was for a boot and shoe manufactory, and Pinsoneault's consent to fit up and have it used as such factory must be held as clearly shown by the lease itself. To demand of the appellants to put into such a factory the furniture of an hotel would be wholly useless, if not absurd. Both Pinsoneault and the now Appellants must he held to have acquiesced in the lease to Linton & Cooper for a factory. The rent was equal to that paid when the premises were used as an hotel; the risk of fire and cost of insurance were less, and the notice as to putting in furniture must be held as waived by the subsequent appropriation of the premises to the purposes of a factory.\nMr. Barnard, Q. C., for Respondents :\nThe first point is: whether, under words \"tenant or tenants\" in the acte d\u2019accord, it can be held that \"tenants\" include those who would occupy after Gerriken's lease should come to an end.\nThe acte d'accord speaks of a lease to Frederick Gerriken, and shows intention to confine agreement to that lease. The words \" or tenants \" is used because there were sub-tenants, and this explanation reconciles these words with the whole terms of the lease. \" At expiration of lease,\" means expiration of lease to Gerriken.\nThe words \"from the then tenant or tenants\" mean Gerriken and his sub-tenants. Pinsoneault made nothing out of this arrangement.\nThe conduct of the parties immediately after the fire shows how both parties understood it. The $1,000 was the consideration for the improvements made and for furniture. The Trustees took away their furniture when lease to Gerriken was at an end by fire. They also took the insurance money which represented their improvements.\nIt has been stated this contract came to an end in a manner unforeseen by the parties, and the dissenting judge thought the Court could deal with the matter in the same way the parties might have done, if they had foreseen the event. But then the Estate Steele should have restored Pinsoneault to his original position, and this they refused to do.\nAction was badly brought. No action pro socio for account can be brought unless the Plaintiff himself offers an account.\nPepin v. Christin ([1]) ; McDonald v. Miller ([2]) ; Miller v. Smith ([3]).\nAppellants contend there was no evidence that lease was resiliated by force majeure, or resiliated at all. But there is no doubt the lease has been resiliated, and the Plaintiffs have so treated it in their proceedings, and that lease was at an end was assumed by both parties.\nThe 8th admission by the parties is to the following effect: That in the action of Pinsoneault v. Gerriken en resiliation of lease acte was granted to Pinsoneault by the Court that he was free to consider the lease resiliated, as the lease had been destroyed by the effect of the fire.\nThe only complication as to this part of the case is that Mr. Gerriken also brought an action against Pinsoneault asking for the resiliation of the lease, and judgment on that action was also rendered on the same day, by the same judge, who appears to have been puzzled by the fact that while the parties both asked for the same thing, each contested the action of the other.\nThe result, however, of the two actions was that the lease was resiliated from the date of Gerriken's demand, and judgment for rent up to that time was given in favor of Mr. Pinsoneault, whose claim for damages, however, was rejected. The conclusion arrived at was based, it seems, on the view taken by the judge of the law as to the effect of a fire. Had the whole building been destroyed, the lease would have been resiliated de facto without any action being necessary. But as the building was only partially destroyed, an action was necessary, and the tenant must pay his rent up to the date of his demand, although he proved that the damages done had absolutely rendered the premises uninhabitable.\nUnder any circumstances, the action of the Appellants, as brought, should have been dismissed, because, under our law, no one can sue par procureur. Code of Procedure, art. 19. Here the action, if any, belongs to the individual creditors of Steele.\nMr. Robertson, Q. C., in reply:\nIf Pinsoneault could lease the property at all for $6,000, my client has a right to claim his share. There is no condition in the written contract that he would cease to be entitled to his share the moment the lease to Gerriken terminated. The reason that Plaintiffs sued as Trustees of Steele's creditors is because Pinsoneault, by the acie d'accord, agreed to account to them as such Trustees.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by TASCHKREAU, J.:-\nThis action is based upon a certain acte d'accord, passed on the 1st April, 1870, between the late Alfred Pinsoneault, of the one part, and the Plaintiffs, present Appellants, acting in their quality of Trustees of Thomas L. Steele, of the other part, and calls upon the Defendants, present Respondents, as the legal representatives of the said Alfred Pinsoneault, to render an account, and pay over certain rents received, and which, it is alleged, the said Pinsoneault had agreed to pay over to the Appellants by the said acte d'accord.\nIn the Superior Court, the Plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the Defendants, but in the Court of Queen's Bench this judgment was reversed and the Plaintiffs' action dismissed with costs. The Plaintiffs now appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed. The Plaintiffs sue \" in their quality of Trustees duly named of the creditors of Thomas L. Steele,\u201d The rule with us, contained in art. 19 of, the Code of Procedure, is that no one can sue par procureur. Of course, in certain cases, when specially authorized by law to do so, Trustees of certain public bodies may sue and appear before the courts as such. So can an assignee, under the Insolvency Acts. But here the Plaintiffs have no such standing. They are merely the attornies of Thomas L. Steele's creditors. It is true that Pinsoneault passed the deed of April, 1870, with them, acting in their quality of such Trustees. But that does not give them the right to appear as such before a court of justice. It is not, because in a deed A appears as attorney of J5, that he may, on that deed, sue as such attorney. In this very deed of April, 1870, Honore Cotte appeared as attorney of the late Pinsoneault, who was absent. It could not be pretended that Cotte could sue the Appellants on that deed, in his said quality of attorney. For the same reason, the Appellants cannot sue Pinsoneault, or his representatives, on this deed, in their quality of Trustees of Steele's creditors. Upon this ground alone the Plaintiffs' action cannot stand.\nBut I go further, and say that, on the merits of the case, the Plaintiffs' action was rightly dismissed. I fully concur in the remarks which the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench made at the rendering of the judgment in the court below. It appears that on the 10th February, 1866, Pinsoneault leased a building called the Bonaventure building, or St. James' Hotel, to Thomas L. Steele for seven years, from 1st May, 1866, at the rate of $3,250 a year, and that on the 7th March, 1868, this lease was extended for another period of seven years, that is to say, up to the 1st May, 1880, the rent for these last seven years being $5,000. In 1868, Steele transferred his interest in the said lease to the Plaintiffs, acting as Trustees for his, Steele\u2019s, creditors. In 1870, the Plaintiffs and Pinsoneault passed the acte d'accord in question. By this deed the lease of November 1st, 1868, of this building, until the first of May, 1880, was cancelled, and a fresh lease of it made by Pinsoneault to one Gerriken for the unexpired term, that is to say, up to the first May, 1880, at the rate of $6,000 a year. It was agreed that the fixtures and furniture then in the building should remain during Gerriken's lease. Pinsoneault agreed to pay to the Plaintiffs whatever he should receive from the tenant beyond $5,000 a year. In 1873 this building was burnt, with a large portion of the furniture. Pinsoneault received his insurance on his property, and the Plaintiffs received $3,223 for insurance on furniture, as well as another sum of $791, by the sale of furniture, saved from the fire. The lease to Gerriken was terminated by the said fire, and was subsequently annulled by a judgment of the Superior Court. Pinsoneault expended $10,292 in repairing the building, and leased it to Linton, Popham & Co., for $6,000 a year, from October, 1873. The Plaintiffs have received their proportion of what Pinsoneault had been paid up to the time of the fire, but now claim an account of what he has received since the fire, both from Gerriken and from Linton, Popham & Co., above $5,000 a year. To the Plaintiffs' demand, the Defendants have pleaded that they have received nothing from Gerriken since the fire, and that, the lease to Gerriken having terminated by the fire, the Plaintiffs were not entitled to any portion of the monies received by them, the Defendants, since.\nI think that the Plantiffs, under the circumstances, have no claim against the Defendants. They have received over $4,000 for the furniture and fixtures which were in the building at the time of the fire. Though summoned to do so, they refused to replace in the said building an amount of furniture equal to that which stood therein before the fire. They have treated the lease to Gerriken as terminated by the fire. I do not see how they can now claim from the defendants $1,000 a year on a property on which Pinsoneault has expended $2,000 more than he received to secure a new tenant. Pinsoneault has taken back his property, the Plaintiffs their furniture, and the contract between the parties has been put an end to by a contingency not provided for.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dissmissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants : A. & W. Robertson.\nSolicitor for Respondents : Edmund Barnard.\n[1] 3 L. C. Jur. 119.\n[2] 8 L. C. R. 214\n[3] 10L. C. B. 304\n"

B.)\nL., manager of the Bank of B. N. A., a foreign banking corporation, having a branch in the city of Saint John, derived from such business during the fiscal year of 1875 an income of $46,000. but, during the same period, sustained losses in its business beyond that amount. The Bank, having made no gain from said business, disputed the corporation's authority to assess them under 22 Vic., c. 37, 31 Vic., c. 36, and 34 Vic. c. 18, on an income of $46,000.\nHeld: That under the Acts of Assembly relating to the assessing of rates and taxes in the city of Saint John, foreign banking corporations doing business in Saint John are liable to be taxed on the gross income received by them during the fiscal year; and that L. had been properly assessed. (Henry, J., dissenting.)\nAppeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick pronounced on a question submitted to that court under a special case.\nSpecial case stated for the opinion of the court:\n\"1st. The Bank of British North America now is, and in, and prior and subsequent to the year 1875, was a corporation established in London, England, out of the limits of the Province of New Brunswick.\n\"2nd. The said bank, in and prior to said year 1875, had, and has since had, and now has an office or place of business within the city of Saint John, in the Province of New Brunswick.\n\"3rd. In and prior to said year 1875, Thomas Maclellan was the Manager of the said bank in the said city of Saint John, and carried on for said bank within the said city the business of banking by discounting notes and buying and selling exchange.\n\"4th. John P. Lawless is now the Manager of said bank in the said city of Saint John, and carries on business for said Bank within said city.\n\"5th. The fiscal year of the said bank, preceding the making up of the annual assessment for the city of Saint John for the present year 1876, commenced on the first day of January and ended on the 31st day of December, in the year 1875, both days inclusive.\n\"6th. The said bank, during the said fiscal year, sustained losses from the business transacted by it within the said city during said fiscal year, and on the whole year's business of the said fiscal year the said bank, in consequence of said losses, made no gain or profit, and none was made or received by or for said bank during said fiscal year.\n\"7th. But for the losses made by the bank in said fiscal year, arising during that year out of the business of the said bank within the said city, the income derived from such business in said year would have amounted to forty-six thousand dollars; but the losses sustained by said bank on its business in said city during said fiscal year exceeded that amount, and left the bank a heavy loser on its business of said year within said city.\n\"8th. The above-named James Sullivan, John Wilson, and Uriah Drake are assessors of taxes for the city of Saint John for the present year.\n\"9th. The said assessors have assessed the said John P. Lawless, as Manager of said bank, in the present year in the sum of one thousand seven hundred and twenty-five dollars, for taxes claimed by the said assessors, to be payable by the said bank on forty-six thousand dollars income during the said fiscal year.\n\"10th. The bank claim that the income on which the bank is liable to be assessed is the gain, if any, received by said bank from the whole business of the fiscal year, and that as the losses of the business in the said city of said fiscal year exceeded all the profits which the bank, but for said losses, would have made, the bank, in fact, made no gain from said business within said city during said fiscal year, and therefore received no income from said business, and are not liable to be assessed as aforesaid.\n11th. It is agreed between the assessors and the said John P. Lawless, as Manager of the said bank, to submit to the court the question whether, upon the facts as above stated, the bank or its manager are, or are not, liable to be assessed as aforesaid in the said sum of one thousand seven hundred and twenty-five dollars, under the Acts of Assembly relating to the assessing of rates and taxes in the city of Saint John. If the court find in the affirmative, the assessment is to stand; if in the negative, the said assessment is to be set aside, altered or varied, so as to make it conform to the decision of the Court upon the question submitted.\"\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Judge Fisher dissenting, decided in the affirmative.\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., for Appellant:\u2014\nThe 12th section of the Assessment Act, 1859, provides that rates are to be levied and raised by an equal rate upon the value of the real estate situate in the city, and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants whereever the same may be, and also upon the amount of income or emolument derived from any office, place, occupation, profession, or employment whatsoever within the Province, and not from real or personal estate, of the inhabitants of the said city, including persons made or declared to be residents or inhabitants by any Act or Acts of Assembly now or hereafter to be in force relating to the imposition of rates, and also upon the capital stock, income or other thing of joint stock companies or corporations as hereinafter provided.\nThe 14th section provides that all joint stock companies or corporations shall be assessed under this Act in like manner as individuals.\nThe 15th section provides that the agent or manager of any joint stock company or corporation, established abroad or out of the limits of this Province, who shall carry on business for such company in the city of Saint John, shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant upon the amount of income received by him as such agent.\nThe last section was subsequently repealed and new provisions enacted by 31 Vic., c. 36, sec. 4, and 34 Vic., c. 18.\nThe word \"income\" means gain from property, labor and skill; so defined in Imperial and Worcester's dictionaries.\nBut we have an interpretation given to the term \"income,\" by the Legislature in Act 38 Vic., c. 6.\nIf the contention of Respondents is right, then nothing could be deducted, not even expenditures, and the agent would be taxed in his representative capacity, and also taxed on that portion being his salary in his personal capacity.\nIt is said that, because the agents of fire insurance companies are to make returns of the net profits, etc., therefore the return to be made by other companies of \"income,\" must mean something different from \"net profits,\" and that, because it is to mean something different, it must mean all the receipts without reference to expenditures; but the circumstance is overlooked that fire insurance companies are not to be assessed upon their whole income, but only on part, and this affords an explanation of the return required of fire insurance companies, viz., \"of the net profits, etc.,\" because it is by this return that the assessors are to determine what is to be deemed the income of that portion of the business which is made ratable.\nMr. Kaye, Q. C., followed on the part of the Appellant:\u2014\nThe meaning of the terms used by the Legislature has to be ascertained.\nThe first term is the word \"income.\" This word has a well understood meaning, and as applied to the business of a year, it can have but one meaning, viz.: the gain on the whole year's business. It is what the business has gained at the end of the year over what it had at the beginning. In this case the bank has to make a return of \"the income for the fiscal year.\" What is the meaning of the fiscal year. It means that then the bank could ascertain the balance of profit earned.\nAll moneys necessarily paid in earning the salary or profit are to be deducted before ascertaining the income. You cannot take the capital to make the income. An agent could not return that he had made any income when he had actually used part of the capital. This is the ordinary meaning of the word \"income.\" If you take the meaning of the word \"income\" as meaning all the money that comes in without regard to what goes out, then, as regards a bank, you deprive the word of meaning. But, if you say the word \"income\" means the \"profit that comes in,\" then this, having to be ascertained at the end of fiscal year, must be the balance remaining after deducting what has been paid out. If the word used is not ambiguous,\u2014and the word \"income\" is not, before you can limit or control it you must have express words for that purpose.\nWhile there may be gross profits and net profits, there cannot be gross income and net income of a year.\nLocal banks are taxed on nominal capital; foreign banks on their profits.\nHow are we to determine whether it is a disadvantage to the local bank to be taxed on its capital? It may be an advantage in some years. At any rate, we have no figures upon which to base any argument, or to arrive at any result. We must, therefore, come back to the terms used by the Legislature in the Statute. The word \"income\" must mean the gain made by the bank and returned to the head office as such, at the end of the fiscal year. If the word is plain, is there anything in the proviso which cuts down the meaning. The words net profits are not used to distinguish that term from \"income,\" but for a different object, viz., to limit the taxation on insurance companies to a portion of its business. Because, in the proviso, \"net profits\" is used, is it to be argued that the word \"income\" means gross income, a term which is never used?\nMr. Thomson, Q. C., for Respondents:\u2014\nThe 15th section of the Act of 1859 (22 Vic., cap. 37,) declares that \"The agent or manager of any joint stock company or corporation established abroad, or out of the limits of this Province, who shall carry on business for such company or corporation in the city of Saint John, shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant, upon the amount of income received by him as such agent.\" \"Like manner\" does not limit the mode or system of taxation; they are equivalent to \"likewise,\" The return is to be of \"the whole amount of income received during the fiscal year.\" If the agent had returned that he had received no income, he would have committed perjury. The words \"whole amount of income\" cannot be synonymous with \"net profits.\" The word \"whole\" excludes the idea of net.\nBut the proviso to 15th section clearly shows that the Legislature knew the difference between income and net income. They used \"income,\" not as synonymous with, but as designedly contra-distinguished from \"net profits.\"\nSec. 4, 31st Vic., c. 26, did not re-enact the proviso as to insurance companies. As this was, no doubt, an oversight by which insurance companies were likely to suffer, the Legislature passed the Act of 1871 (34 Vic., c. 18), which, after reciting that doubts had arisen whether under the wording of the fourth section of the Act of 1868 (31 Vic., c. 38), \"so far as the same relates to agents or managers of fire and marine insurance companies, established abroad or out of the limits of the Province, who shall carry on business within the city of Saint John,\" &c., enacted that the fourth section of 31 Vic., c. 38, should not be applicable to such companies; and by section two such managers or agents were declared to be assessable on \"net profits.\" Thus, again, the Legislature made a clear distinction between \"income\" and \"net profits,\" and made such distinction in favor of insurance companies only.\nMr. Weldon says, according to our contention, the manager would be taxed twice. But is this different from the position of the Bank of New Brunswick? But this point has never been raised, and is not part of the special case.\nAttention has been called to 38 Vic., c. 36, 1875, in which it is alleged that a definition has been given to the word \"income,\" which suits their views. I submit it does not; but I submit we have nothing to do with this Act. It relates to the Province, except Saint John. But the definition of word \"income\" in this Act (annual profits or gain) does not carry us any further.\nI contend the word \"income\" means income without deducting expenditure. Cooley on Taxation[1], and cases there cited; Attorney General v. Black[2]; The Queen v. The Commissioners of the Port of Southampton, &c.[3].\nThese Appellants do not pay upon their capital; and, if they succeed in their contention they would pay no taxes at all, although receiving the benefit of all municipal regulations. It is said, however, that their clerks pay on their income; but so do the clerks of the local banks. Where they can tax the corpus, they do so; where they cannot get at the corpus, they tax the income; and they tax the gross income because they believe it to represent the amount of capital employed. The term \"income\" ordinarily signifies gross income. You cannot interpret it, as if the word net or clear was before it. But when the Legislature uses the words \"whole amount of income,\" and also words \"net profits,\" it makes it clear that the word cannot be so interpreted.\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThe Bank of British North America, a corporation established in London, England, out of the limits of the Province of New Brunswick, carried on, through its Manager, in the city of Saint John, the business of banking.\nThe fiscal year of the said bank, preceding the making up of the annual assessment for the city of Saint John for the year 1876, commenced on the first day of January and ended on the 31st day of December, 1875, both days inclusive. The bank during such fiscal year sustained losses from the business transacted within said city during such fiscal year, and on the whole year's business, and in consequence of such losses made no gain or profit. But for such losses the income derived from the business of that year would have amounted to $46,000, but the losses sustained during that year exceeded that amount, and left the bank a heavy loser on the business of the year.\nPlaintiffs were the assessors of taxes for the city of Saint John for the year 1876, and, as such, assessed the Defendant, as Manager of said bank, in the sum of $1,725, for taxes claimed by said assessors to be payable by the bank on $46,000 income during the said fiscal year. The bank claims that the income on which the bank is liable to be assessed is the gain, if any, received by the bank from the whole business of the fiscal year, and that, as the losses exceeded all the profits which the bank, but for such losses, would have made, the bank, in fact, made no gain, and so received no income from its business, and, therefore, are not liable to be assessed. The case agreed on by the parties submits to the court, as the only case for its determination, whether on these facts the bank or its Manager are, or are not, liable to be assessed in said sum of $1,725, under the Acts of Assembly relating to the assessing of rates and taxes in the city of Saint John, and it was agreed that \"if the court find in the affirmative the assessment is to stand, if in the negative, the said assessment is to be set aside, altered or varied, so as to make it conform to the decision of the court upon the question submitted.\"\nThis case was argued before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and that court decided that the Defendant, as Manager, was liable to be assessed $1,725 for taxes, as claimed by the assessors to be payable by said bank on $46,000 income during the fiscal year of said bank, preceding the making up of the annual assessment for the said city for the year 1876, under said Acts of Assembly, and the assessment as stated was to stand.\nFrom this decision the Plaintiffs now appeal.\nThe Statutes of the Province of New Brunswick, by virtue of which assessments are made in the city of Saint John, are the 22 Vic., c. 37, intituled \"An Act relating to the levying, assessing and collecting of rates in the city of Saint John,\" and the 31 Vic., c. 36, and the 34 Vic., c. 18, in addition and amendment thereof. The first principle we find put forward, in the Act of 1859, as the basis of taxation, is equality,\u2014\"all rates levied or imposed upon the said city shall be raised by an equal rate\" upon the value of the real estate situate within the city; upon the personal estate of the inhabitants wherever the same may be; upon the amount of income or emolument derived from any place, occupation, profession, or employment whatsoever within the province; but not from real or personal estate; and, as to all local joint stock companies or corporations, upon the capital stock, income or other thing of such joint stock companies or corporations; and as to joint stock companies or corporations established abroad, or out of the limits of the province, the agent or manager, who shall carry on business for any such company or corporation in the city of Saint John, shall be rated and assessed, in like manner as any inhabitant, upon the amount of income received by him as such agent; and such agent, when required, is to furnish a true and correct statement in writing, under oath, setting forth \"the whole amount of income received in the city of Saint John during the fiscal year of the company, preceding the making up of the annual assessment.\" With respect to insurance companies abroad, the assessment is to be taken on a three year's average of the yearly \"net profits\" on insurance of property within the city; and the agents are to furnish the assessors with a statement in writing of the aggregate of such \"net profits\" for the three years next preceding that in which the assessment is to be made.\nIn this and in the subsequent acts, when any departure from the principle of an equal rate is permitted, the exemptions are specially provided for, as in sec. 14 of the 22 Vic., c. 37, which declares that \"nothing shall render liable to assessment the real or personal estate, income or other thing of the city corporation, or of any religious, charitable or literary institution.\" And so in sec. 16 of the 22 Vic., c. 37, and sec. 5 of 31 Vic., c. 36, which relieve stockholders of any joint stock company or corporation from liability to be rated, in respect of any property or income derived from such company or corporation; and as in the 14th sec. of 31 Vic., c. 36, which provides \"that nothing in the Act shall extend to authorize any assessment on any person or agent for the freight or earning of any vessel, steamboat or ship entering or clearing the port of Saint John.\" So also in the 6th sec. of the 34 Vic., c. 8, which wholly exempts life assurance companies or associations doing business in the city of Saint John, or their agents or managers, from taxation in said city. In each of these Acts we have a very clear distinction indicated between \"the whole amount of income\" in the case of nonresident corporations generally, and \"the net profits\" or \"net proceeds,\" as the term is in the 5th sec. of the 34 Vic., c. 18, on insurance of property within the city by assurance companies established abroad. This Act of 1859, though added to and amended by the 31 Vic., c. 36, is not interfered with as to the equality required to be observed in levying the rates, and though sec. 15 is repealed, sec. 4 of 31 Vic., c 36, enacted in lieu thereof, in like manner declares that corporations established abroad, or out of the limits of the province shall be rated and assessed on the income received, and to enable the assessors to rate such companies or corporations, the manager is in like manner to furnish under oath in writing the whole amount of income received during the fiscal year, as in the Act of 1859. In this Act of 31 Vic. there is no reference to insurance companies, and, as the whole of section 15 of the Act of 1859 was repealed, the proviso contained in it in their favor was also repealed. This was evidently not intended by the Legislature, and to make this apparent the 34 Vic., c. 18, was passed. This Act, after reciting that doubts had arisen as to the construction to be put upon the 4th sec. of the 31 Vic., c. 36, so far as the same relates to the agents or managers of fire and marine insurance companies established abroad, or out of the limits of the province, who shall carry on business within the city of Saint John, or who shall have an office or place of business within the city for such companies, and that it was desirable that such doubts should be removed, proceeds to enact that the said fourth section shall not apply to agents of any fire or marine insurance companies so established, and so carrying on business, but that such agent or manager should be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant, upon the amount of net profits made by him, as such agent, from premiums received on all insurances effected by him, in case of fire insurance, on property situate within the limits of the city, and, in case of marine insurances, wherever the subject matter of insurance may be; and, when required by the assessors, such agent is to furnish to them, within 30 days, a true and correct statement in writing under oath, setting forth \"the whole amount of net profits\" made by such company within the city of Saint John, from such premiums so received during the fiscal year preceding the making up of the annual assessment.\nHere we see the principle of a three years' average abandoned,\" and the assessment confined to \"the net profits of the fiscal year preceding the making up of the annual assessment,\" as distinguished from \"the whole amount of income\" received for all other companies and corporations, during the fiscal year preceding the making up of the annual assessment. Now, if all outside companies and corporations were to be assessed only on net profits, what doubts could arise as to marine associations, or what necessity for any new enactment as to them, as they are to be assessed on all the business they do within the city of Saint John, wherever the subject matter of insurances may be. Inferentially, then, we have this enactment recognizing a clear distinction between \"the whole amount of income\" and \"the whole amount of net profits.\"\nNow, it is important to see how joint stock companies or corporations, other than those established abroad, or out of the limits of the Province, are dealt with.\nBy the 14 sec. of the 22 Vic., c. 37,\nAll joint stock companies or corporations shall be assessed in like manner as individuals, and for the purpose of such assessment, the president, or any agent or manager of such joint stock company or corporation, shall be deemed to be owner of the real and personal estate, capital, stock and assets of such company or corporation, and shall be dealt with, and may be proceeded against accordingly; the principal place of carrying on the business and operations of any such company or corporation shall be deemed to be the place of inhabitancy of such company or corporation, and of such president, agent or manager, and such president, agent or manager shall, in regard to the real and personal estate, income or other thing of such company or corporation, be assessed separately and distinctly from any other assessment to which he may be liable, &c.\"\nAnd, as we have seen, the individual stockholders are exempt in respect thereof. Under this section, it is clear that the real and personal estate, capital stock and assets of all corporations are liable to assessment, wholly irrespective of their gains or losses during the fiscal year. Their losses may have equalled or exceeded their gains, but that would not exempt them from taxation, for the law makes no distinction in the assessment on real and personal estate, whether it is actually productive or not; on the contrary, it is declared by sec. 12 of 22 Vic., c. 37, that\u2014\nFor the purposes of this Act, the value of all real and personal estate and joint stocks, shall be deemed and taken to be, and shall be put down at one-fifth of the actual worth thereof as nearly as the same may be ascertained[4].\nIf foreign banks, then, can do business in the city of Saint John, and their losses, when made, are to exempt them, in whole or in part, from taxation, what a large pecuniary advantage is conferred on them over the domestic corporations, and how entirely in their case is ignored the legislative declaration that all rates levied and imposed in the city shall be raised by an equal rate. While, therefore, not only local banks and all other local corporations are taxed, wholly irrespective of profits, and whether the business of the fiscal year was profitable or otherwise, but likewise all resident inhabitants are thus taxed on all real and personal estate and joint stock, without reference to productiveness or unproductiveness, upon what principle of equality or uniformity in the taxation can foreign banks ask to be assessed only on \"net profits,\" and to be exempt from all taxation in those years when their business may happen not to furnish any net profits, while the actual value of the property of every other home corporation and every citizen bears its equal share of the city burthens. While perfect equality in the imposition of taxes cannot, perhaps, be always expected, and while we cannot look for such a perfect system of taxation as will not, under certain circumstances, produce unequal results, and, perhaps, injustice, we may fairly infer the Legislature contemplated equality and uniformity so far as practicable; and, I think, on the face of these acts, we have indicated a policy of equality and justice, and, as far as possible, a uniform rate on all property of the same description, and not such invidious exemptions and favoritism as would be the result if the defendants' contention should prevail; and when exemptions are claimed, and that this policy has been departed from, we have a right to expect that an intention so to exempt would be made apparent by clear and unambiguous language, as we have seen has been done in the cases before referred to; and, without such a clear indication of the will of the Legislature, I do not think a legal construction should be adopted that will compel one corporation or person, or one subject of taxation, directly to contribute, while other corporations or persons, and other subjects of taxation of precisely the same class, are entirely exempt.\nI look on this tax as, in effect, a tax upon the capital of the bank employed in the city, as it would not be fair to tax the whole capital of the mother Bank, and it might be very difficult, if not impossible, to fix the amount of capital employed by the branch bank or agency, which may fluctuate from week to week.\nThe Legislature, not being able to get at the amount of capital to be taxed, appear to have adopted the principle of taking the gross income, as the basis for computing the tax, as showing the volume of business transacted during the year, and, as it were, approximately representing the capital employed generally throughout the fiscal year, thereby practically taxing the property or assets of the bank by the income derived therefrom, and thereby compelling these foreign corporations to contribute to municipal expenditure, and so bear their fair share for the valuable privileges they enjoy, and place them on an equal footing, as near as may be, with domestic institutions of a similar character. I cannot bring myself to think, that the Legislature ever contemplated that though private individuals and all local corporations should contribute to the municipal burthens, regardless of gain or loss, foreign banks alone should be a privileged class, and though enjoying, in common with similar home institutions, the protection and advantages derivable from municipal expenditure, they should, at seasons of depression, when net profits may not be earned, but when funds are generally most needed, escape all municipal burthens.\nIn another point of view, this tax as imposed may, I think, be said to be more in the nature of a franchise than a property tax. One peculiarity of taxes of this description is that they depend on the amount of business transacted, and the extent to which they have exercised the privileges granted in their charter without reference to the value of their property. Numerous instances of this description of tax are to be found in the American reports and works on taxation, such as a tax on the amount of deposits in lieu of all other taxes. But, apart from all this, I think the tax is imposed by the express language of the Statute.\nBy the 12th sec. of the 22 Vic., cap. 37, it is declared that:\nAll rates levied or imposed upon the said city shall be raised by an equal rate upon the value of the real estate situate in the city or district to be taxed, and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants wherever the same may be, and also upon the amount of income or emolument derived from any office, place, occupation, profession or employment whatsoever within the Province, and not from real or personal estate of the inhabitants of the said city, including persons made or declared to be residents or inhabitants by any Act or Acts of Assembly now or hereafter to be in force relating to the impositions of rates, and also upon the capital stock, income, or other thing of joint stock companies or corporations as hereinafter provided.\nBy the 15th sec. repealed by 31 Vic., c. 36, which substitutes other provisions:\nThe agent or manager of any joint stock company or corporation established abroad or out of the limits of this Province, who shall carry on business for such company or corporation in the city of Saint John, shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant upon the amount of income received by him as such agent; and for the purpose of enabling the assessors to rate such company or corporation, the said agent or manager shall, when required in writing by the assessors so to do, furnish to them a true and correct statement in writing under oath, setting forth the whole amount of income received in the city of Saint John during the fiscal year, (of said companies) preceding the making up of the annual assesssment. * * * For the purposes of this section the agent or manager shall be deemed the owner of such income and shall be dealt with accordingly.\nProvided, however, that the assessment on insurance Companies, or the agent or manager of any Insurance Company established abroad, shall be taken on a three years' average of the yearly net profits on insurance of property situate within the said city, or for the whole period for which they may have been doing business in said city, not exceeding three years, such average to be obtained as follows, &c. * *\nProvided further, that life insurance companies or their agencies shall be free from assessment under this Act.\nSection 16, repealed by 31 Vic., c. 36, sec. 5, enacted that:\nNo stockholder of any joint stock company or corporation liable to be rated under this Act shall be assessed in respect of any property or income derived from such company or corporation.\nIt has been very strongly and very ingeniously contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the term \"income\" is not to be interpreted as meaning the gross income or receipts by the agent, but the gain or emolument derived by the agent during the year from the whole business of his principal in the city. That the term \"income\" has acquired a technical meaning, and is used to signify \"gain or profit,\" and that this is also the popular meaning of the word \"income.\" I think the term \"whole income\" must be construed to mean the gross income or revenue received by the bank on the business of the fiscal year preceding the assessment; or, in other words, the total amount the bank earned without reference to any outgoings; that the words \"whole income\" must be read in their ordinary meaning, as the whole incomings of the bank as opposed to net profits, net earnings, net income, clear income, or clear gain. The Legislature has in this Statute clearly distinguished between whole income and net profits, and has so clearly used those terms as contra-distinguished, that to read them as synonymous words would be quite unjustifiable.\nThe income of the bank is its discounts, interest, premium on exchange, &c., and this is earned when received, and forms the income of the bank. If the bank makes bad debts on any business or transactions of the current year, or operations entered into in past years, that is a loss pro tanto of capital. This they may make up by borrowing money, or by calls on the stockholders, or so much of the lost capital may be replaced from \"income,\" but it was in either case the capital invested that was really lost, not the income. In making up a profit and loss account the bank would necessarily be debited with all interest paid, losses made, expenses incurred, or disbursements, in fact all \"outgoings,\" and credited with all interest, earnings or gains, and the balance would be the net loss, or the net profit, of the year, but certainly would not be the \"income\" of the year.\nThe income, if applied to make up loss of capital by unfortunate investments, fire, or other causes, would be in effect an addition to capital, to be again employed as capital in the business of the bank. As was held in Forder v. Handyside[5], where defendants, who were assessed on the net profits, had, in accordance with the articles of association, set apart a sum of money for depreciation of buildings, fixed plant and machinery, and claimed, in making a return of the annual profits or gains, to deduct this amount, as the amount written off for depreciation of buildings, fixed plant and machinery; and, though a majority of the Commissioners were of opinion that persons in trade were equitably entitled to write off from their profits each year a sum for depreciation, and that the amount claimed was fair and reasonable, and decided in favor of the defendants, on a case stated for the opinion of the Court, it was held that such a deduction was contrary to the Statute, as the amount set aside was, in effect, an addition to capital.\nIn Regina v. Commissioners of the Port of Southampton[6], Bramwell, J., said:\nIt turns on the meaning of the word \"income\" in sec. 124 of 6 Wm. 4, c. cxxix. Does it mean all or four-fifths of what the Defendant received from the sources therein mentioned? I cannot reason myself into a doubt on the subject, though I must entertain much in deference to the opinion of those who think differently. \"Income\" is that which comes in, not that which comes in less an outgoing. The fifth the Defendants were liable to pay to the Plaintiffs was an \"outgoing,\" not a diminution of income.\nAnd Lord Chelmsford says:\nIt appears to me the word \"income\" here means the total amount of the rates and duties receivable by the Commissioners, without regard to any outgoings to which it may be subject.\nAnd, after stating reasons that had been assigned, says:\nOne can hardly suppose that these considerations were at all in the view of the Legislature, and led to the use of the word \"income\" in a different sense from its ordinary meaning.\nAnd in Angell & Ames[7]:\nThe moneyed corporations of the State of New York, deriving income and profit, are liable to taxation on the capital, and it is held that, in ascertaining the sum to be inserted in the assessment roll, no regard is to be had, either to accumulations or losses, but only to the amount of capital stock paid in and secured to be paid, and that the word \"income\" means that which is received from the investment of capital, without reference to outgoing expenses; and the term profits means gain made upon any investment when both receipts and payments are taken into account.\nWhere a moneyed corporation is liable to be assessed on the whole nominal amount paid in and secured to be paid (after deducting statutory exemptions,) no deduction is to be made for losses of capital, nor for debts due.\nBurroughs on taxation[8]:\n\"Income.\" The gross revenue of an individual, whether it arises from rents of real estate, interest on money loaned, dividends on stocks, or compensation for personal services rendered in any trade, profession, or occupation, constitutes his \"income.\" * * * But such tax is never imposed upon all persons, nor upon the gross income, it is usually upon the annual income of persons, in excess of a certain amount, allowing deductions of various kinds.\nBurroughs on taxation[9]:\nWhere the tax is imposed on the annual net earning or income of a corporation, the income, after deducting necessary expenses, is the amount to be taxed; that portion of income devoted to repayment of capital is included as a part of the income and liable to the tax, A tax on net earnings or income, is on the product of business, deducting expenses only; no allowance is made for capital exhausted or waste of capital in business. But if the tax be upon \"profits or income,\" it will not be construed to mean net profits or income.\nA good deal of stress was laid on the words of the Statute, which says that corporations are to be assessed in like manner as any inhabitant. I think this provision \"in like manner as any inhabitant\" must be read as fixing merely the liability to be rated and assessed, and the liability being so established, then the law declares how the tax is to be levied, and makes provisions in reference thereto wholly different from those applicable to inhabitants. Whereas, if the words \"in like manner\" were to be held to apply, not only to the liability, but to the mode of levying the rate or assessment, then the clause should have terminated at the word \"inhabitant,\" otherwise this incongruity would arise, that while in one part of the clause it is provided that joint stock company shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant, the subsequent part of the section provides an entirely different mode, and whereby the assessment is to be on the whole amount of income received, a term entirely distinct from that used in reference to inhabitants.\nIn view of the policy of the act and the wording of the act, on principle and on authority, I think the decision of the majority of the Judges of the Court below was correct; that the Defendants have no cause to complain, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, J., concurred with the Chief Justice.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLa question soulev\u00e9e par le special case soumis du consentement des deux parties pour la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Inf\u00e9rieure, \u00e9tait de savoir si la Banque British North America, corporation \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, mais ayant un bureau d'affaires dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, N. B., peut \u00eatre, d'apr\u00e8s le \"St John City Assessment Act 1859\" et ses amendements, tax\u00e9e sur le total de son revenu, ou seulement sur le montant des profits nets, r\u00e9alis\u00e9s apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction faite des pertes subies durant l'ann\u00e9e.\nLa 1\u00e8re sec. de l'acte ci-dessus cit\u00e9 impose \u00e0 la Corporation de la cit\u00e9 de St. John l'obligation de fixer chaque ann\u00e9e, pas plus tard que le 1er avril, le montant qu'il sera n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9lever pour les besoins de la cit\u00e9 pendant l'ann\u00e9e. La 12\u00e8me sec. d\u00e9clare que la taxe dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John sera r\u00e9partie d'apr\u00e8s un taux \u00e9gal: lo. Sur la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobili\u00e8re et immobli\u00e8re; 2o. Sur le montant du revenu ou \u00e9moluments de tout office, place ou occupation, etc.; 3o. Sur le capital, revenu ou autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des compagnies \u00e0 fonds social ou corporations tel que ci-apr\u00e8s pourvu. Pour les fins du pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de ces taxes, la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re est fix\u00e9e au 1\/5 de sa valeur actuelle (r\u00e9elle).\nLa 14\u00e8me sec. d\u00e9clare que les compagnies \u00e0 fonds social seront cotis\u00e9es de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les individus. (in like manner as individuals.)\nLa 15\u00e8me sec. d\u00e9clare que l'agent ou g\u00e9rant d'une compagnie \u00e0 fonds social ou corporation \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, ou en dehors des limites de la province, faisant affaires pour telle compagnie ou corporation dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, sera cotis\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que tout autre habitant sur le montant du revenu par lui per\u00e7u en sa qualit\u00e9 d'agent,\nShall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant upon the amount of income received by him as such agent.\nLa m\u00eame section oblige les repr\u00e9sentants de ces institutions \u00e0 donner aux cotiseurs, s'ils en sont requis, un \u00e9tat correct et sous serment du montant total du revenu per\u00e7u dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, durant la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e fiscale, pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la confection du r\u00f4le annuel de cotisation.\nUn proviso d\u00e9clare que les compagnies d'assurances ne seront cotis\u00e9es que d'apr\u00e8s une moyenne des profits nets r\u00e9alis\u00e9s sur les affaires faites dans la cit\u00e9 pendant les trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Le m\u00eame proviso exempte les compagnies d'assurance sur la vie et leurs agences des taxes impos\u00e9es par cet acte.\nLa sec. 16, exempte de taxes les parts des actionnaires dans les compagnies cotis\u00e9es en vertu de cet acte.\nLa 15\u00e8me sec. de l'Assessment Act de 1859 qui avait d\u00e9fini les diff\u00e9rents modes de taxer les compagnies mentionn\u00e9es plus haut, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e par la 31 Vict., ch. 36, sec. 4. Mais cette derni\u00e8re section, qui comprend de nouvelles cat\u00e9gories de personnes et de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, qui ne l'\u00e9taient pas dans la section r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e, conserve dans leur entier les dispositions de la dite section 15, quant aux institutions \u00e9trang\u00e8res faisant affaires dans la dite cit\u00e9 de St. John. La seule innovation est que le mot income, y est employ\u00e9 comme s'appliquant \u00e0 toutes les compagnies indistinctement, omettant les mots net profits, qui dans la sec. 15 devaient servir de base pour l'imposition de la taxe sur les compagnies d'assurances.\nL'obligation de fournir un \u00e9tat sous serment, s'il est requis, de tout le revenu per\u00e7u par les agents des compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res est rest\u00e9e la m\u00eame.\nL'omission dans la sec. 4 ci-dessus cit\u00e9e de la distinction faite dans la sec. 15, entre les compagnies tax\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s leur revenu, et celles qui ne l'\u00e9taient que d'apr\u00e8s le montant des profits nets, ayant donn\u00e9 lieu de douter si les compagnies d'assurances jouissaient encore du privil\u00e9ge sp\u00e9cial que leur avait accord\u00e9 la sec. 15, le statut 34 Vict., ch. 18, fut pass\u00e9 pour mettre fin \u00e0 ces doutes. La 1\u00e8re sec. d\u00e9clare que la sec. 4 de 31 Vict., ch. 36, qui avait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ces doutes ne s'appliquera pas aux agents des compagnies d'assurance maritime et contre le feu \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger ou en dehors de la province, faisant affaires dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, ou qui auront un bureau d'affaires dans la dite cit\u00e9 pour telles compagnies.\nLa 2\u00e8me sec remet les agents de ces compagnies dans la position que leur avait faite la sec. 15 (de l'acte de 1859), en d\u00e9clarant qu'ils seront sujets comme tout autre habitant, in like manner as any inhabitant, \u00e0 \u00eatre cotis\u00e9s sur le montant des profits nets, (\"upon the \"amount of net profits made by them\") sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s assur\u00e9es dans les limites de la cit\u00e9. On est donc revenu aux dispositions de la sec. 15, concernant la distinction entre les compagnies d'assurance et les autres compagnies ou corporations \u00e9trang\u00e8res. La sec. 4 qui \u00e9tablit cette distinction doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative des expressions whole income et net profits qui font le sujet de la difficult\u00e9 en cette cause.\nLes citations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes font voir que la l\u00e9gislature a clairement \u00e9tabli diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de compagnies ou corporations, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de chacune desquelles elle a fait des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales quant au mode de les taxer, savoir: 1o. Les compagnies \u00e0 fonds social ou corporations provinciales ayant un bureau d'affaires dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, qui doivent \u00eatre tax\u00e9es (sec. 2) d'apr\u00e8s le montant de leur capital; 2o. Les compagnies \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger ou en dehors de la province faisant affaires dans la cit\u00e9 de St. John, qui doivent \u00eatre tax\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s la sec. 15, sur leur revenu, dont elles doivent d\u00e9clarer le total aux cotiseurs; 3o. Les assurances maritimes et contre le feu tax\u00e9es d'apr\u00e8s un proviso de la m\u00eame section sur le montant des profils nets, r\u00e9alis\u00e9s sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s assur\u00e9es dans les limites de la cit\u00e9; 4o. Les assurances sur la vie que le m\u00eame proviso exempte de toutes taxes.\nLa distinction entre les divers modes de taxer ces diff\u00e9rentes institutions, les unes sur le capital, comme les compagnies ou corporations incorpor\u00e9es dans la province, les autres d'apr\u00e8s le montant de leur revenu entier, et d'autres enfin d'apr\u00e8s le montant de leurs profits nets, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre faite d'une mani\u00e8re plus claire et plus pr\u00e9cise. Les mots \"whole income\" et \"net profits\" comportent en eux-m\u00eames un sens tr\u00e8s clair et qui ne me para\u00eet pas susceptible de laisser aucun doute sur l'intention de la l\u00e9gislature. Ils me paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dessein pour signifier des choses diff\u00e9rentes, et ils doivent ici recevoir la signification que leur ont donn\u00e9e les statuts cit\u00e9s plus haut qui de plus sont conformes \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de ces deux expresssions donn\u00e9e par Cooley on taxation[10]:\nIncome means that which comes in and is received from any business or investment of capital without reference to the outgoing expenditure. Profits, on the other hand, are understood to mean the net gain of any business or investment, taking into account both receipts and payments. Income as applied to the affairs of individuals, expresses the same idea that revenue does when applied to the affairs of government. People v. Supervisors of Niagara[11].\nL'Appelant a pr\u00e9tendu que les expressions in like manner as any other inhabitant, signifiaient que la taxe impos\u00e9e sur les compagnies serait la m\u00eame que celle pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur le revenu des individus,\u2014que le revenu d\u00e9fini, d'apr\u00e8s la sec. 12, 22 Vict., 37, comme suit: Income or emolument derived from any office, place, occupation, profession or employment in the Province, doit s'entendre seulement du revenu net, d\u00e9duction faite des d\u00e9penses et pertes. Cette d\u00e9finition ne d\u00e9finit rien. En employant les mots income or emolument comme synonymes, elle laisse subsister la difficult\u00e9 de savoir si, pour les fins de la taxe, il faut dans l'estimation des revenus d'une place ou d'un office en d\u00e9duire les d\u00e9penses. Elle ne peut par cons\u00e9quent servir de b\u00e2se \u00e0 un argument pour r\u00e9soudre cette difficult\u00e9 puisqu'elle y est sujette elle-m\u00eame. On ne peut non plus s'appuyer sur la d\u00e9finition du mot income donn\u00e9 dans l'Assessment Act de 1875, car cet acte concerne la province du N. B., et ne peut servir \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation des statuts sp\u00e9ciaux concernant la cit\u00e9 de St. John. Il faudrait pour cela y trouver une disposition sp\u00e9ciale qui n'existe pas.\nAu contraire de la pr\u00e9tention de l'Appelant, je crois que les termes in like manner as any other inhabitant n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits que pour signifier que les compagnies ou corporations seraient, comme les individus, soumis \u00e0 l'obligation de payer les taxes, et nullement pour d\u00e9clarer que le m\u00eame taux ou mode de taxer serait applicable dans les deux cas. Ceci me para\u00eet r\u00e9sulter clairement de la sec. 12, d\u00e9clarant que les compagnies ou corporations seraient tax\u00e9es as hereinafter provided. C'est donc aux dispositions sp\u00e9ciales sur ce sujet, qu'il faut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pour conna\u00eetre quel est le mode \u00e9tabli quant aux compagnies o\u00f9 corporations. Ces dispositions particuli\u00e8res, cit\u00e9es plus haut, font voir que les compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res sont soumises \u00e0 un mode particulier qui consiste \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever la taxe sur le total de leur revenu.\nUne interpr\u00e9tation donnant \u00e0 ces corporations le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exemption de payer des taxes, tandis que les banques provinciales y seraient soumises, se trouverait en opposition directe avec la 12\u00e8me clause de l'acte ci-dessus cit\u00e9 d\u00e9clarant que la taxe sera impos\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale\u2014\"equal rate.\" Ne pouvant pas conna\u00eetre au juste le montant du capital employ\u00e9 par les banques \u00e9trang\u00e8res dans leurs agences locales autrement que par le revenu qu'elles en retirent, c'est sans doute pour arriver \u00e0 ne taxer que le montant du capital employ\u00e9 dans ces agences que la loi les oblige \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer leur \"whole income,\" pour servir de b\u00e2se \u00e0 la taxe. De cette mani\u00e8re elles sont atteintes comme les autres banques\u2014et comme elles, tax\u00e9es dans le cas de profit comme dans le cas de pertes, sur le capital employ\u00e9 dans les agences locales. En adoptant cette interpr\u00e9tation, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la justice, conform\u00e9ment au principe exprim\u00e9 dans la sec 12, sont observ\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'institutions du m\u00eame genre, qu'elles soient d'origines provinciales ou \u00e9trang\u00e8res.\nLes raisons ci-dessus expos\u00e9es me paraissant suffisantes pour r\u00e9soudre la question soumise, je ne crois pas devoir entrer dans de plus amples consid\u00e9rations pour justifier la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis venu, savoir: que dans le cas actuel la Banque British North America a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement tax\u00e9e sur le montant entier de son revenu, au lieu de ne l'\u00eatre que sur le montant de ses profits nets.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe Appellant is agent and manager of the Bank of British North America, at the city of Saint John, N. B., and as such was rated under certain assessment acts relating to the said city. By a majority judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, to which he had recourse, the tax upon him was decided to be legal, and from that judgment he appealed to this Court. We have, therefore, to consider the matter as presented by the acts in question, and decide as to his liability to be rated under them.\nBy sec. 12 of 22 Vic., cap. 37:\nAll rates levied or imposed upon the said city shall be raised by an equal rate upon the value of all real estate situate in the city or district to be taxed, and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants wherever the same may be, and also upon the amount of income or emolument derived from any office, place, occupation, profession or employment whatsoever within the Province, except from real or personal estate of the inhabitants of the said city, and, also, upon the capital stock, income, or other thing of joint stock companies or corporations as hereinafter provided. * * * And for the purposes of this act, the value of all real and personal estate shall be put down at one-fifth the actual worth thereof, as nearly as can be ascertained.\nSection 14 provides that:\nAll joint stock companies, or corporations, shall be assessed under this act in like manner as individuals.\nBy section 15:\nThe agent or manager of any joint stock company or corporation established abroad or out of the limits of this Province, who shall carry on business for such company or corporation in the city of Saint John, shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant [which means to the same extent] upon the amount of the income received by him as such agent,\nWith a provision that:\nThe said agent or manager shall, when required in writing by the assessors so to do, furnish to them a true and correct statement under oath setting forth the whole amount of income received in the city of Saint John, during the fiscal year of said companies preceding the making of the annual assessments. * * * Provided, however, that the assessment on insurance companies, or the agent or manager of any insurance company established abroad, shall be taken on a three years' average of the yearly net profits on insurance of property situated within the said city, or for the whole period they may have been doing business in said city, not exceeding three years.\nBy virtue, then, of those Acts the assessment was based on a rate of one-fifth the ascertained value of all real estate in the city, and upon personal estate of inhabitants, wherever the same might be, and of stock of resident joint stock companies or corporations. In the view I take of this case, depending as it does upon the construction to be put on sec. 4 of 31 Vic., cap. 36, taken in connection with the repealed sec. 15 of 22 Vic., c. 37 and 34 Vic., c. 18, it matters not what rates the Legislature imposed upon resident joint stock companies or corporations; but I refer to the fact in passing; and it may be useful to remember that such is the case when discussing the argument founded on the inequality in the rate in years when the net income of non-resident companies or corporations, as it is termed, should be nothing, or very much too small, to equal the taxes paid by resident companies or corporations when rated on a different basis. We have not, from any evidence before us, the means to determine in that way what the Legislature meant when using the term \"income,\" and, if we had, the Legislature has forbidden us to do it. By sections 14 and 15 of 22 Vic., c. 37, the Legislature has directed that the resident, as well as the non-resident corporations, shall be rated as individuals, the former on one-fifth of the value of their capital stock, and the latter on their income. I feel, therefore, wholly unauthorized, because forbidden, to inquire into any alleged inequality of taxation as between the resident and non-resident companies or corporations. That was a matter for the Legislature and not for us. If, indeed, there could be any doubt as to the meaning of the words, or if there was no provision assimilating the assessment on non-resident companies or corporations, we then, but only then, would be, not only allowed, but bound to draw an argument as to the meaning and effect of the term \"income,\" when used and applied in reference to non-resident companies or corporations which are rated on a principle different from that applied to resident ones. When the Legislature says the non-resident companies or corporations shall be rated in like manner as individuals, upon what theory of construction or evidence can I say it did not mean so, and that a different principle should be interposed or substituted? For these reasons, I cannot feel authorized to found my judgment upon definitions founded on principles applicable to companies or corporations, when inapplicable to the cases of individuals. I consider, therefore, my duty is to ascertain the intentions of the Legislature when applying the term \"income\" to an individual, and upon that proposition to a great extent my judgment is founded.\nTo arrive at a result we must ascertain how the term \"income\" is used in regard to an individual.\nThe 12th sec. of 22 Vic., c. 37, under which the tax is imposed, employs the words, \"and also upon the amount of income or emolument derived from any office, place, occupation, profession, or employment whatsoever within the Province,\" excepting income or emolument from real or personal estate of the inhabitants of the city.\nThat \"income,\" when employed as it is in the section, is made synonymous with \"emolument\" is an undeniable proposition, which needs no authorities or arguments to sustain. \"Income\" cannot, therefore, be deemed to mean anything which \"emolument\" cannot, in the fair and ordinary acceptation of the term, apply to.\nWhat then is the meaning of \"emolument\" in its usual and ordinary acceptation. It comes from the participle (emolumentum) of the latin verb emolo, molo to grind, originally meaning toll taken for grinding. It is now, according to the Imperial Dictionary and other reliable authorities, understood: \"1. The profit arising from office or employment\u2014that which is received as a compensation for services, or which is annexed to the possession of office, as salary, fees and perquisites. 2. Profit, advantage, gains in general;\" and according to the same dictionary, \"emolumental\" means \"producing profit, useful, profitable, advantageous.\" According to Webster's dictionary emolument means: \"1. The profit arising from office or employment\u2014that which is received as a compensation for services, or that which is annexed to the possession of office, as salary, fees and perquisites. 2. Profit, advantage, gain in general\u2014that which promotes the public or private good. 'Emolumental,' producing profit, useful, profitable, advantageous.\" \"Emolument\" is thus, in the first definition in both authorities cited, declared to be \"the profit arising from office or employment,\" and not merely the gross amount of salary, fees or perquisites, but the balance remaining after deduction of the necessary expenses paid out in earning the salary, fees or perquisites.\nIn support of the principle just stated, I can confidently refer to the Imperial Income Tax Statute, 16th and 17th Vic., cap. 34. It is intituled \"An Act for granting to Her Majesty duties on profits arising from property, professions, trades and offices,\" and in the heading of each page it is called \"Income Tax.\" Sec. 2, schedule E, provides that \"every public office or employment of profit\" shall be charged. Sec. 51, however, provides for the reduction \"in respect of any public office or employment, where the person exercising the same is necessarily obliged to incur the same \"of the expenses of travelling, or of keeping and maintaining a horse, or otherwise \"to lay out and expend money wholly and necessarily in the performance of the duties of his office or employment.\" The true meaning of the term emoluments, as applied to such an office or employment, either with or without any provision, such as in the last section contained, is that which would include only the balance remaining after the deduction of such necessary expenses. Schedule \"D\" imposes the tax in respect of annual profits or gains \"from any profession, trade, employment or vocation.\" Sec. 50 provides for assessing doubtful debts due to any person, but in cases of insolvency only the amount of dividend likely to be received on any such debt. In making the returns provided for by the Act of the \"profits or gains,\" the question of doubtful debts is provided, and, while really bad debts would be deducted in the estimate, persons making returns would have to charge themselves with the doubtful ones. This, then, is the principle of the Imperial \"Income\" Tax, and, under it, only the \"profits\" or \"gains,\" after deducting bad debts, are taxed. It is the sound principle, for otherwise it would be a tax on capital and not on \"income,\" and while a tax on capital, and to be paid out of it, no one could contend it would be derived from \"emoluments,\" which, according to every authority, means \"profits, advantages, gains in general.\" I have said that \"Income\" and \"Emoluments\" are employed in the section in question as synonymous, and being so used we are constrained so to apply the first term, when employed in any subsequent section of the same act. \"Income,\" however, has a well understood meaning, and in the absence of any legislative construction that meaning must be given to the term. According to Webster's dictionary \"Income\" is \"that gain which proceeds from labour, business, or property of any kind.\" * * * The profits of commerce or of occupation.\" \"Income is often used synonymously with revenue, but income is more generally applied to the 'gain' of private persons,\" and the same definition is given verbatim in the Imperial dictionary. In Richardson's dictionary it is stated to be the profit or emolument, the revenue coming in. Thus, for a stated period, income is, therefore, the profit or emolument derived from any commercial business or occupation for that whole period, and not for any portion of it, and not for any portion of the business but from the whole of it. If an individual, in the earlier part of the prescribed period should lose, say, a thousand dollars, but during the remaining part gains an equal sum, could it be said his profits, or income, or emoluments, from the business would be a thousand dollars? I maintain that, where there is no profit during the period, the fund on which the tax is directed to be levied is not in existence, and the tax is, in such a case, levied on capital. Such I cannot hold to have been the intention of the Legislature. The case states that the profits fell far short of the losses on the business for the year, and we must not, therefore, inquire further how either arose or occurred. The exact position is admitted by the case.\nThe 4th sec. of the 31st Vic., cap. 36, which repeals the 15th sec. of 22nd Vic., cap. 37, includes, with the agents of joint stock companies and corporations, \"any other person or persons, whether incorporated or not, doing business out of the Province, who shall carry on business within the city of Saint John, or who shall have an office or place of business in the city of Saint John for any such company, corporation, person or persons,\" and provides that all such agents \"shall be rated and assessed in like manner as any inhabitant upon the amount of income received by him for the same as such agent.\" The agents of companies and corporations are, then, put on the same footing as agents of a branch of a mercantile house or manufacturer, doing business out of the Province. I hold that a construction inapplicable to the agent of such mercantile house or manufacturer would be just as inapplicable to companies or corporations. The Legislature has thought fit to direct that the latter should be taxed by the same language as the former, and I feel constrained to declare it to be so, irrespective altogether of the policy involved, feeling bound to leave that question where constitutional right places it.\nSuppose, then, the case of the agency of a mercantile house or manufacturer, whose head quarters were in Montreal, being established at Saint John. A shipment of goods is made from Montreal of the value of $5,000, and the whole lost at sea or destroyed by fire, either en route, or after arrival at Saint John. Subsequently other shipments are made, and profit from them is realized of $4,000, and thus stood the profit and loss account of the agency at the end of the fiscal year. What would be the legitimate reply at head quarters to an inquiry as to the \"income\" derived from the agency, and what would be the reply to such an inquiry at head quarters anywhere under such circumstances? We (or I, as the case might be), derived no income from the agency, but sustained a loss of capital to the extent of $1,000. Would any one contend that, if the result was the same in regard to business carried on by a resident individual, he should be rated on the income of $4,000? I presume no one would attempt to impose such a rate, and although the Legislature expressly directs that the agents of non-resident companies, corporations, and \"other person and persons\" having agencies in Saint John, shall be taxed in like manner as resident individuals, we are asked to decide otherwise, in the face of the legislative provisions assimilating them in language the most plain and explicit, and in respect to the meaning of which there should be no doubt. Every person supplying fishermen, we know to be engaged in a precarious business from various causes; not the least of which is the bad debts they contract, A merchant, then, who is often paid in the produce of the sea, and makes a profit on its sale and on the goods supplied of, say, $3,000, but by loss of property and bad debts at the end of the fiscal year finds his assets $2,000 short of the capital employed, what would his income from the business be?. And how long could he live on such income? When we hear of a person in business \"living beyond his income,\" what do we infer? Why, that he is living beyond the profits of his business from which his support is derived, and that he is, consequently, either drawing upon the capital, or running into debt. That is the universal, and, I think, well understood application of the term, and as such should be applied. The case would be the same in respect of a person deriving his means of livelihood from a salary, fees, or perquisites, and the same answer would apply to both.\nWe are, however, referred to a proviso in the same section, by which agents of insurance companies are to be assessed on \"a three years' average of the yearly net profits,\" and we are asked, therefore, to conclude that the Legislature did not use \"income\" as synonymous with, but as designedly opposed to, net profits. In support, however, of that proposition the act itself furnishes no proof. I have, I hope, sufficiently shown that \"income,\" as applied to the commercial transactions of a resident individual, does not mean the mere nominal profits of goods sold in great part on credit, and never paid for, or even for profits on cash sales, but to the balance of profit and loss in all departments of his business during the prescribed period, and that the Legislature so intended when the same principle was applied to the agents of \"companies, corporations, or other person or persons.\" If such be the proper construction, then \"income\" and \"net profits\" mean exactly the same thing. The argument, at best, is but begging the question, because one must first establish the fact of the difference between \"income\" and \"net profits\" of a trade or business before he can say the Legislature did not use the terms synonymously. The Legislature in an Act, as well as an individual in a letter or other document, may in one place use a different term to express the same idea as is intended by a different term in another, and the mere fact cannot by itself be evidence for construction.\nWe are required to hold that \"income,\" in relation to banks, must necessarily apply to and include the amount realized from discounts and other loans and premiums, or profits received from exchange, but (independent of the peculiar way the matter as to the profits and losses is stated in this case) why should the construction stop there? Why should it not include the income, that is all that comes in from every source? The answer is, that it only should be applied to what comes in as profits. To give weight to that argument, or rather to found it, the term profits must be invoked, and that to be equitable must not be one sided. It would be unjust to charge a bank with the nominal profits on one side of its account with an individual, when the whole would show they were only nominal, because, not only such nominal profits, but a portion of its capital, had been lost by the insolvency of its debtor, or in some other way; and, were the dealings of the bank in question all before us, I have little doubt that no small portion of what constitutes the $29,000 of profits would be found of that character. I make these remarks in passing, but not under the conviction that they are at all necessary in the general view I take of the case, in regard to the assimilating provisions of the several governing sections under consideration. Sec, 16 of the Act of 1859 exempts from taxation the property or income of a stockholder derived from his company or corporation. The only income he could derive would be in the shape of dividends, and those dividends would depend upon the state of the profit and loss account at the end of the fiscal year. The \"income,\" in that case, could only come from profits after deducting all losses. How, then, can any one say that, instead of taxing the profits only in the case of the individual stockholder, by using the word \"income,\" the Legislature, employing the same term, intended it to have a different application in respect of the whole of the stockholders collectively. In a word, that it should mean profits in the one case, and not in the other.\nIt is also contended, that the return of the \"whole amount of income\" required by the agent, as provided for by the two Acts, in case of non-resident companies, &c., shows that the term \"income\" must be taken to mean income without deduction of losses. \"Income\" per se is as comprehensive, when used as it is in the Statutes, as \"whole amount of income.\" If the direction to the agent was merely to return a statement of the \"income,\" a statement of a part only would not be a compliance with the direction. If, indeed, the Statute spoke antecedently of two different defined kinds of income, or from different sources, and for some object it was necessary to have a return as to both, I could easily see that the words \"whole amount\" would have a significance and object wholly absent from the circumstances arising under the terms of the sections in question. It may be taken, in my opinion, as a caution and warning to agents to leave nothing out of their returns; but cannot, I think, to extend the meaning or application of the term \"income\" in the preceding part of that section, or to \"income or emoluments\" in section 12; and to give to the expression in question the application sought would, in my view, be overstraining the true meaning of the language of the provision, and, therefore, in opposition to the intentions of the Legislature as found by the words used.\nOn the argument we were referred by the counsel of the Respondents to an American work (Burroughs on Taxation, 161.) I can find nothing in that work, or the cases therein referred to, to strengthen the contention that an individual in commercial business can be taxed under the term \"income,\" or even a corporation, for anything beyond the net profits of the business. At page 160 that author says: \"A declared dividend will furnish the measure of tax on income,\" and refers to a case, Atlantic and Ohio Telegraph Company v. Commonwealth.[12]. I have referred to that judgment which, as the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, was, in 1870, delivered by Thomson, C. J., who says:\nBy whomsoever the stock is held, the measure of the tax is upon the dividends declared.\nAnd again:\nWhen a dividend is declared, that gives the measure and furnishes the rule for the tax.\nThe same author at the same page says: A profit on the investment or capital of the corporation is the measure of the tax, whether paid as dividends to stockholders or going to increase the capital,\nand cited a case, Commonwealth v. Pittsburgh, &c., R. R. C.[13]. I have read that case, and the judgment fully sustains the doctrine laid down. It was delivered in 1873, and quotes with approval what I have quoted from the judgment reported in 66 Penn. S. R. 57; and the Judge adds that:\nWhen a corporation has actually made dividends from its profits or property without formally declaring them by adding them to the stock of the shareholders, or where it has declared dividends and returned them, whether earned\" or not, the sum thus added to the stock of shareholders, or the sum declared and set apart to him, becomes the measure of the tax. The legislative intent being to make the profit transferred by the corporation to its shareholders from its treasury or property the measure of the taxation of its capital.\nI have also carefully examined the cases cited by the author, referred to and can find none in conflict with the position I have taken. I have likewise examined all the other American and the English cases cited, with the same result. At page 159, Burroughs says:\nA tax upon all persons in proportion to their income is said to be the most equitable mode of taxation; but such tax is never imposed upon all persons, nor upon the gross income\u2014it is usually upon the annual income of certain persons in excess of a certain amount, allowing deductions of various kinds.\nI have already said that, if any individual made a loss on his year's business instead of a gain, a tax on his gross revenue or earnings would indeed be, not on income, but on capital. According to all writers on political economy the gross revenue of an individual comprehends the whole annual produce of his land or labour; the net revenue, what remains free to him after deducting the expense of maintaining his fixed and circulating capital; or what, without encroaching upon his capital, he can place in his stock, or spend upon his subsistence, conveniences, or amusements. His real wealth is in proportion not to his gross but to his net revenue. His \"income\" is, therefore, what he can add to his stock, or spend. So, in my judgment, should it be held under the Statutes in question in this case.\nIn McCulloch's edition of Smith's Wealth of Nations[14] the learned and philosophical writer says:\nThe private revenue of individuals arises ultimately from three sources, rent, profit, wages. Every tax must finally be paid from some one or other of those three different sorts of revenue, or from all of them indifferently.\nAt p. 392\u2014\nThese (taxes) must be paid indifferently from whatever revenue the contributors may possess\u2014from the rent of their land, from the profits of their stock, or from the wages of their labour.\nI have shown that \"income\" in its well understood sense, as commonly used, means the annual profits of commercial business. I have shown the unjustness of any other construction, either as applicable to individuals or corporations., and, also, by the reference to the acknowledged authority on political economy just quoted, that to tax income regardless of the result of profit and loss would be against every equitable principle; and by the provisions of the Imperial \"Income\" Tax the Parliament of Great Britain has, by express provision, given a legislative construction of that term which excludes the construction of the Statutes in question asked for by the Respondents. I cannot construe sec. 15 of 22 Vic., cap. 37, or sec. 4 of 36 Vic., cap. 36, by the provisions of sec. 14 of the former, for by it a different mode of assessment is provided, and it cannot help in the work of the construction of the term \"income\" used in them, or in section 12 of the same Act. Section 14 is wholly independent of the sections 4 and 15 of the Acts mentioned, and they are equally so of it. The Legislature settled the policy of a different character for assessments under each, and we must construe each as if the other, or others, never existed. If it was the intention of the Legislature that the agents of non-resident companies, corporations, or persons should be taxed when their losses for the prescribed period exceeded their receipts in the shape of nominal profits or earnings, the language should, and I think would, have been much more explicit. If such was meant the legislation should have clearly shown it. Statutes for assessment are required to be plain and free from reasonable doubt. Except in very exceptionally bad times such as, not only in Canada but nearly all over the world, have been experienced for two or three years past, banks, as a general rule, always declare a dividend annually or semi-annually. Such, no doubt, was the case when the acts in question were passed. We can readily assume, therefore, that the circumstance of a bank being unable to declare a dividend was one not likely to be provided for, because unusual. We should not, therefore, construe such legislation as now under consideration from the position of a bank a year or two ago, which, from heavy losses at a time of unexampled depression, and when bankruptcy was so universal, makes large losses instead of profits during the prescribed period. The position being a very exceptional one, arising from the unusual general depression and consequent bankruptcy, we should not take it as one likely to be foreseen or provided for. I think it safer so to consider it than to make such an exceptional position the test for the construction of Acts passed so long before\u2014under wholly different circumstances. By the provision in question the non-resident banks might pay some years more than the resident. I maintain that the tax in question, requiring payment out of capital and not from income or profits, would be against every sound principle; and being so, I have no right to assume that in any case would the Legislature impose such a tax. It may be said that, even in such a case, the agent of a non-resident bank should pay some tax, and it is a reasonable one. That question is, however, I hold, not for us but the Legislature, and because it has not made provision for such a tax furnishes no reason why we should, by a false construction, confirm a levy the Statutes do not warrant. The rules for the construction of Statutes are pretty well understood, and I will, therefore, only refer to some of those quoted in the factum of the Respondents.\n\"If the words of a statute are plain they must be strictly followed, but if they are ambiguous, the whole context must be looked to for their explanation\"[15]. I think the words of sections 4, 12 and 15 are per se quite plain and easy of application, and, therefore, we are not permitted to consider \"the whole context.\"\nWords must be construed according to the plain ordinary meaning and in the largest ordinary sense which, according to the common use of language, belongs to them[16]. In construing the words \"emolument\" and \"income,\" I have done so according to their plain ordinary meaning, and that which according to the common use of language belongs to them.\n\"It is the duty of all Courts to confine themselves to the words of the Legislature, nothing adding thereto, nothing diminishing[17].\" We must not import into an act a condition or qualification we don't find there. I have been solely guided by the words of the Legislature, and feel bound to be so, apart from the consideration of consequences or results, which I would not be justified in considering where \"the words are plain\" and convey definite ideas.\nEntertaining such views, my judgment must be that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment below reversed.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred with the Chief Justice and Fournier, J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J.

It was shown that these air-brakes were the best known appliances for stopping trains, and that they had been tested during the day, but that they were not applied at a sufficient distance from the crossing to enable the train to be stopped by the hand\u2011brakes, in case of the air-brakes giving way.\nC.S.C., cap. 66, sec. 142, (Rev. Stats. Ont., cap. 165, sec. 90) enacts that \u201cevery Railway Company shall station an officer at every point on their line crossed on the level by any other railway, and no train shall proceed over such crossing until signal has been made to the conductor thereof, that the way is clear.\u201d\nSec. 143, enacts that \u201cevery locomotive * * * or train of cars on any railway shall, before crossing the track of any other railway on a level, be stopped for at least the space of three minutes.\u201d Held,\u2014That the Appellants were guilty of negligence in not applying the air-brakes at a sufficient distance from the crossing to enable the train to be stopped by hand-brakes in case of the air-brakes giving way.\nThat there was no evidence of contributory neligence on the part of the Grand Trunk Railway, as they had brought their train to a full stop, and only proceeded to cross Appellants track, when authorized to do so by the officer in charge of the semaphore, who was a servant of the Great Western Railway Company.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appeal of the defendants (appellants) to the said Court of Appeal from the decision of he Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the said Province, rendered on the sixth day of February, 1877, discharging the rule nisi whereby the plaintiff (respondent) was ordered to show cause why the verdict obtained in the said cause should not be set aside and a verdict entered for the defendants.\nThe declaration in this cause alleged that: \u201cDefendants so negligently and unskilfully drove and managed an engine, and a train of carriages attached, along a certain railway which the Plaintiff was then lawfully crossing in a certain railway carriage; that the said engine and train of carriages were driven and struck against the said railway carriage in which the Plaintiff was then lawfully crossing the said railway, as aforesaid, whereby the Plaintiff was thrown down and wounded, and sustained severe spinal injuries, and was permanently disabled, and was prevented from attending to his business for a long time, and incurred expense for surgical and medical attendance.\u201d\nPlea: Not guilty by statute.\nThe main facts of the case are as follows: The Grand Trunk Railway crosses the Great Western Railway on the level near the City of London, Ont. On June 19th, 1876, a Grand Trunk train, of which Plaintiff was conductor, and a Great Western train, were approaching the crossing; the G.T.R., the plaintiffs\u2019, train stopped at the semaphore until signaled to proceed; it then advanced, and when crossing defendants\u2019 line of railway it was run into by defendants\u2019 train, on account of the accidental bursting of one of the air brakes which were applied from twenty to thirty yards distant from the semaphore, a distance too short to enable the driver to stop the train with the ordinary brakes, when applied. The evidence given at the trial is reviewed at length in the judgments on this appeal.\nThe case was tried at the Middlesex Fall Assizes, 1876, before Burton, J., without a jury, and the learned judge found a verdict for the Plaintiff, and assessed the damages at $1,000.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for Appellants:\nThe declaration is not framed to present, nor was the evidence at the trial directed to support or to meet, a complaint for the non-performance of statutable provisions.\nIt is not charged that Defendants acted contrary to an Act of Parliament, or that they acted contrary to law; the charge is negligence and unskilfulness, from both of which they claim to be acquitted. Blamires v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company[1].\nEven if charged in the declaration as the foundation of the action, it does not entitle the Plaintiff to recover.\nThe G.T.R. train was bound by the statute to stop three minutes, and if Plaintiff, who was conductor of that train, had obeyed the law he would have been safe, and the accident would not have happened.\nWinckler. G.W.R.[2] Shields v. G.T.R.[3]; Graham v. G.W.R.[4] It is the collision which is the cause of the action, and we say it would not have happened if you were not negligent. You have been in pari delicto, for you have not shown that you so behaved as not to cause the accident. The statute does not impose any penalty for negligence, it imposes a duty, and I charge you with the breach of a statutory duty which has caused the accident. The act, Appellants contend, is a complex one, and the accident results as much from the act of one railway as from the act of the other.\nAs to the question of negligence, the Appellants were provided with the best known apparatus for bringing their train to a stop, and that is all the law requires. These brakes had been used for three years, and at this crossing they had always been known to answer the purpose. The same air-brake had been used twenty-six times successfully on this very trip, and this case should be decided by the experience up to the time of the accident. The bursting of the pipe which caused the injury was not and could not be known before, for it seems to have taken place after the speed of the train had been partially slackened by the brakes, and, therefore, was an accident against which the Appellant could not, by the use of ordinary precautions, provide.\nSpeed is one of the objects aimed at in railway travelling, and railway companies are justified in adopting improvements which have a tendency to effect this object; and the Appellants contend that when they adopt such improvements, after they have been tested and approved by skilled persons, competent to judge and recommend after long use, they are not guilty of negligence because an accident occurs in the giving way of some parts of the machinery which they could not foresee or prevent.\nThe learned counsel relied on the following authorities: Blyth v. The Birmingham Water Works Company[5]; Redhead v. The Midland Railway Company[6]; Wyborn v. The Great Northern Railway Company[7]; Daniel v. The Directors of R.M.R. Co.[8]; Crafter v. The Met. R. Co.[9]; Wharton on negligence[10].\nMr. Rock, Q.C., for Respondent:\u2014\nIt is contended that the declaration of the Plaintiff is sufficient. Anderson v. The Northern Railway Co.[11] is a case in point. The failure to comply with statutable provisions is evidence of negligence. A declaration based on the general ground of negligence is sufficient. See Shearman & Radfield on negligence[12].\nThere is no evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the Plaintiff; on the contrary, there is evidence that the G.T.R. stopped, and only proceeded when signaled to proceed by the officer in charge of the semaphore.\nAppellants were bound to stop the train, before passing the crossing, for at least three minutes, and not to proceed until signaled so to do; this was not done, as they did not apply the air-brakes in time. One of their own servants says that twenty-five yards west of the semaphore they were going at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour; the only reason they did not stop was because the distance was too short; in that they were guilty of negligence.\nAir-brakes, such as used by Appellants on their train, do become defective, and when the Appellants found that the air-brakes had become defective, they should have applied the hand-brakes on said train, which they did not do, and had they done so immediately after the bursting of the air-brakes, as they were in duty bound to do, the collision whereby the Respondent was injured would have been avoided.\nIt was also the duty of the Appellants to use the best known and safest appliances for the stopping of their trains, and it was shown in evidence, as is the fact, that had the ordinary hand-brakes been relied upon on the occasion when the collision occurred, the accident would not have happened, but the Appellants, in trusting to the air-brakes, instead of making use of the hand\u2011brakes, which are safer and more reliable, were guilty of negligence.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nThe Grand Trunk Railway crosses the Great Western Railway about a mile east of the city of London, on a level crossing. The facts in this case are very few, and, there are no contradictions.\nAt the crossing, and where this accident happened an employee of the Great Western was in charge, and whose duties (he says) \u201care to signal trains for both companies for the crossing, and attend to the switch.\u201d He likewise says, \u201cmy duty is, if two trains come at one time, to show the stop signal to the Trunk, the Great Western having the right of road then, but when they do not come together it is first come first served.\u201d And he further says, \u201cthe Grand Trunk train came first on that day, and it, of course, had the right to pass first. * * I signaled the conductor of the Grand Trunk to come on.\u201d He also says, \u201cthe Grand Trunk train was going at the regular and usual rate of speed in crossing that place.\u201d And Bell, the driver of the Great Western train, says:\nLast September I was driver of the train that ran into the Grand Trunk train. As I approached the crossing it was my duty to stop, and I endeavoured to stop by applying the air-brakes. * * * When I put on the brakes they pulled me considerably for a little time. Then I found out the air was gone, and I reversed the engine and whistled \u201con brakes.\u201d I could not say whether the brakes were applied. I believe the pipe produced is the pipe of the engine that burst that day. * * * The consequence of the defect was that I could not stop my train before getting to the crossing, and I went into the Grand Trunk train. * * * We had other brakes on the train\u2014the ordinary hand-brakes. I have regular brakesmen\u2014the same number as if we did not have the air brakes\u2014two on each train.\nAnd in answer to the question: \u201cIf these air-brakes are so perfect, why do you have ordinary brakesmen?\u201d he answers:\nThey require brakesmen to look after the train, handle baggage, give signals, and apply the other brakes, if anything should go wrong with anything about the train. * * We have the same number of brakesmen and the same hand-brakes that we had before. * * We did not stop the train with the ordinary brakesmen, because the distance was too short. We tried. It was my duty to stop at the semaphore. I always stop at the semaphore. I tried to stop that day before I was motioned by Mapstall. I tried to stop before I got to the same place; I could not say at what distance from it: it might be 20 or 30 yards. When I discovered that the air was gone from the brakes, I was a little over 200 yards from the junction. I was going at 30 miles an hour when I first shut off steam. That would be about half a mile from the semaphore. I applied the brake after I shut off steam. * * I whistled \u201cdown brakes\u201d when I was a little over 200 yards from the junction. The train might be going 25 miles an hour then. The only reason I can give why we did not stop the train is that the distance was too short.\nThe conductor of the Great Western Railway says: \u201cThe brakesmen did all they could and applied the brakes, but could not stop the train.\u201d And in the course of his examination the following occurs:\nHis Lordship: Do you consider it safe to apply the air-brakes so near the junction, when you see the result now, that the brakesmen, when called upon afterwards, were not able to prevent the collision?\nWitness: We naturally supposed that the air-brake would stop the train.\nQuestion: In point of fact, there is no security in applying the airbrake so near the junction? Answer: No, not if they burst, of course, there is not.\nExamination resumed: We do not expect them to give out. We used the same brakes from Suspension Bridge to Dorchester, and fetched the train up at every station; and the same brake was used twelve months before.\nHis Lordship: If the ordinary brake had been used in time this accident could not have occurred, but if you trust to the air-brake, and choose to put it on so near the crossing, an accident is unavoidable should the air-brakes fail.\nWitness: The same accident would have occurred the other way, suppose the hand\u2011brakes gave out. The handbrakes are affected just in the same way as others. I have often broken the chain, brake-rods, the rims, and the dogs of the brakes, and different parts of the car connected with them. They all give out.\nQuestion: But in that case it is only one part of the brake that gives way?\nAnswer: Nothing that is made but what will break and wear.\nOn cross-examination, he says:\n* * * If we had had to depend on the ordinary brakes and brakesmen to stop the train, they would have been called sooner that day than if the air-brakes had not been there. * * If there had been no air-brakes, and the ordinary brakes had not given out, the train could have been stopped. I have known air-brakes become defective since this accident occurred. I could not say how many times. I paid no particular attention to keep an account of the different ones. When I am on a train and a defect occurs, I report it to the parties who are supposed to remedy it. I have known of one or two defects in air-brakes. It is rather an unusual occurrence. It does not occur often, but it does occur. I have known defects occurring on the road at least as often as once a week. I will not say oftener. I do not mean a breakage in them, but the ordinary wear of the rubber. And not only with regard to the rubber pipes, but to the iron pipes under the bodies of the cars. We have ordinary brakes on all trains, and on all passenger cars as well as all freight cars; the same as we had before the air-brakes were introduced. The ordinary brakes are for the purpose of stopping the train. If it had not been for the defect in the pipe, the train would have stopped before we reached the semaphore. I reported this affair to the proper quarter when it occurred. I have had occasion to report some defects in the air\u2011brakes on my train since then. The trains were stopped when I discovered the defects. If the pipes are defective and the air is applied, the brakes do not work at all.\nBy His Lordship: There are regulations about brakesmen being on hand to apply the brakes if called for. They are supposed to be ready on the platform.\nQuestion: If the air-brakes were applied, as they were in this instance, so near the crossing, then, although the brakesmen were at their posts, they would not be able to prevent an accident?\nAnswer: No, certainly not. The engineer has to use his judgment in approaching crossings and stations.\nBy Mr. Beecher: I have known a similar burst to this to occur on one of my trains from the ordinary pressure. It has occurred three different times. When I speak of something going wrong once a week, I mean that the parts of the air-brake break and wear with the ordinary working of the train\u2014not only the rubber pipes, but the iron rods, and so on. The air-brake acts upon the wheels by means of the same brakes as the handbrakes. The ordinary brake, just like this, is liable to get out of repair.\nBy Mr. Rock: In cases of breakages, sometimes the outside will indicate it beforehand by rubbing and chafing, and sometimes not. I have several times known breakages take place by virtue of which the air would escape, and still there was nothing externally to indicate anything wrong. The only test in cases of that kind would be to apply the air. Here there was no escape of air twelve minutes before.\nGillean, a brakesman on the Great Western says:\nI was a brakesman on the train that had this collision on June 19th last. I remember hearing the brakes whistled \u201con\u201d when we were between the semaphore and the Grand Trunk crossing, about 40 or 50 yards west of the semaphore. I was standing between the parlor car and the coach, on the platform outside. I instantly applied the brakes. I applied one just as tight as I could, and was applying the other when we struck. I did all I could.\nOn cross-examination:\nIf we had put on the hand-brakes where he tried his air-brakes, then the train would have come to a full stop before we came to the semaphore.\nHenry Childs, the car superintendent of the Great Western, in answer to this question: \u201cIn coming up to a crossing this way, is it not manifestly unsafe to apply the air brakes unless it is done earlier than in this instance?\u201d says, \u201cIt seems from this accident to be so.\u201d\nOn cross-examination, he says:\nIf the tube had not broken there was no need of the brake being applied sooner. If it had been applied, and they found anything was the matter, they could have stopped the train with the ordinary brakes.\nThen follows this question:\nTherefore it would have been better to have applied it sooner? Answer: Certainly. * * * These brakes have been in use three years\u2014we had experimented with them about a year before that\u2014since then we have always had brakesmen on trains, the same as before.\nAs to air brakes, Bell says:\nThey were quite effective when we last stopped, and held first-rate\u2014there was nothing defective. The brakes were examined at Suspension Bridge, and also at Hamilton, they always are. * * * We examine the wheels at Paris, but not the air-brakes. * * * The air\u2011brake has been in use for three years, and this is the first accident that has happened to it, I believe.\nCook, the fireman, says:\nI was fireman on the train with the last witness (Bell), I heard what he said about the air\u2011brakes on that train, and that there was nothing wrong with them all the way to Dorchester. That is correct. The thing that caused the trouble was a burst like that in the tube produced. There was nothing to warn us that there was anything wrong with it\u2014we usually put the air on at the Bridge, and a man goes round to see if there is any leak of air, and if there is any he changes the pipe.\nNewman, car examiner of the Great Western Railway, says he examined the air brakes at the bridge, and found their condition perfect. There was nothing, whatever, in any part of them to indicate anything wrong. \u201cI examined every link\u2014the link between the engine and the next car, and between every other car.\u201d Haskin, car examiner at Hamilton, says:\nI examined the train that this accident happened to. On that morning I examined the air\u2011brake to every car. I will not be certain that the driver put on a pressure of air, but I examined the brakes, and found every one good. Nothing to indicate anything wrong.\nCross-examined by Mr. Rock: The most effective method of testing these brakes is by the air from the engine. I cannot say that they were examined that way on that morning, but as a rule they generally are. They are not always, tested that way at Hamilton, unless there is any defect. The driver would know of any defect by the air escaping and the brake not doing its work. These brakes do get defective sometimes. They must be renewed. They will wear out. They do not frequently get defective. We renew them when they do. We will run two or three months without any defect. Sometimes it is a less time\u2014a month or two months. I have not known a defect in less than a month. I have not frequently known them to occur at intervals of a month. We might have had two or three pipes get defective in the course of two or three months, or in the course of six months. The defects we find are where the tube has been rubbed, and where the air perforates through. It only perforates where there has been a defective part. I have known that to be the case within the last six months. They are to be always relied on, unless any of them burst. Certainly, sometimes they do burst. I have known them to burst during the last year. I cannot say how many times. I do not think half-a-dozen times. Probably as many as three or four times. They would then become inoperative and useless. The ordinary brakesmen are carried in case of accident. Nothing is perfect. My opinion is that the ordinary brakesmen are carried because these brakes are not perfect occasionally. I do not know that as a fact. I do not know anything about the stoppage of trains. I suppose trains with these brakes will sometimes run nearer a station without endeavouring to stop than with the ordinary brake. I cannot tell whereabouts on the road air-brakes have proved defective. Defects generally occur by the pipes bursting and the air escaping.\nChilds, car superintendent G.W.R.: \u201cI have known the pipes sent in to me for repairs when burst, perhaps once in six weeks or two months, not very frequently.\u201d\nThis evidence shows conclusively, that the Grand Trunk train was lawfully crossing the Great Western track, and was in no way whatever to blame for this accident. As to any idea that the Grand Trunk train did not stop three minutes, and therefore was guilty of contributory neligence, I can only say, the evidence is, that the Grand Trunk train was brought to a full stop, and did not move till the officer in charge, a servant of the Great Western, lowered the semaphore, and invited and authorized the Grand Trunk train to proceed. I cannot find a syllable in the evidence, showing that there was not the most rigid and exact compliance with the law; so I have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, the Grand Trunk did not in any way contribute thereto. It was unquestionably the duty of the Great Western to come to a full stop before coming to the junction, under the common law liability, as it likewise was their statutory duty.\nRevised Statutes of Ontario, Cap. 165, page 1539, sec. 90:\u2014\nEvery railway company shall station an officer at every point on their line crossed on a level by any other railway, and no train shall proceed over such crossing until signal has been made to the conductor thereof that the way is clear.\u2014C.S.C., Cap. 66, s. 142.\nSec. 91:\u2014Every locomotive, or railway engine, or train of cars on any railway shall, before it crosses the track of any other railway on a level, be stopped for at least the space of three minutes.\u2014C.S.C., Cap. 66, s. 143.\nThey did not do so. The air-brakes gave out, and when the hand-brakes were whistled on, the distance was too short for the hand-brakes to pull the train up, and they ran into the Grand Trunk. The simple question is, was there anything to justify or excuse the Great Western in not stopping? Had they stopped, of course there would have been no collision. Were they, then, prevented from stopping, and so discharging their common law and statutory duty by vis major, or inevitable or unavoidable accident? or could they, by providing suitable means, or by the proper use of means within their control and at their disposal, have accom- plished what it was their duty to do, and was the accident the result of such means not being provided or used? The Great Western was supplied with air-brakes and hand-brakes, and brakesmen to work the brakes, being all the brakeage power, as far as the evidence shows, or that I can assume, used on railway cars, and so no blame can attach to them for not providing the necessary means of coming to a full stop. If the collision took place by vis major, or by reason of an accident happening to that power which could not have been foreseen, and against which no reasonable care, skill, or foresight, could have provided, then the case would, no doubt, free the Great Western from legal liability for the consequences of such an inevitable and unavoidable accident. But that cannot be called an unavoidable accident which might have been avoided by more caution. While the evidence very clearly shows, on the one hand, that the air brake apparatus is a most useful and valuable invention, and a most powerful and effective means of controlling and bringing up quickly a train, it is, on the other hand, very liable to become defective, and does frequently burst and become useless, and that, too, without the fault of those in charge, and notwithstanding constant and rigid examination, from latent defects not externally visible or capable of detection, as well as from chafing or other causes which may be visible and capable of detection. And in this very case, the car superintendent says he could not perceive, on examination of the burst tube, any flaw at the hole which would indicate a weakness; and though he cut a slit in it to see if there was anything rotten or defective, he found nothing; and says that one of these pipes bursting would prevent the stopping of the whole train, so that the train would then necessarily be entirely out of all human control, unless, indeed, there were other means which could be resorted to.\nIt does appear to me it would be simple madness to run a train, under ordinary circumstances, without reference to any exceptional case such as this, dependent alone on the air apparatus; and that this is so is best evidenced by the fact that, notwithstanding the power and value of these air-brakes and the great expense at which they are attached, the ordinary handbrakes and brakesmen are retained as before the introduction of the air-brake, and stringent rules are made requiring the brakesmen to be at their posts on the platform ready in case of necessity; that is, I presume, in the event of the air-brakes giving out to supply its place by the use of the hand-brake. But of what possible advantage could it be to have the ordinary brakes, or rules requiring brakesmen to be ready to work them, if, when called into requisition, the rate of speed is so great, or the distance so short, that they cannot be worked effectively. It is hardly possible to conceive a point on a railway requiring greater care and caution in approaching it than when two railways cross and trains are continually running on both.\nIt was the imperative duty of the driver of the Great Western to bring his train to a full stop, and, knowing how great a risk there was of a disastrous collision, and knowing, as he ought to have known, how liable air-brakes are to get out of order, from latent and other defects, he was bound to have taken every precaution which care and foresight could dictate, and have relied on all his resources, and have resorted to them, and placed himself and his train at a sufficiently early period, in a position to make them available in case of an emergency. He should, in my opinion, have acted on the assumption that when he came to the crossing a train would be passing on the other track, for he could not know that this would not be the case, and he should, therefore, have exercised a degree of care, precaution and diligence proportioned to the probable, or even possible, impending danger.\nIn view of the double means of stopping the train with which it was provided, and in view of the liability of air-brakes to burst and become useless, the Great Western train, in my opinion, should not have run so close to the semaphore, and at such a rate of speed that, if one of the means available failed, the other would be practically useless, but that the speed of the train should have been slackened and the air-brakes applied, more particularly at such a dangerous spot, at such a distance from the semaphore, as, in the event of their failing, would have enabled recourse to have been had to the hand-brakes; and that running the train so fast and so close to the semaphore as to render inoperative any stopping power which might have been obtained from the hand-brakes, before taking any steps to put the train under control, was negligence, wholly independent of any statute.\nI cannot help declaring that, in view of the risk and danger attendant on a train crossing a railway track when not entitled to do so, and the probable consequences of a collision so dreadful to contemplate, I think it was most rash and hazardous, and, in view of the law, a most unjustifiable act for the driver of the Great Western train to approach within half a mile of such a crossing at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and not attempt to obtain control of his train till within twenty or thirty yards, or sixty, or ninety, from the semaphore where it was his duty to stop, and that his train should be going twenty-five miles an hour when he was only a little over two hundred yards from the junction and whistled \u201cdown brakes.\u201d This very fact of the conductor whistling on brakes shows that it was to the hand-brakes he looked in the event of the air-brakes not working; but what possible use was his calling for help from the hand-brakes when his rate of speed was so great, and he had allowed his train to be in such close contiguity to the crossing that they were powerless to respond to his call? Instead of taking every possible care and precaution that judgment, skill and foresight could suggest to comply with the law, they appear to have taken the least possible precaution, or rather no extra precaution at all. They did not put themselves out of the way in the least to obey the law; on the contrary, having two means of fulfilling their duty and bringing their train to a stand, they approach so near the junction and at such a rate of speed, that their primary means failing, their auxiliary means are useless, and they are helpless to fulfil either the common law or their statutory duty, but appear to have shaved as close as it was possible to do if they had had the most absolute certainty that the air-brakes could not give out.\nIt cannot be denied that the requirements of the law could have been complied with, simply at the expense of delay, and that, too, but trifling. Defendants had provided the means necessary to enable them to do as the law directed, but they chose to put it out of their power to use them. The statute imposed on Appellants the duty to stop, if it were possible, and stop they were bound to do, regardless of delay or inconvenience; they cannot be allowed to say, or to act, as if they said: \u201cWe\u2019ll try to stop if it does not delay us beyond the shortest possible time, or inconvenience us too much.\u201d\nIt is as well, once for all, to let railway people know that, however desirable speed may be, speed must give way to safety in all cases where speed and safety are incompatible, and that every provision which the law has made for the safety and security of life and pro- perty must be respected and complied with, irrespective of delay, inconvenience or expense.\nIf courts of law should countenance so reckless a disregard of available precautions and means for avoiding collisions as existed in this case, and thereby sanction such a disregard of so wise, and wholesome, and necessary a statutory provision, for the protection of life and property, they would, not only set themselves in opposition to the wise policy of the law, but would encourage speed at the risk of safety, and recklessness and carelessness, where the public safety demands the utmost care and caution. While we ought to be careful not to impose any undue burdens or duties on railway companies, we are bound to see that those imposed by Act of Parliament are respected and fulfilled, and that there be no breach of any statutory duty.\nI do not think authorities are required to support the view I have taken of this case, but as there are several which, I think, bear directly on the case, I will cite them: Blamires v. Lane. & Yorkshire Ry. Co.[13] shows that in an action for negligence it is right to use the statute as evidence of what should have been done.\nIn Williams v. Gt. Western Railway Co.[14]:\nThe defendants\u2019 line crossed a public foot-path on the level, but the defendants had not erected any gate or stile, as provided by 8 and 9 Vic., cap. 20 sec. 61.\nThe plaintiff, a child, four years and a-half old, having been sent on an errand, was shortly afterwards found lying on the level crossing, a foot having been cut off by a passing train.\nHeld, that there was evidence to go to the jury that the accident was caused by the neglect of the defendants to fence.\nThe ground taken here was that this was an unexplained accident.\nOn the other side it was contended, that there was ample evidence of negligence, none of the precautions prescribed by 8 and 9 Vic., cap. 20, s.s. 47, 61, and 26 and.27 Vic., cap. 92, sec. 6, having been observed; that the only question was whether that negligence could be reasonably connected with the accident.\nKelly, C.B., adopted that view. He says:\nThe questions are, first, whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendants which could have contributed to the accident; secondly, whether such negligence was the cause of the accident. As to the first point it is impossible to imagine a case where negligence is more clearly made out or more inexcusable. There was a clear statutory duty to have gates on both sides of the carriage way * * * and it was equally required for the protection of the public, that a gate or stile should be placed at each side of the railway. Both those duties were left unperformed; this was clearly negligence.\nPollock, B., after saying no doubt there was a non-performance of what was enjoined by the Act of Parliament, says:\nIt is not for us to speculate on what was the precise intention of the Legislature when they required that there should be a gate or stile on a foot-path crossing on a level. It is sufficient to say that the defendants have neglected to comply with the enactment.\nAmphlett, B., says:\nWe start with the fact that the defendants have failed to comply with the express provisions of the statute, and this is an act of gross negligence.\nCockburn, C.J., in Stokes v. Eastern Railway Company[15], says:\nLastly, even assuming that the accident was not caused by negligence of the company\u2019s servants, might it have been prevented or mitigated by a better use of brake-power? It is not to be disputed, because the universal practice of railway companies is an acknowledgment of its necessity, as a matter of proper caution and care, that brake\u2011power ought to be used. Are you of opinion that the absence of a second brake\u2011van, or the not putting the single one in the rear, was negligence on the part of the company? You must consider the questions as practical men; and if you think there was a neglect of what might fairly and reasonably have been expected from the railway company for the protection of a train, that would be negligence.\nFry, J., in Nitro-Phosphate and Odam\u2019s Chemical Manure Company v. London and St. Katherine Docks Company[16], says;\nTherefore, I think that if the case had stood simply on the common law liability of the defendants for negligence, I should have had great difficulty in concluding that there was any such liability. The flood of November, 1875, being, in my judgment, what, in the contemplation of law, is called an act of God.\nBut I do not think that this case is to be determined upon the defendant\u2019s common law liability; and for this reason: The defendants did not choose to rely on their common law right to use their land as they might think fit. They chose to go to Parliament for powers to authorize them to some extent, apparently, to do what they might have done without those powers. They take a power to construct and to maintain a dock upon their land, and taking that power and acting upon it, they must, in my judgment, subject themselves to the conditions which Parliament has imposed upon the exercise of that power. They cannot afterwards fall back upon the question of what was reasonable care, if Parliament have in any particular respect laid down what they are to do. The question, therefore, which I have to determine, comes, in my opinion, to this: have Parliament laid down anything which takes the place of the common law liability to use reasonable care? have they, in short, defined the height at which the bank of the dock is to be maintained? If they have, I do not think that the Defendants can say, we will be judged by our own common law liability, or by our statutory liability, as we may think fit. To allow them to do so would obviously be unfair, for this reason, that if they perform their statutory obligation, they are harmless in all cases, even if that liability is less than the common law liability, whereas if they perform even less than the statutory obligation, they might contend that, if the common law obligation reached to a less extent, they would be harmless also. I think they must stand or fall by their statutory liability. In some cases, this will enure to their benefit; in other cases, it will enure to their injury. But, whether it be for or against them, it becomes, in my opinion, the rule by which their negligence or care is to be tried. * * * I hold therefore, that the statute imposed on the defendant company, an obligation to maintain the upper surface of the bank, which was to retain the water in their dock at a level of four feet above trinity high- watermark. It is conceded that they did not so maintain it. The result in my opinion, is, that there has been negligence on their part in not fulfilling their statutory obligation, and that they are responsible for that negligence.\nHENRY, J.:\nThis is an action brought by the Respondent to recover damages from the Appellant company, for injuries received by him, arising from a collision between a train of that company with one of the Grand Trunk Railway, of which he was then conductor.\nIt is a special action on the case for negligence of the servant or servants of the Respondents, and, as such, is alleged in the declaration.\nThe defence, by the only plea of the Respondent, is \u201cnot guilty.\u201d\nAt the time of the collision, the train of the Grand Trunk Company was in motion on the crossing, about a mile east of London. The crossing of the two lines of railway at that point is a level one. The question of contributory negligence was raised by the allegation that the Plaintiff\u2019s train should have waited longer at the semaphore before running upon the crossing. The Appellant, however, failed to prove that such was the case, and, by all the statements in evidence, we are to conclude that the Respondent waited there the prescribed time. The semaphore is regulated and controlled by an employee of the Appellant, and the signal to proceed was given to the Respondent before he advanced his train. His train was therefore legally in the position it occupied when the collision occurred.\nRedfield on Railways[17] says:\nThe subject of railway crossings on a level with the highway has been before alluded to, as one demanding the grave consideration of the legislatures of the several states. It always causes a most painful sense of peril, especially where there is any considerable travel on the highway, and is followed by many painful scenes of mutilation and death, under circumstances more distressing, if possible, than even accidents, so destructive sometimes of railway passengers.\nIn a case which he cites, Bradly v. The Boston and Maine Railway[18], where the plaintiff was injured at a railway crossing by collision with an engine, it was held that \u201cwhere the statute required at such points certain specified signals, the compliance with the requirements of the statute will not excuse the company from the use of care and prudence in other respects.\u201d And he says:\nBut when the statute requires certain precautions against accidents, and its requirements are disregarded, the party suffering damage is not entitled to recover, if he was himself guilty of negligence which contributed to the damage.\nThis position, as a general proposition, no one will doubt. He proceeds thus:\nIf the wrong on the part of the Defendant is so wanton and gross as to imply a willingness to inflict the injury, Plaintiff may recover, notwithstanding his own ordinary neglect. And this is always to be attributed to Defendant, if he might have avoided injuring Plaintiff, notwithstanding his own negligence.\nThe application of the doctrine last quoted to this case amounts to this, that if the Respondent\u2019s train, when the collision took place, was even wrongfully on the crossing, the Appellants\u2019 conductor or driver might have avoided the collision, by using the ordinary and necessary care and prudence, but which, from the evidence, I hold, he did not use.\nWharton, in his treatise on negligence[19], says:\nWhere a statute requires an act to be done or abstained from by one person for the benefit of another, then an action lies in the latter\u2019s favor against the former, even though the statute gives no special remedy. In this case applies the maxim ubi jus ibi remedium.\nIt is in evidence, that the two trains pass the crossing about the same time\u2014sometimes one, at other times the other train crosses first, according to the time of arrival at the point, as regulated between the two companies. There is therefore greater danger of loss to life and property by a collision than when a train passes a public road, and more care and circumspection are required to be used by the conductors of each train. Both trains appear to have been three or four minutes behind time, and there was therefore the more necessity for each to beware of the consequences of a collision by running into the one which happened to be ahead and then on the crossing. The conductor of the Appellants\u2019 train should therefore have approached the crossing with the greatest care and caution, instead of which he approached the semaphore, at which he was required to stop, within a few yards, at the rate of twenty-five or thirty miles an hour, trusting alone to the air-brakes, without any provision made for the use of the hand\u2011brakes, in case of an accident to the air-brake. It was therefore such reckless management as, under the circumstances, should subject the Appellants to make good any resulting damage. The hand-brake men were not at their posts, and so much time elapsed after the breaking of the air-brake before even one of them put on the brake that the train was not stopped in time to prevent the collision, although, from the evidence, we are justified in concluding that, had the hand-brakes been instantly applied when the air-brake gave out, the train might have been stopped in time to prevent the collision.\nIt was contended on the argument, that as the air brake, when in good order, is superior in its action to hand brakes, and more promptly efficient, the accident occurring to it, preventing its use at a critical time, by which the train runs on unchecked, and an injury thereby occasioned, the company would not be responsible therefor. The ruling principle in such cases is of universal application; and that is, that the company must use all the well-known and recognized appliances to prevent the occurrence of injuries, and if they trust to one only where others are as commonly used and considered necessary for safety, and damage results, the company is responsible for it. It appears from the evidence, that although air-brakes are more prompt, and even more effective in every way, they cannot be at all times solely relied on. They are useful, no doubt, in the general working of a train, but it would be wrong to trust to them alone when approaching the crossing of another train due there about the same time, at the rate of twenty-five or thirty miles an hour. It is proved that the pipes or tubes often burst; and there is no absolute security to be felt in them from even a recent test of those some time in use\u2014the material of which they are made wears out by use, and the pressure they will bear depends upon the strength of their weakest part. In use they are, I presume, liable to injury of different kinds, which, at a given point, may weaken them, and experience of such tubes shows that no mere inspection can be relied on. They may have been recently tested, but that seems to afford little or no security, as they may become weakened by the very means used to test them. Whether the reasons I advance be sound or not we have evidence of the fact that they often give out when least expected. I think, therefore, that trusting to them alone, at a juncture such as in the present case, was wholly unjustifiable, and that when the conductor takes the responsibility of trusting to them alone, his company should have the responsibility of making good any resulting damage. There are many other facts proved that show culpable negligence, but it is unnecessary to refer more particularly to what the evidence discloses. The declaration is for negligence, generally, and the breach of statutory provisions, as shown in this case, in consequence of which\ninjury or damage ensues, is sufficient to entitle the Respondent to recover. There is no question as to the amount of damages. I have no doubt that the Respondent is entitled to our judgment. I think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below affirmed with costs.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU, J.J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Samuel Barker.\nSolicitor for respondent: Warren Rock.\n[1] L.R. 8 Ex. 283.\n[2] 18 U.C.C.P. 250.\n[3] 7 U.C.C.P. 111.\n[4] 41 U.C.Q.B. 324.\n[5] 11 Ex. 781.\n[6] L.R. 2 Q.B. 412; L.R. 4 Q.B. 379.\n[7] 1 F. & F. 162.\n[8] L.R. 5 H.L. 45.\n[9] L.R. 1 C.P. 300.\n[10] Secs. 32, 300, 635, 822 et seq.\n[11] 25 U.C.C.P. 301.\n[12] Sec. 16, p. 16.\n[13] L.R. 8 Ex. 283.\n[14] L.R. 9 Ex. 157.\n[15] 2 F. & G. 691; quoted by Railway Company, L.R. 2 Q.B.

He informed S. that there were other insurances on the property, but not knowing the amount that there was in the Gore Mutual, requested him to ascertain it, and signed the application partly in blank, paid the premium and obtained an interim receipt, valid only for thirty days. S. failed to do what he promised to do, and what plaintiff had entrusted him to do, and forwarded the application to the head office at T., making no mention of the insurance in the Gore Mutual. The Company accepted the risk, and, in accordance with their practice, where the risk extended only over a short period, instead of a formal policy, they issued a certificate, which stated that the plaintiff was insured subject to all the conditions of the Company\u2019s policies, of which he admitted cognizance, and that in the event of loss it would be replaced by a policy. The machinery was subsequently destroyed by fire, after the thirty days, but within the two months, and a policy was thereupon issued, endorsed with the ordinary conditions, one of which was that notices of all previous insurances should be given to the Company and endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged by them in writing, or the policy should be of no effect; and another was, that all notices for any purpose must be in writing. The insurance in the Gore Mutual was not endorsed on the policy.\nHeld: That as the application in writing did not contain a full and truthful statement of previous insurances, the verbal notice to the agent of the existing policy in the Gore Mutual, without stating the amount, was inoperative to bind the Company; the plaintiff was not entitled to have the policy reformed by the endorsement of the Gore Mutual policy thereon, and could not recover.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which reversed the judgment of the Court of Chancery for Ontario[2], pronouncing a decree in favor of the plaintiff.\nAction on a policy begun in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, but subsequently transferred, by an order made in Chambers under the administration of Justice Act, 1873, to the Court of Chancery.\nPlaintiff declared on a policy, dated the 9th February, 1875, which, he alleges, was made and accepted in reference to the conditions thereto annexed, which were to be used and resorted to explain the rights and obligations of the parties thereto in all cases not therein otherwise specially provided for, where by defendants insured plaintiff against loss by fire, not exceeding $6,000, on property described as agricultural machinery in pro- cess of construction, finished and unfinished, owned by the plaintiff, and contained in a two\u2011story stone building, with a one-story frame addition, covered with shingles laid in mortar, occupied by the plaintiff as an agricultural implement manufactory, situated on the west side of Cross street, in the town of Dundas, in the county of Wentworth, from the sixth day of February, A.D.1875, at twelve o\u2019clock, noon, unto the sixth day of April, A.D. 1875, at twelve o\u2019clock, noon; that the plaintiff was interested in the said machinery to the amount insured; that after the making of the said policy, and whilst it was in force, the said machinery was destroyed by fire, whereby plaintiff suffered damage and loss to the amount so insured, and that all conditions were fulfilled and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action, and nothing happened or was done to prevent him from maintaining the same; yet the plaintiff had not been paid.\nTo this declaration defendants pleaded:\n1st. Policy not their deed.\n2nd. That it was provided by policy and the conditions endorsed thereon, that the representations made in the application for insurance should and would contain a just, full and true value of the property insured, so far as the same were known to the said plaintiff; and that if any material fact or circumstance should not have been fairly represented, then the policy should and would cease, and be of no further effect. That the representations in the application for said insurance were contrary to said stipulation and agreement. There was misrepresentation as to value.\n3rd. Alleged that it was further provided, that in case plaintiff should, at the time of effecting said insurance, have any other insurance against loss by fire on the said insured property, and not notified to the defend- ants and mentioned in, or endorsed upon, the said policy, then the said insurance should and would be void; defendants averred that at the time of effecting said insurance the said property was insured for the sum of one thousand dollars in the Gore Mutual Insurance Company, which fact was not notified to the defendants and mentioned in or endorsed upon the said policy, according to the condition in that behalf, whereby the said policy was void.\n4th Alleged provision by conditions for particular account of loss, and until such proofs &c., produced, loss should not be payable.\n5th. Alleged that by policy and conditions endorsed, plaintiff should procure certificate, and, under hand of a magistrate most contiguous &c., &c., and no such certificate was procured.\n6th. That by policy and conditions, if any fraud or false swearing in proofs, plaintiff should forfeit all claims. Fraud and false swearing as to amount of loss, and so all claim under policy forfeited.\n7th. Property not burnt or destroyed as alleged.\nIssue by plaintiff.\nThere was a second count added at trial by leave of Mr. Justice Burton with allegation of insurance of $1,000 in the Gore District Mutual Insurance Company, of which the defendants had notice before and at the time they effected the said risk; and the defendants agreed to accept the said risk and to insure the plaintiff\u2019s said property, having such knowledge as aforesaid, and to mention the same in the said policy, or have the same endorsed thereon; and defendants, by mistake, omitted to mention the existence of the said policy in the said Gore District Mutual Insurance Company in the said policy, or to endorse the same thereon, which the plaintiff had no knowledge of until after the said stock was so burnt, damaged and destroyed as aforesaid; and the said policy or contract of insurance ought to be reformed and amended by the mention therein of the existence of the said policy in the Gore District Mutual Insurance Company of $1,000; and all conditions &c., as in first count.\nDefendants pleaded at trial to second count:\nFirst. Defendants had no notice of the said policy of insurance of $1,000; nor did the defendants by mistake omit to mention the said policy of $1,000 in the policy of the defendants, or to endorse the same thereon; and the said policy of the defendants ought not to be reformed as in the said count mentioned.\nAnd for a second plea, the defendants set out two of the conditions mentioned and referred to in the said policy of the defendants in the said count mentioned, and subject to which the said policy was made and entered into by the plaintiff and defendants, as follows: \u201cNotice of all previous insurance upon the property insured by the Company shall be given to them and endorsed on this policy, or otherwise acknowledged by the Company in writing at or before the time of their making insurance thereon, otherwise the policy subscribed by the Company shall be of no effect; and the applicant shall be bound by his representations on making his insurance; and if the agent of the Company makes the application for the insured, he shall be considered the agent of the insured and not of the company;\u201d and that the plaintiff made his application for the said insurance through one R.W. Suter, the agent of the defendants at Dundas, and that the said application was in writing, and was forwarded to the defendants at their head office in Toronto; and the policy was issued thereon; that application contained no statement or mention of the said policy of $1,000 in the Gore District Mutual Insurance Company; nor had the defendants or their Directors, or any of the officers of the Company at the head office, any knowledge or notice of the said last-mentioned policy, before or at; the time of the making of the said application or of the said policy of the defendants, although the plaintiff had communicated the existence of the said policy of $1,000 to the said R.W. Suter at the time he made his said application for insurance to the defendants; but the said R.W. Suter had no authority from the defendants to change, or vary, or waive the said conditions; and the said R.W. Suter did not give the defendants any notice thereof, nor had the defendants any notice or knowledge thereof, unless the notice to Suter was a sufficient notice to them, which they denied; that immediately after the said application of the plaintiff the said policy of the defendants was made and delivered to the plaintiff, and he was fully aware and had the means of knowing that the said policy of $1,000 was not endorsed by the defendants on the said policy, nor otherwise acknowledged by the defendants in writing, and that the plaintiff has been guilty of laches in not seeking sooner to reform the said policy; and defendants say that the conditions on the said policy were made expressly with the intention of preventing fraud and collusion between the insured and the agents of the Company, by requiring the knowledge of the Company to be evidenced in writing; and if applications are made for insurance by an agent of the defendants, he should be considered the agent of the insured and not of the defendants as to the said application; and that they were not bound by the notice to or knowledge of the said Suter, without the acknowledgment of the defendants endorsed on the policy or otherwise expressed in writing; and that the said policy of $1,000 was not omitted to be endorsed on the policy of the defendants, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, through any error or mistake of the defendants.\nEquitable replication added at the trial by leave of Mr. Justice Burton, sets out the condition referred to in third plea:\n\u201cNotice of all previous insurances upon the property, assured by the Company shall be given to them, and endorsed on this policy, or otherwise acknowledged by the Company in writing, at or before the time of their making, assurances thereon, otherwise the policy subscribed by this Company shall be of no effect; plaintiff says he made application for the insurance, for which the policy made by the defendants in the declaration mentioned was issued, to an agent of the defendants authorized to receive applications for insurance and the payment of the premiums, and to grant interim receipts on behalf of the defendants; and plaintiff says that in and at the time of the making of the said application, he informed and notified the said agent of the defendants of the existence of the insurance in the Gore District Mutual Insurance Company, in the said plea mentioned, and instructed the said agent to have the same endorsed on the said policy or otherwise acknowledged by the defendants in writing, when the same should be made, which the said agent undertook to do; and the defendants omitted or neglected to have the existence of the said other insurance endorsed on the said policy, or otherwise acknowledged in writing; and before the said policy was delivered to the plaintiff, the said loss occurred; and the plaintiff had no notice until after the happening of the said loss that the existence of the said insurance was not endorsed on the said policy, or otherwise acknowledged in writing.\u201d\nRejoinder to equitable replication re-affirms the two conditions as to notice of all previous insurances, as to agent of the Company being considered agent of assured and not of Company; re-affirms statement of application being made through Suter, agent of defendants, in writing, and forwarded to head office, and policy issued thereon; that application contained no statement of the $1000 policy in the Gore District Mutual Company, &c., as in the plea, although the plaintiff had communicated the existence of the said policy of $1,000 to Suter at the time he made his said application for insurance to the defendants; Suter had no authority from the defendants to change or vary, or waive the said conditions, and did not give the defendants any notice thereof.\nThe application in this case was in writing, dated 6th February, 1875, for insurance to amount of $6000 for two months, from 6th February, 1875, to 6th April, 1875, on agricultural machinery. 3 per cent per annum, 2 1\/100 two months.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nVice-Chancellor Proudfoot pronounced a decree in favor of the plaintiff, which was reversed on appeal by the Appeal Court for Ontario.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellants:\nThe defence in this case rests only upon the fact that an insurance of $3000 in the Gore Mutual was not disclosed to the respondents, and that the local agent had power to bind the Company no more than thirty days. It cannot be said that there was not a valid contract of insurance between the plaintiff and the defendants by the verbal application, the payment of the required premium, and the issuing of the interim receipt. This contract was continued by the respondents, for within thirty days they issued in favor of the appellant a certificate or short form policy. The Court must, therefore, read this certificate as if the words\u2014\u201cThe non-delivery of a policy within the time specified is to be taken, with or without notice, as absolute and incontrovertible evidence of the rejection of this contract of insurance by the said board,\u201d were not there. The legal effect of the issuing of a certificate or short form policy was only the continuation of the contract commenced by the interim receipt. Under that contract, all that was necessary was, that the agent should be notified\u2014not necessarily in writing\u2014what other insurances existed on the property, and the evidence clearly shows that Suter, who was also agent of the Gore Insurance Company, was duly notified of the existing insurance in that Company. A notice to the agent is equivalent to a notice to the Company. See Hendrickson v. The Queen Insurance Company[3] Moreover, before the issue of the policy a notice in writing was sent to the Company of the existence of that insurance with the proof papers. The Company, then, having full knowledge of the double insurance complained of, issued the policy upon which this action is brought, thereby electing to confirm the contract of insurance made by the interim receipt. They elected to and did retain the premium, and, having done so, and issued the policy in consideration therefor, they ought, the plaintiff submits, to issue a binding policy. Collett v. Morrison[4]; Jones v. Provincial Insurance Company[5] Up to the issue of the long policy the contract of insurance was not under seal, and a parole waiver would be good even at Common Law.\nSee The Canada Landed Credit Co. v. The Canada Agricultural Co.[6] If the sixth condition was broken they waived it; Sherman v. Madison Mut. Ins. Co.[7]; Brady v. Western Ass. Co.[8] The appellants are even entitled to recover within the terms of the policy, for the conditions of the policy are only to be resorted to in cases not otherwise specially provided for. Now, in this policy provision is made for endorsing other insurances on the policy, and if the insurance in the Gore was not endorsed on the long policy, it was no fault of appellants, but that of respondents\u2019 agent; for he was duly notified of all existing insurances when he issued the interim receipt. See Peoria Mar. & Fire Ins. Co. v. Hall[9]; Insurance Co. v. Wilkinson[10]; Wyld v. The Liverpool L. & G. Ins. Co.[11] Appellants further contend there was no double interest, as the interest of assured in the Gore policy was assigned when the application was made to the respondents. It was a transfer of a policy in a mutual company, which made the mortgagee a member of the mutual company.\nMr. Osler, Q.C., followed on the part of the appellants:\u2014\nThe whole contract is contained in the original provisional receipt; it does not embody any other document; it does not refer to the application, except for the description of the insured property; it provides for a continuation of the contract as made, if accepted, not for its alteration. No written notice of existing assurance is thereby required; the notice required by the nota bene was given at the time.\nThe contract was, perhaps, voidable, but the action of the directors is evidence that the contract was not rejected, and they could not make, within the 30 days, a new and more limited and conditional contract. In Penley v. Beacon[12] evidence was given in order to show that outside of the interim receipt the contract was valid. The short form policy was issued by the company for their convenience, and I contend that the endorsement is not necessary on short form policies, for the conditions say; \u201cOn this (long form) policy\u201d and not on the short form policy. There being no change made in the contract by the short date policy, no change was made up to the date of the fire, and the loss should be payable as upon an unconditional insurance. The Court below say there were two distinct contracts, and that by the second contract a notice in writing was necessary. Appellants contend that the application and interim receipt and certificate are but the one contract, and that notice in writing is only necessary when the further assurance is put on after the contract was completed.\nThey cited, also, Tough v. The Provincial Ins. Co.[13] and Royal Ins. Co. v. Knapp et al.[14]\nMr. Boyd, Q.C., (Mr. Lyon with him) for respondents:\u2014\nWhen the plaintiff made his application for insurance, he was aware that information was required by the Company as to other insurances existing on the machinery in question. This is expressly asked by the eleventh query to be answered by the applicant, and he answers it by mentioning: \u201cHastings Mutual, $2,000; Canada Mutual, $3,000.\u201d As a matter of fact, there was a further insurance in Gore District Mutual Insurance Company effected by Billington, as to which no information is communicated in the application to the Company.\nThe interim receipt is provisional, and the moment the Company issue a policy, the agent is out of the question. The basis of the contract is the application, and the Company accepted the risk on the footing of what was disclosed in the application, and the applicant agrees that it shall form part, and be a condition of the insurance contract. That a short date policy was issued cannot alter the case, for it is tantamount to the long policy, and refers to all the conditions of the long policy, of which assured admits cognizance. It is true, Billington says he never received the certificate; then he finds himself in this dilemma. If he never received the short form policy, he has no locus standi here at all, for the interim receipt provides that, unless it be followed within thirty days, the insurance shall be void, but if he did receive it, he is bound by all the conditions in that policy, and one of the conditions is that all notices of further insurances shall be in writing.\nIn this case there is no evidence that either Suter or Billington knew before the fire what amount of insurance was to be mentioned, nor can it be said that the Company had knowledge or notice of this fact? There was no material mistake which would warrant a reformation of the policy, no distinct oral agreement, as in Wyld v. Liverpool L. & G. Insurance Company[15] They cited Richardson v. Maine Insurance Company[16]; Cooper v. Farmer\u2019s Mutual[17]; Hawke v. Niagara District Insurance Company.[18]\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply:\nThe contract is provisional, it is true, but it refers to the application, and the application does not exclude any verbal evidence. The answer to the eleventh query ought to be treated as if there was no answer at all. The fact that there is evidence that we gave the agent of the Company all the information necessary is sufficient.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThe pleadings present the plaintiff in a somewhat anomalous position before the Court. In his declaration he sets out a contract of insurance against fire, as made between defendants and himself, and avers a loss by fire of the property insured to the amount insured; and alleges that all conditions were fulfilled, and that all things happened, and all times elapsed, necessary to entitle him to maintain this action, and that nothing happened, or was done, to prevent him from maintaining the same, and claimed the $6,000 insured; and, having taken issue on defendants\u2019 pleas, went down to trial, but, on the trial, changes his ground entirely, and, by the time we reach the end of the new pleadings, we find the case wholly changed. In the first added count, the plaintiff says he had other insurance on the property, of which defendant had notice, and agreed to insure having such knowledge, and to mention the same on the policy, and have the same endorsed thereon; but, he says, defendants, by mistake, omitted to mention in or endorse same on policy, and of which he, plaintiff, had no knowledge until after the fire, and, therefore, he says, the policy or contract ought to be reformed and amended by the mention therein of the existence of such other insurance; and an equitable replication to defendants\u2019 third plea, which sets up that there was other insurance not notified to defendants and mentioned in or endorsed on policy, whereby policy was void, after setting out the condition of the policy, avers that plaintiff made application for the insurance to defendants\u2019 agent, authorized to receive applications for insurance and the payment of premiums, and to grant interim receipts on defendants\u2019 behalf; that at the time of application, plaintiff informed the agent of the existence of this insurance, and mentioned and instructed him to have same endorsed, or otherwise acknowledged by defendants in writing, which agent undertook to do, and defendants omitted or neglected to have same done; and before policy was delivered, loss occurred, and plaintiff had no notice until after loss that same was not done.\nIn plaintiff\u2019s application for insurance, dated 6th February, 1875, of \u201cQuestions to be answered by the applicant,\u201d in answer to question 11: \u201cWhat insurance is effected on the property now to be insured, and with what companies? Answer: Hastings Mutual, $2,000; Canadian Mutual, $3,000.\u201d And, at the end of the queries, follows this:\n\u201cAnd lastly, it is expressly agreed on the part of the Applicant that this Application and Survey, as well as the Diagram of the premises herewith, shall form part and be a condition of this Insurance Contract. The Company is not to be held liable for any loss or damage by fire caused by locomtive engines, unless special insured against.\u201d\nOn this application the agent granted a provisional receipt in the following form:\n\u201cPROVINCIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA.\n\u201cHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO.\n\u201cAgent\u2019s Office, 7th February, 1875\n\u201cProvisional Receipt No.\n\u201cReceived from of Post Office the sum of dollars, being the premium for an insurance to the extent of dollars on the property described in application of this date, numbered subject, however, to the approval of the Board of Directors in Toronto, who shall have power to cancel this contract at any time within thirty days from this date, by causing a notice to that effect to be mailed to the applicant at the above Post Office; and it is hereby mutually agreed that, unless this receipt be followed by a policy within the said thirty days from this date, the contract of insurance shall wholly cease and determine; and all liability on the part of the Company shall be at an end. The nondelivery of a policy within the time specified is to be taken, with or without notice, as absolute and incontrovertible evidence of the rejection of this contract of insurance by the said Board of Directors. In either event, the premium will be returned on application to the local agent issuing this receipt, less the proportion chargeable for the time which the said property was insured.\n\u201cAGENT.\n\u201cN.B.\u2014Any existing assurance on the property must be notified at the issuing of this receipt, or the contract is void. Please read this receipt in order to make yourself acquainted with its terms.\u201d\nAnd the Company say they subsequently issued a \u201cShort Policy,\u201d as it is termed, in this form:\u2014\n\u201cPROVINCIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA.\n\u201cHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONTARIO.\n\u201cCertificate of Fire Insurance, for a term not exceeding three months.\n\u201cTORONTO, 19th February, 1875.\n\u201cNo. 2081.\n\u201cThis certifies that Messrs. J. Eastwood & Co., of Hamilton, have insured under, and subject to all conditions of the policies of the Provincial Insurance Company of Canada, of which the assured admits cognizance, the sum of eight hundred dollars on paper hangings, in bales and in cases in bond in the Grand Trunk Freight Sheds, in Hamilton, as per application No. 68,838, for one month, to wit, from the 18th day of February, 1875, to the 18th day of March, 1875, at noon; amount, $800, premium $2.40; which premium is hereby acknowledged to have been received. Loss (if any) payable to\n\u201c(Signed,)A. HARVEY,\n\u201cManager.\u201d\n\u201cNOTE.\u2014This Certificate of Insurance will, in the event of loss, be replaced by a policy, if required.\u201d\nPlaintiff says he never received any such instrument; in fact, in his evidence, repudiates any knowledge of it. But he says, after the fire he applied for, and the Company issued a policy, that on which the plaintiff originally declared.\nIf there was no short policy, plaintiff is clearly out of Court. Unless followed by a policy within 30 days from date of the provisional receipt, the insurance, by the terms of the receipt, wholly ceased, and, without any \u201cshort\u201d policy on which to base it, the long policy, issued after the 30 days and after the fire, if of any force or effect at all, must necessarily be an entirely new and distinct contract, as to which there could be no pretence for saying any conditions should be expunged, or into which, it could be contended, any new provisions should be incorporated. Notwithstanding, however, what plaintiff says, the evidence shows a short policy was issued, whether it ever reached plaintiff or not, and, no doubt, would bind the Company from the moment they issued it and put it en route for plaintiff\u2019, though he may never have received it. This, though immaterial, as the Company do not deny the issue of the short policy, and have substituted the long policy sued on, shows how very loosely and with almost reckless indifference plaintiff treated this insurance, and may perhaps account for the manner he acted in reference to the application, as we shall see; for if, as he says, he never did receive the short policy, and never had any intimation that it had been issued,\u2014as the thirty days named in the receipt expired thirty days after the 7th February, which would be the 9th or 10th of March,\u2014he must, from that time till the issue of the policy after the fire, have been under the impression that he was wholly uninsured by defendants, and it is not easy to understand upon what principle he applied for and expected a policy, for by the terms of his agreement, as contained in the provisional receipt, the non-delivery of a short or long policy within the 30 days from the date of the receipt is made absolute and incontrovertible evidence of the rejection of the contract of insurance, and the contract of insurance under the provisional receipt wholly ceased and determined, and all liability of the Company was at an end. But, assuming, as I think we must, that a short policy was issued, I think the evidence shows that, while both the agent Suter and Billington knew there was insurance in the Gore on the premises, neither actually knew whether any of it was on the stock. Suter says positively:\u2014\nAt the date of application I was not aware of it (that the property was insured in the Gore). I knew there was existing insurances on the property, but I was not aware there was in the Gore Mutual.\nAnd again:\nI was well aware there was a policy in the Gore Mutual on the premises, but neither Mr. Billington nor I knew that the Gore policy covered the stock.\nAnd Mr. Billington says:\u2014\nI spoke particularly of the Gore Mutual, and we could not find it (the policy) We knew there was a policy existing, and I thought there was a part on stock, but I did not know what part.\nMr. Billington appears to have been anxious to have had any insurance that was on the stock mentioned in the application, and was even willing to have had the whole amount of the $3,000 inserted as on stock, though he knew that sum was not on stock. The contract certainly contemplates a true statement in this particular. It is not necessary to enquire whether, had he done this, it would have helped him, for it was not done, evidently, with Billington\u2019s knowledge and acquiescence. Instead of providing himself with the information necessary to enable him properly to fill up his application, he appears to have signed an application in blank, or partly in blank, for the greater part was filled in by the brother of the agent, at the agent\u2019s place of business, in the absence of the plaintiff, who trusted to the agent to obtain for him the amount, if any, of the insurance actually on the stock in the Gore Mutual and have it inserted in the application, which the agent never did, and could not do, because he never obtained the necessary information.\nThe answer to the question in the application was written by the brother of the agent; the agent says his handwriting stops at the word \u201cunfinished,\u201d which is in the description of the property, at the first line of the application following the heading. That question was:\u2014\nWhat insurance is effected on the property now to be insured, and with what company? Hastings Mutual, $2,000; Canadian Mutual, $3,000.\nBillington was quite alive to the necessity of transmitting a statement of all other insurances to the Company, and appears to have known full well the consequences of not doing so, for he says, in answer to the question:\u2014\nI suppose you knew the effect of concealing these particulars? Yes. Q. You knew the effect that it would have on your policy? I thought it would vitiate policy.\nIf Billington chose to trust to Suter to obtain the information for him, and he failed to do so, how can this effect the Company? Instead of getting himself the precise information required to enable him to make a proper application, as was his interest and his duty to the Company, he trusts to Suter to get it for him. Surely, he must take the consequences of any neglect on Suter\u2019s part. He says:\u2014\nI supposed every thing was satisfactory or he would let me know. He took my money and I supposed the thing was all right.\nIn other words, he trusted Suter to do for him what he ought to have done for himself, and, too late, discovers he has trusted to a broken reed.\nIn all this, Suter was in no way representing the Company in any matter within the scope of his authority or duty; he was acting solely for Billington\u2019s accommodation. The plaintiff, evidently under the impression that the insurance in the Gore partially covered the stock, and knowing the necessity of putting a true statement in reference thereto in his application, gives an incomplete application to the agent, and relies upon his ascertaining the facts for him, not for the Company, as to this insurance, and putting the information so to be obtained in the application before transmitting it. The agent or friend, without ascertaining the state of the Gore\u2019s insurance, transmits the application filled up by his brother, in which no reference is made to the Gore\u2019s insurance. The Company, acting on the application so transmitted (after being pressed by the agent), apparently, somewhat reluctantly issue the short policy. It is very clear that, as between Billington and the agent, the latter should have obtained the information as he promised, and which he said was accessible to him, or he should have notified Billington, but he did neither.\nWithout obtaining this information, it is equally clear that neither plaintiff nor the agent were in the position to fill in a proper application, for neither knew for a certainty that there was really any insurance on stock in the Gore, though plaintiff thought there was, but neither knew how much, and, therefore, neither could fully and truthfully fill in the application.\nHad Billington been desirous of repudiating any contract based on this application, I can well understand how he might, with much force, contend that the agent transmitted an application he had never authorized him to send. But if, on the contrary, he is desirous of availing himself of a contract, based on the application so sent, I am at a loss to understand how he can accept the contract, and say it was based on any mistake or error on the part of the Company, and that they should have inserted in the policy the amount of an insurance, of which both the assured and the agent were ignorant, and which does not appear to have been ascertained by either of them till after the fire occurred and the Gore policy was found.\nThe insurance under the provisional receipt was clearly superseded by the short policy, and by the terms of that contract must the plaintiff be bound if he claims to be insured at all. How can he claim to have the policy reformed and a new contract made.\nThe agent\u2019s power to bind the Company by a contract of insurance was limited to the provisional contract. If no certificate or short term policy was issued, this contract was unquestionably at an end at the expiration of 30 days. If a certificate was issued by Company and accepted by plaintiff, that became the contract between them, and, by the terms of that contract; both parties are bound. The insurance under this certificate was made subject to all the conditions of defendants\u2019 policies, \u201cof which the assured admits cognizance.\u201d\nThe condition as to other insurance was not complied with, and, according to the terms of the contract, the insurance was at an end.\nI can discover nothing whatever to justify any Court in saying that the defendants ever agreed to insure plaintiff on any other terms or conditions than were contained in the original receipt during the time that was in force, or than were contained in the subsequent certificate of insurance, or the policy by which it was afterwards replaced, or that the plaintiff ever expected to be insured on any exceptional terms; or that, so far as the Company is concerned, there was any mistake in the terms of this contract; or that the Company were ever asked or expected by the plaintiff to alter, vary, expunge, or waive, any one of the conditions contained in their policies.\nIn my opinion, the whole trouble has arisen from no fault or default on the part of the Company, but from plaintiff\u2019s relying on others to do for him what he should have done for himself, or that he should have taken care to see that those he entrusted had done as they promised.\nAs I can discover no omission or insertion of a material stipulation contrary to the intention of both parties and under a mutual mistake, and, therefore, nothing to reform, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs of appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Osler, Gwynne & Teetzel.\nSolicitors for respondent: Murray, Barwick & Lyon.\n[1] 2 App. Rep.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\n37 Vic., c. 13\u2014Interest on deposit in Court\u2014Officer of Court not entitled to interest, if received by him\u2014Summary jurisdiction of Court over its officers\u2014Order of Court upon its own officer, when obtained by a third party, is a final order appealable under sec. 11 of 38 Vic., c. 11.\nUnder 31 Vic., c. 12, and 37 Vic., c. 13, the Minister of Public Works of the Dominion of Canada appropriated to the use of the Dominion certain lands in Yarmouth County, known as \"Bunker Island.\" In accordance with said Acts, on the 2nd April, A. D. 1875, he paid into the hands of W., prothonotary at Halifax, the sum of $6,180 as compensation and interest, as provided by those Acts, to be thereafter appropriated among the owners of said island. This sum was paid at several times, by order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, to one A., as owner, to one G., as mortgagee, and to others entitled, less ten dollars. As the money had remained in the hands of W., the prothonotary of the Court, for some time, H., attorney for G., applied to the Supreme Court for an order of the Court calling upon W., the prothonotary, to pay over the interest upon G.'s proportion of the moneys, which interest (H. was informed) had been received by the prothonotary from the bank where he had placed the amount on deposit. W. resisted the application on the ground that he was not answerable to the proprietor of the principal, or to the Court, for interest, but did not deny that interest had been received by him. A rule nisi was granted by the Court and made absolute, ordering the prothonotary to pay whatever rate of interest he received on the amount.\nHeld: 1. That the prothonotary was not entitled to any interest which the amount deposited earned while under the control of the Court. That, in ordering the prothonotary to pay over the interest received by him, the Court was simply exercising the summary jurisdiction which each of the Superior Courts has over all; its immediate officers. (Fournier and Henry, J.J., dissenting.)\n2. That the order appealed from, being a decision on an application by a third party to the Court, was appealable under the 11th sec. of 38 Vic., c. 11. (Fournier J., dissenting, and Taschereau, J., dubitante.)\nThis was an appeal at the instance of Martin I. Witkins, Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Halifax, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making absolute a rule nisi of that Court as follows:\u2014\n\"IN THE SUPREME COURT, 1878.\n\"Halifax, SS.\n\"IN RE BUNKER'S ISLAND.\n\"On argument of the rule nisi herein, calling upon Martin I. Wilkins, the prothonotary of this honorable Court, at Halifax, to pay over to Thomas O. Geddes the interest upon money of the said Geddes, paid into the hands of the said prothonotary, under and by virtue of Chapter 13 of the Acts of the Dominion, A. D. 1874, and on motion of counsel:\u2014\n\"It is hereby ordered that said Martin I. Wilkins do forthwith, upon being served with a copy of this order, pay to said Thomas O. Geddes, or his attorney, the sum of two hundred and sixty dollars and twenty-eight cents, being the amount of said interest at four per centum per annum during the period said moneys were in his hands and invested in the banks.\n\"And that said Thomas O. Geddes do thereupon pay the said prothonotary the sum of twenty-six dollars and two cents, being ten per centum upon said interest accruing upon the principal sum, the latter sum being payable to said prothonotary as a commission for handling the principal sum, and in full for such service. \"Dated at Halifax this 15th day of May, A.D. 1878.\n\"On motion of Mr. C. S. Harrington of counsel with Geddes.\n\"By the Court,\n\"(Sgd.) \"M. I. Wilkins,\n\"Prothonotary.\"\nThe facts as agreed upon by the parties are shortly as follows:\u2014\nIn the year 1875 the Minister of Public Works for the Dominion of Canada appropriated certain lands in the County of Yarmouth for public purposes, under the provisions of the Dominion Satutes, 31 Vic., c. 12, and 37 Vic., c. 13, in amendment thereof, and paid to the said prothonotary of the said Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, at Halifax, on the second day of April, A.D. 1875, as required by the said Acts, the sum of six thousand one hundred and eighty dollars.\nThis sum was paid at several times by order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to the parties entitled, less the sum of ten dollars, now in the hands of the said prothonotary, for disposition as the Court might order.\nIn consequence of some dispute between the claimants of the funds deposited, the money was not withdrawn immediately, but remained in the custody and under the control of the prothonotary for the time set out in the following affidavit:\u2014\n\"I, Charles Harrington, of the City and County of Halifax, Esquire, do make oath, and say as follows:\n\"1st. 1 say that under and by virtue of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, passed in the year 1874, the Minister of Public Works of the Dominion of Canada appropriated to the uses of this Dominion certain lands in the County of Yarmouth, known as Bunker's Island. That by virtue of the authority vested in him by said Act, he did, on the thirteenth day of April, A.D. 1875, pay into the hands of Martin I. Wilkins, Esq., prothonotary of this honorable Court, the sum of six thousand one hundred and eighty dollars as compensation money, and interest, to be thereafter appropriated according to law among the several owners of the said island, and an order or notice, in compliance with sec. 2 of said Act, was then published, calling upon all parties interested to appear and prove their title to the money aforesaid.\n\"2nd. I say that proceedings were thereupon taken by Ebenezer E. Archibald, the owner of the land, and Thomas O. Geddes, a mortgagee, to procure payment out of the fund in Court, but no money was actually paid out of said fund by said prothonotary until on or about the twenty-seventh day of March, A.D. 1876, on which date the sum of five thousand five hundred and fifty-five dollars was paid as follows:\nFor Thos. O. Geddes\n$3,451.78\nFor E. E. Archibald\n2,103.22\n$5,555.00\nthe above being the amount due said Archibald for his fee simple, and the undisputed amount due said Geddes upon his mortgage.\n\"That from the date last above mentioned until on or about the 22nd day of August, A.D. 1877, the balance of six hundred and twenty dollars remained in the hands of the said Martin I. Wilkins, and on that date the further sum of four hundred and ninety dollars was paid to said Thomas O. Geddes by order of His Lordship the Chief Justice. I crave leave to refer to the original papers on file herein, from which the facts above set out will more fully appear.\n\"3rd. Lastly, I say that I am informed, and verily believe, that the said sum of $6,180 was placed in the bank upon deposit receipt by the prothonotary aforesaid, and I pray an order of this Honorable Court for the payment due to Thomas O. Geddes of the interest upon the proportion of the moneys aforesaid belonging to him.\"\nThe prothonotary resisted the application, and the question raised on this appeal was whether, for the period during which this money was deposited with the prothonotary, he was liable to pay interest on the amount at the rate of four per cent. per annum.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for Appellant:\nOn the question of jurisdiction see Kent's Commen.[1]; Osborn v. U. S. Bank[2]; Citizens' Bank of Steubenville v. Wright[3]; Weston v. The City Council of Charleston[4].\nOn the merits, I contend that if the fact that any interest on the money deposited by the Minister had been received by the prothonotary, were established by legal evidence, which it was not, such interest would not be held by him to the use of Respondent, but to the use of the Minister, who alone could demand an account of it, and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia had no power or authority to decide that the officer held such interest, to the use of \"Respondent, nor had they any power to order him to pay it to the \"Respondent, who was a mortgagee who had been paid off.\nAll we know is, that the Appellant is called upon to pay a sum of money to the Respondent, with whom he had no privity.\nIf the Respondent had any legal or equitable claim against the prothonotary, for interest on the moneys deposited, or money had and received in any other manner to his use, he should have enforced his demand by an action at law or in equity, and the Supreme Court and its Judges have no power, under the Statute, to determine on a summary application, whether he has such claim or not.\nMoreover, there are facts alleged upon which the judgment proceeds which do not exist at all. There is no evidence where the money was deposited and what interest was received. This case, on principle, should have been treated as a suit at law between the Respondent and the Appellant, and it was the duty of the Respondent to establish his case by evidence. The burden was upon him, and the prothonotary was under no obligation to deny facts that had not been so established, and the Court had no right to assume, in the absence of such denial, that the facts were as set forth in the judgment. See Brown v. Southwise[5].\nAppellant also contends, that the Court has no power to order any further interest to be paid than the Statute directs; and by virtue of the Statute the parties are entitled to no more than six months' interest under any circumstances, except only in the case of the delay of the order beyond that term, being occasioned by the default of the minister.\nWhen moneys are paid in under these Statutes, the officer with whom it is deposited is not required to invest them at interest, and he has no right to lend them, but is bound to keep and pay them out when ordered to do so under the Statutes. Attorney General v. Lind[6].\nMr. Haliburton, Q. C., for Respondent:\u2014\nThis was not a \"final judgment\" in \"a case,\" which, under the Supreme Court Act, can be a subject of appeal to this Court. The application is only an interlocutory proceeding, and it is an order of the Court to its own officer in re Bunker's Island. Reference was made to In re Freeman et al[7], and Conkling's Treatise on U. S. Courts[8]. In this case, if the prothonotary had any reason to object to the compensation awarded him, he should have filed a petition of right. Crawford et al v. Attorney General[9]. Now, the rule ordered that whatever money he had received, be was to account for it; and what does he do, he answers that he was not bound to pay interest. I submit that even in the case of a trustee, if he is charged with interest, the onus of proving he has not received it, remains upon him. But there is a distinction to be drawn between a public officer and an ordinary party. No official can retain as a perquisite any interest received by him on public monies in his hands. This is conclusively established by Lonsdale v. Church[10]; see also Attorney General v. Hoseason[11]; DeBolt v. Trustees of Cincinnati Township[12].\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., in reply:\u2014\nThe case of Lonsdale v. Church is a case in which the officer had not the money forthcoming. Here the money was paid promptly. If the Respondent is entitled to interest, it should be paid by the Crown, and not by the officer who has had the risk of safely keeping the money.\nThe Appellant does not come here in conflict with the Court, but only says that the Respondent has failed utterly to prove anything against him.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\n(After stating the facts as agreed upon by the parties.) By 31 Vic. c. 12, sec. 2, and sub-sec. 2 of sec. 2, 37 Vic., c. 18, the Minister of Public Works is authorized to pay compensation money, or award, into the office of one of the Superior Courts for the Province, in which the lands are situate (with interest thereon for six months), subject to the claims of all persons seeking compensation, all which claims are to be received and adjudged upon by the Court, and the Court shall make such order for the distribution, payment, or investment of the compensation, and for the securing of the rights of all parties interested, as to right and justice, and according to the provisions of the Act and to law shall appertain.\nBy virtue of these Acts the Minister of Public Works appropriated to the use of the Dominion certain lands in Yarmouth County, known as Bunker's Island, and, in accordance with the Acts, paid, on the 2nd April, 1875, into the office of the prothonotary, at Halifax, the now Appellant, $6,180, as compensation and interest to be thereafter appropriated among the owners of this island. On the 27th March, 1876, $3,451.78 was paid to T. O. Geddes, mortgagee of the island, and $2,103.22 to Archibald, the owner. From 27th March, 1876, to 22nd August, 1877, the balance of $670 remained in the hands of the prothonotary, when the further sum of $490 was paid Geddes, by the order of the Chief Justice, to whom the master's report had been referred for a final decision, and a further sum of $106.50, as interest over and above the amount already paid in, was ordered to be paid by the Minister of Public Works to the prothonotary, and by which order, after appropriating certain sums to parties interested in said island, the prothonotary was directed to pay balance then in his hands to Geddes.\nThe legal custodian of this money was the Court. The money was by the Statute paid into \"the office of one of the Superior Courts for the Province in which the lands are situate,\" to be distributed by order of the Court, after receiving and adjudicating on all claims thereto, and they were also bound, not only to make such order for the distribution, payment, or investment of the compensation, but also \"for the securing of the rights of all parties interested, as to right and justice, and according to the provisions of this Act and to law, shall appertain.\" The prothonotary of the Court, as the officer of the Court in charge of the office of the Court, was, no doubt, the person to receive it, but he had no personal interest in the money, and no right to use the money for his own personal gain or benefit, nor in or to any money that money produced had he any right or title, nor had he any legal control over it, beyond taking charge of it as an officer of the Court, as he would have of any paper, document, or record deposited or fyled in the office of the Court; and had he allowed the money to remain in the office of the Court, and kept it in the office with the same care that he was bound to keep the \"valuable records and other deposits of the Court, he would have discharged his duty, and no other or greater obligation was imposed on him. The applicant's contention in this case is, that the money being thus in his hands, as the mere ministerial custodian of the Court, he, instead of allowing the money to remain in the office, deposited it, no doubt for greater safety, in a bank where interest was allowed on deposits, and he now claims from the Court that so much of such interest as accrued from his portion of the amount deposited belongs to him, on the ground that the income belongs to the corpus, and must go with it to the proprietor; that it does not belong to the Court, in whose custody the law placed the principal, still less to the ministerial officer of the Court, who had simply legally the physical custody as the officer of the Court, subject to the order of the Court. I think it appertains to right and justice and to law, that to whomsoever the money deposited in the bank belongs, to him belongs the interest that money earned.\nThe applicant, by affidavit, applied to the Court in these words:\nLastly, I say that I am informed, and verily believe, that the said sum of $6,180 was placed in the bank, upon deposit receipt, by the prothonotary aforesaid, and I pray an order of this honorable Court for the payment due to Thomas O. Geddes of the interest upon the proportion of the moneys aforesaid belonging to him.\nWhereupon the Court granted in these terms the rule nisi, on which the rule absolute now appealed from was based:\nOn reading the affidavit of C. S. Harrington, sworn on the second day of March, A.D., 1878, the papers on file herein, and on motion of counsel, it is hereby ordered\u2014\nThat Martin I. Wilkins, the prothonotary at Halifax, do pay to Thomas O. Geddes, or his attorney, interest upon the money of said Thomas O. Geddes paid into the hands of said Martin I. Wilkins, as prothonotary, aforesaid, in the above matter, at the rate of four per centum per annum, or whatever other rate of interest the said prothonotary may have received upon the said money from the time said money was paid into his hands until the time at which the same was paid out to Thomas O. Geddes, aforesaid, deducting from said interest whatever allowance, if any, the Court shall award said Martin I. Wilkins (as a commission for receiving and paying out the same) from money of said Geddes, unless cause to the contrary be shewn before this honorable Court on Friday, 29th day of March, A. D. 1878, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon.\nHalifax, March 25, A.D. 1878.\nThis was no more nor less than the Court practically calling upon its officer to inform the Court, whether the information the applicant had received was correct, and intimating that any interest received belonged, not to the Court or its officer, but to the owner of the fund, and assuming the rate of interest to be four per cent., intimating to him that rate as the amount to be paid, or, if not the correct amount, \"whatever other rate of interest the said prothonotary may have received upon the said money from the time the said money was paid into his hands until the time at which the same was paid out\" to Geddes, deducting from said interest whatever allowance the Court should award as a commission to the prothonotary. On service of this rule, I think it was the duty of the prothonotary, clearly and unequivocally, to have informed the Court what he, as the officer, had done with the money deposited in the Court; that the burthen of such a disclosure rested entirely with him; what had been done with the money might, or might not, be within the knowledge of the Court, but it certainly was most peculiarly within the knowledge of the prothonotary. If the amount had remained in the office as it was deposited, he should have said so; if it had not, he should have said so, and should have minutely detailed to the Court every particular connected with the money from the time it came into the office till the time it passed into the hands of the respective proprietors. All information in respect thereof being property of the Court, and not the private property of the officer to be given the Court, or withheld, as he might think would best serve his private interests. Instead, however, of so dealing with the Court, he resists the application on an affidavit, in which, after in section 1 stating the amount deposited, and the amount paid out under order of the Court, and in sec. 2 stating what he gathers from the papers on file as to this deposit, the prothonotary concludes that the parties must have been paid the price of their land and interest, and, therefore, he says, it is to be presumed that Mr. Geddes and his attorney have not alleged that he has not received the full amount of his claim.\nIt is very clear that the applicant does not complain that he has not received the full amount of his claim, but his complaint is that he has not received the interest which the amount of his claim produced. In sec. 3 the prothonotary puts forward what he considers his duty to be in these words:\u2014\n3rd. I do not receive money deposited on any condition, express or implied, that I am to pay interest for the use of the same, as it is not paid to me for my benefit or advantage, but for the convenience of the depositor, and my duty requires me to keep and pay it to those who are legally entitled to take it out of Court. I am neither bound to pay interest on money deposited with me, nor am I bound to invest it at interest for the depositor.\nAnd infection 4 he complains of the injustice of a Provincial Statute not making proper compensation to persons keeping money for other persons in two cases, and claims it, by implication, authorizes compensation in other cases. In section 5 he says, his commission on money deposited is still open for arrangement; and, in sections 6, 7 and 8 he says:\n6th. Money so deposited is not paid to me at my request, nor am I a voluntary bailee or depository in respect of it, but I am compelled to accept and take the risk of keeping it until it is called for, and know of no principle, legal or equitable, on which I can be called upon either to pay interest, invest at interest, or account for interest on money so forced upon me.\n7th. Mr. Geddes has no legal claim on me that I am aware of for any money received by me to his use, and if he supposes that he has such claim the courts of justice are open to him and he can there enforce his rights.\n8th. I do not think that Mr. Geddes, or any other person, can legally call on me to state how I deal with money deposited with me. My duty requires me to keep it and pay it out to those who are legally entitled to demand it. I have so kept and disposed of the money in question, and Mr. Geddes has no right to enquire how I employed, or whether I employed the money, or simply kept it locked up in my moneybox, which are entirely at my own discretion.\nAnd closes his affidavit with section 9 in these words:\n9th. I do not believe that Mr. Geddes has a claim for any amount from any person in respect of his land, and I consider this motion a mere speculation to try and obtain money to which he has no just or legal claim. And this is the only cause he shows against this rule nisi. I do not think it can be denied that the case was brought forward and, dealt with in a somewhat loose and not altogether satisfactory manner. There are, no doubt, facts put forward in the judgment of the Court which are not to be found in the affidavits, but reading the affidavits before the Court, and especially that of the Defendants, I think we are bound to assume, that no point was raised, or controversy had, as to the fact of the money having been in the bank at interest, or that the rate claimed was too high, but that the whole controversy was as to the prothonotary's right to retain the interest, and as to the right of the Court to interfere in the matter. And the reason is very obvious; for, if the money had never been in the bank, then the report to the Court of that fact by the prothonotary would have instantly answered the application; so, again, if the prothonotary had raised the question that that fact was not sufficiently before the Court, all the Court would have had to do would be to allow the officer to state whether the money had remained in the office, or had been deposited, and, if the latter, on what terms. Nobody, I think, can doubt that the Court had sufficient jurisdiction and power over its officer to compel this. But the substantial and only material question raised was, that the applicant's money had, while subject to the control of the Court, produced interest, which he claims, and the way in which the prothonotary met the case relieves it from difficulty. Mr. Wilkins appears to think that, as the money was deposited in the office of the Court, and he was the officer in charge, he could do with it as he pleased, and was not liable to account to anyone for what he did with it, so long as he had the exact amount deposited forthcoming to answer any order the Court might make in reference to it; in other words, for the time being, it was, as it were, his own private business, and for his conduct in reference to which he was accountable, neither to the owner of the money, nor to the Court. In this mode of putting the case, the officer lost sight of his position, and assumed the functions of the Court. Instead of dictating to the Court in an affidavit what his duties and rights were, he should, I think, have frankly put forward the facts, and then, upon those facts, have asked the Court to decide.\nIf he had never received any interest, all he had to do was to say so, and there the matter must have ended. If 4 per cent. was more than he actually received, all he had to do was to say how much he received, and the applicant could get no more. He raises no issue of fact, he does not deny that the money was deposited in the bank on interest, nor that that interest was as much as 4 per cent. per annum. Can anybody read this affidavit in any other light than as admitting, by irresistible implication, or inference, that he did deposit the money in the bank at a rate of interest not less than 4 per cent., and that he considered and believed (I have no doubt honestly, though, I think, very erroneously,) that what he so received, he was entitled to retain, either by way of compensation, or because, so long as he had the money forthcoming to respond to any order of the Court made in reference thereto, no one had any right to inquire what he did with the money, and if he invested or deposited, whereby gain or interest accrued from it, such increase was his private emolument, as to which he was not accountable to any person. In all which contentions, I humbly think, he was most unequivocally wrong. The question of compensation cannot in any way affect this case. If he is entitled to more than the Court have awarded him, he must make an application in the proper form and to the proper quarter, he cannot take charge of the deposits in the Court, and, in defiance of the Court, hold the same till what he may consider his just claims are satisfied.\nNor can he treat the money deposited in the Court in any way as his private property, or make out of it on his own account any personal gain, profit, or emolument; if deposited for convenience or safe-keeping in a bank, whether by order of the Court, or by act of the officer, and interest is thereby earned, such interest goes with the principal, and must be accounted for to the owner as his property, as much as the principal from which it was derived; it being, so much fruit, so much increase on the money, and must follow the ownership of the money and go to the proprietor.\nUnder ordinary circumstances between party and party, when a person, not expressly a trustee, has dealt with another's money, the law raises a trust by implication, and, though he invests the money without the assent of the owner, he is held a trustee for the owner's benefit[13].\nThe law is too clear to be disputed that any interest made by an agent by the use of the principal's money belongs to the latter, and it is laid down in a general rule by Story on Agency adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench in Morison v. Thompson[14], that in all cases when a person is, either actually or constructively, an agent for other persons, all profits and advantages made by him in the business, are to be for the benefit of his employers. And in Paley \"On, Principal and Agent\"[15], it is said:\u2014\nAnd not only interest, but every other sort of profit or advantage clandestinely derived by an agent from dealing or speculating with his principals' effects, is the property of the latter, and must be accounted for. So that if an agent who has purchased goods according to order, sell them again to advantage, with a view of appropriating the gain to himself, although he should have answered the loss if any, yet his employer is entitled to the profits.\nAnd Lord Cockburn, in Morison v. Thompson, after citing these authorities, adds:\nIn our judgment, the result of these authorities is, that whilst an agent is bound to account to his principal or employer for all profits made by him in the course of his employment, or service, and is compelled to account in equity, there is at the same time a duty, which we consider a legal duty, clearly incumbent upon him, whenever any profit so made has reached his hands, and there is no account in regard to them remaining to be taken and adjusted between him and his employer, to pay over the amount as money absolutely belonging to his employer.\nIf this is so between individuals, it is scarcely necessary to say what must be the duty of an officer of the Court to the Court, and of the officer and of the Court to the party. The duty of the prothonotary was clear to account to the court for all profits made out of this money, or which the money earned for itself on deposit in the bank, and which came to his hands as prothonotary. The duty of the Court was clear to order the payment of such earnings or profits to the applicant, and the duty of the prothonotary was to pay over the amount as absolutely belonging to the applicant.\nWhile the officer of the Court can never be permitted to make any profit to himself, by using or investing the funds deposited in Court to be disposed of by the Court, he would clearly be exempt from any loss occurring to those funds while in his charge as an officer of the Court, unless, indeed, he has been guilty of negligence, malversation or fraud. If he performs his duty, he may claim indemnity from all personal loss. This is no new doctrine; it is equally applicable to trustees, agents, guardians and wards, and such like relations.\nThis is not to be treated in anyway as a suit between party and party; there is no suit about it. It is simply the exercise of the summary jurisdiction which each of the Superior Courts has over all its own immediate officers. It has nothing to do directly with the distribution of compensation money deposited under the Statute. It is an application to the Court outside, and independent of the distribution, though, it is true, growing out of the amount apportioned. It is an application by a party, to whom a portion of the amount deposited has been awarded, for the payment to him out of Court of money which the amount awarded him earned, while under the control of the Court, as interest from the bank, where it had been deposited for safe keeping, which interest so earned, the applicant claims, belongs to the principal, and so inured to his benefit as owner of the corpus from whence the interest proceeded; and, therefore, the applicant seeks an order from the Court to its officer to pay over to him the amount. In principle, the application is precisely similar to an application to the Court for an order for the payment of interest, supposing the money had been deposited in the bank on interest by order of the Court. If this money had been deposited in the bank of deposit of the Court, as it would have been in accordance with the practice in New Brunswick, to the credit of the cause or matter in which it was paid in, subject to the order of the Court, no difficulty would ever have arisen. Though not done by order of the Court, it was done by the officer of the Court. Surely this cannot legally take from the owner of the money the produce of the money and give it to an officer of the Court, who can pretend to no interest in the money, nor any control over it beyond what the Court may authorize him to exercise.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion, that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, as an appeal from a final rule or order[16], though I have had some doubt on this point. There are many eases reported in the Privy Council reports, and referred to in Mr. Macpherson's book on the practice of the Judicial Committee, which show that an appeal does not lie from rules or orders made by Colonial and East Indian Courts\u2014from which the Privy Council possesses an appellate jurisdiction defined by the charters establishing such Courts, in the same terms as that possessed by this Court\u2014where such rules and orders are made upon their own officers.\nThe rule or order is regarded, in such cases, rather as a command or direction by the Court to its own ministerial officer, than a judicial determination or decision. I find, however, in all these cases, that the Court acted of its own motion, and there was no third party invoking the exercise of its jurisdiction; and this distinction, in my judgment, makes the principle I have referred to inapplicable in the present case; for there being here a party making a claim upon the prothonotary, the order of the Court was strictly a judicial decision or determination, whilst in the cases I have referred to, the Court, ex mero motu making an order upon its own officer, was acting rather as a party exercising superior authority over its subordinate, than as a judicial tribunal deciding between adverse and contesting parties. For these reasons we are, I think, bound to entertain the appeal, as being \"a decision, rule, or order\" coming within the express words of section 11 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe objection raised by the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to make the order, is entirely unfounded. The Appellant says, that the order is not authorized by the Statute[17] under which the money was paid into Court. The answer is, that the order is not made in exercise of any jurisdiction conferred by the Statute, but in exercise of that large and most salutary summary jurisdiction which all courts of justice possess over their own officers.\nThe prothonotary of the Supreme Court was, in contemplation of equity, a trustee of the money paid into Court, and any profit made by him by the use of the money belonged to the persons who should prove to be entitled to it, who could, without any doubt, have compelled the Appellant to account for the interest in the usual manner in which parties are made to account in Courts of Equity. This, however, did not interfere with the summary jurisdiction of the Court over the Appellant, as its officer, and if he did, in fact, receive interest, the Court, in ordering him to account for it, most properly exercised a jurisdiction upon the existence of which this Court ought not to cast a shadow of doubt.\nThen, it is contended, that the evidence was insufficient to show that any interest was, in fact, received by the Appellant. The evidence might, perhaps, have been made stronger, but I agree with the Chief Justice, that it was at least sufficient to warrant the Court in calling upon the prothonotary to answer it, and, upon his refusal to admit or deny the fact of interest having been received by him, to make the presumption against him upon which the Court acted. Mr. Harrington, who, it appears, from the consent paper filed and printed in the case, was the attorney for Archibald and Geddes, the owner and mortgagee of the land, swears, that, to his information and belief, the money paid into Court was placed in the bank by the Appellant \"upon deposit receipt;\" and he prays for an order for the payment of a proportion of the interest to Geddes. I think this necessarily implied that the money had been deposited on interest, and, when the Court were put at arms length by their own officer, who thought fit to place himself in an attitude of defiance towards them, they acted neither erroneously nor rigorously in treating the money as having been deposited at 4 per cent., and the time of deposit as being co-extensive with the period during which the money remained in Court. Strictly speaking, the more regular and satisfactory course would have been for the Court to have made a preliminary rule or order upon the prothonotary to answer specially as to the fact of his having received any, and what amount of interest. But, as the Appellant has chosen to dispute the power of the Court to order him to pay interest, and has chosen to withhold all information as to the fact of his having received any interest, he cannot have been prejudiced by the course which the Court pursued in making an order against him upon the statement contained in Mr. Harrington's affidavit.\nUpon one other point I had some doubt. I think Geddes, the Repondent, was not entitled to be paid anything more than the amount which was strictly due to him upon his mortgage for principal and interest, together with his costs. The claim of a mortgagee is always so limited. The fund in Court represented the land, and as the mortgagee would not, in any event, have been entitled to any of the fruits or profits of the land, as he would have been held accountable if he had gone into possession, so neither is he entitled to the fruits or profits produced or gained by the investment or employment of the fund into which the land has been converted by the paramount authority of the law. The Statute expressly provides that the fund paid into Court \"shall stand in the stead of such lands or property\"[18].\nAny interest received by the Appellant, beyond the amount due to Geddes on his mortgage, would, therefore, have been properly payable to Archibald, the owner of the equity of redemption.\nI cannot, however, satisfactorily ascertain that Geddes received more than was due to him in respect of his mortgage debt, interest and costs, although some of the figures would lead one to suppose that he has received something more. The amount of principal secured by the mortgage, as distinguished from interest, is not, however, anywhere distinctly stated in the case, and, as it is the duty of an Appellate Court to assume the decision of the Court below to be right, in so far as it is not demonstrated to be erroneous, more especially as regards a point not comprised in the Appellant's objections to the judgment appealed from, I cannot say that the order appealed from was in this respect wrong.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe appeal in this case was taken from a rule of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, founded on an affidavit made by Charles Sydney Harrington, of Halifax, Esquire, setting forth that under the Dominion Act, 1874, cap. 13, the sum of $6,180 was, on the 13th day of April, 1875, paid by the Minister to the Appellant, prothonotary of that Court, for certain lands in the County of Yarmouth, known as Bunker's Island, appropriated for the uses of the Dominion; that delay took place in the decision of the Court as to the parties entitled to a distribution of that sum; and that no money was paid out until the 27th March, 1876, when the sum of $5,555.00 was paid to the Respondent for an amount then due on the mortgage he held of the lands in question, and to one E. E. Archibald, as owner; and that a further sum of four hundred and ninety dollars was, on the 22nd of August, paid to the said Respondent, thus leaving $140 still remaining of the $6,180 in the hands of the Appellant. The affidavit craves leave to refer to the original papers on file and concludes thus: \"Lastly, I say that I am informed, and verily believe, that the said sum of $6,180 was placed in the bank upon deposit by the prothonotary aforesaid, and I pray an order of this honorable Court for the payment due to Thomas O. Geddes of the interest upon the proportion of the moneys aforesaid belonging to him.\"\nUpon this affidavit the following rule nisi was granted In re Bunker's Island:\u2014[His Lordship read the rule nisi[19].]\nThis is not a rule calling upon the officer to account to the Court, but an independent procedure to recover money from him in the same way as would have been adopted against one not the officer It is not for the Court to control its officer, but to control money under the terms of the Act, and so we should treat it. The affidavit does not state that there was any balance of the $6,180 remaining in the Appellant's hands, nor is the rule to pay any such balance, but interest, which it is alleged accrued upon it for an indefinite term, and to be subsequently ascertained as the result of some future enquiry, as to the fact of his ever having received any interest, and to what amount, and to deduct from the amount so ascertained whatever allowance the Court should award him as a commission. The Respondent showed cause against the rule, and, by his affidavit, shows conclusively that he paid out, under the order of the Court, all he received, except $10, subject to the order of the Court. I need not refer further to it than to say that it contains no acknowledgment that he ever deposited the money in any bank, or received interest on any part of the sum deposited with him. He is, however, adjudged to pay interest at the rate of four per cent. for every day the money remained in his possession, awaiting the orders of the Court. The Court, I admit, has power over its own officers, and may, by summary process, order the payment of any sum actually in such officer's hands, in any case wherein money is paid into Court, and over which the Court has control, but that is far from this case, as, I think, I shall hereafter show.\nUnder the provisions of the Acts the Court has a prescribed and limited control. By sec. 2 of c. 13 of 37 Vic., under which Act the money for the lands in question and interest is required to be paid to the prothonotary, and over the amount so paid in, the Court has control. By the concluding clause of that section, it is enacted that\u2014\nThe Court shall make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation, and for the securing of the rights of all parties interested as to right and justice, and according to the provisions of this Act and to law shall appertain.\nAs soon as it appeared to the Court necessary, it might have, therefore, ordered the whole amount to be invested, or when, by its judgment, a party became entitled to any portion of it, the Court could have ordered it to be invested, and if the investment became a bad one through the failure of a bank or otherwise, the prothonotary would be held harmless in having obeyed the order of the Court under the provision, but without that the prothonotary would have invested at his peril, and would, in case of failure, be liable to make good the loss. Besides, the prothonotary was required to have the amount always ready to be paid at any moment the Court ordered him to pay it out. No order for the investment was made, and the prothonotary had, therefore, to keep the money safely under his immediate control. He was under no obligation to invest it, but might, for safe keeping, at his own risk, either keep it locked up in his safe, or deposit, on call, in a bank. If there had been, under the circumstances, a legal obligation on the prothonotary to invest, as is sometimes the case with executors, trustees and others, and he did not do so, he would have failed in his duty, and might properly be charged with the loss of interest occasioned thereby. The case, however, of a public officer who receives money that the Court may, at any moment, call upon him to pay over, is very, and essentially different. The money is not under his control, but that of the Court, and, therefore, he is under no legal obligation to invest. If he did so in this case and a loss was incurred, it would be his, and not the Respondent's. In the case of an executor or trustee it would be very different, for, if the latter made a reasonably good investment in the interest of heirs, legatees, or cestui que trusts, the loss would be theirs, not his. In the one case, the prothonotary would guarantee the investment, but, in the other, the executor or trustee would not. In the one case, the profits arising from the investment would go to those whose risk they were at; but, in this case, the Respondent claims profits when running no risk from the party at whose risk the investment undoubtedly would be.\nBefore remarking on other parts of the case, it is proper to test the mode of procedure in it.\nThere was, previously to the proceedings herein, a matter before the Court, but was that matter still open to the jurisdiction of the Court? As I before stated, and as section 2 provides, the Court had summary jurisdiction only over the amount actually shown to have been paid to the Prothonotary under that Act. The case agreed upon has this statement:\u2014\nThe contention on the part of the Respondent, and sustained by the Court, is, that for the period during which this money was deposited with the Prothonotary, he is liable to pay interest on the amount at the rate of four per cent. per annum. And\nThe question was raised by the said rule nisi granted on the 25th March, A.D. 1878, which was made absolute on the 1st day of April, 1878, and from that judgment this appeal is taken by the said Martin I. Wilkins the Prothonotary.\nIt is, therefore, patent that the application is not, either for any part of the money paid into the hands of the Prothonotary, or for the proceeds of any investment ordered by the Court. How, then, or by what authority could the Court, by such a procedure, make any such order? It is true the Appellant is an officer of the Court, but could it by such procedure investigate a tailor's or shoemaker's bill against him, and order him to make payment? There is not the scintilla of evidence, as I shall show, that he ever received any interest on the money, or ever invested it, and if there was, it was not money paid into his hands, under the Act, and, therefore, not under the summary control of the Court, and heading the affidavits and rules \"In re Bunker's Island\" could not give it jurisdiction.\nSection 13 of cap. 94, R. S. of Nova Scotia, 4th series, under title 23 \"of Procedure in Civil Cases,\" and which chapter is entitled \"of Pleadings and Practice in the Supreme Court,\" and under the heading \"Pleadings,\" it is enacted that \"all personal actions shall be commenced by Writ of Summons or Replevin.\" If, therefore, the Appellant had in his hands any money to the use of the Respondent, that question could only be legitimately tried by an action for money had and received, and the Respondent could only recover if he proved money in the Appellant's hands. In that case it would not be sufficient to get some one to swear that he was informed and verily believed\" that the sum was placed in the bank upon deposit receipt.\" No Judge, worthy of his position, would permit such evidence at all, for it is mere hearsay. Besides, it proves nothing, if the statement were true, for it contains no allegation that it was on interest. The mere statement that it was \"upon deposit receipt\" does not necessarily prove that it was on interest, for, if a deposit is made on call, as the money in this case would likely be, if at all, it does not necessarily follow that the bank would pay any interest. But the rule nisi asks for interest for the whole period at four per cent., and the rule absolute appealed from gives it without the deduction of even one day.\nI can see no evidence to sustain such a case, and the Plaintiff in it should, under evidence on a trial, and would, no doubt, be non-suited by any Judge in Nova Scotia. The affidavit says he was informed and believes the money to have been placed in the bank. There are in Halifax several banks\u2014to which of them does \"the bank\" point. There was no evidence before the Court what any bank paid on deposits, and I know of no legislation by which the rate should be fixed by that of the Bank of Nova Scotia, as by the judgment appealed from appears to have been done; nor am I aware of any rule of evidence, or any other, by which a Court can, or is required to, take judicial notice of the rates paid by the banks from time to time, or any of them; and what evidence is there to show that the bank rate in April, 1875, referred to as the proper rate in the judgment, was the proper rate in March, 1876, or August, 1877, when the several payments were made by the Appellant.\nIf, again, it was the duty of the prothonotary to have invested the money on interest, and he failed to do it, he could be made answerable by a proper suit. The judgment, too, mistates the statement in the affidavit of C. S. Harrington, which alleges that he, in that affidavit, stated \"that the amount was placed in the bank upon deposit receipt,\" when the affidavit states only \"that he was informed and verily believed\" that such was the case. I am at a loss how the Court got the information as to the particular usage of the banks, unless from personal enquiry, and that would be but hearsay evidence, and not receivable. I feel bound in this case, as well as in any other, to uphold the rules of evidence which the wisdom of centuries has approved for the safety of every civil right, and, independent of the question of jurisdiction, arising from the incorrect procedure, I feel bound to say the evidence to sustain the rules is totally insufficient. The applicant for a rule nisi is bound to make out by statements in his affidavits a prima facie case, and he cannot otherwise succeed, unless his opponent, in answering, supplies any material deficiency in them. That deficiency which I have pointed out is in no way supplied by the Appellant's affidavit. The judgment, then, is not founded on evidence, but on some other ground not known to, or acknowledged by, the law. It, therefore, in my opinion, cannot stand.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, acting by consent instead of the Court, made, in 1877, the \"distribution\" of the whole sum, except \"$625 to meet Parr's demand, if established, and costs.\" He, however, states his belief that Parr had no claim, and the Respondent, in August of that year, received out of that balance $490, and $125 were by order paid to the master who investigated the rival claims, which left, as the Appellant states, but $10 of the sum paid into his hands. He closes his judgment of distribution in these words: \"In strict justice, a large share, perhaps, of the costs ought to fall on Parr, but I content myself with deciding that he shall pay to Archibald forty-five dollars, being about one-third of the master's fees, which will close the transaction.\" The Court, therefore, by His Lordship the Chief Justice, \"closed the transaction,\" which simply means, made the distribution and did everything the Statute authorized or permitted the Court to do. I feel bound, therefore, to hold the power of the Court under the Statute was executed, and, being so, it could not further deal summarily with any matter with respect to, or arising out of it, and that for the settlement of any other claims or demands, the party making them should have done so by an action. There are other objections that might be taken to the judgment, but I have stated sufficient, in my opinion, to set it aside. I, therefore, think the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Court below reversed.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred with Henry, J.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nIn this case, I have strong doubts as to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine the appeal. It seems to me that an order by a Court of Justice upon one of its officers does not fall under the provisions of sections 11 and 17 of the Supreme Court Act, and is not an appealable case. However, the majority of the Court hold that the appeal lies.\nBy the 37th Vic., ch. 13 D., sections 1, 2 and 3, it is enacted that any compensation money for lands taken or acquired by the Minister of Public Works under the 31st Vic., ch. 12, shall stand in the stead of such lands, and that such money may be deposited by the Minister of Public Works in the office of one of the Superior Courts of the Province in which the lands are situate. The Court, after hearing the parties interested, is empowered \"to make such order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation, and for the securing of the rights of all parties interested, as to right and justice, and according to the provisions of this Act and to law shall appertain.\"\nIn April, 1875, a sum of $6,180 was deposited in the hands of the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in virtue of the said Act. This sum has been distributed by the Court, and the only question now is about the interest on it. Upon a rule obtained by the Respondent, the Prothonotary has been condemned by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to pay the interest on that sum at the rate of four per cent. per annum, and from this judgment the prothonotary appeals to this Court.\nI am of opinion his appeal should be dismissed. One of his contentions is that the Respondent should have proceeded against him by an action at law or in equity, and that the Court could not determine the matter upon a rule. He might as well have pretended the same thing for the whole of the six thousand dollars, and have kept the money till a judgment against him upon a regular action had intervened. Has it ever been pretended that a Sheriff, a prothonotary or any other officer having monies in his hands to be distributed by the Court, must be regularly sued and condemned in an ordinary action before he has to pay it? Such is the contention of the Appellant.\nAnother of the reasons urged by the Appellant is that the Court below had not the power to order him to pay this interest, and that the Statute does not provide for it. The words of the Statute are to me very clear. It enacts that the Court shall make such order for the distribution, payment, or investment of the monies, as to right and justice, and according to law, shall appertain. Does not that give to the Court the most ample powers possible over these monies? How can the Appellant pretend, as he does, that he, alone, was to decide about the investment of this sum; that this was at his sole discretion?\nThe only question in the case upon which I, at first, had any doubts, is about the amount of the interest, four per cent., to which he has been condemned, and how the Court below could come to establish this amount, or any amount, against him without evidence of any kind about it. But a reference to the case has satisfied me that, upon this ground also, Appellant must fail. What was the issue between the parties in the Court below? The Respondent's counsel, upon an affidavit that he was informed and verily believed that the Appellant had received interest from the bank on the said sum of $6,180, obtained a rule nisi ordering the Appellant to pay him interest upon his monies, at the rate of four per centum per annum, or whatever rate he, the Appellant, might have received. Upon the return of this rule, what does the Appellant say? He does not deny having received interest upon the monies in his hands, but he merely alleges that he is not bonnd to pay such interest. No issue of facts is raised by him; there is not a word from him denying that he has received such interest. Upon this the Court takes his affidavit as an admission of the facts alleged against him, and rightly so, it seems to me. This was not an ordinary case between party and party, but a Court of Justice dealing with its own officer. I am thoroughly satisfied that, if the Appellant had not received interest at four per centum per annum, he would have said so in his affidavit. He only raised a question of law, and, upon that question of law, the Court properly held that he had no more right to appropriate to himself the interest than the capital. In the absence of evidence of the amount of interest by him received, and upon his refusing to inform the Court what was that amount, a fact within his own knowledge, he might even have been condemned to pay the legal interest, six per cent. per annum.\nI am of opinion this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Samuel G.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Henry and Gwynne, J. J\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nOpposition to Seizure of real estate\u2014Prescription\u2014-Renunciation, effect of, under Art. 1379 C. C. L. C; Art. 2191 C. C. L. C.; Art. 632 C. P. L. C.\nIn January, 1856, R. McC. sold certain real estate to J. McC., his sister, by notarial deed, in which she assumed the qualities of a wife duly separated are to property of her husband, J. C A. After the latter's death in 1866 J. McC., before a notary, renounced to the communaut\u00e9 de biens which subsisted, between her and her late husband. E. C K., a judgment creditor of R. McC., seized the said real estate as belonging to the vacant estate of the said R. McC., deceased. J. McC. opposed the sale, on the ground that the seizure was made super non domino et possidente, and setting up title and possession. She proved some acts of possession, and that the property had stood for some tim\u00e9 in the books of the municipality in her name. E. C\u00bb K. contested this opposition, on the ground that J. McC.' s title was bad in law, and simulated and fraudulent, and that there was no possession.\nHeld: That by her renunciation to the communaut\u00e9 de biens which subsisted between, her and her late husband at the date of the deed of Januarv, 1856, J. McC. divested herself of any title or interest in said lands and could not now claim the legal possession of the lands under that deed or by prescription, or maintain an opposition because the seizure was super non domino et non possidente.\nAPPEAL from a judgment rendered in the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), at Montreal, confirming a judgment of the Superior Court there, dismissing an opposition fyled by the appellant to the sale of certain lots in the village of West Farnham, seized as belonging to the defendant esqualit\u00e9, that is, as curator to the vacant estate of the late Robert McCorkill.\nThe respondent, in the capacity of curator to the vacant estate of the late Seneca Paige, having obtained judgment against Edward Donahue, as curator to the vacant estate of the late Robert McCorkill, caused twelve lots of land to be seized, as belonging to the estate of the said Robert McCorkill, in the village of Farnham, in execution of the said judgment.\nThe action in which judgment was sought to be executed was instituted in the year 1857 by Edward Finlay, and continued by respondent as curator to the vacant estate of the late Seneca Paige, against Robert McCorkill, then of West Farnham, upon two promissory notes, amounting to $730, one for $400, due in November, 1855, and the other for $370, due in November, 1856.\nThe appellant, widow of the late John C. Allsopp, and sister of Rorbert McCorkill, claimed, by opposition a fin d'annuler, the lots seized, on the following grounds:\n1 The seizure was null as made super non domino et non possidente; that neither McCorkill, nor Donahue, as curator, had ever been in possession of any of the lots since the date of the plaintiff's alleged title of debt.\n2 That for more than twenty years she (the opposant) \u2022 had been openly, peaceably, and uninterruptedly in pos-session, use and occupation of all the said lots as proprietor, and setting up a notarial deed from Robert McCorkill to the opposant, duly authorized by her husband, and a party to the deed of date the 2nd January, 1856, before notaries, to her, then the wife of John C Allsopp, of West Farnham, and by him duly authorized, of certain immovable property, including the lots seized, which are now village lots, and part of the north quarter of No. 42 in the fourth range of Farnham, and of No. 44 in the fourth range of Farnham, included in the deed of sale.\n3 That she was entitled to claim the emplacements as her property by prescription, and had, since the date of her deed, paid all assessments and taxes on the lots, and leased and occupied them.\nThe contestation of the opposition alleged, inter alia:\nThat at the time of the institution of said action Robert McCorkill was in possession, animo domini, of all the property seized, and that he died in possession of the same, animo domini; that as soon as Robert McCorkill was sued by the executor]s of Seneca Paige, he organized, with the opposant, a general system of fraudulent transactions, with the object of divesting himself of all he possessed and vesting his sister, the opposant, with fraudulent, fictitious and simulated titles to his own property, acquiring, moreover, property in her name, but with his own resources, and passing in her name titles to debts due to him the whole with the fraudulent intent of preventing his creditors from collecting any debt from him\u2014amongst others that of the plaintiff; that the deed of 22nd January, 1856, was one and the principal of the fraudulent transactions above mentioned; that even if the said deed should have the character mentioned in the opposition, it would be null and void inasmuch as the said Robert McCorkill would have thereby divested himself of all his property, in fraud of the late Seneca Paige, and would have rendered the recovery of the debt mentioned in the writ of execution impossible that all the enunciations contained in the said deed were false, and so falsely made, in order to give to said deed some apparent legality, which otherwise it would not possess even prima facie; that the opposant falsely styled herself as separated as to property from her husband, and as marchande publique, l while in reality she was commune en biens with her husband, and did no kind of trade or business in her own name; that, as commune en biens, she had no legal status to acquire property; that the said deed purports that the price or consideration money had been by her paid in full, while, in fact, she had not paid anything, and has never paid anything, as she has herself admitted in the inventory by her made after the death of her husband on the 11th January, 1866; that, notwithstanding the said deed (22nd January, 1856), Robert McCorkill continued to possess all the property described therein up to the time of his death which took place in 1874, and to draw all the benefits thereof, acting as proprietor, as in fact he was, making sales of portions of the same; that several years after the said deed, to wit, on the 27th September, 1859, the said Robert McCorkill borrowed a large sum of money from the Trust and Loan Company, and mortgaged, as his own property, most, ill not all, of the real estate described in the said deed of 22nd January, 1856; and in 1860, when it served his purpose, he applied for and obtained a ratification of title to the said real estate without any opposition on the part of the opposant; that the opposant well knowing the nullity of the said deed (22nd January, 1856), and that she could not hold there under, contrived another fraudulent state of things, by which she sup-posed that the said deed might have the effect of passing the property to the community between her husband and herself,\u2014and in the inventory by her made, as aforesaid, she declared the said property, or parts thereof, as being owned by said community\u2014and, for the same fraudulent objects, she afterwards renounced the said community, and contrived, with the said Robert McCorkill, other fraudulent means of vesting herself with some apparent title to the same; that her husband, the said John C. Allsopp, at the time of his death, had no near relative in the vicinity of his residence, having left one sister, Anna Maria Allsopp, living at Gap Sant\u00e9, in the district of Quebec, and a brother living in California; that the said Robert McCorkill, representing the estate of the said J. C. Allsopp as vacant, obtained his appointment as curator to such pretended vacant estate, and afterwards, to wit, by deed of assignment passed before M. Cl\u00e9ment, N. P., on the 14th December, 1867, the said Robert McCorkill \u00e9s-qualit\u00e9, acting in conjunction with Cyrille Tessier, a pretended attorney, by substitution of power of attorney given, in the first instance, by James Carleton Allsopp, in California, to Rev. N. Godbault, to sell his rights as heir to Henry Quetton de St. George, of Gap Sant\u00e9, did pretend to sell to said opposant all the rights of the said curator and of the said James Carleton Allsopp in the estate of the said John Charles Allsopp; that the said deed bears on its face the evidence of its fraudulent character and of its nullity; that the fact of one heir being a party to such deed destroyed the theory of the estate being vacant; that Robert McCorkill and the opposant concealed the condition of the estate in order to obtain the said assignment for a trifle, mentioning only two pieces of ground and pretending to acquire the whole under general expressions; that if, as alleged in the said inventory, the sale of January, 1856, vested in the community, the whole of the property seized would have formed part of the estate of John Charles Allsopp; that James C. Allsopp never gave power to Rev. N. Godbault to sell his rights to any one else than Henry Quetton de St. George, and the said Rev. N. Godbault never gave power to said Cyrille Tessier to sell the same to any person but Henry Quetton de St. George; that supposing the said property to have vested in John Charles Allsopp (opposant's husband) by the deed of January, 1856, opposant would have acquired no right by virtue l of the assignment of the 14th December, 1867\u2014first, because Robert McCorkill was not curator to the vacant estate of John C. Allsopp, and if he were curator he never was authorized to sell, and Cyrille Tessier had no power whatever to sell to opposant.\nWherefore the said plaintiffs prayed that the said deed of the twenty-second January, 1856, be declared fraudulent and void and that the said opposition be dismissed with costs distraits.\nA d\u00e9fense an fonds en fail was also fyled.\nThe appellant, in answer to the contestation, denied the allegations of fraud, and set up that the opposant was not responsible for, nor was she aware of, the alleged fraudulent practices of the said late Robert McCorkill, &c.; denied the alleged possession of the said Robert McCorkill of the lots at the time of his death, &c.\nAppellant also alleged that in case the plaintiff were desirous of setting aside, or availing himself of any illegality in said deed of 1856 to said opposant, or the assignment to the said McCorkill, in his said quality, or of the alleged want of authority in Cyrille Tessier to make the alleged sale, and to plead, as he does, the rights of Henri Quetton de St. George, and to allege, or prove, the nullity of the power of attorney by James Carleton Allsopp to the Rev. N. Godbault, he (the said plaintiff) was bound to have shown interest in himself, or in the said Paige, to do so, and should have brought all parties interested into Court, and taken a suit to have the same set aside.\nThat the plaintiff could not obtain any r\u00e9siliation of the deed, nor could he by general allegations of an organization to defraud on behalf of said McCorkill, extending over fifteen years subsequent to the institution of said suit, and previous to the said judgment in favor of plaintiff, bind the opposant, or prove fraud on her part at the date of the deed set up in her opposition, or obtain the dismissal of her opposition.\nThat in fact the said McCorkill was considered by the opposant a good and correct man of business and frequently acted on behalf of the opposant, generally without any formal legal authority; that it was not until long after his death that the said opposant was made aware that he had mortgaged any part of the property of the opposant, or treated it as his, or had become bound to the Trust and Loan Company under the loan in general terms alleged in said contestation.\nThat any acts of fraud or improper conduct on behalf of said McCorkill could not be held as inculpating the opposant without the clearest evidence of complicity on the part of the opposant, which complicity opposant denied, alleging, moreover, that the said now defendant, as curator to said McCorkill, failed, or neglected, to urge the defence of the said Robert McCorkill in this cause, or to prove the receipts fyled thereon, or to show the said notes sued on by the plaintiff to have been paid and compensated, and declined to authorize the proceeding with the defence, or to sanction the attorney of the deceased defendant proceeding with said defence.\nThat the contestation of said opposition was contrived between the now plaintiff and defendant, to obtain possession unjustly of the lots seized in this cause, and to injure the said opposant.\nConclusion to dismiss contestation.\nGeneral replication to the defense en fait.\nThe case was inscribed for hearing and enqu\u00eate at the same time and a large number of witnesses were examined to show who was the bond fide possessor of the lots, and to prove that at the time of the deed to the opposant Robert McCorkill was insolvent.\nThe deeds mentioned in the pleadings were fyled as exhibits, besides which several receipts signed by the Secretary Treasurer of West Farnham, certifying that l the property stood in the books of that municipality in opposant's name since 1863. There were also other notarial deeds filed inter alia:\nExhibit P.\u2014\" Renunciation par Dame Mary Jane McCorkill \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 le biens qui existe entre elle et feu John C. Allsopp, son \u00e9pouse, copie, P. Beriau, N. P., 2 avril, 1866.\"\nExhibit Q.\u2014\"Authorization to renounce Estate John G. Allsopp, 7th April, 1866; J. Rainville, N. P. \"\nThe Superior Court for Lower Canada, sitting in and for the district of Montreal, rendered judgment on the 30th December 1876, holding that the renunciation by the opposant to the communaut\u00e9 de biens that subsisted at the date of the deed of January, 1856, invoked by the opposant, disseized her and destroyed the claim made by her opposition, and destroyed also her claim made by prescription.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) affirmed the judgment, on the ground that opposant's title was simulated and fraudulent and that having suffered her vendor to act as proprietor, and to be the reputed possessor animo domini, she could not maintain her opposition, though she had done some acts of possession.\nMR. ROBERTSON, Q. C, for appellant:\u2014\nThe possession by the opposant of the lots seized at the time of the seizure and for many years prior to it, is established beyond any reasonable doubt. The following authorities, on which the appellant relies, clearly establish that a seizure of real property in the possession of a third party is a nullity. See Arts. 632 & 634 C. P. L. C.; Pothier ([1]); Lee v. Taylor ([2]); Atkinson v. Atkinson ([3]); Waring v. Zuntz ([4]). In addition to this, on the face of the deed of 1856, all the rights of Robert McCorkill in the property sold, M passed out of him unless fraud is made out.\nThis deed is manifestly what our code calls a translatory title, a title competent to convey the land; and such a deed, followed by twenty years open possession, by payment by opposant of all dues and assessments since the date of the deed, by possession at the date of the seizure, and without proof of fraud or bad faith, or proof of any possession whatever on the part of the defendant is submitted as sufficient base for the prescription pleaded by the opposant.\nThe plaintiff, by his contestation, takes the ground, first, that the deed of 1856 conveyed nothing to anybody but was a fraudulent instrument got up to defeat the action of the curator to the estate of Paige, and that this fraud was participated in by the appellant. Next, that if anything was conveyed to the appellant, she renounced it by renouncing to the community; and thirdly that by the renunciation the lands went to the heirs of John C. Allsopp whose residences and names are given in the contestation.\nNow whatever may be the rights of her late husband's estate in the land, the respondent cannot urge these rights, nor set aside the deed attacked, while no person is of record to protect the estate. The question as to the necessity of a substantive action revocatory is not decided upon by the judgment of the Superior Court appealed from; but the whole cause is made to turn upon the renunciation of the appellant, as depriving her of any right to fyle an opposition such as produced in this cause.\nThe renunication was registered in the Registry Office subsequent to the seizure of the lots in question, as appears by contestant's exhibit P. There is nothing to show who caused the registration to be made; the effects of the renunciation were not directly raised in the L pleadings; nor the rights of the estate or the heirs of the husband, in consequence of the renunciation; nor its effects on the rights of the appellant under her marriage contract.\nThe learned counsel then reviewed the evidence, arguing that the proof of the alleged fraud on the part of the appellant had failed, and that there was no evidence of record to show d\u00e0confiture in 1856 or in 1873, and cited the following authorities:\nCummings v. Smith ([5]); McGinnis v. Cartier ([6]); Lacroix v. Moreau ([7]); Ferri\u00e9re, dic. de droit ([8]); Guyot, rep. ([9]); Abat v. Penny ([10]); Demolombe ([11]); Mayrand v. Salvas ([12]); B\u00e9daride de la Fraude ([13]); Lemoine y. Lion-nais (1[14]).\nMr. Doutre, Q., C., and Mr. Haliburton, Q. C., for respondent:\nThe opposant bases her right of ownership to the lots seized on the deed of January, 1856. In this deed she falsely assumed the qualities of a wife separated as to property, for by her contract of marriage she is proven to be commune en biens. This fact alone is sufficient to prove that the deed was simulated and fraudulent. But we have a further proof, for at the death of her husband, in 1866, she, by a notarial deed, declares that she renounces to the communaut\u00ea de biens, which subsisted between her and her late husband.\nThe vice which lay at the beginning of this transaction is still existent. Pothier de la Possession ([15]); Chardon du Dol ([16]). Even if she had acquired soma interest under the deed of 1856, the moment she renounced all rights acquired were abandoned, and she could not by law, touch a single article belonging to I the estate; and if she had sufficient possession since then she could not avail herself of that possession. See Art. 2191 C. C. L. C. Her possession is coupled with a title which is vicious, and having invoked no other title than that deed, the opposition should have been dismissed without further enquiry when it was ascertained that she was commune en biens, and had renounced the community.\nThe learned counsel further contended that it was manifest, from the evidence, the deeds relied on by appellant were simulated and fraudulent, and that she had never been bone fide proprietor of the lots, and never legally possessed them; and cited Hans dit Chauss\u00e9 v. D' Orsonnens and D' Orsonnens, opposant ([17]); Chardon du Dol ([18]); Domat ([19]).\nMR. ROBERTSON, Q. C., in reply:\nIf the deed cannot be attacked for fraud it is a valid deed, and the property ceased to be owned by Robert McCorkill. If the renunciation had the effect of giving rights to other parties to the deed, they should be brought into the case. It is manifest the seizure was made super non domino et non possidente, and consequently is null.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nThe opposant opposes the seizure in this case, and asks to have the same declared irregular, illegal and null and that the same may be set aside and she maintained in her possession and be declared to be, in so far as regards the plaintiff, proprietor of the lands seized in this cause on the ground that the lands so seized belonged to her by good and valid titles, long before and at the date of the issuing of the writ of execution in this cause, and long before even the existence of the alleged title of debt in the declaration of said plaintiff and in the judgment rendered in the cause mentioned * and the title in the opposant is alleged as follows: \"That by deed of transfer in due form of law made on the 22nd January, 1856, before C. Morin and colleague, public notaries, at. Farnham, Robert McCorkill, Esq., then of St. Romuald de Farnham, for divers, good and valid considerations, causes, matters and things in said deed mentioned, bargained, sold, assigned and transferred to the said opposant, thereto present and accepting, and thereto duly and specially authorized by the said John C. \u00c1llsopp, her husband then living and party to said deed, the property lands tenements and hereditaments in said deed described,\" which description covers the land in question.\nThis property, though professing to be conveyed to the opposant as mrachande publique, wife of John Charles Allsopp, and from him separated as to property, separ\u00e9e quant aux biens was not so, as she was commune en biens with her husband, as appears by his contract of marriage, and an inventory made by her after the death of her husband on the 11th Jan. 1866 whereby she declared the said properties, or parts thereof, as being owned by the said community, and on the 2nd April, 1866, the opposant renounced the communaut\u00e9 de biens. Having thus destroyed her title and possession, I think she has no locus standi to contest this seizure. I carefully refrain from the expression of any opinion on the validity of the deed from McCorkill to the opposant, or of the validity of the seizure as against any parties who have a right to contest it on the ground the property was not the property of the judgment debtor, or that the judgment debtor was not in possession animo domini.\nFOURNIER J.\nLa pr\u00e9sente contestation, soulev\u00e9e ai moyen d'une opposition afin d' annuler, origine des faits suivants:\nLe 16 octobre 1875, jugement contre Donahu\u00e8, cura-teur \u00e0 la succession vacante de feu Robert McCorkill, pour la scmme de $700.00 montant de deux billets par lui souscrits l'un le 8 novembre 1854 et l'autre le 18 d\u00e9cembre 1855 en faveur de Seneca Paige dont la succession, aussi vacante, est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en cette cause par l'Intim\u00e9 en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur.\nLe 5 novembre suivant, en ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement, douze immeubles d\u00e9crits au proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie sont saisis sur Donahue, en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur, comme appartenant \u00e0 la succession de feu Robert McCorkill.\nL'Appelante en cette cause (opposante en Cour inf\u00e9rieure) demande, pour deux raisons principales, la nullit\u00e9 de cette saisie, savoir: lo. que ni McCorkill, ni Donahue, curateur \u00e0 sa succession vacante, n'ont jamais eu possession des immeubles saisis; 20. que depuis au-del\u00e0 de vingt ans, elle a toujours \u00eat\u00ea elle-m\u00eame en possession ouverte, paisible et publique des dits immeubles en vertu d'un acte de vente que lui en avait consenti Robert McCorkill, son fr\u00e8re, le 22 janvier 1856 et enregistr\u00e9 le 4 mars 1860.\nL'Intim\u00e9 Knight, comme curateur \u00e0 la succession vacante de feu Seneca Paige, a contest\u00e9 cette opposition: lo. par une d\u00e9fence au fonds en fait niant toutes les all\u00e9gations de l'opposition 2o. par une exception p\u00e9remptoire, dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue que la vente invoqu\u00e9e par l'opposante (acte de vente du 22 janvier 1856) a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en fraude des droits de Paige, comme cr\u00e9anciers ant\u00earieurs \u00e0 la dite vente. Il all\u00e8gue aussi simulation et fausset\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations contenues dans le \u00bflit acte de vente, et de plus, que McCorkill a toujours conserv\u00e9 la possession des dits immeubles animo domini, qu'il les avait hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s en faveur de la Compagnie \" Upper Canada Trust and Loan Company \", que l'Appelante agissait au dit acte comme femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e le biens, tandis que de fait elle \u00e9tait commune en biens et ne pouvait cons\u00e9quemment acheter que pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la communaut\u00e9; il ajoute encore qu'elle n'a point pay\u00e9 le prix de son acquisition.\nApr\u00e8s avoir oppos\u00e9 ces divers moyens de d\u00e9fense, l'Intim\u00e9 cite ensuite un autre titre en vertu duquel l'opposante aurait pu, si elle l'e\u00fbt jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos fonder aussi sa r\u00e9clamation aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont il s'agit, c'est l'acte de vente du 14 d\u00e9cembre 1867 consenti \u00e0 l'opposante par R. McCorkill, en qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 la succession vacante de John Charles Allsopp, conjointement avec Cyrille Tessier, agissant an dit acte comme procureur substitu\u00e9 de James C. Allsopp, fr\u00e8re et l'un des h\u00earitiers de John C. Allsopp. Divers moyens de nullit\u00e9 sont invoqu\u00e9s contre cet acte.\nL'exception se termine par une conclusion demandant seulement la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte de vente du 22 janvier 1856.\nL'opposante a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ce plaidoyer, par une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation sp\u00e9ciale des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, en ajoutant que tous ceux qui sont survenus apr\u00e8s l'institution de l'action de Edward Finley et al vs. McCorkill et le r\u00e8glement de la succession de John Charles Allsopp, son mari, en supposant qu'ils fussent prouv\u00e9s, n'\u00e9tablissent aucune participation de sa part \u00e0 la fraude de McCorkill, et no constituent pas un motif suffisant pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 son titre et sa prescription Grounds for setting aside the said deed and title of the opposant, or title given by prescription as alleged in the said opposition. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi que pour attaquer son acte do vente du 22 janvier 1856, et l'acte du 14 d\u00e9cembre M 1867, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de mettre en cause toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, au bien prendre une action directe pour les faire annuler.\nOn a vu plus haut que l'appelante n'a fond\u00e9 son opposition que sur I'acte de vente du 22 Janvier 1856, et sur la prescription quelle pretend lui \u00eatre acquise. Cependant l'Intim\u00e9, dans son exception, cite de plus la cession du 14 d\u00e9cembre 1867 qu'il d\u00e9clare entach\u00e9e do nullit\u00e9 et de fraude, mais sans prendre aucune conclusion \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard se bornant seulement \u00e0 demander la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte du 22 janvier 1856.\nLa contestation telle que soulev\u00e9e par les plaidoiries ne repose done que sur la validit\u00e9 de ce dernier acte, la prescription invoqu\u00e9e par l'opposante et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 do mettre en cause los autres parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es avant do pouvoir faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte du 22 janvier 1856.\nApr\u00e8s une assez longue enqu\u00eate sur les all\u00e9gations respectives des parties, la cour inf\u00e9rieure a, par son jugement du 30 d\u00e9cembre 1876, renvoy\u00e9 l'opposition, se fondant uniquement sur le d\u00e9faut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat on de qualit\u00e9 chez l'opposante pour attaquer la saisie faite en cette cause.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc do la Reine, en appel, mais principalement pour le motif quo la vente faite \u00e0 l'opposante \u00e9tait simul\u00e9e et faite en fraude des droits do Seneca Paige cr\u00eaan cier de McCorkill.\nEtait-il n\u00e9cessaire d'aller Plus loin que ne l'a fait la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance? Jo no le pense pas; car s'il est vrai quo l'opposante a perdu l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'elle pouvait avoir acquis en vertu do l'acte do vente do 1856, et qu'elle n'a aucune qualit\u00e9 pour repr\u00e9senter ceux qui peuvent y avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat, elle manquerait \u00eavidemment, dans ce cas, d'un \u00eal\u00eament indispensable pour lui Ill donner droit de s'immiscer dans la pr\u00e9sente contestation.\nQuelle est, en effet, sous ce rapport, la position actuelle de l'opposante? En supposant qu'elle ait acquis des droits en vertu de l'acte de vente du 22 janvier 1856, les a-t-elle conserv\u00e9s? On a vu plus haut qu'elle avait fait l'acquisition des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question en sa alit\u00e9 de femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, agissant avec l'auquisition de son mari. Mais il est clair qu'ele n'avait p \u00e9t\u00e9 qualit\u00e9, puisque son contrat de mariage, produit en cette cause, \u00e9tablit qu'au contraire, elle \u00e9tait commune en biens. Elle n'a en cons\u00e9quence Pu acqu\u00e9rir pour elle-m\u00eame personnellement, et si Son acte d'acquisition a quelque valeur l\u00e9gale, c'est \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 qu'il doit profiter, puisque par le parag. 3 de l'art. 1272, la communaut\u00e9 se compose entre autres choses \" de tous l les immeubles acquis pendant le mariage.\"\nApr\u00e9s avoir fait, le 11 janvier 1866, Un inventaire des biens composant la communaut\u00e9 qui avait exist\u00e9 entre elle et son mari, dans lequel elle prend sa v\u00e9ritable qualit\u00e9 de commune en biens, ne croyant pas qu'il lui serait avantageux d'accepter cette communaut\u00e9, l'appelant y a, plus tard, savoir, le 2 avril 1866, renonc\u00e9e par acte authentique, devant B\u00e9riau, N.P.\nDepuis cette renonciation, l'appelant a-t-elle pu, d'apr\u00e9s la loi, conserver un droit quelconque sun les biens de la communaut\u00e9? Il est certain que non. D'apr\u00e8s l'art. 1379, Code Civil,\nLa femme qui renonce ne peut pr\u00e9tendre aucune part dans les biens de la communaut\u00e9, pas m\u00eame dans le mobilier qui y est entr\u00e9 do son chef.\nLa femme par sa renonciation (\u00e0 la communaut\u00e9) perd toute esp\u00e8ce do droits sur les biens qui la composent: los biens restent en totalit\u00e9 au mari ou \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers ([20]).\nDepuis sa renonciation, l'appelante n'ayant absolument aucun droit aux immeubles de la communaut\u00e9, dont ceux saisis en cette cause font partie il me semble parfaitement inutile de discuter la validit\u00e9 de l'acte du 22 janvier 1856 ni le caract\u00e8re de la possession de l'opposante pendant l'existence de la communaut\u00e9. Lors m\u00eame que sa possession, (ce queje suis loin d'admettre), aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une possession l\u00e9gale pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la communaut\u00e9, cette possession, comme son titre \u00e0 ces m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en qualit\u00e9 de commune en biens, a compl\u00e8tement disparu par l'effet de sa renonciation. Elle n'a eu depuis cette \u00e9poque qu'une simple d\u00e9tention qui ne pouvait servir de base \u00e0 la prescription qui exige une possession animo domini, ni lui faire acqu\u00e9rir aucun autre droit quelconque. Il n'est rest\u00e9 chez elle ni possession, ni droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et par cons\u00e9quent aucun int\u00e9r\u00e9t \u00e0 s'opposer \u00e0 la saisie des dits immeubles.\nPour ces motifs seulement, et d'accord avec l'honorable juge qui a rendu le jugement en cour de premi\u00e8re instance, je suis d'avis que le jugement doit \u00eatre confim ec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J, concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J. I\nThis seems to me a clear case. In 1856, during her marriage with John Allsopp, Jane McCorkill. the appellant, bought the lands seized in this case. She was in community with her husband. Consequently, these lands fell into the community ([21]). Allsopp, her husband died in 1865. In 1866 she renounced the community \"The wife who renounces cannot claim any share in the property of the community,\" says art. 1379 of the Civil code. Yet, it is upon that deed of purchase of 1856, and upon that deed alone, that she now claims these lands by her opposition. She alleges and contends that she is in possession of them animo domini, and that the seizure of these lands made upon the defendant is null. But the only title that she invokes to sustain this allegation and to qualify her possession, is a title which, at the most, would give her only one half of these lands, and to which half she has renounced. This disposes of her opposition and that is all we have to adjudicate upon in this case. It may be that the seizure is null; it may be that the heirs Allsopp can have it set aside but we have in this case nothing? to do with all this. All we have to determine is whether Jane McCorkill the appellant, has proved that these lands are in her possession as proprietor in virtue of the deed of 1856. I have shown that she is not By the renunciation to the community which existed between her and her husband she has divested herself of any rights to these lands. Allsopp's heirs, at his death, and by this renunciation, in the very terms of art. 607 Of the Civil Code, were then seized of these lands by law alone. In them vested the legal possession. The appellant detains the lands, it may be, but she has not the legal possession of them.\nI do not wish it to be understood that I consider the sale of 1856 as valid; far from it; but I deem it unnecessary to go into this point, and merely say that, supposing it to be valid, the appellant has now no right to these lands under it. She may have established that the defendant is not proprietor of the lands seized, but, at the same time, it is clearly proved that she is not proprietor of them, and that she possesses for others.\nI am of opinion this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J:\u2014\nI agree that the opposant, having renounced all her estate and interest in the communaut\u00e9, cannot support her opposition upon the deed of January, 1856, in virtue of which alone she claims to have had possession of the M land in question. I must say, however, that there appears to me abundant evidence to support the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, upon the grounds of fraud and simulation, upon which the majority of that Court rested their judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for appellant: Roberstson & Robertson.\nSolicitors for respondent: Doutre, Doutre, Robidoux & Hutchinson.\n[1] Pro.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR LOWER CANADA (DISTRICT OF RIMOUSKI)\nAppeal\u2014Mandamus\u2014Supreme and Exchequer Court Ace, secs.11, 17 and 23.\nHeld: That the appeal in cases of mandamus under section 23 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, is restricted by the application of sec. 11 to decisions of \"the highest court of final resort \" in the Province; and that an anneal will not lie from any Court in the Province of Quebec but the Court of Queen's Bench. (Fumier and Henry, J. J., dissenting.)\nQuery:\u2014Can the Dominion Parliament give an appeal in a case in which the legislature of a province has expressly denied it? Semble, per Strong, J, there is nothing in sec 63 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, confining, appeals from the Exchequer Court to a recourse against final judgments only, the word used being \" decision,\" which is applicable as well to rules and orders not final as to final decisions.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Quebec, district of Rimouski, dated the 6th May 1877 on a writ of mandamus, adjudging the present Appellant to pay the costs.\nOn the 30th October, 1876, the Respondent presented a petition (requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e)) alleging that at a meeting of the Municipal Council of the first division of the County of Rimouski, held on the 31st August, 1876 the following resolution was adopted :\n\" That the conclusions of the petition in appeal of Firming Marquis and others be granted; that the by-law of the 17th July last (1876) enacted for the purpose of cancelling a by-law of the Municipal Council of the parish of St. Fabien, annulling a by-law of the same Council, bearing date February, 1876, which grants a by-road (route) on the line between Samuel Bouchard and Luc Roussel in the fourth range, be annulled and that the said by-law of the month of February be declared valid and be enforced according to its form and tenor, the whole with costs against the Respondents;\"\nThat the minutes of the proceedings were not signed on that day by the appellant, and that respondent, who had a deep interest in the immediate opening of the by road subsequently requested the appellant to sign the said minutes which he refused to do. The petition, therefore, prayed for the issuing of a writ of mandamus, commanding Mr. Danjou, in his quality of Warden to said Council, to sign immediately in the register of the proceedings of the said Council, the minutes of the 31st August 1876 with costs.\nThe writ was issued by order of Mr. Justice Maguire and made returnable before him, at Rimouski, on the 8th November then next. After issue joined in the month of December, the appellant signed the minutes, and on the 26th May, 1877, Mr. Justice Maguire gave judgment, adjudging the present appellant to pay the costs. From that judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) and that Court on the 8th September, 1877, on a motion to quash, rejected the appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that under art. 1033, C. C. P., the judgment of the Superior Court in this case was final and in last resort. On the 22nd September, 1877, leave was granted by Mr. Justice Maguire to appeal direct to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBefore the Supreme Court the respondent moved to quash the appeal, principally on the following grounds :\n\" Whereas the said appellant has not appealed from the judgment of the said Court of Queen's Bench, but from the judgment rendered by the honorable Judge Maguire, and that such appeal to this honorable Court is allowed only from the judgment of the Court of last resort in the Province where such judgment has been rendered, and in the present cause, from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which is the court of last resort in the Province of Quebec, according to section eleven (11), cap. 11, 38 Vic, and that an appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction only by the consent of parties, according to section twenty-seven (27) of the said chapter, and that such consent has never been given by the respondent or his attorney;\n\"Whereas, by and in virtue of the laws of the Province of Quebec no appeal lies in matters concerning municipal corporations and municipal offices, as provided by the articles 1033 and 1155 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Lower Canada and that the mandamus in this cause has been issued against the appellant in his capacity of municipal officer, and to force him to fulfill the duties and obligations inherent to a municipal office, and that no appeal lies before this honorable Court from the judgment rendered by the honorable Judge Maguire, and that even if such an appeal to this honorable Court did lie, this present appeal could not be maintained, having been brought after the delay mentioned in section 25th, cap. 11, 38 Vic.\"\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., supported the motion. Mr. McIntyre, contra.\nSTRONG, J. :\u2014\nThis is a motion to quash an appeal pursuant to sec. 87 of the Supreme Court Act. The appeal is from a judgment rendered in the Superior Court of Lower Canada under the following circumstances. The Municipal Council of the municipality of which the appellant was the presiding officer, having passed a by-law in which the respondent had an interest, the latter obtained from the Superior Court for the District of Rimouski a writ of mandamus, in order to compel the appellant to sign the minutes of the meeting of the Council in which the by-law had been passed. After service of the writ the appellant signed the minutes. The Superior Court, or a Judge thereof in Chambers, on the 6th May, 1877, gave judgment adjudging the present appellant to pay the costs. From that judgment the appellant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench. for the Province of Quebec and that Court on the 8th of Sept., 1877, rejected the appeal for want of jurisdiction, holding that the judgment of the Superior Court was final and in last resort. The appellant has now appealed to this Court from the judgment of the Superior Court. A motion having been made by the respondent to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, it was argued during the session of this Court in January, 1878, and reargued during the last session.\nBy section 11 of the Supreme Court Act it is (inter alia) enacted :\nAnd when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case, it shall always be understood to be, given from the Court of last resort in the Province where the judgment was rendered in such case.\nThe 17th section is as follows:\nSubject to the limitations and provisions hereinafter made, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the highest Court of final resort, whether such Court be a Court of Appeal or of original jurisdiction now or hereafter established in any Province of Canada, in cases in which the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court; provided that no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any case wherein the sum or value of the matter in dispute does not amount to $2,000 : and the right to appeal in civil cases given by this Act shall be understood to be given in such cases only as are mentioned in this section, except Exchequer cases and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus, or municipal by-laws, as hereinafter provided.\nSection 23 enacts that:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of a criminal charge, and in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus, and in any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule of Court, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument.\nThe clear meaning of section 17 is, that the right to appeal is given from final judgments only, and, in Quebec, from final judgments, where the matter in dispute amounts at least to $2,000, except in Exchequer cases and matters of mandamus habeas corpus and municipal by-laws, in which judgments not final may be appealed from. By this construction, which makes the exception apply to the provision regarding final judgments, and not to the Court appealed from, sections 11, 17 and 23 stand well together, without any repugnancy, and it is the primary and natural meaning of the language in which the law is expressed. The exception cannot be read as applying to the proviso limiting the amount appealable in Quebec cases for there would be no meaning in excepting Exchequer cases to which that proviso can have no application.\nIf it is said that its object is to except appeals in matters of mandamus, habeas corpus and municipal by-laws from the provision in the first part of the 17th section, limiting appeals to those from the highest Court of final resort, and to set such cases entirely at large as regards the Courts from which an appeal can be brought, the effect would be to cut down the general provision of the 11th section, by introducing an exception as regards the class of cases spoken of in the latter Dart of section 17 and in section 23 But we are not to give the general provision of the 11th section such an interpretation, unless it is absolutely requisite. Then, what are the cases in which the 17th section gives the right to appeal? They are judgments of the highest Court of final resort in the Province in which the Court of original jurisdiction was a Superior Court. The exception of Exchequer cases would be without meaning here; they would be senseless, idle words, as applying, by way of exception to the judgments \" of the highest Court of final resort now or hereafter to be established in any province.\" There is' no sensible way of reading this exception but by treating it as distinguishing between a class of cases \u2014ordinary civil actions and suits inter parties, in which an appeal is to lie from a final judgment only, and those enumerated in it cases in the Exchequer and those of mandamus, habeas corpus and municipal by-laws, in which it is clearly intended that the appeal shall not be restricted to final judgments, but may be taken from decisions on motions for rules and other applications not final in their nature, as well as from the ultimate determination. This is confirmed by sec. 23, which expressly gives appeals in cases of mandamus, habeas corpus and applications to quash municipal by-laws, \u201c in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ \"of mandamus,\" &c., as well as in any in which a by-law has been quashed, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument.\nAgain, section 68, which regulates appeals from the Exchequer, is quite consistent with this interpretation, since there is nothing in that clause confining appeals from that Court to a recourse against final judgments only, the word used being \" decision,\" which is applicable as well to rules and orders not final as to final decisions.\nThis construction harmonizes with all the provisions of the Act and makes the several sections 11, 17 and 23 read consistently with each other, without suppressing any words as redundant, or reading any into the Statute by way of necessary implication. Appeals in ordinary civil suits between party and party are, therefore, governed by section 17, whilst appeals in matters of mandamus, habeas corpus, and municipal by-laws, are regulated by section 23 read, as regards the Court from which an appeal lies, subject to the interpretation clause, section 11 providing that an appeal shall always be understood to be given from the court of last resort in the Province. This disposes of the argument, that the effect of this exception of mandamus and cognate matters in section 17 was to emancipate those cases from the limitation as to the courts to be appealed from contained in the interpretation clause section 11.\nI think it right to say here that by the allusion which I have made to the words \" final judgment \" in the 17th section, I by no means assume that those words indicate anything more than the meaning attached to them by the interpretation given in the 11th section, which I take to - be final as regards the particular motion or application, and not necessarily final and conclusive of the whole litigation.\nThe next enquiry is, what is the meaning to be attributed to the words \"Court of last resort\" in section 11? I think it clearly means the highest Court of appeal in the Province in which the suit, action, or other proceeding has arisen. This conclusion is thus arrived at. The object of the 17th section is, as I have already attempted to establish, to limit appeals in civil suits and actions to final judgments, as these words are interpreted in section 11, and in Quebec cases to actions in which the matter in dispute is above the specified amount. As regards the Court from which the appeal is to lie there is no reason to infer that the Legislature intended to make any difference between the class of cases particularly dealt with by section 17, and those to which the general provisions of the interpretation clause would apply. It is not to be arbitrarily assumed that the Legislature, by the words \" highest Court of final resort,\" meant a different Court from that indicated by the words \" Court of last resort in the Province \" in section 11. Then, we may regard the definition of the Court from which an appeal is given in section 17 as intended to repeat with more fullness and particularity, and by way of explanation, the provision of section 11 on the same subject. We are, therefore, to consider the two expressions \" Court of last resort\" and \" highest Court of final resort,\" as convertible and equivalent in meaning. \"Acts of Parliament,\" it is said by a lath writer ([1]) \" are frequently framed in varying phraseology without any intention of conveying a different meaning. In their progress through Parliament alterations and additions from various hands are made, and thus present the style and language of different authors. In such cases, the more precise and determinate expression is regarded as fixing the meaning of that which may be conceived in language more general or ambiguous.''\nIt follows that the appeal, in cases of mandamus\\ under sec. 23, is restricted by the application of sec. 11 to decisions of \" the highest Court of final resort.\" Then, the prefix \" highest \" entirely shuts out the possibility of the construction which would assign to the words \" Court of final resort;\" the flexible and varying meaning of Court of last resort in each particular case, as it might, or might not, happen to be subject to appeal to the ultimate Appellate jurisdiction in the Province and fixes the true meaning as that of last Court of Appeal in the Province, without reference to the particular case; for, though there may be Courts of last resort in different decrees for different cases, it is clear there can only be one highest Court of final resort in a Province.\nTherefore, it appears plain that an appeal will not lie from any Court in the Province of Quebec but the Court of Queen's Bench.\nArticle 1033 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Lower Canada is as follows: \" An appeal from any final judgment rendered under the provisions contained in this c chapter, lies to the Court of Queen's Bench, except in \" matters relating to municipal corporations and o offices, provided the writ of appeal be issued within \" forty days from the rendering of the judgment appealed from.\" The Court of Queen's Bench quashed the appeal to that Court, on the ground that this article applied, and that it had no jurisdiction; for the same reason this Court must, in my view, hold that the present appeal is also inadmissible in this Court. The interpretation which I have applied to the language of the Supreme Court Act, has appeared sufficient to warrant the conclusion arrived at without calling in aid any extrinsic arguments. There are, however, reasons of policy and convenience which show that every presumption should be made in favor of a construction which would refuse an appeal from the decision of a Superior Court of first instance, which the Provincial Statutes have declared to be final and in last resort, and not subject to revision by the Provincial Court of Appeals.\nWithout touching on what may. hereafter come to be an important constitutional question, that regarding the powers of Parliament to confer appellate jurisdiction in particular cases or classes of cases on this Court, and the right of the Provincial Legislatures to withhold it, it would not, I think, be possible to attribute to the terms in which jurisdiction is conferred by the Supreme Court Act in the 11th section already referred to even if it were read as an isolated enactment without any light from other parts of the Statute, a construction which would embrace appeals in cases in which the Provincial laws had precluded resort to the Provincial Court of Appeals. It must be presumed that the Provincial Legislature, in denying the right of appeal, designed to sub serve the ends of justice and the requirements of good policy, and it must equally be presumed, in the absence of express words, that Parliament did not intend to subvert those laws, and thus to annihilate Provincial legislation regulating the finality of law suits concerning property and civil rights.\nThese observations have no reference to the constitutional question which would arise if Parliament was to give an appeal in a case in which the Legislature of a Province had expressly denied it, but they are only intended to show how strong an influence such. considerations ought to have in favor of a construction D which would avoid such a conflict. Had the ambiguous words \" Court of last resort stood alone this weighty presumption would; in my judgment, have been by itself sufficient to have impressed upon them the same meaning which I have derived from reading them in the light afforded by other provisions of the Statute.\nIt may well be remarked that no stronger instance of the implicit of opening this Court to appeals shut out from the .Appellate Court in the Province could be afforded than the present case. We have here an appeal respecting a mandamus granted against a municipal officer, who complied with the complainant's demand before the judgment was given, whose term of office has long since expired, and who appeals only for the sake of getting rid of the costs, which prime facie his compliance with the demand after the writ was granted shows he was properly ordered to pay.\nI think it also right to add that, although in strictness, we may not have it in our power to decline to entertain appeals for costs only, yet that such appeals ought, in my opinion, to be always regarded with the utmost disfavor, that the appellant should not, even though successful, be awarded costs, and that it may be found possible to make him pay costs.\nIn my judgment the motion must be granted and the appeal quashed with costs.\nFOURNIER J :\nCette cause est maintenant devant la cour sur une motion demandant le renvoi de l'appel pour d\u00e9faut de juridiction, et d\u00e9faut de cautionnement.\nLe pr\u00e9sent appel origine des faits suivants: Joseph Danjou, l'appelant, pr\u00e9fet de la premi\u00e8re division municipale du comt\u00e9 de Rimouski, ayant refuse de signer le proc\u00e8s-verbal des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations d'une assembl\u00e9e du conseil de cette division tenue le 31 ao\u00fbt 1876 fut poursuivi devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec, district de Rimouski, \u00e0 l'effet de le faire contraindre d'attester le dit proc\u00e8s-verbal par 1 apposition de sa signature.\nApr\u00e8s contestation li\u00e9e, preuve et audition au m\u00e9rite, la dite Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Rimouski, le.26 mai 1877 a rendu le jugement suivant :\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il est \u00e9tabli par la preuve, quo le dit Joseph Danjou, en sa qualit\u00e9 do pr\u00e9fet et pr\u00e9sident de la dite session, a ill\u00e9galement refuse do signer au pr\u00e9judice du requ\u00e9rant ledit proc\u00e8s-verbal des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations et proc\u00e9d\u00e9s du dit conseil, adopt\u00e9s \u00e0 la dite session tenue le trente-et-un ao\u00fbt dernier;\nConsid\u00e9rant cependant que le dit Joseph Danjou a, depuis le rapport du dit bref de mandamus et la contestation li\u00e9e sur icelui, savoir, dans le mois de d\u00e9cembre dernier, sign\u00e9 le dit proc\u00e8s-verbal des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations du dit conseil adopt\u00e9es \u00e0 la dite session tenue le trente-et-un ao\u00fbt dernier, le soussign\u00e9 condamne le dit Joseph Danjou simplement \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9pens distraits \u00e0 J.

Quant au second savoir, le d\u00e9faut do cautionnement, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 lors de l'argument, je m'abstiendrai d'en parler. li no reste actuellement pour la consid\u00e9ration de la cour quo le premier motif, fo\u00e8ne sur le d\u00e9faut do juridiction, savoir : quo le jugement dont l'appelant veut appeler, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu en mati\u00e8res municipales, n'est pas susceptible d'appel d'apr\u00e8s les arts 1033 et 1115 du C. P. C. de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa Cour du Banc do la Reine devant laquelle cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e en appel, a donn\u00e9 gain do cause \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 eu se fondant sur les deux articles ci-dessus cites. Le pr\u00e9sent appel n'est pas de ce dernier jugement, mais de celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Rimouski, en date du 26 may 1877, comme \u00e9tant la cour jugeant en dernier ressort dans cette cause. Cette proc\u00e9dure a soulev\u00e9 l'importante question de savoir, si l'appel \u00e0 cette cour existe d'un jugement en dernier ressort rendu par une autre cour que la plus hale cour de dernier ressort, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec\u2014c'est-\u00e0-dire la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLes clauses de l'Acte 38 Vict. ch. 11 \u00e0 consulter pour la solution de cette question sont les lie 17e et 23e.\nLa lie est une clause d'interpr\u00e9tation fixant la signification de certaines expressions employ\u00e9es dans l'acte. La 17e donne l'appel dans les causes civiles seulement qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es et en excepte les causes de la Cour d'Echiquier, celles de mandamus, d'habeas corpus ou concernant des r\u00e8glements municipaux pour lesquelles des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales sont faites par la sec. 23 Cette derni\u00e8re section est celle qui donne l'appel dans les causes soustraites \u00e0 l'effet de la 17e. [L'honorable juge lit la 17e clause de l'Acte 88 Vic. c. 11.1 L'appel dans ces causes a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 except\u00e9e des effets de la sec. 17, parce que ces causes, n'\u00e9tant pas appelables avant la passation de l'acte de la Cour Sup\u00e8reme elles \u00e9taient alors jug\u00e9es en dernier ressort par les Cours Sup\u00e9rieures de 1\u00e8re instance dans toutes les provinces de la Puissance, except\u00e9e celle de Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9, dans certains cas, le Code de Proc\u00e9dure admet l'appel. li eut \u00e9t\u00e9 bien \u00e9trange de d\u00e9clarer que l'appel dans ces causes n'aurait lieu que du jugement de la plus haute Cour de dernier ressort quand il \u00e9tait certain que ces causes n'\u00e9taient pas susceptibles d'y \u00eatre port\u00e9es. Pour donner \u00e0 cette clause une pareille signification, il faudrait donc supposer que le parlement qui a donn\u00e9 l'appel sans condition, en a cependant sous-entendu une, qui d\u00e9truirait son ceuvre : c'est-\u00e0-dire, que l'appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame n'aurait lieu que si une loi locale rendait C6S causes appelables \u00e0 la plus haute Cour provinciale aim qu'elles puissant parvenir jusqu'ici. Mais pourquoi supposer sans raison une condition si contraire an texte de la loi i Le droit du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de rendre ces causes appelables, nonobstant toute l\u00e9gislation an contraire existant alors dans les provinces n'\u00e9tant par douteux, il me semble que cette disposition devrait recevoir son plein et entier effet.\nLes proc\u00e9dures mentionn\u00e9es dans la section 23, \u00e9tant de la nature des appels, comme appartenant aux pouvoirs de surveillance et de r\u00e9vision exerc\u00e9s par les cours sup\u00e9rieures sur les juridictions inf\u00e9rieures, n'\u00e9taient pas, du moins pour la plupart d'entre elles, sujettes \u00e0 l'appel comme je l'ai dit plus haut. C'est aussi, sans doute, \u00e0 raison de leur nature particuli\u00e8re qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soustraites \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un appel interm\u00e9diaire. Il \u00e9tait dons logique de dire simplement qu'il y aurait appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame, comme le dit si clairement la section 23.\nPour limiter l'effet de cette derni\u00e8re section l'Intim\u00e9 s'appuie fortement sur la section 11e, fixant la signification de certaines expressions dans l'acte. li pr\u00e9tend qu'elle a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 cette question, en d\u00e9clarant, que lorsque l'appel est donn\u00e9, c'est toujours de la Cour de dernier ressort dans les provinces o\u00f9 le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans telle cause\nOn remarquera d'abord que dans cette clause, sans doute en vue de l'appel sp\u00e9cial donn\u00e9 par la section 23, l'on ne trouve pas comme dans la 17e le mot \"highest,\" la plus haute Cour, il est seulement dit l la Cour de dernier ressort dans la province \" Le mot \" highest\" a sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9 afin d'\u00e9viter Ia contradiction qu'il y aurait eu en d\u00e9clarant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, qu'il y aurait appel des causes jug\u00e9es en dernier ressort par les Cours Sup\u00e9rieures, et de l'autre que cet appel ne pourrait avoir lieu que de la plus haute Cour de dernier ressort dans la province, \u00e0 laquelle ces causes n'\u00e9taient pas alors susceptibles d'\u00eatre port\u00e9es. Le sens clair et \u00e9vident de cette clause est que l'appel existe du jugement de la Cour qui prononce en dernier ressort par rapport \u00e0 telle cause.\nAnd when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case, it shall always be understood to be given from the Court of last resort in the province where the judgment was rendered in such case.\nIl n'est pas ici question de la plus haute Cour, et ces termes doivent s'appliquer sans restriction \u00e0 toute Cour si\u00e9geant en dernier ressort, pourvu qu'elle soit une Cour d'appel, ou une Cour de juridiction sup\u00e9rieure jugeant en dernier ressort.\nSi toutefois les termes pouvaient avoir la signification que leur donne l'Intim\u00e9, on pourrait encore r\u00e9pondre que la section enti\u00e8re (la 1 Ime) n'a pas d'application \u00e0 la question sous consid\u00e9ration.\nEn effet il y est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en termes formels que \u00e0 moins que \" le contraire ne soit prescrit, ou que le con-\" texte n'exige \u00e9videmment une autre interpr\u00e9tation,\" les expressions y mentionn\u00e9es auront la signification qui leur est donn\u00e9e. Les deux conditions qui rendent en certains cas cette clause d'interpr\u00e9tation inapplicable, ne se pr\u00e9sentent-elles pas dans la question actuelle?\nLe contraire de la pr\u00e9tention que l'appel n'a lieu que de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort n'est-il pas prescrit par la section 23 donnant l'appel sans condition. Le contexte de la m\u00eame section ainsi que celui de la section 17 n'exige-t-il pas une autre interpr\u00e9tation que celle qui aurait pour effet d'an\u00e9antir le droit d'appel si clairement donn\u00e9? Si l'on admet que la section 11 doit contr\u00f4ler l'appel donn\u00e9 par la section 23 n'en devrait-il pas \u00eatre de m\u00eame pour la section 49. Par cette section toute personne trouv\u00e9e coupable 'le haute trahison, de f\u00e9lonie ou de d\u00e9lit devant une Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de juridiction criminelle, peut, lorsque la conviction a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par une cour de dernier ressort, en appeler \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du jugement de confirmation.\nLa Cour d'Erreur et d'Appel d' Ontario qui est le plus haut tribunal de dernier ressort de cette province n'a pas de juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8res criminelles. Si l'on fait aux causes criminelles application de la derni\u00e8re partie de la section 11, savoir : \" et lorsque l'appel \u00e0 la \" Cour Supr\u00eame est permis \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un jugement d dans aucune cause, il sera toujours sens\u00e9 \u00eatre permis \" \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du jugement de la cour en dernier instance d dans la province o\u00f9 le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans la c cause,\" il en r\u00e9sulterait qu'un appel ne pourrait pas avoir lieu \u00e0 cette cour d'une conviction ou sentence prononc\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de cette province, cette derni\u00e8re n'\u00e9tant pas la cour en derni\u00e8re instance dans la province d'Ontario. Est-ce \u00e0 dire que pour cette raison l'appel donn\u00e9 par la section 49 ne pourrait pas avoir lieu? En faisant ainsi application de la clause d'interpr\u00e9tation, l'on d\u00e9truirait une des dispositions les plus importantes de l'acte. Mais je ne pense pas qu'une telle interpr\u00e9tation serait admise. On r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 cette objection que la Cour du Bane de la Reine est une Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en m\u00eame temps une cour de dernier ressort dans la province pour les causes criminelles, et l'appel serait sans doute admis. Le m\u00eame argument, s'il est valable dans ce cas est \u00e9galement applicable \u00e0 celui dont il s'agit. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est, comme l'indique sa d\u00e9nomination, une cour sup\u00e9rieure de premi\u00e8re instance, en m\u00eame temps qu'une cour de dernier ressort en certains cas comme en mati\u00e8res municipales, d'apr\u00e8s les arts. 1033 et 1115 d\u00e9code de P. C.\nquelque mani\u00e8re que j'envisage la question, je ne puis trouver la confirmation des pr\u00e9tentions de l'Intim\u00e9 dans la sec. 1le \u00e0 laquelle suivant moi l'on donne une interpretation trop rigoureuse et une port\u00e9e qu'elle ne devrait pas avoir. Ma mani\u00e8re de voir \u00e0 ce sujet est appuy\u00e9e sur les autorit\u00e9s suivantes:\nRegina vs. the Justices of Cambridge shire;Regina vs. the Justices of Shropshire. Regina vs. the Justices of Gloucestershire. ([2]).\nDans ces causes lord Denman, \u00e0 la page 491, s'exprime ainsi sur l'effet des clauses d'interpr\u00e9tation :\nBut we apprehend that an interpretation clause is no to receive so rigid a construction that it is not to be taken as substituting one set of words for another, .nor as strictly defining what the meaning of the word must be under all circumstances. We rather think it merely declares what persons may be comprehended within that term, when the circumstances require that they should.\nDe plus, d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles d'interpr\u00e9tation, la sec. 23 contenant une disposition particuli\u00e8re ne peut pas \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la sec. 11 :\u2014\nA particular enactment, says Maxwell, must prevail over a general enactment in the same statute. The general enactment must be taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply.\nCette section (23me) n'est aucunement en contradiction avec l'esprit de l'acte et ne peut avoir l'effet d'en rendre aucunes dispositions incompatibles, ni d'en d\u00e9truire les effets Elle \"D\u2019eut exister sans affecter aucune des dispositions de l'acte, pas m\u00eame la section lime qui contient la d\u00e9claration sp\u00e9ciale qu'elle ne s'applique pas dans le cas o\u00f9 le sens de l'acte ne s'y pr\u00eate pas.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la sect. 23 me parait avoir un sens tr\u00e8s clair : -elle donne le droit d'appel dans des causes o\u00f9 la loi provinciale ne l'admettait point. Frapp\u00e9 des d\u00e9veloppements consid\u00e9rables des affaires municipales dans ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, surtout depuis que les corporations se sont engag\u00e9es dans les entreprises de chemins de fer pour bien des millions, le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a sans doute pens\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait de Pint\u00e9 tt public, de soumettre \u00e0 la juridiction d'appel de cette cour les jugements des cours de lrre instance d\u00e9cidant ces affaires en dernier ressort Le pouvoir exerc\u00e9 de cette mani\u00e8re n'\u00e9tant pas contestable suivant moi, je suis d'opinion que l'on doit donner effet a la sec. 23 en recevant l'appel en cette cause, La majorit\u00e9 de la cour en d\u00e9cide autrement.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nIn this case a motion was heard to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that it was not a case within the meaning of the Act providing for appeals to this Court.\nIt is an appeal from the decision of a Judge of the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec in a case of mandamus before him, to compel the appellant to sign his name as warden of the Municipal Council of the first division of Rimouski to certain acts and deliberations of the Council in accordance with his duty as such warden and which he refused to do. There was a decision for costs only against him. The judgment was against him on the merits, but, as the appellant had in the interim between the application for the mandamus and the hearing, done what the mandamus would have required him to do no order for it was made; but the appellant was condemned to pay the costs of the application. From that judgment an appeal was first had to the Court of Queen's Bench, in appeal but that Court properly, I think decided there was no appeal thereto. The appeal to this Court was consequently taken.\nA question might be raised as to the power of the Dominion Parliament to provide for an appeal under such circumstances to this Court. I will first endeavor to dispose of that question. By the provision of the British North America Act, 1867 sec. 101 \" The Parliament of Canad\u00e1 is given authority,\" from time to time, to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general Court of Appeal for Canada.\" The right to provide for the Constitution \" of the Court without any terms of limitation, must, in my opinion, confer upon the Parliament of Canada the exclusive power of providing for appeals to this Court, from the highest to the lowest Courts in the Dominion; but, of course, in such a way as not to interfere with the procedure in the several Provinces, which is given for regulation to the Local Legislatures. No Act of the Parliament of Canada can affect the powers of the Local Legislatures in regard to appeals from one Court to another in any Province, but, when not so affecting such appeals, the Parliament of Canada, I hold, had, and has, the right to decide what cases shall come to this Court from the judgment or decision of any other Court.\nHaving disposed of that question, we must next enquire whether, by what Parliament has enacted, an appeal lies to the Court in the present, and similar cases.\nSections 11,17 and 23 are those by which, it is said, we must be governed. Section 17 provides for the cases in which an appeal shall lie. It enacts thus : \" Subject to the limitations and provisions hereinafter made, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the Court of final resort whether such Court be a Court of Appeal or of original jurisdiction, now or hereafter to be established in any Province of Canada, in cases in which the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court And the right to appeal in civil cases given by this Act shall be understood to be given in such cases only as are mentioned in this section, except Exchequer cases, and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus, or municipal by-laws, as hereinafter provided.\" Section 23 contains the only provisions to which the terms \" hereinafter \" and \"as hereinafter provided\" can be applied. Section 17 cannot embrace the provisions of section 11, for they are in reference to section 17 neither \"hereafter\" nor \" as hereinafter provided.\" Section 17 in its last clause clearly exempts from its own operation \" Exchequer cases, and cases of mandamus, habeas corpus, or municipal by-laws,\" and in so many words says that in all those cases, as provided for in section 23, there shall be an appeal. What then does section 23 provide? \" An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of \u00e1 criminal charge, and in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus,. and in any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule of Court, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument.\"\nAs I said before, from the stand point of section 17 we are told to look to section 23;and to invert our vision to section 11, would be looking backwards for the light we are ordered to look forwards for; we would, in fact, be looking toward the west for sunrise. If, however, we did look at section 11, we would find its provisions do not affect the construction we should put upon sections. 17 and 23, for by its terms the enactments in sections 17 and 23 are clearly excluded. It commences thus : \" Unless it is otherwise provided, or the context manifestly requires another construction,\" certain words therein mentioned shall have a prescribed meaning and the section ends with these words : \" and when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case it shall always be understood to be given from the court of last resort in the province where the judgment was rendered in such case.\" Were it not for the opening expressions used in the first part of that section, it would be in direct opposition to the provisions of sections 17 and 23, but by them the provisions of those sections at variance with those of section 11 are to prevail, because by them it is without question ''otherwise provided,\" and \"the context manifestly requires another construction.\" Under section 23 there must of course be a judgment, order, or decision to appeal from but, when there is, that section provides for an appeal to this Court, In regard to the proceeding for or upon a writ of mandamus, the section makes no limitation; but in the case \"in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule of Court or the rule for qquashing it has been refused after argument,\" the appeal is, as regards a municipal bylaw on conditions thus stated. It is allowed only in one case where the by-law has been quashed by rule of Court, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument. No such limitation as in the latter case is provided in regard to proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus or writ of mandamus. I feel bound to conclude, from a careful study of the whole case, that an appeal lies in the case in question to this Court, and that our judgment on the motion to quash it should be for the appellant.\nTASCHEREAU, J. :\u2014\nThis case is before us on a motion to quash the appeal. Marquis, the respondent, sued out a writ of mandamus against the defendant, (appellant,) on the ground that the said appellant had, as warden of the County of Rimouski, illegally refused to sign certain proceedings of the County Council, in which he, the plaintiff, had an interest. The writ was allowed by a Judge in Chambers, and made returnable before him in Chambers, and the whole of the proceedings, including the judgment complained of, took place before a Judge in Chambers, sitting in vacation, under sections 10, 23 et Seq of the Code of Procedure. By this judgment, the defendant (appellant) was declared to have illegally acted, in refusing to sign immediately the proceedings in question, but as it appeared that, since the return of the said writ, he had signed them, he was condemned only in the costs of the proceedings. The defendant appealed from this judgment to the Court of Queen's Bench, but this appeal was dismissed on motion as by article 1033 of the Code of Procedure no appeal is allowed on mandamus in municipal matters. This judgment is reported ([3]). It was undoubtedly correct, and it can hardly be seen how the defendant could have brought such a case before the Court of Queen's Bench in the face of the article of the Code and the constant jurisprudence of the Courts in the matter ([4]).\nHe now admits this error, and appeals to this Court, not from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissing his appeal, but from the judgment given against him at Rimouski by a Judge in Chambers, as just mentioned. We have-now to determine whether the appellant has an appeal to this Court from this last mentioned judgment.\nThree clauses of the Supreme Court Act have to be examined on this question : the eleventh (11th), seventeenth (17th) and twenty-third (23rd). The eleventh, which is the interpretation clause of the Act, reads as follows:\nUnless it is otherwise provided, or the context manifestly requires another construction, the following words and expressions when used in this Act with reference to proceedings under it in appeal shall have the meaning assigned to them respectively.\nThe expression \" the Court,\" means the Supreme Court;\" and the expression \" the Court appealed from,\" means the Court from which the appeal has been brought directly to the Supreme Court, whether such Court be a Court of original jurisdiction, or a Court of Error and Appeal l and when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case, it shall always be understood to be given from the Court of last resort in the Province where the judgment was rendered in such case\nThe 17th clause is in the following words:\nSubject to the limitations and provisions hereinafter made, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the highest Courts of final resort whether such Court be a Court of Appeal or of original jurisdiction, now or hereafter established in any Province of Canada, in cases in which the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court; provided that no appeal shall be allowed from any judgment rendered in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec in any case wherein the sum or value of the matter in dispute does not amount to two thousand dollars : and the right to appeal in civil cases given by this Act shall be understood to be given in such cases only as are mentioned in this section, except Exchequer cases and cases of mandamus. habeas corpus or municipal by-laws, as hereinafter provided\u00bb\nAnd the 23rd clause enacts that:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of a criminal charge, and in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of mandamus, and in any case in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule of Court, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument.\nThe contention of the appellant is that this last clause entitles him to his present appeal.\nCertainly if it was to be applied as it reads alone, and independently of the other parts of the Statute, the appellant would be well founded in his contention But if, on the one hand, a well settled rule on interpretation of Statutes is that the interpretation clause is not to be strictly construed, on the other hand, it is a rule equally clear and well established that the intention of the law giver is to be deduced from a review of the whole and of every part of the Statute, taken and compared together ([5]). The interpretation clause must receive a liberal construction, it is true, but it is equally true, in my opinion, that it cannot be altogether thrown aside in the interpretation of a particular subsequent enactment. Quite the contrary, it over-rides the whole Statute, and, in the very terms of section 11 of the Supreme Court Act, unless it is other wise provided, or the context manifestly requires another construction, the meaning given to a particular word in the interpretation clause attaches to that word throughout the whole Statute.\nNow, this section_J.1 positively enacts that, when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case, it shall always be understood to be given from the Court of last resort in the Province where the judgment was rendered in such case. On one part of his argument at the hearing before us, the appellant, far from denying the bearing of section 11, or section 23, invoked it, if I understood him well, but argued that, in his case the judgment he appeals from is the judgment of the Court of last resort, quad him, as he had no appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench. But it seems to me that the words of this section 11 clearly say that no appeal is given in any case, except from the Court of last resort in each Province. The words \" whether such Court be a Court of original jurisdiction or a Court of appeal l in this section and in section 17., cannot be interpreted so as to give an appeal either from the Court of original jurisdiction or from the Court of Appeal in the Provinces where there are Courts of Appeal; but, it seems to me, only mean that, in the Provinces where there are no Courts of Appeal the appeal to the Supreme Court shall lie from the court of original jurisdiction, (provided the court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court,) and in the provinces where there exist Courts of Appeal, the appeal to this Court shall lie from that Court of Appeal in all cases giving an appeal to this Court only from the Court of last resort in each Province. This distinction was most wisely made in the Act, as it is well known that in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and some of the other Provinces there are no Courts of Appeal. Cases come before us directly from the Courts of original jurisdiction, because for such Provinces they are the Courts of last resort. But is the appellant here, putting the question in the very words of section 11, appealing from a judgment given by the Court of last resort in the Province where the judgment was rendered in his case? Clearly not. The Court of last resort in the Province of Quebec is the Court of Queen's Bench he appeals from the Superior Court.\nThe appellant, in another part of his argument, tried to get rid of this sec. 11 of the Act by relying entirely on sec. 23 and reading it by itself, and as not ruled by the said sec. 11. I have already laid down the clear, fair and well established principle that the intention of the law-giver is to be deduced from a view of the whole and of every part of a Statute, taken and compared together. \"It is an elementary rule,\" says Maxwell, \" that construction is to be made of all the parts together, and not of one part only by itself\" ([6]). Now, taking the whole of this Act together, it appears to me that even in criminal cases the intention of the Dominion Parliament has been to give an appeal to this Court from the Courts of last resort in each Province only and from no other Courts. As I have said already if the Court of last resort in a Province is a Court of original jurisdiction, then the appeal is given from that Court of original jurisdiction; if, on the contrary, in another Province the Court of last resort is a Court of Appeal, then the appeal to the Supreme Court is given from that provincial Court of Appeal.\nAnd what would be the consequences for the Province of Quebec if we were to give effect to this 23rd clause as it reads by itself and without reference to sec. 11 of the Act? Virtually to abolish the Court of Review and the Court of Appeal in all cases of habeas corpus (not arising out of a criminal charge), and in all cases of mandamus, in other than municipal matters. In such cases under the Provincial laws, there is an appeal to both these Courts under certain restrictions ([7]).\nNow, if section 23 of the Supreme Court Act is to be construed independently of sec. 11, in all these cases an appeal would be given to the Supreme Court directly from the Court of original jurisdiction, without obliging the parties to go to review or to appeal in the Province. It may be doubted if the Dominion Parliament has such a power: whether it can in any case take away directly or indirectly the jurisdiction that each Local Legislature chooses to give to its own Provincial courts; whether under section 101 of the B. N. A. Act it has the power to give an appeal to the Supreme Court from any other but the Court of last resort in each Province. But I need not enquire into this; in my opinion, it has not done so in section 23 of the Supreme Court Act, because I hold that this section is ruled by section 11 and that, under both, no appeal to this Court lies in any case except from the Court of last resort in each Province.\nAnother anomalous consequence of the interpretation that the appellant gives to this clause would be that, in the Province of Quebec, an appeal to this Court would be in some cases from the Circuit Court. For this section 23, gives also an appeal to this Court in all cases in which a by-law of a municipal corporation has been quashed by rule of Court, or the rule for quashing it has been refused after argument. Now, in the Province of Quebec under the municipal codes, all such cases are brought before the Circuit Court, and, if the appellant\u2019s contention was admitted, could be appealed from that Court here. By holding that there is no appeal except from the Court of last resort in each Province, we avoid making the Statute give an appeal to this Court direct from the Quebec Circuit Court, which I believe was not the intention of the Parliament to give. Then, with this interpretation, in cases concerning the quashing of municipal by-laws, as in mandamus and habeas corpus in civil matters, and all other cases, the parties have to go to the local Court of Appeal before coming here ([8]).\n\"Before adopting any proposed construction of a passage susceptible of more than one meaning,\" says Maxwell, on Statutes ([9]), i it is necessary to consider the effects or consequences which would result from it for they do very often point out the genuine meaning of the words. There are certain objects which the legislature is presumed not to intend, and a construction which would lead to any of them is therefore to be avoided.\"\nApplying these remarks to this case, and believing that it was not the intention of Parliament to give in any case an appeal to this Court directly from the Circuit Court of the Province of Quebec I cannot read this section 23 so as to have an effect which Parliament did not intend.\nAnother possible objection to this appeal is that it is from a Judge in Chambers, and not from the Superior Court. In certain cases, an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench or to the Court of Review, is given from a Judge in Chambers, but only when a special enactment allows it. So it was held by the Court of Queen's Bench, in Beliveau v. Chevrfils ([10]); see, also, Blanchard v. Miller (1). Now, quoad appeals to the Supreme Court, there is no such enactment.\nI am of opinion that the respondent's motion must be granted, and the appeal quashed with costs.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred with Strong and.

J.,\u2014That an appeal does not lie from the Court of Review (P.Q.) to the Supreme Court of Canada. [Henry, J., contra.]\nMOTION to quash appeal.\nThe judgment appealed from was rendered by the Court of Review (P.Q.) sitting at Montreal, on the 29th September, 1877.\nOn the 22nd October 1877 a motion for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was made; on the 14th of the same month the motion was granted the 20th November, 1877, being finally set down as the day upon which the amount and nature of the security should be adjudged. On the 20th November, 1877, appellant deposited in the hands of the prothonotary of the Superior Court for the district of Montreal $500. On the 5th December, 1877, execution was taken out by plaintiff, and defendant fyled an opposition a fin d'annuller, with an affidavit that the $500, deposited on the 20th November, 1877, were as security for the costs of the Superior Court, as appeared by the following certificate:'. We, the undersigned, joint prothonotary of \" the Superior Court for tower Ganada, district of Monreal, do hereby certify that the said defendant de-\"l posited in our office on the 20th day of November l last the sum of five hundred dollars as security for \" costs in this cause.\nGiven at Montreal this fifth day of December, 1877.\n(Signed,) \"HUBERT, HONEY & GENDRON,\n\"P. S. C.\"\nOn the 17th January, 1878, appellant procured from The prothonotary the certificate given above in the head note, and fyled it With the printed case as complying with the 6th Rule of the Supreme Court Rules\nMr. Bethune, Q. C., for respondent:\nThe respondent moves to quash this appeal:1st. On the ground that no appeal to the Supreme Court lies from a judgment of the Court of Review of the Province of Quebec, as it is not \" the highest court of final resort\" in the province; 2nd. On the ground that there is no certificate to show that a bond for costs was ever executed to the satisfaction of the Court below or of a judge thereof, as required by the 31st section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and by the 6th Rule of the Supreme Court Rules.\nThe security that the appellant contends is sufficient in this case consists of the sum of $500, which was put into the hands of the prothonotary of the Court below on the 20th November, 1877. There is no evidence that the Court below, or any judge thereof, or the respondent, ever knew that this amount had been deposited for this appeal. There was an application made to put in security, and, after a long delay, on the 17th December, 1877 it was dismissed by Mr. Justice Rainville. An execution was then taken out by the respondent, and an opposition a fin d'annuller was put m by appellant, accompanied by an affidavit that $500 had been deposited in the hands of the prothonotary on the 20th November, 1877, as security for the costs in the Court below. It was only subsequently to the fyling of his opposition and the dismissal of this application, after execution issued, that respondent heard, for the first time that the $500 deposited were intended for security for costs of the Supreme Court appeal. I contend there is no provision in the Statute allowing the prothonotary to accept this security; no one but the Court or a judge thereof can certify that proper security has been given.\nInstead of a proper certificate, it seems that a private arrangement was arrived at between the prothonotary and the appellant, the amount which had originally been deposited for costs in the Court below being suddenly declared to be a security for costs of an appeal to the Supreme Court. It is clear there is no certificate of a judge given within thirty days from the date of the judgment.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: We will hear the counsel for the appellant on this point before going any further.\nMr. Loranger, Q. C. (Mr. Mclntyre with him) for appellant:\u2014\nUnder the law of the Province of Quebec the money once deposited in the hands of the prothonotary is under the control of the Court. If a party wishes 1o bring an appeal, and is not in a position to give security, a deposit of money in the hands of the prothonotary is deemed a proper security, for, under 31 Vic., c. 5, sec. 4, P. Q., the prothonotary is obliged to deposit all monies received in a case to the credit of the parties in the hands of the Treasurer of the Province and this must be considered the best kind of security. As to notice, there can be no necessity to give respondent notice, as no one can remove the money but on an order of the Court. It is contended that there is no proof that the security required by law has been given. The certificate fyled is in accordance with the 31st section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and there is, at least, a legal presumption that proper security has been given, for the Court below allowed the appeal only after taking cognizance of the security. In our province there is no mention of money, because money deposited in Court is considered better than any bond. The money is deposited for the costs of this appeal, and. so far the law has been complied with; the judges of )the Court below have allowed the appeal, and the case is fixed for hearing; and we are now told that the appeal must be quashed. I respectfully submit that if this certificate is not deemed sufficient, the appellant is entitled to have the certificate and security completed in accordance with the views of this Court.\nMr. Bethune, Q. C., in reply:\u2014\nThe order of dates disposes as to the argument relied on in consequence of the granting of the appeal. The certificate referred to has nothing to do with the security; it only has reference to the settling of the case. There is nowhere to be found a certificate of the Court below, or of a judge thereof, that proper security has been given.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nAn application was made to quash the appeal in this case on two grounds. 1st. That no appeal would lie in the case. 2nd. That the security required by the Statute bad not been given. As the last objection must prevail, it will be unnecessary to discuss the first.\nThe 31st section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act provides that:\nNo appeal shall be allowed (except only the case of appeal in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus,) until the appellant has given proper security to the extent of $500 to the satisfaction of the Court from whose judgment he is about to appeal or a Judge thereof that he will effectually prosecute his appeal and pay such costs and damages as may be awarded in case the judgment appealed from be affirmed; provided that this section shall not apply to appeals in election cases, for which special provision is hereinafter made.\nAnd Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules provides that:\nThe case shall be accompanied by a certificate under the seal of the Court below, stating that the appellant has given proper security to the satisfaction of the Court whose judgment is appealed from, or of a judge thereof, and setting forth the nature of the security to the M amount of five hundred dollars, as required by the thirty-first section of the said Act, and a copy of any bond or other instrument, by which security may have been given, shall be annexed to the certificate,,\nThe only certificate accompanying the case is as follows:\nWe, the undersigned, joint prothonotary for the Superior Court of Lower Canada, now the Province of Quebec, do hereby certify that the said defendant has deposited in our office, on the twentieth day of November last, the sum of five hundred dollars, as security in appeal in this case, before the Supreme Court, according to section thirty-first of the Supreme Court Act, passed in the thirty-eighth year of Her Majesty, chapter second.\nMontreal, 17th January, 1878.\nHUBERT, HONEY & GENDRON,\nP.S.C.\nAnd it does not appear that there has been \"any proper security to the extent of $500 to the satisfaction of the Court from whose judgment the appellant is appealing, or a judge thereof, that he will effectually prosecute his appeal and pay such costs and damages as may be awarded in case the judgment appealed from be affirmed.\" The mere fact that the party appealing has deposited $500 as security in appeal before the Supreme Court, according to section 31 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and a certificate to that effect, is neither a compliance with the Statute nor the rule. The proper security must be to the satisfaction of the Court or judge, or it is not the security required by the Statute; and the certificate must show that such is the case. It does not follow, by any means, that the Court or judge would be satisfied that the proper security was given by the appellant of his own mere motion depositing \" as security on appeal l $500 in the prothonotary's office. It is not for this Court to determine whether money simply deposited in the prothonotary's office is a satisfactory security or not. It is enough to say that whether the security, which, it is alleged, has been given, may be a sufficient security or not, it is not the proper security required by law, and which the law has made a condition precedent to the allowance of the appeal, and without compliance with which, the law declares no appeal shall be allowed.\nThis case has been a long time before the Court and the appellant, in the course of his argument, has craved indulgence to enable him to produce a proper certificate; he has taken no steps whatever to bring any facts connected with this deposit under the notice of the Court, or in any way to explain why he did not obtain a proper certificate, or even to show that this money was really deposited as security for costs in this Court on this appeal, or that it is a security satisfactory to the Court or a judge; nor has he produced any affidavit in any way explanatory of the matter, or made any formal application; nor put forward any facts on affidavit to justify this Court in delaying the plaintiff from obtaining the benefit of the judgment pronounced in his favor: but, on the contrary, the documents in this cause would show that the amount deposited by appellant has been treated by him, not as security for the costs in this cause in this Court, but as security for costs in the Court below.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI think the motion to quash the appeal must be granted on two grounds.\nFirst. An appeal does not, in my opinion, lie in any case from the Court of Review directly to this Court. The Supreme Court Act only authorizes an appeal from the highest Court of final resort in the Province, and in the judgment just pronounced in the case of Danjou.v. Marquis, I have stated my reasons for the conclusion, that the highest Court of final resort in the province of Quebec means, under the present judicial constitution of that Province, the Court of Queen's Bench, from which alone an appeal lies to this Court.\nSecondly. The payment of the $500 to the prothonotary, not having been made under any order, or to the satisfaction of the Court appealed from, or of one of its judges, was entirely unauthorized by the Statute, and therefore nugatory, and just as ineffectual as security for the costs of the appeal as the payment of the same sum into any private hands would have been. The appeal must be quashed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J:\u2014\nL'Intim\u00e9 demande le renvoi de cet appel pour deux motifs,\u2014le premier, est le d\u00e9faut de juridiction le cette Cour pour entretenir l'appel; le deuxi\u00e8me est de n'avoir pas donn\u00e9 le cautionnement requis par la loi pour pouvoir se porter appelant.\nCe dernier moyen doit \u00eatre consider\u00e9 le premier, car s'il est fond\u00e9 il devient inutile de s'occuper du premier. En effet sans un cautionnement valable il n'existe pas d'appel, et dans ce cas, cette Cour ne se trouvant pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de la cause, elle doit s'abstenir d'examiner la question de juridiction.\nLa sec. 81 de la 38me Vict. ch. 11, impose comme condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'exercice du droit d'appel, l'obligation de donner un cautionnement de $500 \" \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour de laquelle il y a appel, ou d'un juge \" de cette Cour. Dans le cas actuel cette formalit\u00e9 essentielle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie.\nAu lieu du cautionnement requis, l'appelant a fait entre les mains des prothonotaires du district de Montr\u00e9al un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $500 pour lequel ceux-ci lui ont donn\u00e9 le certificat suivant:\nWe, the undersigned, Joint Prothonotary for the Superior Court of Lower Canada, now the Province of Quebec, do hereby certify that the said Defendant has deposited in our office, on the twentieth day of November last, the sum of five hundred dollars, as security in appeal in this case, before the Supreme Court, according to section (31st) thirty-first of the Supreme Court Act, passed in the thirty-eighth-year of Her Majesty, chapter eleven. Montreal 17th January, 1878. HUBERT, HONEY & GENDRON, P. S. C.\nLe d\u00e9p\u00f4t ainsi fait, s'il avait re\u00e7u 1 approbation de la Cour ou du juge, serait sans doute pour l'Intim\u00e9 une garantie pr\u00eaterable \u00e0 la simple promesse on obligation de payer constat\u00e9e par un cautionnement. Aussi les tribunaux n'ont jamais fait difficult\u00e9 d'admettre que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'une somme de deniers, tenait valablement lieu du cautionnement exig\u00e9 par la loi,\u2014mais encore fallait-il toujours avoir recours \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 de la Cour ou du juge pour faire d\u00e9clarer que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t tiendrait lieu de cautionnement. L'appelant pouvait donc remplacer le cautionnement par un d\u00e9p\u00f4t; mais il ne pouvait pas plus\u2019 dans un cas que dans l'autre, se dispenser de l'approbation de la Cour ou du juge, tel que le requiert la section ci-dessus cit\u00e9e. Le juge devait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 donner son approbation au, d\u00e9p\u00f4t des deniers aussi bien qu'au cautionnement.\nEn supposant que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t en question aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de \" l'acte concernant les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts judiciaires,\" 35 Vict. ch. 5 (Statuts de Qu\u00e9bec), l'appelant n'en \u00e9tait pas moins oblige de recourir \u00e0 l'approbation du juge. Le certificat des protonotaires constate que les $500 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans leur bureau, mais il n'y a pas de preuve que cette somme ait \u00e9t\u00e9 remise au tr\u00e9sorier de la province. La sect. 4 de cet acte oblige les protonotaires de d\u00e9poser imm\u00e9diatement la dite somme d'argent, par eux re\u00e7ue \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9p\u00f4t judiciaire, au bureau du tr\u00e9sorier de la province et de produire dans le dossier de la Cour o\u00f9 cette somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, le re\u00e7u de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du tr\u00e9sorier,\u2014llequel re\u00e7u - fait preuve prim\u00e2 facie du d\u00e9pot.\nIl n'est pas prouv\u00e9 que ce re\u00e7u a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit dans la cause. O\u00f9 sont actuellement les deniers s Sont-ils encore entre les mains des protonotaires ou bien les ont-ils vers\u00e9s dans la caisse du tr\u00e9sorier de la province comme ils \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s de le faire? Si les deniers sont entre les mains des prothonotaries, ce n'est pas l\u00e0 qu'ils devraient se trouver ;\u2014s'ils sont dans la caisse du tr\u00e9sorier, ce fait n'est pas prouv\u00e9, et nous ne pouvons pas le pr\u00e9sumer, car la loi a pris le soin de d\u00e9clarer, que le fait du d\u00e9p\u00f4t, serait \u00e9tabli par la production dans le dossier du re\u00e7u de d\u00e9p\u00f4t du tr\u00e9sorier.\nLes protonotaires certifient bien le fait de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t dans leur bureau, mais la loi ne les a pas charg\u00e9s de cette mission vis-\u00e0-vis de cette Cour. C'est la fonction de la Cour ou du juge dont il y a appel, qu'en agissant ainsi, ils ont pris sur eux-m\u00eames de remplir sans en avoir l'autorit\u00e9. Leur devoir \u00e9tait de produire le re\u00e7u du tr\u00e9sorier dans le dossier; et sur production de ce re\u00e7u la Cour ou le juge aurait pu donner un certificat \u00e0 cette Cour constatant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Ce certificat eut sans doute, \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un accomplissement suffisant de la formalit\u00e9 requise par la loi. L'approbation du juge est de rigueur; elle est indispensable pour mettre les deniers sous le contr\u00f4le de la justice et les affecter \u00e0 la garantie des frais d'appel. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e, sans doute pour mettre un terme aux contestations qui s'\u00e9levaient souvent sur la validit\u00e9 du cautionnement lorsqu'il s'agissait d'en r\u00e9aliser le montant. Cette approbation du juge est un jugement final qui rend maintenant impossible une semblable contestation.\nRien ne d\u00e9montre mieux l'importance de cette formalit\u00e9, que la conduite subs\u00e9quente tenue par l'appelant au sujet de ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu des protonotaires le certificat ci-haut cit\u00e9, constatant que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $500, est fait comme garantie des frais d'appel, as security in appeal in this case, il a essay\u00e9 d'en faire un autre emploi, en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il avait fait ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour couvrir les frais encourus dans la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure comme on le verra ci-apr\u00e8s. L'appelant n'ayant pas donn\u00e9 le cautionnement voulu par le paragraphe 5 de la sec. 32, pour suspendre l'ex\u00e9cution l'Intim\u00e9 fit \u00e9maner un bref d'ex\u00e9cution du jugement en cette cause, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1877. Pour en suspendre l'effet, l'appelant produisit une opposition afin d'annuler, dans laquelle il pr\u00e9tend sous serment ne pas avoir donn\u00e9 de cautionnement d'appel. Il dit au contraire que son d\u00e9p\u00f4t doit \u00eatre affect\u00e9 au paiement des frais de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nQu'il est plus que suffisant pour couvrir les frais mentionn\u00e9s au \" dit bref, et ce d\u00e9p\u00f4t ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait comme susdit, ainsi qu'il appert \" par le certificat produit avec les pr\u00e9sentes (celui ci-dessous cit\u00e9), \" le demandeur (Intim\u00e9) est sans droit \u00e0 demander l'ex\u00e9cution de \" son jugement pour le montant des dits frais.\"\nCe nouveau certificat, aussi donn\u00e9 par les protonotaires est comme suit:\nWe, the undersigned Joint Prothonotary of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, District of Montreal, do hereby certify that the said Defendant deposited in our office on the twentieth day of November last, the sum of five hundred dollars as security for costs in this cause.\nGiven at Montreal this fifth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven. Hubert, Honey & Gendron, P. S. C.\nAinsi nous avons deux certificats, l'un appropriant les deniers d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 la garantie des frais d'appel; l'autre, les affectant au paiement des frais d\u00e9j\u00e0 faits en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nC'est un double emploi que l'appelant veut faire. Il est \u00e9vident que si l'on avait eu recours en premier lieu \u00e0 l'approbation du juge, l'appelant n'aurait pu faire un semblable usage de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t, et encore moins tenir \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tribunaux une conduite aussi peu respectueuse.\nAvant d'avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les faits par la lecture des papiers, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 dispose, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 permettre l'amendement du certificat, comme la Cour du Banc de la Reine permet l'amendement du cautionnement surtout dans les cas o\u00f9 l'erreur provient des officiers des tribunaux,\u2014mais maintenant Si une demande r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e9tait faite \u00e0 cette fin, il faudrait, pour me d\u00e9cider \u00e0 l'accorder, une preuve suffisante pour d\u00e9truire le mauvais effet produit par l'opposition de l'appelant.\nPour ces raisons j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t est nul, et que l'appelant ne s'\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la 3le section, au sujet du cautionnement, son appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nEtant d'avis qu'il n'y a pas de cautionnement, et que par cons\u00e9quent cette cause n'est pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement devant la Cour, je m'abstiens d'exprimer mon opinion sur la question de juridiction.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the Superior Court in review in Montreal, who gave a judgment in favor of the respondent on an appeal to that Court from the Superior Court of first instance. An appeal was first had to the Court of Queen's Bench sitting in appeal, and after argument the latter Court decided that, inasmuch as the Court of Review confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, there was no appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench. Under the law, I think, that decision was correct, and in consequence thereof the appeal to this Court was had. On a motion before us to dismiss the appeal, the respondent's counsel relied upon two grounds:\u2014\n1st. That under the circumstances the Supreme Court Act provided for no appeal.\n2nd. That the proper security had not been given.\nSections 11 and 17 of the Supreme Court Act were relied upon, and it was contended that under those sections there was no appeal, except from the Court of final resort, and that as, in most cases the Court of Review was not a Court of final resort, no appeal would lie from it to this Court in any case.\nSection 11, after declaring how the terms \"judgment,\" \" appeal,\" the expression \"the Court,\" and \"the Court appealed from \" shall be construed, provides that \" when an appeal to the Supreme Court is given from a judgment in any case,it shall always be understood to be given from the Court of last resort in the province where the judgment was rendered in such case.\"\nIt is contended, on one side, that the true construction of the last provision is to limit the appeal to cases where a judgment is of the Court of last resort not in the particular case, but of the Court of last resort generally, and that no appeal will lie in any case from any other than the Court of last resort, whether the Court of last resort has jurisdiction as an Appellate Court in any particular case or not.\nOn the other side, it is argued that it means the Court of last resort in the particular case.\nOwing to the peculiar position of jurisprudence in Quebec, by which the Court of Review is made, in certain cases, the Court of last resort, as is the case here, a difficulty arises as to the last clause of section 11\u2014 the words \"in such case \" at the end of the clause. Were these words inserted immediately after the word \"Province,\" the sentence would then read that the appeal should be \"from the Court of last resort in the Province in such case,\" which would clearly favor the appeal herein, and I am of the opinion that we should so place them. The words of the clause are:\" When an appeal is given from a judgment, in any case, it shall always be understood to be given from the Court of last resort in such case.\" The words i in the Province where the judgment was rendered,\" do not, in my judgment, affect the construction, adversely to my view, although they precede the words \"in such case.\" It was, it appears to me, properly the intention of the legislature to create a general Court of Appeal, and when we find that by local legislation a party is debarred from an appeal to the highest Court in a Province and when an appeal lies from Courts of original jurisdiction, where no higher Courts exist, provided they are superior Courts, I think, in a similar case, we are justified in the conclusion that the true construction of that section (13) would give an appeal in any case where the Superior Court in Quebec is the Court of final resort, and were we to be governed by that section alone I would so hold.\nSection 17, however, is differently constructed. It provides that \"an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the highest Court of final resort whether such Court be a Court of Appeal or of original jurisdiction * * * in cases where the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court * * * and the right to appeal in civil cases * * * shall be understood to be given in such cases as are mentioned in this section.\" The word \"highest\" adds nothing to the value of the provision, for the court of final resort must be \"highest,\" and we are to read the sentence which contains it as simply the Court of final resort. That term is synonymous with the term used in the 11th section; for \"last resort\" and \"highest resort,\" mean the same thing.\nSection Il is the interpretation clause of the Act, and must be construed to extend the meaning of \"final judgment\" in the 17th section. J Judgment\" is a technical legal term, and without sec. 11 it would be construed in its technical sense and would not cover \"rules,\" \"orders\" or other matters specified in section 11. In section 17 we have the words \"highest court of final resort,\" which, I have shown means no more than \"Court of final resort.\" As to the meaning and application of the latter term we are to look at section 11 and decide according to its provisions as in the other in regard to the prescribed application of the term judgment.\" If, therefore, my construction of the concluding clause of section 13 be the correct one, section 17, as read in the light of the provisions of the section which interprets it, that is, as to the Court of final resort, I may safely say the appeal will lie to this Court,\nThe Parliament of Canada, when passing the Supreme Court Act must be assumed to know the state of the law in Quebec, as to appeals from the Court of Review, (which is an Appeal Court,) and to have known that no appeal would lie therefrom in certain cases to the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal. The Act provides for appeals from all provinces where the Court of original jurisdiction is the Court of final resort in all cases. The policy of the Act is, therefore, to allow appeals in all cases where the Court of original jurisdiction is the Court of final resort, where the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court. in certain cases, then, in Quebec, where the Court of original jurisdiction is a Superior Court, and as to those cases, a Court of final resort, unless my construction be adopted, there would be no appeal while in other provinces there would be. In Quebec, as to those cases, there would be no appeal, while in other provinces under similar circumstances an appeal lies. In the construction of Statutes, where any difficulty arises, we are not only authorized, but required to give effect, not only to the mere words employed as far as they are intelligible, but to give effect as well to the spirit as the letter of the enactment and if by one construction an obvious inconsistency appears and by another it is consistent we are bound to give a construction by which its consistency will be shown. I, therefore, consider myself justified in deciding that the appeal herein is provided for.\nThe other point, however, I feel bound to decide against the appellant. By the rules of this Court the appellant is required to put in security to the satisfaction of the Court appealed from or of a judge thereof, and the case must be accompanied by a certificate, under the seal of the Court so stating. The certificate in this case is defective. In the first place it is not under the seal of the Court as required by rule 6 of this Court and it does not allegue the security to have been \" to the satisfaction of the Court * * * or of a judge thereof.\" Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act requires the security to be so given as well as the rule before mentioned By the section and rule the security must be given to the satisfaction of the Court below or a Judge thereof, and the rule provides for the evidence of that fact to us. The right of deciding as to the sufficiency of the security is vested in the Court below or a Judge thereof, and I can see no way for substituting any other means of deciding it. Even were it shown the security was ample, we are not authorized to decide upon it as the law has not authorized us to do so. Our jurisdiction to hear the appeal is conditional upon the Court below or a Judge thereof being satisfied with the security. Although not within our functions to decide upon the sufficiency of the security, we might possibly have reserved our decision and allowed the appellant reasonable time to obtain the necessary certificate, had we been so asked within a reasonable time after the appeal was first inscribed; but no such request having been made and so long a time having elapsed, I don't think we should now suggest such a course, or permit it to be taken. I think, therefore the appeal must be dismissed. TASCHEREAU, J.:\u2011\nOn the first ground of the respondent's motion to dismiss this appeal that is to say, for want of sufficient security, I would be of opinion to remit the record to the Court below under the fourth of the rules of practice of this Court in order to allow the certificate to be completed. The prothonotary duly certifies to us that the appellant has deposited in his office the sum of $500 as security in appeal to this Court, according to section 31 of the Supreme Court Act. According to 35 Vic, c. 5, Q., an Act concerning judicial deposits, that sum must now he in the hands of the Provincial Treasurer as such security. Omnia presumuntur rite esse acta donec probetur in contrarium. The first certificate given by the prothonotary, filed by the respondent with his motion is not at variance with the certificate returned to this Court with the case and I fail to see by the opposition made by the appellant in the Court below, and fyled here by the respondent with his motion, that these $500 were deposited for any other purpose than as security for the appeal to this Court. What other security was the appellant obliged to give, or could he even give? The prothonotary certifies to us that security has been given for the appeal to this Court, and for me this is conclusive. But there is an irregularity in this certificate, inasmuch as it does not state, as required by the 6th of our rules of practice, that such security was given to the satisfaction of the Court appealed from or of a judge thereof. As $500 deposited in cash are certainly the. best security that could be given under section 31 .of the Supreme Court Act this irregularity seems to me only a matter of form, and, according to the 69th of our rules of practice which says that no proceeding in this Court shall be defeated by any formal objection, I would be of opinion to remit the record to the Court below to have this irregularity remedied.\nBut on the second ground of his motion I am with the respondent, and think that this appeal should be dismissed, because it is an appeal from the Court of Review, and consequently not from the highest Court of last resort in the Province of Quebec.\nI need not repeat here what I have just said in Danjou v. Marquis. For the reasons I gave then which apply, for the greater part, to this case, I am of opinion that there is no appeal from the Court of Review in the Province of Quebec, because that Court is not the Court of last resort in the Province. The appellant contends that for him, in this case the Court of Review is the Court of last resort. That is so. But it is not the Court of last resort in the Province where the judgment was rendered in this case, according to the very words of section 11. He is not allowed to go to that Court of last resort, hut that is by his own act, and, then, it is not a reason to allow him an appeal from any other Court in face of this section 11 of the Supreme Court Act. Then section 17, under which he brings his appeal, is still stronger against him. \"An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court, \" says this clause, \"from all final judgments of the highest Court of final resort now or hereafter established in any Province, and the right to appeal in civil cases given by this Act shall be understood to be given only in such cases as are mentioned in this section \" This seems to me perfectly clear. No appeal except from the Court of last resort in each Province is given. If a different construction was given to the Statute, this case might have been pending at the same time before this Court and before the Quebec Court of Appeal. For immediately, when the judgment in Review was given, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, the plaintiff who in the Superior Court, had obtained judgment for $16,000 less than he demanded, had a right to appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench from that judgment, under sections 499 and 1118 of the Code of Procedure. So that the case would have been pending at the same time before the Court of Queen's Bench on an appeal by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Superior Court, and before this Court on an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Review.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Loranger, Loranger & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for respondent: Bethune & Bethune.\n"

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gywnne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAction\u2014Evidence\u2014Judgment, parol evidence of determination of suit by, inadmissible.\nIn an action of damages for malicious arrest and imprisonment of plaintiff, under a capias, issued by a stipendiary magistrate in Nova Scotia, whose judgment, it was alleged, was reversed in appeal by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, oral evidence\u2014\"that the decision of the magistrate was reversed,\"\u2014was deemed sufficient evidence by the Judge at the trial of the determination of the suit below. Held (reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia), that such evidence was inadmissible, and was not proper evidence of a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, rendered on the 2nd April, 1877.\nThis was an action brought by respondent (plaintiff) against appellant (defendant) to recover damages for alleged malicious prosecution.\nThe writ was issued on the 21st October, A. D. 1873, and the cause was tried before Mr. Justice Des Barres on the 28th March, A.D. 1876, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff for $150 damages.\nA rule nisi was taken under sec. 212, c. 94 of Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 4th series, to set this verdict aside, the Judge having refused a rule, and was argued before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the 12th day of April, A.D. 1876.\nThe rule nisi was discharged on the 2nd April, A.D. 1877.\nThe facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgments on this appeal.\nMr. Cockburn, Q.C., for appellant:\nThere was no sufficient proof of the termination of the suit below. R. L. Weatherbe's evidence is the only evidence that the suit below was terminated. Mr. Weatherbe admits that the Judges on appeals of summary causes keep or use a docket and make minutes of their proceedings. This book should have been produced. There was, therefore, mis-direction on the part of the learned judge who tried the cause, who ought to have told the jury that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the termination of the proceedings under which the arrest was made. See Panton v. Williams[1]; Rev. Stat. Nova Scotia, 4th series, c. 91, sec. 266. Mr. A. F. McIntyre, for respondent:\u2014\nNo objection was made to the charge by counsel on either side. The evidence of Mr. Weatherbe, which was offered and received to prove the termination of the proceedings had under the capias, was in all respects sufficient to establish the termination of those proceedings. The question whether judgment was given in favor of the respondent in the proceedings on the capias being a matter of fact was held to be properly provable as such by any competent witness present when the judgment was delivered and who knew the fact.\nDyson v. Wood[2]; also Sinclair v. Haynes[3]; Pierce v. Street[4]; Arundell v. White[5].\nThere was no necessity under the practice of the Court to prove by record or memorandum the determination of the suit, for no record is filed in appeal cases, and execution issues in such causes upon the bill of costs filed without any record.\nRev. Stat. Nova Scotia, c. 91, secs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 19, 20, 31, 32, 33, 34; c. 94, sec. 77, 78 and 266.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Broad v. Ham[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis was an action for maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, procuring a party to be arrested and imprisoned on a writ issued against him at suit of defendant, and the declaration alleges, that \"such proceedings were thereupon had in the said action that the now plaintiff obtained final judgment of nil capiat thereon against the now defendant, whereby the said action was determined;\" and, in an added count, he alleges that the magistrate who issued the writ gave judgment for plaintiff, the now defendant; that the now plaintiff, the then defendant, applied for, and perfected, an appeal from the said judgment to the Supreme Court according to the Statute, and the now plaintiff caused his appeal to be entered upon the docket of the Supreme Court, and did duly prosecute his said appeal in said Supreme Court, and such proceedings were thereupon had in said suit that the said judgment was reversed, and the now plaintiff obtained final judgment in said suit of nil capiat therein, against the now defendant, whereby said action was determined.\nTo this declaration defendant pleaded inter alia:\n\"6th. That the said action was not determined as alleged.\n\"9th. That the plaintiff did not appeal from the judgment of the said stipendiary magistrate as alleged.\n\"10th. That the said judgment was not reversed, as alleged, on appeal to the Supreme Court, whereby said action was determined as alleged.\"\nOn the trial, the judgment given by the magistrate appears to have been proved, and the only evidence given to support the allegation as to the appeal, reversal and final judgment that I can discover is as follows:\u2014\nRobert L. Weatherbe, sworn: I acted as Counsel for Cox on his appeal before the Supreme Court at Truro, at which Judge McCully presided. The decision of the magistrate was reversed.\nMr. McDonald objects.\nCross-examined: Don't know whether any judgment was entered in the Supreme Court on the appeal, or whether any execution was issued. I don't know whether Judges make entries on their dockets of the judgments which they deliver in summary and appeal causes, but I believe they make minutes.\nMr. Thompson objects.\nAnd Gunn, defendant, says:\nI was at the Supreme Court and heard the trial under the appeal. The only reference to this important allegation by the learned judge in his charge appears, after stating that in order to maintain suit it was incumbent on the plaintiff to give evidence of malice and want of probable cause for issuing writ and causing plaintiff to be arrested, to be comprised in these words \"and also to prove that the suit below was at an end.\"\nA verdict having been found for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a new trial on the ground, among others, of want of sufficient evidence of the termination of the suit in which the capias was issued. The Court discharged this rule and refused a new trial, and from this the defendant now appeals.\nThis is too plain a case to need any lengthened argument. There was no legal evidence of any determination of this suit, and the Judge should have directed a verdict for the defendant.\nThe case of Pierce v. Street[7], upon which the judgment of the Court is founded, has no application to this case whatever. In that case defendant had not declared within a year. Now we all know that formerly in England as well, I may say, as in New Brunswick, and I believe also in Ontario, by the general rule of law, a plaintiff must declare against a defendant within twelve months after the return of the writ; if he did not the cause was out of Court, and so most undoubtedly the cause was at an end, and there was no other way of showing it than, as was done in that case, by showing there was no declaration within the twelve months, and, therefore, Lord Tenterden says:\nThere was quite sufficient proof that the suit was at an end at the time when this action was commenced.\nAnd Littledale, J., says:\nThe suit was determined by the plaintiffs not declaring within a year. And Parke, J.:\nWhen the cause is out of Court, it must be considered determined.\nAnd it is somewhat curious that Arundell v. White[8], referred to by Parke, J., though noticed by the Court below, did not serve as a guide to show that such evidence as was given by Weatherbe in this case was wholly insufficient, and that though there may be no extended records, some evidence from the minutes or records of the Court is requisite. There it will be seen, as noticed by Parke, J., when in the Sheriff's Court in London, the practice was, upon the abandonment of a suit by the plaintiff, to make an entry in the minute book, it was held proof of such entry was sufficient to show that the suit was at an end. This case is much stronger here, the cause was never out of Court and never abandoned. If the suit was determined at all, it must have been by a solemn judgment of the Supreme Court, reversing the judgment of an inferior tribunal. If such took place, to say that in a Court such as the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, there was no entry or record of such a judgment, or no docket, minute, or memorandum book, or no document of any description fyled of record in which the decision of the Court was entered or kept, either by Judge or Clerk, nothing in the shape of a record to show how the parties' rights had been dealt with, and how the cause was disposed of, is simply incomprehensible and inconsistent with the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4th series). If no judgment was entered on the appeal, the party who desired to take proccedings in which it was necessary to show the cause finally disposed of, should have, by proper application, obtained a final disposition on the records of the Court before bringing an action, in which the determination of the suit was essential to his right to recover. If it has been disposed of, then that fact should be shown by an exemplified or examined copy from the records of the Court, and not, as in this case, by a party who was present at the appeal simply swearing \"the decision of the magistrate was reversed and this was objected to, which objection should have been sustained. Certainly, such a statement was not proper evidence of a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in an action brought by the respondent to recover damages for malicious arrest under a writ of capias, issued by a justice of the peace at the suit of the appellant. To the respondent's declaration the appellant pleaded in substance, (and they are the only pleas necessary to be noticed):\u2014\n1st. A denial that he issued the writ in question without reasonable, and probable cause.\n2nd. That the suit commenced by the issue of the said writ of capias was not determined as alleged.\n3rd. That he had probable cause for bringing the said action.\n4th. That the respondent did not appeal from the judgment of the magistrate, as alleged.\n5th. That the judgment given by the justice on the appeal whereby the said action was determined was not reversed as alleged.\nOn the trial of this cause an unsuccessful motion was made for a non-suit by the counsel of the appellant on the two following grounds:\u2014 1st. That there was no sufficient evidence to show the determination of the prior suit.\n2nd. No sufficient proof of the want of reasonable and probable cause.\nUnder the charge of the learned Judge, before whom the suit was tried, a verdict was given for the respondent for $150 damages. A rule nisi to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial was subsequently granted, and the same was, after argument, ordered to be discharged with costs; and from that decision the appeal was had to this Court.\nThe grounds for setting aside the verdict embodied in the rule nisi were:\u2014\n1. Because the verdict is against law and evidence.\n2. Mis-direction.\n3. For the improper rejection and reception of evidence.\n4. For excessive damages.\n5. On the grounds taken at the trial.\nUnder the first and third objections the appellant can question the validity of the verdict.\nThe objection at the trial on the motion for non-suit was that no sufficient evidence had been given of the termination of the prior suit; and that is covered by the first ground taken in the rule nisi, and also in the third, which objects to the reception of the evidence received, after being objected to, of the termination of the suit given by the only witness on that point.\nEntertaining the views I do as to the propriety of admitting that evidence, it will be unnecessary for me to refer to any other objection to the judgment. The only evidence adduced as to the determination of the prior suit was, as I copy it from the Judge's notes of the trial, as follows:\nRobert L. Weatherbe sworn:\u2014I acted as counsel for Cox on his appeal before the Supreme Court at Truro, at which Judge McCully presided. The decision of the magistrate was reversed.\nMr. McDonald objects.\nThe notes of trial show that Mr. McDonald was, on the trial, the counsel of the appellant. It is, therefore, open to the appellant still to object to that evidence, as the objection to it was over-ruled and that evidence submitted to the jury. On his cross-examination the same witness said:\nDon't know whether any judgment was entered in the Supreme Court on the appeal, or whether any execution was issued. I don't know whether the Judges make entries in their dockets of the judgments which they deliver in summary and appeal causes, but I believe they make minutes.\nTo this evidence the counsel of the respondent objected,\nWe have, therefore, the evidence on cross-examination objected to also. I think that evidence was quite admissible, going, as it did, to show there was evidence in writing that should have been produced. Every lawyer knows that primary evidence is what is called for on every legal trial, and until that is shown to be incapable of production, from its having been destroyed or otherwise, secondary evidence cannot be received.\nIt is a distinction of law, and not of fact, referring only to the quality and not to the strength of the proof. Evidence that carries on its face no indication that better remains behind is not secondary but primary. The cases which most frequently call for the application of the rule now under consideration are those which relate to the substitution of oral for written evidence, and the general rule of law with respect to this subject is, that the contents of a written instrument, which is capable of being produced, must be proved by the instrument itself and not by parol evidence.\n* * * * * *\nAnd first, oral evidence cannot be substituted for any instrument which the law requires to be in writing, such as records, public and judicial documents, official examinations, deeds of conveyance of land, wills, &c. * * *. In all these cases the law having required that the evidence of the transaction should be in writing, no other proof can be substituted for that, so long as the writing exists and is in the power of the party. Thus, for example, parol evidence is inadmissible to prove at what sittings or assizes a trial at nisi prius came on, or even that it took place at all; but the record, or, at least, the postea must be produced. So the date of a party's aprehension for a particular offence cannot be shown by parol, the warrant for apprehension or committal being superior evidence[9].\nIn his cross-examination, the witness before mentioned, when referring to Judges trying summary or appeal causes, says he believes \"they make minutes,\" and certainly creates the impression that \"there is better evidence beyond.\" He, the witness, only states that he acted for the respondent on his appeal, and that the judgment of the magistrate was reversed. He does not identify it as being the suit brought by the appellant under the capias, nor does he say how he came by the knowledge that the judgment was reversed. If oral evidence was at all permissible, he, if such were the case, should have stated that he was present and heard the judgment pronounced, or, in some other way, shown how he acquired the knowledge which might, for all he says, have been mere hearsay. It may be objected that he might have been cross-examined, and the source of his knowledge tested, but, I hold that the onus was on the respondent by the examination of his counsel to have got from the witness sufficient to show that he obtained his knowledge from a legitimate source. The evidence, therefore, in the bald way it is presented, does not, even if admissible, establish the fact that the particular suit referred to in the pleadings was determined.\nLet us consider, however, the provisions for the trial of appeal cases in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. By section 77 of the Practice Act, Revised Statutes, 4th series, p. 456:\nIn appeal causes, the appellant shall cause his appeal to be entered on the docket of summary cases, and in case he shall neglect to enter the same, the original judgment shall be affirmed at the instance of the opposite party, with costs.\nSec. 78. In all causes brought up by appeal and contested, the Court shall try the same anew.\nSec. 79 provides for a jury in summary and appeal cases at the discretion of the Court.\nSec. 80. In appeal cases, where the original judgment is affirmed, the final judgment shall include the debt and costs below, with the further costs, and execution shall issue for such debt and costs, or costs only as the case may require. Where the original judgment is reversed after the same has been enforced, the final judgment shall include the amount levied under the original judgment, together with the costs of reversal.\nSec. 81. In appeal cases the respondent may take out execution against the appellant or have recourse to the appeal bond.\nSec. 244 provides that:\nThe prothonotary shall examine and compare all bills of costs.\nAnd that:\nBefore any such bill shall be charged against the plaintiff or defendant, it shall be allowed and signed by a Judge.\nSec. 235. Final judgment may be signed by any Judge, and the Judge shall set down the date on the docket. And the prothonotary shall mark on the record the day it was signed, but no marginal note shall be required thereon.\nTo carry out these enactments, it was necessary that judgment in summary and appeal causes should be signed. A docket of such causes was and is required, upon which, no doubt, minutes were made by the Judge or prothonotary. Bills of costs are to be taxed by the Judge after examination by the prothonotary; and other proceedings are to be in writing.\nWe must presume, without proof, that such proceedings in writing exist, and to which the rules of evidence apply. None were produced and nothing shown to dispense with their production. The evidence admitted being wholly irregular when objected to, and the termination of the previous suit being, therefore, not proved, the respondent has failed in an essential part of his case. The appeal must be allowed and the rule nisi for a new trial be made absolute with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nOne of the material allegations of the Plaintiff's declaration was that the original action by the present defendant against him was determined. By the 6th and 10th of his pleas, the defendant specially denied this allegation, which necessarily had to be proved at the trial. The plaintiff did attempt to prove it, but how? By parol evidence. Now, can it be seriously pretended that the judgment of a Court of Justice can be proved by parol evidence? The defendant was examined, but he does not admit that judgment was given in the first case. As far as I can see by the minutes of the evidence, no question was put to him about it. Of course, as said by the learned Judge in the Court below, as soon as a judgment is pronounced in Court, the suit is terminated, and an action, like the present one, may be immediately taken. But when it comes to prove the judgment, it has to be done according to the rule that the best attainable evidence must be adduced to prove every disputed fact. The cases of Arundell v. White[10], and Dyson v. Woods[11], cited by the respondent, only go to decide that the proceedings in Courts of inferior jurisdiction and Courts not of record may be proved by the minute books in which they are entered, or by copies of such books, or, perhaps, by the officer of the Court, or other competent person, if it is proved that no entry of them has been made in any official book. This cannot be applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and, then, no minute book, no writing whatsoever has been produced here, nor has it been proved that none exist. The parol evidence produced, under the circumstances, seems, to me, perfectly illegal.\nThe case of Pierce v. Street[12], also cited by the respondent, is not in point. The question there was the determination of a suit by discontinuance. Here, the respondent alleges, in his declaration, that the first suit was determined by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nI am of opinion that in the judgment of the Court below discharging the rule for a new trial obtained by the defendant, there is error; that the defendant's appeal from the said judgment must be allowed, and that the said rule must be made absolute, the whole with costs against the respondent.\nGWYNNE, J., concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: R.

White (Defendant) Respondent.\n1879: February 7; 1879: May 7.\nPresent: Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAgreement, construction of\u2014Sale of Timber\u2014Consideration\u2014Right to recover back money paid.\nC., after having examined a lot, entered into an agreement with W., the owner, whereby the latter sold all the pine timber standing on the lot to C., \u201csuch as will make good merchantable waney-edged timber, suitable for his purpose, at the rate of $13 per hundred cubic feet,\u201d and C. paid to W. $1,000, \u201cthe balance to be paid for before the timber is removed from the lot.\u201d C. cut $651.17 worth of first-class timber, suitable for the Quebec market, which was all of that class to be found on the lot, and sued W. to recover back the balance of the $1,000, namely $348.83.\nHeld,\u2014That the true construction of the contract was that W. sold and granted to C. permission to enter upon his lot, and cut all the \u201cgood merchantable timber there growing, suitable for his purpose,\u201d and not merely \u201cfirst-class timber;\u201d that there was more than sufficient \u201cgood merchantable timber,\u201d still remaining on the lot to cover the balance of the $1,000, and that there was no evidence to show that the contract had been rescinded.\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J., that the payment of the $1000 was an absolute payment, the plaintiff believing and representing to defendant that there was sufficient timber to cover that amount, if not more, on the faith of which representation defendant entered into the contract, which he otherwise would not have done, and that if the plaintiff made an error he, and not the defendant, must suffer the consequences of this error.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing the judgment of the Court of Com- mon Pleas of the said Province, rendered on the 29th December, 1811[1].\nThis was an action brought by the plaintiff (appellant) to recover from the defendant a portion of certain purchase money for timber paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, the plaintiff alleging that there was a failure of consideration to the amount sought to be recovered back, also that there was a rescission of the contract under which the money was paid, whereby he became entitled to a return of that portion of the purchase money for which he received no value.\nThe action was in the Court of Common Pleas for Ontario, and was begun by writ of summons issued on the 30th day of May, A.D. 1877.\nThe respondent pleaded:\u2014\n1. Payment;\n2. That he never was indebted as alleged;\n3. Set off.\nThe contract reads as follows:\u2014\n\u201cWhitevale, 8th September, 1876.\n\u201cI have this day sold to Hugh Clarke, of Agincourt, all the pine timber standing on south half of lot 33, concession 5, Pickering, such as will make good merchantable waney-edged timber, suitable for his purpose, at the rate of $13 per 100 cubic feet, and have received the sum of $1,000, the balance to be paid for before the timber is removed from the above lot, and I hereby grant the privilege of removing the timber across the land free of all incumbrance.\n\u201cT.P. WHITE.\u201d\nThere was evidence, which will more fully appear in the judgments, that \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d is a definite description of timber, and that \u201cfirst-class timber\u201d is a different quality of timber. Previous to entering upon the agreement the appellant represented to the respondent that there was on the lot some 15,000 to 16,000 feet of timber suitable for his purpose; and it was proved that all the \u201cfirst-class timber\u201d which was to be found on the lot was cut before appellant stopped cutting.\nThe cause was tried on the 24th day of October, 1877, at the Assizes for the County of York, at Toronto, before Hagarty, C.J., of the Court of Common Pleas, without a jury, and a verdict was then entered for the plaintiff for $348.\nIn Michaelmas Term, November 26th, 1877, the defendant obtained a rule nisi to set aside the said verdict, and to enter a non-suit, or for a new trial between the parties, and on the 29th December, 1877, a rule absolute was granted as of Michaelmas Term 41st Victoria, whereby the said rule nisi, obtained by the defendant, was discharged.\nThe defendant appealed from the said judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and on the 16th day of March, A.D. 1878, an order was made by the last mentioned Court whereby the rule nisi obtained by the defendant in the Court below was made absolute to enter a non\u2011suit, and against the last mentioned order or judgment the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nDr. McMichael, Q.C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe case turns principally on the construction of the agreement under which the timber was bought. What is the meaning of the contract by itself? The words in dispute are \u201cgood merchantable waney-edged timber, suitable for his purpose.\u201d Parol evidence is permissible to show the meaning of the words \u201csuitable for his purpose.\u201d The defendant contends that these words mean suitable for the Quebec market. Plaintiff contends that they mean the timber suitable for the contract he had to fulfil at the time. Plaintiff has proved that he took all the timber suitable for his purpose, and specified by his contract, and he has, therefore, a right to recover the balance of the money. The words \u201csuitable, &c.,\u201d imply a power of selection, and they are controlled by the words \u201csuitable for his purpose.\u201d These words mean \u201cgood, merchantable timber of the first-class.\u201d Adding these words does not contradict the previous words. Clarke told White \u201cthat he was taking out the timber for the Quebec market for McLean Stinson, first-class waney-edged timber, and White must have so understood the contract. This evidence has been no doubt overlooked.\nThe agreement itself made the appellant the judge as to what would suit him and what would not, and he was not bound to take any but what suited him, and was entitled to all that would suit him. If, therefore, the agreement, unaided by parol evidence, is to control, the verdict was right and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas should be affirmed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversed. If parol evidence is admissible to explain the meaning of the words \u201csuitable for his purpose,\u201d the parol evidence shows his purpose was to fill his contract with McLean Stinson, in other words, first-class timber such as that contract called for, and as there was upon the evidence, only a little over 5,000 feet of that kind of timber the appellant was entitled to recover back the difference between the $1,000 paid and the value of the quantity of that kind of timber obtained.\nIf we do not go out of the agreement, these words mean \u201cwhat will suit me.\u201d See Towers v. Barrett[2]. As to the question of the rescission of the contract, it is not necessary to discuss it, as the Chief Justice says: \u201cThere was no contract left to rescind.\u201d All the timber that could be found was taken, and all that remained was to seek to recover back the amount mistakenly overpaid,\nHon. Mr. McDougall for Respondent:\u2014\nPlaintiff was lumbering for the Quebec market, and was an export. He went into the defendant\u2019s lot and examined the trees. He (plaintiff) knew the soil. The plaintiff took another expert with him, and these two went through, settling in their own minds how many trees there were suitable for their purpose. They came to the conclusion that there were 150 trees suitable for their purpose\u2014about 16,000 feet. They went to the plaintiff, who says: \u201cI will not let you go into my bush and select my best trees and leave the rest.\u201d Then the agreement was signed. The form of the agreement was printed, and originally contained the words \u201csquare timber,\u201d which mean first class timber. These words were struck out, and the other words \u201cgood, merchantable, &c.,\u201d were interlined. The price was an average price. Brady\u2019s evidence proves this; and his evidence is uncontradicted, except by the plaintiff and Stinson, who go upon what they say the agreement calls for, viz.: first class timber. None of the illustrations used apply to this case. A better illustration would be that of a butcher engaged in sending cattle to a European market. He goes through the herd of a farmer and says: \u201cI think there are 50 there suitable for my purpose. I will give you $10 a piece for them.\u201d He takes only 25 of the best. He must, in this case, be bound by what he considered his purpose.\nAt the trial, the Chief Justice thought there was a rescission of the contract, but there were only complaints on the part of the plaintiff. The defendant ad- mits there were some trees left suitable for his purpose, and there were sufficient trees of the first class to meet the contract. Towers v. Barrett is not applicable. There the subject matter was purchased on condition that it would meet with approval of a third person.\nThe plaintiff must show that the other party had the same understanding of the contract. See Addison on Contracts, p. 973.\nDr. McMichael, Q.C., in reply:\nIn the factum, the defendant does not contend there was sufficient quantity of first class timber left to complete the contract, but that there is a large quantity of merchantable timber left on the land. Oxendale v. Weatherall[3] is the converse of this case.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nAction for money lent by plaintiff to defendant, for money paid by plaintiff for defendant, and at his request, and for money received by defendant for the use of plaintiff.\nPlea\u20141st. Before action defendant satisfied and discharged plaintiff\u2019s claim.\n2nd. Never indebted.\n3rd. Plaintiff indebted to defendant in an amount equal to plaintiff\u2019s claim for goods sold, work done, money lent, money paid, money received, and for interest.\nPlaintiff\u2019s case is that he purchased certain timber from defendant under the following contract: [His Lordship read the contract[4]]. That there was not a sufficient quantity of timber in the land of the description named in the contract at the rate of $13 per 100 cubic feet to amount to $1000, and that he is now entitled to recover back the difference by reason of the failure of consideration. If, as a matter of fact, there was not sufficient timber at the price named to cover the $1000, I think plaintiff would be entitled to recover the difference. I think the consideration in this contract being severable and the price apportionable accordingly, a failure of part of the consideration would give a right to recover a proportion ate part of the price. I think under the terms of this contract the quantity plaintiff was to pay for was to be regulated and determined by measurement; that it was never intended that plaintiff should pay more than $13 per 100 cubic feet. If there was in fact only 5000 cubic feet on the land, to allow defendant to retain the $1000 would be to make plaintiff pay $20 per 100 cubic feet instead of $13, which would be, in my opinion, in direct opposition to the express terms of the contract. In the case of Devaux v. Conolly[5], which was an action brought for money had and received, recover back a sum overpaid as upon a partial failure of consideration, in the course of argument counsel cited the observation of Lord Ellenborough in Cox v. Prentice[6] as follows:\nLet us put the case of parties agreeing to abide by the weighing of any article at any particular scales, and in the weighing an error, not perceived at the time, takes place from some accidental mis-reckoning of some weight, and the thing is reported of more weight than it really is, and the price is paid thereupon, would not, in that case, money had and received be sustainable?\nMaule, J., says:\u2014\nNo doubt about that; it would be like the purchase of a box of eggs at so much per hundred, and after the buyer has paid for them upon the supposition that the box contained 4000, he ascertains there are but 3,500.\nIt is very obvious that both parties were under the impression that there was more timber on the land than $1000 worth, at the price fixed, and no doubt there was considerable discussion between the parties in reference to this, before the contract was finally closed, and it is very possible both parties were, more or less, influenced by this consideration. But, I think, that what took place as to the probable quantity of timber on the lot was merely matter of discussion and expression of opinion, and that both parties honestly thought there was more than $1,000 worth of timber at the price named, of the description in the contract on the land. But, I think, there was no fraudulent representation in respect thereof, nor any representation constituting a warranty; that what took place was not understood or intended to, and did not, form any part of the contract, and though both may have been disappointed in their expectation, that would not alter the terms of the contract; that what the defendant sold and what the plaintiff purchased was all the timber standing on the lot of the description named at a certain rate per 100 cubic feet; nothing more, nothing less; that neither party knowing how much there was, plaintiff paid on account $1000. If there was more timber than $1000 would pay for, plaintiff was to pay the balance, if not enough to amount to $1000, plaintiff, in my opinion, would be entitled to recover back the difference. If there was $1000 worth of timber on the land, plaintiff was bound to take it out, and could not leave any part in the woods, and claim to be repaid any portion of the $1000 paid, because in such a case there was no failure of consideration.\nI do not think there is any evidence of any abandonment or rescission of this contract. I think the evidence shows Mr. White did not stop plaintiff or his men, or put an end to the contract. Plaintiff says:\nWhen Mr. White stopped the men working, I saw him and told him then, that I would see the men, and see that they were more careful. The men went on cutting after that. Mr. White did not interfere with either my men or me after that. The questions, then, which, I think, must determine the rights of the parties are: first, what is the construction of this agreement as to the description of timber? Having settled that, was there a sufficient quantity of the timber so specified in the agreement to amount to $1000?\nAs I read this contract the words \u201cgood merchantable waney-edged timber\u201d designate the description or character of the timber, and the terms \u201csuitable for his purpose,\u201d do not alter such description or character, but indicate that such timber will suit his purpose; that they do not justify any extension of or addition to such description, which appears to have a well understood meaning among those engaged in the lumbering business, still less to justify the insertion of qualifications by eliminating certain words and inserting others in their stead, which would remove the timber from the general class named, and limit and confine it to timber of a special class and of a superior quality; nor do I think there is anything in the parol testimony to vary this construction, but, on the contrary, if on the face of the contract there is any ambiguity which it would be proper to remove by parol evidence, the weight of evidence, I think, shows that this was the intention of the parties.\nAs to the first question, I have carefully examined plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and all he says as to the description or quality of the timber is as follows in his direct examination:\nI made a claim against Mr. White, because I could not get enough of timber suitable for the purpose. * * There was not enough stuff on the lot to answer the agreement. * * * Mr. White found fault that we were cutting very small pieces out of large trees, and I did not want to press him. I think some of the 40 trees his man cut might have answered my purpose. I saw his men cutting a tree myself that I thought would make a piece. * * *\nI am in the habit of buying timber and cutting it for the Quebec market. * * * We only cut fifty trees, that being all that was there suitable for my purpose, I mean that in the whole bush only 50 trees were fit for my purpose. * * * I suppose my men cut down all the trees that were suitable. They were there for that purpose. I saw one tree afterwards that White\u2019s men were cutting that I thought would make a piece.\nTo his Lordship\u2014I have been at the place since, there is no timber there suitable for my purpose.\nI will swear there is not a number of trees suitable for my purpose there still.\nNow, it is most remarkable, if what has been pressed on us is the true construction of this agreement, that the plaintiff himself does not, in his direct examination or re-examination, pretend to say that \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d was not the timber intended, nor that such timber was not suitable for his purpose, nor, more remarkable still, does he say one word in his direct examination as to what his purpose was in getting the timber, but on cross-examination he says:\nI am in the habit of buying timber and cutting it for the Quebec men. I was paying $130 per 1,000, I was getting $175 for the timber delivered at Frenchman\u2019s Bay. I had to haul it from lot No. 5, in Pickering to Frenchman\u2019s Bay, I paid as high as $110 in the same neighbourhood. I paid $135 to Armstrong; that was that season. The average that season was more than $110 or $115. The reason for my being anxious to get as much timber in that neighbourhood as possible, was that if I managed to get a full crib at Frenchman\u2019s Bay, I was to get the same price as at Toronto; but, if I did not succeed in this, I was only to get the same price as delivered at the railway, which was considerably less.\nIn all this it may be inferred he was getting this timber for sale deliverable at Frenchman\u2019s Bay, but, notwithstanding this was drawn from him in his examination in his own case, he does not tell us the description of timber he was to deliver at the bay; still less does he say that \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d was not suitable for that purpose; nor does he, throughout his whole evidence, in his own case venture to say one syllable as to having communicated to defen- dant, previously to or at the time of making the contract, any purpose for which the timber was to be suitable.\nBethune, the employee of plaintiff, says:\nI know what timber would be suitable for Mr. Clarke\u2019s purpose. As far as my knowledge went, we cut all the trees that were there suitable for our business. I was through lately with Mr. Clarke. I saw but one tree there that there might be a short piece taken out of.\nAnd his direct examination likewise ends without a word as to the purpose for which the timber was required, or as to the description of timber that would answer that purpose. But on his cross-examination he says:\nWe were supposed to take out first quality. * * * We were making timber suitable for the Quebec market. * * * I do not think there are trees standing there now out of which timber could be taken suitable for the Quebec market.\nThough he refrains from saying what description of timber is suitable for the Quebec market, he gives this important evidence: \u201cMerchantable, waney-edged timber, and board timber are the same,\u201d and \u201cour instructions from Mr Clarke were to cut good board timber fit for the market.\u201d Conway, the measurer of McLean Stinson\u2019s timber, says he measured what he Stinson had bought from Clarke, and states the quantity. On cross-examination he says:\nBetween merchantable timber and first-class timber there is a wide range. * * * I say the timber, with the exception of three pieces, was first-class timber. * * * I did not examine the lot to see if there were any trees there still suitable for merchantable timber. * * * There were some trees would have made timber, but it would not have been first-class.\nRe-examined\u2014The difference is in length and thickness, and the way it is cut out as well. In merchantable timber you can make it with a few knots, but first-class timber you are supposed to make it free from knots. Clarke\u2019s agreement with us was for first-class timber. The son of the plaintiff says:\nThere is timber there that would make boards. * * * But not timber to my knowledge that would answer that contract.\nBy which, of course, witness means \u201cfirst-class timber.\u201d\nAfter the plaintiff\u2019s case was closed, a motion was made for a non-suit. The learned judge appears to have re-called plaintiff, and the following appears to have taken place:\nHis Lordship to the plaintiff\u2014When you were bargaining with Mr. White, and he signed that agreement, did you explain to him the kind of timber you were to get out for Maclean Stinson?\nA. I did.\nQ. Did you, in explaining to Mr. White, make use of the words suitable for your purpose? Did you explain to him what these words meant?\nA. I told him I was taking out the timber for the Quebec market for Maclean Stinson\u2014first-class waney-edged timber.\nHere for the first time we hear from plaintiff of McLean Stinson, or for the purpose for which he was taking out the timber, and we find in this evidence an attempt not only to extend this written contract by adding thereto, but to entirely alter it by eliminating therefrom certain words and substituting others in their stead, thereby changing the subject matter of the contract from \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d to \u201cfirst-class waney-edged timber.\u201d\nNow we have seen that merchantable waney-edged timber and board timber are the same, and that there is a wide range between merchantable timber and first class timber; and Bethune also says: \u201cOur instructions from Clarke were to cut good board timber fit for the market.\u201d If this were true, plaintiff could not have expected them to cut only first class timber, and defendant entirely denies that by the words \u201csuitable for his purpose\u201d was intended first class timber. He says:\nThe way he explained the words \u201csuitable for his purpose\u201d was, that he would take out all the merchantable timber that was there suitable for the Quebec market. I told him I would not allow him to go in and take all the first class timber and leave the rest. It was thoroughly understood between us that it was to include all the timber,\u2014not only first class, but merchantable as well.\nTo his Lordship\u2014I had never sold any first class; but I heard the people complaining that when they went to cut first class they would cut only a small piece out of a tree and waste a great deal; and I explained this to Mr. Clarke.\nSo that on the fair construction of this agreement, and on the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d will fill the contract, and was the timber intended by both parties. If this is the fair interpretation of the agreement between these parties, then did plaintiff take off all the timber on the lot that would answer this description. I think the evidence shows he did not, but that there was, when he stopped cutting, trees on the lot that would have made good, merchantable, waney-edged timber. Plaintiff\u2019s own case shows this; his son says there is timber there that would make boards; and it is clear that plaintiff\u2019s men, whatever instructions he may have given, only sought to get out first-class timber, and did, with the exception of three pieces, get out all first class timber, and, if they took only first class, it follows, as an almost necessary consequence, there must have been good merchantable timber, that they might and ought to have got to meet the contract.\nBut, if this was left in any doubt in plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant\u2019s evidence clearly shows there was left by plaintiff, as Brady says, \u201cmerchantable waney-edged timber suitable for the Quebec market.\u201d\nThis being the case, I think plaintiff has failed to establish any case that would entitle him to repayment of any portion of the $1000, the preponderating weight of evidence being in favor of defendant that there was sufficient \u201cgood merchantable waney-edged timber\u201d to cover the $1000, and so no failure of consideration.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Court of Ontario.\nThe action was brought by the appellant to recover, under a count for money had and received, a sum of money, being, as is alleged, a balance due to him of the sum of $1,000 paid by him to the respondent for certain trees growing on the lands of the latter, under a special agreement. [His Lordship referred to respondent\u2019s pleas and read the contract[7]] The appellant contends that the words \u201csuitable for his purpose,\u201d following \u201cmerchantable, waney\u2011edged timber,\u201d should be construed to mean the class of timber known as \u201cfirst-class waney-edged timber.\u201d Prom the evidence it appears there is a well-known recognized difference in quality between \u201cmerchantable\u201d and \u201cfirst-class\u201d waney-edged timber, and that the latter class is better and brings a higher price. If, therefore, the appellant wanted \u201cfirst\u2011class\u201d timber, why did he purchase by name, as in the contract, an inferior quality and expect that the words \u201csuitable for his purpose\u201d would raise the character of the timber to first\u2011class. We cannot allow parol evidence to contradict or vary a written contract. These words cannot be so construed, any more than if he contracted to purchase a quantity of a certain quality of flour, say that which is known as \u201cfine,\u201d naming it as it is known in the trade, and by adding \u201csuitable for his purpose\u201d expect the seller to give him a higher and more valuable grade, say superfine, merely because he told him he had a contract to give a quantity of that higher grade to another person. What he purchased he should be obliged to take and pay for, even if it did not suit his other contract. If he wanted quality or grade number one, he should not have bargained for number two, and in this case, when selling \u201cmerchantable,\u201d it was not the business of the seller but of the purchaser to contract in the one case for what would suit in the other. The contract for \u201cmerchantable\u201d cannot be turned into \u201cfirst-class,\u201d for that would be contrary to the written contract. The words \u201csuitable for his purpose\u201d cannot raise the class, but would characterize the description of \u201cmerchantable\u201d timber, if the respondent and appellant had, when the contract was entered into, agreed upon the application of those words so to characterize the particular \u201cmerchantable\u201d timber, the former was to cut and remove. His \u201cpurpose\u201d might have been understood between them to mean limber of certain lengths and sizes in the square, or of certain dimensions otherwise. This, however, was not so understood, nor was there any other understanding, and for that reason, and from what I have before remarked, we cannot give any value to the qualifying words of the contract, and we must read the contract as if they were not in it.\nThis, in my judgment, settles the whole case, for, without doubt, from the evidence, there was sufficient on the property, and more, to have enabled the appellant to have got quantity enough of \u201cmerchantable waney-edged timber\u201d to have repaid him for the advance and payment of the $1,000.\nI feel it unnecessary to refer at length to the legal aspect of the case. The action for money had and received must, in such cases, be regarded as founded on such equitable principles as, I think, should stand in the appellant\u2019s way.\nThe law raises no implied premise in respect of money had and received, when the rights of the receiver of the money have been prejudiced by the mistake, and it would be inequitable to compel him to refund the amount.\n* * *\nThe law raises, also, an implied promise to pay back money that has been received without consideration or upon a consideration that has failed; * * * or on the purchase of a good will or fixtures, shares or chattels when the things contracted for, or some of them, have not been transferred or delivered[8].\nThe action for money had and received is an equitable one, and one stricti juris. It is enough if it appears upon the evidence that the plaintiff ought not in conscience to recover[9].\nThe respondent, unwilling to sell if he had on his land a small quantity of suitable timber, and who, it appears, had not inspected his land and felt incompetent to judge, was, as the uncontradicted evidence shows, induced by the representations of the appellant, who had inspected the land, to enter into the contract which he otherwise would not have done, believing from those representations that there was timber enough at the rate bargained for to make up, at least, the $1,000. If, therefore, the appellant represented even innocently that there was at least the value of the sum mentioned by which he induced the contract, he cannot be permitted to deny the truth of that representation. His claim would, therefore, fail in showing that equitable right to recover the amount sued for which, it is necessary should characterize it.\nThere is no evidence of the rescission of the contract by agreement of the parties, and a Court could only order a rescission where the party applying can put the other in statu quo, which the appellant could not do in this case. There is, therefore, no rescission of the contract, or, in my opinion, a failure of any part of the consideration. I think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed, and the judgment below affirmed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.\nThere certainly was no rescission of the contract between the parties. It is true, that after the plaintiff\u2019s men had commenced to cut the timber, the defendant stopped them, and, not pleased at the way in which they were proceeding, said that he would rather that they would stop than take so little out of the trees. But the plaintiff merely promised that his men would be more careful in the future, and they continued the cutting. The plaintiff himself, in his evidence, admits that his men worked as long as they found suitable timber. And one of his men, named Bethune, examined by him, says that they stopped, because there was no more timber suitable for plaintiff\u2019s purpose. No importance can be attached to the fact that the defendant had cut saw-logs off the land, as they were not included in the contract with the plaintiff; and, then, it is in evidence, that this was done only five or six weeks after the plaintiff had given up cutting, and his men had gone away. In my opinion, there is not a scrap of evidence of rescission of this contract.\nThen, what was the nature of the contract between the parties? The defendant is a farmer. He had timber growing on his land. The plaintiff, a lumberer, and an expert in the business, goes to him and asks to purchase his timber. The defendant says that he does not know if the timber is such as will suit the plaintiff\u2019s purpose. The plaintiff says that he has examined the timber with another man of experience in the business, and that he could guarantee that there was certainly far over $1,000 worth of timber on the land, and offers to pay $1,000 cash before commencing to cut it. The defendant says: \u201cVery well; if you can get that much out, I will sell it to you,\u201d or words to that effect. The bargain is concluded on this, as per agreement, in writing, dated the 8th September, 1876, fyled in the record, and the $1,000 are paid by the plaintiff. The plaintiff now alleges that there was not $1,000 worth of timber on this land; that he, in fact, found and cut only $500 worth of it, and claims from the defendant the other $500. To this, the defendant pleads that he only sold on condition that the sale would bring him at least $1,000; that the plaintiff represented to him that such would be the case, and that the plaintiff cannot now recover from him any part of these $1,000, even if it was the case that there was no timber to that amount on the land.\nI think that the defendant has proved his plea, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, must be confirmed. There is no failure of consideration on the defendant\u2019s part. He would not have sold, if the plaintiff had not told him that there was at least $1,000 worth of timber on the land. If the plaintiff: made an error, he, and not the defendant, must suffer the consequences of this error. Then is it the case that there is not on the land $1,000 worth of timber? That would appear to be so, if first-class timber only is meant. But the agreement between them speaks of \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber;\u201d there is no mention of first-class timber. But the plaintiff says that the timber was to be suitable for his purpose, and that this meant first-class timber, as his contract with Maclean Stinson, for whom he bought this timber, was for first-class timber for the Quebec market. The defendant positively swears that he told the plaintiff that he would not allow him to go in and take all the first-class timber and leave the rest, and that it was thoroughly understood between them that the contract was for all the timber, not only first-class, but merchantable as well. The plaintiff, it is true, swears the contrary. But as the agreement in writing speaks of merchantable, not of first-class timber, and, therefore, corroborates the defendant\u2019s testimony, I feel bound to accept the defendant\u2019s version. There is evidence that between Clarke and Stinson, first-class timber only was bargained for; but between Clarke and the defendant, it is proved to my satisfaction that the contract, as made, included merchantable timber as well as first-class timber; and I do not see it proved satisfactorily that the defendant was made aware of the nature of the contract between the plaintiff and Stinson. In fact, that enough merchantable timber remained on the property to make up the $1,000, I think is conclusively proved by the witness Brady. However, this is not important, according to the view I take of the case. The defendant never guaranteed, nor represented, that there was $1,000 of such timber. I am of opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt is a canon of construction of all contracts that they are to be construed by ascertaining the intention of the parties, to be gathered, in the first instance, from the words of the instrument, but interpreted, if necessary, by the surrounding circumstances[10].\nIn Wood v. Priestner[11], Kelly, C.B, says:\u2014\nThe question in these cases [the construction of contracts] depends not merely on the words, but, when the words are at all ambiguous, requires a consideration of the circumstances to aid the construction.\nOral evidence, in fact, although inadmissible to add to, or to detract from, the plain, unambiguous terms of a contract, is always admissible to show all the circumstances necessary to place the Court, when it construes an instrument, in the position of the parties to it, so as to enable it to judge of the meaning of the instrument[12]. The plaintiff here seeks to recover back a sum of money paid by him to the defendant as part payment upon a contract, upon the alleged ground of failure of consideration. [His Lordship read the contract][13].\nNow, \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber\u201d is a definite description of a well known article, and it appears by the evidence, I think, sufficiently clear that there is a large quantity of such timber still upon the lot; but the plaintiff\u2019s contention is that, under the words \u201csuitable for his purpose,\u201d there is to be added to the above description of the timber sold this further description, namely: That it should be of the first class quality, and such that, as first class timber, would meet the requirements of a particular contract, which the plaintiff says he had, to supply first class timber suitable for the Quebec market. Now, to give such a construction to the words \u201csuitable for the purpose\u201d would be certainly to add a very material term to the previous description of \u201cgood, merchantable, waney-edged timber,\u201d which is a definition perfect in itself, and would be, it seems to me, in plain violation of the canons of construction; and if, by reason of the ambiguity of the term \u201csuitable to his purpose,\u201d we have recourse to the surrounding circumstances to aid the Court in construing the contract, it is apparent no such construction as that which the plaintiff contends for can be given to the contract, without imposing now upon the defendant terms totally at variance with his intention, and upon which he swears he never would have entered into the contract at all, for it appears that the defendant peremptorily refused to permit the plaintiff to go into his woods and to cull the timber, taking only first-class quality, and that he refused to enter into any contract except upon the faith that (as the plaintiff represented) there was from 16,000 to 20,000 feet of timber in defendant\u2019s woods suitable for plaintiffs purpose. The plaintiff having taken out 5,000 feet of first-class quality, declines now to take any more timber, upon the allegation that there is no more of first-class quality, and he brings this action to recover back a portion of the money paid as part payment upon a contract, which he had procured the defendant to enter into upon the faith of the above representation. It does not appear to me that under these circumstances it is necessary to enquire whether such representation was made bon\u00e2 fide or not. It is sufficient to say that it was the foundation upon which the defendant entered into the contract.\nNow, in an action to recover back money already paid, upon the ground of an implied promise to re-pay any part of it, as it appears to me, the circumstances surrounding the contract, and in view of which the money was paid, are to be regarded, in order that we may see whether it would be just to imply the promise from such circumstances. It was contended by the learned counsel for the appellant, that this action lies, unless the plaintiff\u2019s contract amounted to a guarantee to take from 16,000 to 20,000 feet of timber from the lot; but this is not so, for in the one action the question is, was there a warrantry, whereas in this action, although there was no warrantry, the money may have been paid under such circumstances as to raise no implied promise to refund any part. The money may have been accepted upon the faith of assurances which would make it inequitable in the person who paid to recall any part of the amount so paid. That is what is contended for here. The plaintiff desired to get some timber out of defendant\u2019s bush. The latter told him that he could not, for any consideration, let any man enter his bush to strip it of its best timber, taking only the first-class timber, but that plaintiff might inspect the bush, and if he should find there timber that would suit him to a considerable amount, without taking the first-class timber alone, defendant might come to terms with him. Accordingly, the plaintiff himself, a skilled person in such a matter, with another person, also a skilled person, inspected the defendant\u2019s bush, and after satisfying themselves, the plaintiff informs the defendant that he found timber enough there that would suit him to the extent of from 16,000 to 20,000 feet. The defendant replies in substance that this would do, but that he would not enter into a contract unless there was some such quantity; upon the faith of this assurance that there was, and upon the payment of $1,000 on account, the defendant makes the contract. Thereupon the plaintiff enters into the bush, strips it of the timber of the best quality, which the defendant had informed plaintiff he never would consent to, and upon the implied promise of plaintiff that it should not be done had entered into the contract, and the plaintiff now in effect says to the defendant: \u201cI have taken all the timber of the best quality from your bush, there is no more first-class timber there, consequently I shall not take any more timber. True it is, I have stripped your bush of the best quality, taking that only which was first-class, and which you told me you never would consent to. True it is, I induced you to make the contract upon the assurance that there was timber in your bush which would suit me to the extent of from 16,000 to 20,000 feet, and that but for this assurance you would have made no contract with me, and the payment which I made to you of $1,000 was upon account, but I was mistaken when I made to you the assurance which alone induced you to enter into the contract, and from that mistake of mine the law implies a promise upon your part to repay me the difference between the $1,000, which. I paid to you, and the value of the first-class timber of which, contrary to your intention and your express desire, I have stripped your bush.\u201d\nIn my judgment the law implies no such promise, and I cannot see that there has been any failure upon the part of the defendant to give any part of the consideration which he undertook to give, and that, therefore, upon the facts appearing here the plaintiff is not entitled to recover back any part of the $1,000, and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for respondent: Jackes & Galbraith.\nSolicitors for appellant: Spencer, McDougalls & Gordon.\n[1] 28 U.C.C.P. 293.\n[2] 1 T.R. 133.\n[3] 9 B. & C. 386.\n[4] See p. 310.\n[5] 8 C.B. 640.\n[6] 3 M. & S. 344.\n[7] See p. 310.\n[8] Addison on Contracts, pp. 1062, 1065.\n[9] See judgment of Lord Mansfield in Bird v.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Administratrix with Will annexed, purchase of fee simple estate by, when personal assets of testator sufficient to pay off incumbrance\u2014Subsequent parol agreement to sell part of said Land null\u2014Compensation Money for land, right to and how to be treated\u2014Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, (4th Series) c. 36, sec. 40.\nAbout 1837 Andrew McMinn devised his lands to his wife, Mary McMinn, for life, with remainder to Maria Kearney. Letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to the widow. At the time of testator's death, the lands were mortgaged for \u00a3150. A suit to foreclose this mortgage was instituted after the testator's death, and it was alleged that under it a foreclosure was obtained, and the property sold, and purchased by the administratrix for \u00a3905, There was evidence that the administratrix received personal assets of the testator sufficient to have paid off the mortgage, had she chosen so to apply them. The sum of \u00a3725 was lent to the administratrix by Ann Kean, her daughter by a former marriage. The administratrix then sold the property to the public authorities for \u00a31,750, out of which she paid her daughter \u00a3400. From 1858 the daughter, with the leave of the administratrix, occupied about 1\/4 of an acre of the land, until, in 1873, under the authority of an expropriation Act, she was ejected from it, the Commissioner taking in all 3 acres 3\/10ths. of this property, the balance being in the occupation of Maria Kearney and her husband, Francis Kearney (the appellants). These 3 acres 3\/10ths. were appraised at $2,310, and that sum was paid into Court to abide a decision as to the legal or equitable rights at the parties respectively. Ann Kean claimed a title to the whole of the land taken, under an alleged parol agreement with her mother, that she should have the land in satisfaction of \u00a3325, the residue unpaid of the loan of the \u00a3725, and obtained a rule nisi for the payment to her of the sum of $2,310, the amount awarded as compensation for the land. In May, 1872, the administratrix executed an informal instrument under seal, purporting to be a lease of her life estate to the appellants in the whole property, reserving a rental of $80 a year and liberty to occupy two rooms in a dwelling house then occupied by her. On a motion to make this rule absolute, several affidavits were filed, including those of the appellants. On the 18th January, 1875, the matter was referred to a master, to take evidence and report thereon, subject to such report being modified by the Court or a Judge. The master reported that the appellants had the sole legal and equitable rights in the property. On motion to confirm that report, the Court made an order apportioning the $2,310 between Ann Kean and the appellants, the former being declared entitled to be paid $1,015.61, and the latter, on filing the written consent of Mrs. McMinn, the residue of the $2,310.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, 1st. That the administratrix, having personal assets of the testator sufficient to discharge the mortgage, was bound in the due course of her administration to discharge said incumbrance, and that the parol agreement made by her with her daughter was null and void.\n2. That when land is taken under authority of legislative provisions similar to Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, (4th Series) c. 36, sec. 40, et seq. the compensation money, as regards the capacity of married women to deal with it, is still to be regarded in equity as land.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a rule nisi to confirm a masters' report. Under the authority of c. 36 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, some 3 acres 3\/10ths. land were expropriated for the Nova Scotia hospital for the insane, and the compensation money for the same being claimed by Mrs. Kean and by Mr. and Mrs. Kearney, was deposited in the Supreme Court to abide a decision as to the legal or equitable rights of the parties respectively.\nOn the 18th January, 1875, the matter was referred to H. C. D. Twining, Esq., a master to take evidence and report thereon, subject to such report being modified by the Court or a Judge. The master reported that Mr. and Mrs. Kearney had the sole, legal and equitable interest in the property. On motion to confirm that report the Court made the following order:\u2014\n\"The order nisi to confirm the masters' report in this cause having been referred to the Supreme Court for argument and decision by a Judge of this Court, and the said order having been argued accordingly by counsel for all parties, and judgment having been given thereon on the 26th day of March, 1877, but no rule having been applied for till the day of this date: It is now ordered that each party bear his or their own costs of argument and attendance before the master, and the master's fees be paid out of the funds in Court to the credit of the cause. That the sum of $1,015.61, with the bank interest thereon, be paid to Mrs. Kean over her own receipt, and the balance of the $2,310 in Court, with the bank interest on such balance, be paid, on their joint receipt, to Mr. and Mrs. Kearney as soon as they, Mr. and Mrs. Kearney, shall have filed in Court the written consent of Mrs. McMinn to such payment. Dated the 2nd day of March, A. D. 1878.\"\nFrom this order Mr. and Mrs. Kearney appealed to the Supreme Court. The material facts of the case sufficiently appear in the head note and judgments. The case was inscribed for hearing ex parte.\nMr. Wallace for appellants:\nThere was no specific agreement for the sale of any certain quantity of land between Mrs. McMinn and Mrs. Kean. The numerous versions, all materially differing, given by Mrs. Kean of a pretended parol agreement, destroys its certainty and specific character, and for that reason was not such an agreement as the law requires[1]. The appellants contend, also, that they were entitled to the property under the will of Andrew McMinn, and Mrs. McMinn would, under the relation of administratrix with the will annexed, there being sufficient personal effects left by McMinn to discharge all his debts including the mortgage, and under the other circumstances of the purchase, be a trustee for her daughter Maria Kearney[2]. The occupation of house and small piece of land, with the consent of Mrs. McMinn, did not give her any other rights than those of a tenant at will or at sufferance, liable to be ejected at any moment. It is not because Mrs. Kean subsequently instituted proceedings in the Equity Court against Mrs. McMinn and the appellants for a specific performance of an alleged verbal agreement, that there was ever a resulting trust in her favor for these 3 3\/10th. acres of land\u2014such a position is utterly untenable[3].\nAnother reason why the appellants are entitled to the amount deposited as representing this property is that Mrs. McMinn, rather than be subjected to proceedings to have her declared a trustee for Mrs. Kearney, signed an agreement by which she conveyed the balance of the McMinn property to Mrs. Kearney, and afterwards made the lease of her life interest to the appellants. The property mentioned in that agreement and lease included the whole 3 3\/10th. acres and the small house then occupied by Mrs. Kean, together with other property. Mrs. McMinn refused to perform this agreement, and a suit was instituted in the Equity Court to compel performance, to which no defence was put in, and a judgment was obtained in accordance with the bill. Under these circumstances appellants submit the master was fully justified in making the report he did, even if Mrs. Kean had proved a specific agreement for a specific piece of property undisputed and undenied, which she did not do.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe facts of this case, so far as they are material to the present appeal, may be stated as follows: Andrew McMinn, being seized in fee of the lands in question, which formed part of a larger property at Dartmouth in Nova Scotia, made his will, whereby he devised these lands to his wife, Mary McMinn, for life, with remainder in fee to the child or children of his marriage with Mary McMinn. Of this marriage there was only one child, one of the present appellants, Maria Kearney. The respondent, Ann Kean, is a daughter of Mrs. McMinn by a former marriage. The testator appointed two persons as his executors, but they renounced, and letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to the widow. The testator, as nearly as I can ascertain, died about 1837.\" At the time of his death the property was mortgaged to a Miss Tremain, to secure \u00a3150. A suit to foreclose this mortgage was instituted after the testator's death, and it is alleged that a foreclosure was obtained, and that under it the property was sold and purchased by Mrs. McMinn for \u00a3905. There is great obscurity as to the true nature of this sale\u2014the case, and the factum which the appellant has filed, alike leave us in the dark respecting it. The decree is not printed, and does not, indeed, appear to have been, put in evidence in the Court below, although it was material to the case of the appellants in one aspect, and to that of the respondents in another. I gather, however, from the statements in the affidavits, that there was either a sale under a decree of the Court, at which Mrs. McMinn became a purchaser, or that the mortgage was paid off and an assignment taken; not that there was first a final foreclosure, making the mortgaged land the absolute property of the mortgagee, and then a sale by the latter. The price which Mrs. McMinn says she paid was \u00a3905. The mortgage appears, from the certificate of the Registrar of Deeds, to have been, as stated, for the sum of \u00a3150, and to have been dated the 8th June, 1836.\nIt is, therefore, almost impossible to suppose that there could have been a redemption and transfer if the amount paid was, as alleged, \u00a3905, since the principal, interest and costs could not have amounted, at the time of the sale, to any thing like that sum; but a document has been put in by the respondent, Mrs. Kean, which, although not properly admissible in evidence originally, has been received without objection and treated as good evidence for her, and may, therefore, be used against her. This is a fragment of an account current, or bill of costs, furnished by Mr. Uniacke, Mrs. McMinn's former solicitor, to his client, which contains the two following entries under date 16th October, 1841:\u2014\"Costs of defence A. P. Tremain's foreclosure \u00a316 2s. 6d.; cash paid for assignment of A. P. Tremain's mortgage \u00a3379 17s. 8d.\" A. P. Tremain is a misprint for H. P. Tremain, who appears by the Registrar's certificate, already referred to, to have been the mortgagee. Against this we have, however, the oath of the respondent to the statement, not disputed by the appellants, that the property was sold under the decree for \u00a3905, and bought in by Mrs. McMinn. Had Mrs. McMinn's title deed even been produced, it might have thrown some light on this fact. But as it is, we must, I think, assume that the whole land subject to the mortgage was sold for a larger price than was required to pay off the mortgagee, and purchased by Mrs. McMinn. It is in proof that Mrs. McMinn, as the personal representative of the mortgagor, received personal assets of the testator amply sufficient to have paid off the mortgage had she chosen so to apply them.\nThe sum of \u00a3725 was, it is said, lent by the respondent, Mrs. Kean, to her mother, to make up the \u00a3905; and this, I think, is sufficiently proved to have been the fact.\nThe next circumstance to be mentioned is the sale by Mrs. McMinn to the public authorities, for the purposes of a hospital for the insane, of a considerable portion of the property, for the price of \u00a31750, out of which Mrs. McMinn paid Mrs. Kean \u00a3400 in part payment of the loan of \u00a3725, and applied the balance to her own use. I may mention here, that the appellant, Maria Kearney, has not adopted this sale, but, on the contrary, she repudiates it, and declares her intention of calling its validity in question when her interest becomes an estate in possession on her mother's death.\nThen, in 1858, Mrs. Kean, who had lived for a number of years with her mother, Mrs. McMinn, on this property, removed to a small house on the land, on which she laid out some money for repairs, and around which she enclosed about a quarter of an acre, and there she continued to live until the land was taken possession of, and she was ejected from it by the Commissioner of Public Works, under the authority of an expropriation act, for the purposes of the hospital for the insane. The land so expropriated consisted of 3 acres 3\/10ths, including that of which Mrs. Kean was, as stated, in occupation.\nDuring the time Mrs. Kean was in possession, the fence she erected was pulled down by Kearney, and an action of ejectment was also brought by the Kearneys against her; this action, however, was never brought to trial. Mrs. Kean claims a title to the whole of the land taken, under an alleged parol agreement with her mother, Mrs. McMinn, that she should have the land in satisfaction of \u00a3325, the residue unpaid of the loan of the \u00a3725 made by Mrs. Kean to her mother. It does not appear that Mrs. Kean was ever in possession of more than the quarter of an acre enclosed within her fence, Kearney being in possession of the remainder. The Kearneys having institued a suit in the Probate Court to compel Mrs. McMinn to account for the personal estate of her husband, in order to obtain a settlement of the suit, Mrs. McMinn, on the 24th February, 1871, entered into an agreement to convey to Mrs. Kearney for life, and to her children in fee simple, all the Dartmouth property, subject to a prior life estate which she reserved to herself. This agreement was signed and sealed by Mrs. McMinn only, and was not executed by Mrs. Kearney. On the 1st May, 1872, Mrs. McMinn executed an informal instrument under seal, purporting to be a lease of her life estate in the whole property to Mr. and Mrs. Kearney, in consideration of a rental reserved of $80 a year. In June, 1872, Mrs. Kean brought a suit for specific performance of the alleged parol agreement with her mother, already mentioned, against the Kearneys and Mrs. McMinn, but, an answer having been filed, no further proceedings were taken. The appellants also instituted an action for the specific performance of the agreement of the 24th February, 1871, in which the plaintiffs obtained judgment by default, ordering a reference to a master, who is said to have made a report, though the purport of the reference, and the finding of the report, are neither of them stated. The Act of the Provincial Legislature under which the expropriation took place is not specifically referred to in the case or factum, but I assume that it was under the 40th and following sections of cap. 36 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4th series). The Commissioner of Public Works requiring, as before stated, a further portion of the land in question, amounting to 3 and 3\/10th acres, for the purposes of the hospital for the insane, proceeded, under the Statute, to procure the nomination of arbitrators, who, on the 10th September, 1873, made their award, allowing $4,000. This included the compensation for the land taken, together with an allowance for fencing, and making a new road. This amount was subsequently paid into Court according to the Statute. Subsequently the sum of $1,690, being the amount paid in beyond the value of the land, which was not claimed by Mrs. Kean, was paid out to Kearney, leaving the balance $2,310 in Court.\nMrs. Kean, on the 16th December, 1874, obtained a rule nisi for the payment to her of the sum of $2,310, the amount awarded as compensation for the land. On a motion to make this rule absolute, several affidavits were filed, including those of Mrs. Kean, Mr. Johnston, her solicitor, Mr. and Mrs. Kearney, and Mr. Wallace, their solicitor, and two affidavits of Mrs. McMinn, directly contradicting each other, were also filed, one by each party. The Court made a rule referring the matter to Henry D. Twining, Esq., one of the Masters of the Court, with power to call the several parties and their witnesses before him, and to examine them under oath on the subject matter of the cause, and in addition to such affidavits, and to enquire into the respective legal and equitable rights of the several parties to the lands recently vested in the Commissioner of Public Works and Mines under the Revised Statutes, cap. 36, and to the proceeds thereof remaining in Court, and to report thereon at an early day, and that such report should be moved on before a Judge, who might confirm or modify the same, and pass a final order for the appropriation and distribution of such proceeds and the interest- thereon. Under this reference the Master heard evidence, and made his report, dated the 20th January, 1876, finding that Mrs. Kearney had the legal and equitable right to the lands, and was, therefore, entitled to be paid out of Court the sum of $2,310, the compensation awarded for the lands. A motion was made before a Judge to confirm this report, who directed that the case should be argued before the full Court, which was afterwards done, when the Court made an order apportioning the $2,310 between Mrs. Kean and the Kearneys, the former being declared entitled to be paid $1,015.61, and the latter, on filing the written consent of Mrs. McMinn, the residue of the $2,310.\nFrom that order Mr. and Mrs. Kearney have appealed to this Court.\nThe first question which presents itself for decision is that relating to Mrs. Kean's rights against the Kearneys and Mrs. McMinn.\nMrs. Kean has no conveyance conferring on her any legal title to any portion of land, nor does she pretend to have any written evidence of an equitable title. If, therefore, she has an interest, it must necessarily be by virtue of an equitable title depending on a parol agreement, partly performed, for the sale to her of the land she claimed. The insufficiency of the proof of the parol agreement set up by the respondent is the first objection which the appellants make to the order of the Court below, and there can, in my opinion, be no doubt but that the proof is quite insufficient. It consists wholly of the evidence of Ann Kean herself, for Mrs. McMinn's short and unsatisfactory affidavit is neutralised by her subsequent affidavit of December, 1874, directly contradicting her former one. Her evidence, therefore, is entitled to no consideration. Mrs. Kean's evidence is confirmed in one single remote point by Mr. Uniacke's account, but it is only as to the fact of the loan having been made by her to her mother, and not in respect of the agreement relating to the land. Then the evidence of Mrs. Kean itself is full of discrepancies and self contradictions, and, moreover, is too uncertain as to the terms of the agreement to warrant any Court in acting upon it, even if it had been the testimony of a disinterested third person.\nFurther, Mrs. Kean is contradicted, as to the quantity of land she was to have, by her own solicitor, Mr. Johnston. Thus, in paragraph 9 of her affidavit of 9th December, 1874, Mrs. Kean says:\nThe said Mary McMinn offered, in lieu of the said balance, to give a small house that was on the property, together with upwards of three acres of land adjoining, which she, at the time, pointed out to me.\nBut Mr. Johnston, in his viv\u00e2 voce examination before the Master, says:\nAbout three years ago Mrs. McMinn wished me to draw a deed or settlement for the property. Out of this property she wished to leave Mrs. Kean an acre for her life. The deed was not executed. I cannot now remember that Mrs. McMinn ever mentioned to me any specific quantity of land that she had promised to give to Mrs; Kean on any other occasion.\nIt also appears, that though a vague indefinite intention of giving some land either by deed or will to Mrs. Kean was announced by Mrs. McMinn, yet there was not any positive agreement to do so, nor was any exact quantity of land ever specified. This conclusion is warranted by passages in Mrs. Kean's own viv\u00e2 voce testimony. Thus she says:\nMy mother promised to give me the land from the first time I sold my house and wharf and gave her the money. I was to have any part of the place that I wanted, instead of the \u00a3325 she owed me. I was to have it either by deed or will. She told me her word was her bond, and what more did I want.\nThis implies a sort of honorary engagement on the part of the mother, rather than a definite concluded contract, and is, moreover, inconsistent with Mrs. Kean's own statement, that the agreement was made when she demanded from her mother payment of the balance. Mr. Johnston also further states in his evidence:\nAt the time of the settlement, Mrs. Kean wished some arrangement made with her mother, Mrs. McMinn, about this money, and wished to get a part of the Dartmouth property to re-imburse her. Mrs. McMinn, who appeared very jealous about parting with any of the property, put her off by saying that the property was all there and was for them, or words to that effect.\nThis evidence, besides being inconsistent with Mrs. Kean's statement that her mother had agreed to give her a specific piece of land at the time of the loan, also shows that there was no contract, but a sort of family arrangement to be carried out at Mrs. McMinn's election, by will or conveyance inter vivos, and which was to be dependent on the mother's good will. Then the possession was only of a piece of land of about a quarter of an acre, and was therefore inconsistent with the terms of the alleged agreement, which Mrs. Kean swears was for 3 acres.\nSpecific performance of a parol agreement for the conveyance or sale of land on the ground of part performance will never be decreed, unless a specific contract is clearly proved. In the present case such proof wholly fails. So far from a concluded agreement made at any fixed date, Mrs. Kean's evidence, in one of the passages cited, indicates that there was none, but that she was dependent on her mother's choosing to make a deed or will of the property. The conclusion must be, that this was one of those vague family arrangements in which possession of land is taken in reliance on a promise of bounty by a parent or relative, and not a contract entered into for valuable consideration[4] of which specific performance could be claimed. This result alone is fatal to the case of the respondent; but even if she had succeeded in proving a parol agreement partly performed for the whole 3 acres, it would not have sufficed to have entitled her to more than the value of Mrs. McMinn's life estate in that portion of the land. As I shall show hereafter, Mrs. McMinn was, subject to her own life estate, a trustee of the land for Mrs. Kearney, and Mrs. Kean would, of course, be bound by the same trust, unless she could show herself to be a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice; but to entitle herself to this protection, she must show a conveyance executed. This she never pretends to have acquired; she can, therefore, stand in no better position than her mother, but is bound by the same equities as regards Mrs. Kearney. The order of the Court below, so far as it directs the payment of any portion of the money to Mrs. Kean, must consequently, for the reasons given, be reversed. Mrs. Kean's claim being thus disposed of, the question next arises as to the rights of the appellants Mr. and Mrs. Kearney against Mrs. McMinn.\nMrs. McMinn was, without doubt, a trustee for her daughter, Mrs. Kearney, in respect of the fee simple. There are two characters in either of which she may have paid off the incumbrance or bought in the estate; she was tenant for life and also administratrix with the will annexed, who had received personal assets sufficient to discharge the mortgage, and, paying off the mortgage in either of these qualities she would become a trustee. If she had been tenant for life only, complicated equities as to contribution would arise which we are not called upon to consider or discuss, since the evidence is ample to show that Mrs. McMinn had received personal assets sufficient to satisfy the mortgage, and the payment must, therefore, be presumed to have been an act done in a due course of administration, the mortgage being primarily payable out of the testator's personal assets, and Mrs. Kearney having a clear equity to have the estate so exonerated. That the transaction must substantially be regarded merely as the discharge of an encumbrance, whatever may have been its form, is clear when we consider that it must have either been a formal transfer of the mortgage, as is indicated by Mr. Uniacke's account already referred to, or, if in form a purchase of the estate under a decree of foreclosure for \u00a3905, still in substance a mere discharge of the incumbrance, since any surplus of the sale \"monies beyond the mortgage debt, interest and costs would belong to the estate of the testator. Apart, however, from this, an administratrix, allowing an equity of redemption to be foreclosed, while she had, or ought to have had, assets in her hands applicable to the payment of the mortgage, and afterwards becoming the purchaser of the estate herself from the mortgagee, upon the plainest principles of equity, would be regarded as a trustee for the persons entitled to the real estate, and the legal result of the transaction would be precisely the same as if she had paid off the mortgage and taken a transfer of it.\nIf, therefore, there had been no dealing with Mrs. McMinn's life estate, the proper disposition of the money would have been to have apportioned it between Mrs. McMinn and Mrs. Kearney according to the value of their respective estates. An instrument, purporting to be a lease, was, however, made on the 1st May, 1872, by Mrs. McMinn, by which she assumed to convey her life estate to Mr. and Mrs. Kearney, in consideration of a rental of $80 a year. This lease, not being in any way impeached, and being sufficient in equity, at least, to pass the estate, it follows that Francis Kearney, the husband, is entitled to receive the income of the money in Court during Mrs. McMinn's life, and that the corpus of the fund would, except in so far as it may be affected by the agreement of 24th February, 1871, which I will presently further refer to, belong to Mrs. Kearney, as being, in the contemplation of equity, still real estate, though in the converted form of money. In one event, Mrs. McMinn might be entitled to some substantial indemnity out of the fund, although she has parted with all her interest in the land. Under the instrument of the 1st of May, she is entitled to a rent of $80 a year. Now, the 3 3\/10th acres having been taken by title paramount, the Kearneys would be strictly entitled to an apportionment of the rent in respect of the eviction, and in that case Mrs. McMinn ought to receive an indemnity out of the fund for the deduction from the original rent. The Kearneys will, however, probably be prepared to waive any claim to an apportionment, which they must do by filing a written consent to that effect. If they are willing to do this, I think the Court need not send it back to the master to have so minute a calculation made, as would be involved in ascertaining what indemnity Mrs. McMinn would be entitled to, in respect of the deterioration of her security for her rent in consequence of the 3 th acres ceasing to be subject to it. If we give no costs against her, setting the costs against this indemity, we shall probably amply compensate her.\nThere remains still to be considered what rights (if any) Mrs. Kearney's children have under the informal instrument of the 24th February, 1871, made on the compromise of the suit in the Probate Court. Mrs. Kearney had, as already shown, a clear right to the remainder in fee, paramount altogether to any title derived under that agreement. She did not sign the agreement and has done nothing under it sufficient to bind her to make a settlement of her estate upon her children pursuant to its terms, unless her joinder with her husband as a co-plaintiff in the suit, brought for the specific performance of this article, should be sufficient for that purpose. As the institution of a suit in the joint names of husband and wife is considered as the act of the husband alone, the suit and the judgment were insufficient to affect her rights as between herself and her children, and she is, therefore, free to insist that, as a married woman, her estate in this land can be bound by nothing short of a deed executed and acknowledged pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, (4th series) cap. 27, and no such deed is in existence. I am, therefore, of opinion that the finding of the Master was right, and the judgment of the Court below ought to be reversed.\nI have before said that the fund is still to be considered land. The rule is clear, that when land is taken under the authority of legislative provisions similar to Revised Statutes, cap. 36, secs. 40, et seq., the compensation money, as regards the capacity of married women to deal with it, is still to be regarded in equity as land.\nThis has in many cases been determined to be so with regard to lands taken under the English Land Clauses Consolidation Act. If the person entitled is sui juris, of course he can elect to take the fund as money, but a married woman can only deal with it as land. The consequence is that this money ought to remain in Court and be invested so as to produce an income which will be payable to Francis Kearney during the life of Mrs. McMinn, and at the termination of Mrs. McMinn's life estate, Mrs. Kearney, or her heirs, will be entitled to the corpus, unless Mrs. Kearney, her husband consenting, thinks fit, on being examined before a Judge apart from her husband, to authorize the payment out of Court of the money.\nIt will be sufficient for us to reverse the order complained of and remit the cause to the Court below with the foregoing declarations. The appellants should have their costs against Mrs. Kean. GWYNNE, J.:\nI am unable to see any evidence in this case which would have justified the master, to whom the matter was referred, in reporting that the respondent Kean had any estate, legal or equitable, in the lands in question, which would entitle her to receive any portion of the purchase monies paid into Court, representing the fee simple estate therein; nor can I see that the evidence calls for any qualification in the terms of the report which he has made, whereby he finds that the appellant Maria Kearney had the legal and equitable right to these lands, and that she is entitled to receive the $2,310, proceeds thereof remaining in Court, together with any interest that may have accrued, unless it be that the evidence warranted his ordering: \"Subject to the value of the life interest of Mrs. McMinn in the use of the two rooms reserved by her for her life under the lease of the 1st May, 1872.\"\nThe claim of the respondent Kean is based upon an assumption of a fact of which there is not a tittle of legal evidence, namely, that Mrs. McMinn became seized in fee simple, in virtue of a purchase made by her, and of a deed executed in her favor by the mortgagee of a mortgage executed by the late Andrew McMinn in his life time, securing \u00a3150, and which mortgage was, as is suggested, foreclosed by the mortgagee after the decease of the mortgagor, whereby the fee simple estate became vested absolutely in such mortgagee discharged of the mortgage. Now, in the evidence before us, there is neither the alleged mortgage, nor the decree of foreclosure, nor any deed, after the foreclosure, executed in favor of Mrs. McMinn, produced or shewn to have existed.\nBy the will of Andrew McMinn, a copy of which was produced, we find that he devised all his personal property remaining after the payment of his just debts, and subject to such payment, to his widow, Mrs. McMinn, to whom he devised the lands in question and 550 acres of other land for her natural life, with remainder to the appellant Maria Kearney in fee. The appellant in her affidavit states that, as she is informed and believes, there was, at the time of her father the testator's death, a small mortgage to the amount of \u00a3150 upon the premises, but that there was personal estate left by him more than sufficient to pay that amount, and that there were no other debts due by him and that letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to appellant's mother, the testator's widow, and that, instead of her paying the mortgage out of the personal effects, the said mortgage was foreclosed, and the whole property sold under a decree of the Court of Chancery, and bought in by appellant's mother, while appellant was an infant of about four years of age. This is the sole apparent foundation for the suggestion that Mrs. McMinn ever acquired a fee simple estate in the land in question. The appellant, who was an infant when these proceedings are alleged to have taken place, may have been informed that there was a decree of the Court of Chancery authorizing the alleged sale, but we cannot admit this statement in the appellant's affidavit (brought forward for the purpose of showing how defective would be any title set up by Mrs. McMinn obtained under such circumstances,) as evidence of the title. We should be slow to believe that a Court of Equity sanctioned such a destruction of an infant's estate. To support a title, resting upon a decree of the Court of Chancery for its validity, we must see the decree, if there be one, and, if none be produced, we must presume that there is none, for, assuming that there was a sum of \u00a3150 due upon a mortgage of the land in question at the time of the testator's death, we know that the amount so due should have been paid out of the testator's personal estate, of which his widow was legatee, subject to the payment of the debts, and also, as is sworn and not denied, administratrix with the will annexed, as well as devisee for life of the mortgaged premises, with remainder in her infant child in fee.\nNow, there is evidence that there was considerable personal estate left by the testator, and if the legatee of personal estate subject to the payment of debts, who was also administratrix with the will annexed of the personal estate, and who was devisee for life of the mortgaged premises, the remainder in fee in which was devised to her own infant child, received and enjoyed the personalty without paying the mortgage debt, she could never be permitted to acquire by any deed the fee simple estate in the mortgaged premises to the prejudice of the devisee in remainder. I confess I think we should be slow to believe that a Court of Equity sanctioned any such proceeding. It is but reasonable that we should call for very precise evidence, and that we should scrutinize with a jealous eye all the' proceedings by which such a result is claimed to have been attained.\nIn the absence, however, of any evidence of any such decree, and of all legal evidence shewing the estate devised to the appellant by her father to be defeated, we must hold the estate so devised to her to be still existing. Then, we find it established that on the 24th February, 1871, the respondent, Mrs. McMinn, in settlement of a suit instituted by the appellant against her as administratrix with the will annexed of the personal estate of the testator, calling her to account for her dealings with that estate, and to avoid, as is sworn and not denied, an examination respecting her conduct as such administratrix, executed a deed under her hand and seal in relation to this very land, in which it is assumed that she had acquired the fee simple estate, in the words following:\u2014\nIn consideration of the proceedings in the Probate Court against me, and of the devise of Andrew McMinn, to Maria Kearney, in his will, I agree to convey, on or before the 1st day of April next, all the real estate now owned by me, or in my possession at Dartmouth or near the asylum, to the said Maria Kearney for her life, then to go to her children in fee simple, subject to a life interest in myself in said real estate, which life interest in me I especially reserve to myself. A good deed of all my present estate therein subject to the said condition to be given, so as to carry out the above object and intention.\nThis instrument, so executed, seems to evince a desire to atone for an admitted wrong, which it is probable the suit instituted against the administratrix would have redressed, and the different disposition purported by the deed to be made of the estate which the testator had devised to the appellant cannot affect the appellant's right to rest in preference upon her title under the will, if, at least, the deed agreed to be executed, whereby the appellant would have only an estate for life with remainder to her children in fee, has not been executed. The object of the deed of February, 1871, seems to have been to remove all pretended claim of Mrs. McMinn to a fee simple estate in the land. Then, we find further that on the 1st May, 1872, Mrs. McMinn, in consideration of $80 per year, payable quarterly, doth demise and lease to the appellant and her husband all that farm known as the McMinn property, adjoining to the north the asylum property at or near Dartmouth, in the County of Halifax, for and during the life of the said Mary McMinn, to have and to hold the said farm to the said lessees for and during the life of the said Mary McMinn; and by that lease the appellant and her husband covenanted to pay to the said Mary McMinn yearly, during her life, $80 per year by quarterly payments; and also agreed to permit the said Mary McMinn to occupy two rooms in the dwelling house now occupied by her on the said farm. If this were a bill filed by the respondent Mrs. Kean, claiming specific performance of the verbal agreement now alleged by her to have been made by Mrs. McMinn, it is clear that no decree could be made in her favor upon the evidence here given, as against the appellant's estate in remainder, nor, if this was a bill merely claiming a right to charge Mrs. McMinn's life estate, would the evidence given warrant any decree to the prejudice of the lease of that life estate to the appellant by the deed of May, 1872, which, the appellant swears, was executed before ever the respondent Mrs. Kean asserted against Mrs. McMinn the claim which she does now assert. The contradictory statements at different times made by Mrs. Kean, who is Mrs. McMinn's daughter, as to the transaction which she alleges took place between them, and the affidavit of Mrs. McMinn made in February, 1873, denying altogether the loan which is now set up, and the apparent absence of any necessity for a loan for the purpose for which it is alleged to have been made, and the absence of all evidence in writing of the transaction as now set up, all concur in investing the alleged transaction with well founded doubt as to its reality, and as to the bona fides of the parties to it, whatever may have been its nature.\nIf the mortgagee of the small mortgage for \u00a3150 had actually obtained an absolute title in fee simple to the mortgaged premises by foreclosure, he might, no doubt, afterwards have sold the fee so obtained for \u00a3905 to whomsoever he pleased, but to obtain that title by foreclosure, there must have been a decree in Equity, and before that decree could have been obtained, the administratrix, who was also devisee of the mortgaged premises for life, would have been compelled to apply the personal estate of the mortgagor in payment of the mortgage as far as it would go. There seems to have been abundance of personal estate to satisfy the mortgage, but assuming the administratrix, who was also legatee of the personal estate, to have squandered that estate, Equity would have compelled her to replace the amount, and in that case her necessity for borrowing would have been limited to the amount of the mortgage. But there is no reason to believe that the mortgagee ever did obtain title by foreclosure; indeed the account which was produced from the papers of Mr Uniacke, if admissible in evidence, would seem to show that Mrs. McMinn obtained an assignment of the mortgage to herself, if, as seems likely, the item there charged under date of October 16, 1841, relates to this mortgage: \"Cash paid for assignment of A. P. Tremaine's mortgage \u00a3379 17s. 8d.\"\nNow, if this be the mortgage in question, then it is plain that the suggestion of her having borrowed \u00a3905 to purchase the fee from the mortgagee after foreclosure, or even by a sale under a decree of the Court, is altogether a myth; but whether it be the mortgage in question or not, there is no evidence that Mrs. McMinn ever by payment of \u00a3905, or of any other sum, or in any way, obtained, either through the intervention of a Court of Equity, or otherwise, any title to the mortgaged premises other than that derived from the mortgagor's will; and that a Court of Equity could have been a party to a transaction purporting to sell to her this property in fee simple for \u00a3905, or for any other sum, is what I must decline to believe in the absence of proof.\nThat something may have been done by Mrs. McMinn out of Court in a suit for the foreclosure of the mortgage, by which she may have tried to defeat the remainder, which was vested in her infant child, I can believe, for the deed of 1871 was apparently executed to atone for some such attempt, but that the attempt was ineffectual, I entertain no doubt, and that a Court of Equity took any part in such a proceeding, I must decline to believe. The evidence is wholly defective to establish such a position, and whatever may have been the dealings between Mrs. McMinn and her daughter, Mrs. Kean, who derived benefit under the same will as that which constitutes the appellant's title, and who, therefore, must have known in what her title consisted, the evidence is, to my mind, wholly insufficient to affect the life lease to the appellant of May, 1872, which, upon the evidence before us, cannot be said to have been obtained otherwise than bon\u00e2 fide, without any notice of any prior or preferable claim, lien or charge of the respondent Mrs. Kean upon that estate.\nAs against the appellant's claim, therefore, to the monies paid into Court, nothing is shown, unless it be, as I have said, the value, whatever that may be, of Mrs. McMinn's life interest in the benefit reserved to her by the lease of May, 1872, and all this litigation having taken place at the instance of, and in the interest of, Mrs. Kean, whose claim fails, she should pay all the costs, as well in the Court below as of this appeal, and it should be referred back to the Court below, with a direction that it be referred to the master to set a value upon such life interest of Mrs. McMinn, with directions to pay that amount, when ascertained, to Mrs. McMinn, and the balance to the appellant, Maria Kearney.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1879: January 23; 1879: May 9.\nPresent: Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAccretion\u2014Public Right of Way\u2014Implied Extinction by Statute\u2014Cobourg Harbour Works\u201422 Vic., c. 72.\nBy 10 Geo. iv., c. 11, the Cobourg Harbour Company were authorized to construct a harbour at Cobourg, and also to build and erect all such needful moles, piers, wharves, buildings and erections whatsoever, as should be useful and proper for the protection of the harbour, and to alter and amend, repair and enlarge the same as might be found expedient.\nThe Harbour Company commenced their work in 1820 by running a wharf, southerly from the road allowance between lots 16 and 17 of the township of Hamilton, which now forms Division Street in the town of Cobourg. By means of the mud and earth raised by dredging and gradual accretions, which were prevented from being washed away by being confined by crib work, the original wharf was widened to the full width of Division Street, and in addition they constructed a store house and placed a fence dividing it from the land which appellant (whose lot fronted on Division Street and extended to the waters\u2019 edge,) had gained by accretion since the addition to the original wharf was made.\nThereupon the appellant filed a bill complaining that his access to this alluvial land was obstructed by the store house and fence which the respondents caused to be placed on the addition to the wharf and praying that the respondents, other than the Attorney General, be decreed to remove them.\nHeld,\u20141. That land gained lay alluvial deposits arising from natural or artificial causes, or from causes in part natural and in part artificial, so long as the fact is proved that the accretion was gradual and imperceptible, accrues to the owner of the adjacent land.\n2. That the storehouse and fence complained of in this case were not constructed on any part of Division Street, but on an artificial structure constructed under the authority of a statute on the line of Division Street for harbour purposes, and, therefore, appellant was not entitled to be indemnified because he is denied access to his alluvial land through the premises of the respondents.\n3. That the public right of way from the end of Division Street to the waters of Lake Ontario, was extinguished by statute by necessary implication.\nCorporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[1] followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a decree of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, and ordering that the Bill of Complaint filed by the Appellants, other than Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General for the Province of Ontario, be dismissed with costs.\nThe Bill in this cause was filed on the 10th of day March, 1876, by the appellant Standly, against the respondents Perry, Graveley, Dumble, McCallum, Boulton and Sutherland, (who were Commissioners of the Cobourg Harbour Trust) and Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General, complaining of the erection by the defendants, other than the [Page 359]\nAttorney General, of a store-house in the street called Division Street in the town of Cobourg, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s access to and from his property to the highway was hindered, and praying that the defendants, other than the Attorney General, might be decreed to remove the building. The bill was taken pro confesso against the Attorney (General, who was only a formal party.\nThe other defendants answered the bill, setting forth in substance that they were commissioners of the Cobourg Harbour Trust; that under various statutes respecting the Harbour at Cobourg, they were authorized to erect and did erect the store-house referred to; that the land on which the store-house was erected was not a part of any public highway, but was part of the property vested, under the statutes in question, in them, for the purpose of the harbour.\nThe cause was heard at the sittings of the Court of Chancery, at Cobourg, before the Hon. V.C. Proudfoot, on the 9th and 10th of May, 1876.\nThe facts of the case sufficiently appear in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Strong.\nThe Vice-Chancellor determined, 1st. that the land formed in front of Division Street, and the plaintiff\u2019s land was so formed by accretion; that the effect in law was to prolong Division Street and to add to the plaintiff\u2019s land the land formed between the former boundary of the plaintiff\u2019s lot and the water\u2019s edge. 2nd. That the defendants could not under any of the statutes referred to, justify the erection of the storehouse in front of the plaintiff\u2019s lot, and he therefore pronounced a decree for the removal of the building[2].\nFrom this decree the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario. That Court reversed the decree of the Vice-Chancellor upon both the points referred to[3].\nThe present appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The appellants Covert and Hargraft are trustees of the lands belonging to Standly, and were made parties in pursuance of a direction in the decree.\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe land claimed by appellant was formed partly by gradual accretion and partly by artificial accretion. The fact that the accretion to the lands in question was accelerated by the cribs and piers of the harbour, cannot deprive the appellants, the riparian proprietors, of their right to the new land so formed by accretion. This very point was expressly decided in doe dem McDonald v. The Cobourg Harbour Company[4]; Throop v. Cobourg and Peterboro\u2019 Railway Company[5]. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the U.S. Supreme Court have also arrived at the same conclusion on this point. See Doe dem. Seebkristo et al. v. East India Co.[6]; and Livingston v. The County of St. Clair[7]. This accretion had also, the effect of prolonging Division Street, as may be seen by referring to the plan. The Commissioners had no right, by the erection of cribs or otherwise to exclude the public from pursuing the public highway to the waters\u2019 edge, the original boundary of Division Street.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Is not the case of Corporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[8] in point?]\nThere it was a right of way by custom that was taken away; in this particular case the only thing which has been legalized is the wharf, and this was not physically inconsistent with the prolongation of Division Street. We contend the statute did not give the respondents the right of closing up streets, or take away from the public the right of going to the waters\u2019 edge over their highway. All the Judges in the Court below have agreed that according to the law of Ontario, the prolongation of Division Street by means of this accretion belonged to the public as part of Division Street. The Act incorporating the Harbour Company did not authorize them to take any land belonging to the Crown. When the Crown is not expressly named in an Act, the Crown property cannot be affected by it. The rights and powers of the respondents are defined in the Acts passed relating to the Cobourg harbour, and no authority was given to them to close up streets or to use or obstruct without purchase any original road allowance. The public continued to have the right of reaching the water over any embankment the Company or Commissioners may have constructed, and if this prolongation remained a highway, the appellants\u2019 right of access to it cannot be denied. The following authorities support this contention: Marshall v. Ulleswater Co.[9]; Eastern Counties Ry. Co. v. Dorling[10]. It is contended on the part of the respondents that subsequent legislation has legalized the acts of the Commissioners. Admitting that it has legalized the erection of the wharf, it cannot extend to the store house complained of, as it was not built when the last Act was passed. The Acts belong to that class of Acts which are to be construed restrictively, and not so as to confer on them the right of closing up a public highway when such a right has not been given by express language. Magee v. The London and Port Stanley Ry. Co.[11]; Galloway v. The Mayor of London[12].\nMr. Boyd, Q.C., and Mr. Sidney Smith, Q.C., for respondents:\nThe appellant contends that the statute authorizing the construction of a harbour at Cobourg could not affect Crown property. Now it is clear that all the works authorized necessarily interfered with the rights of the Crown, as the works were to be built on Crown property. See Rex v. Smith[13], Atty, Gen. v. Richards[14]. The real question to be decided is, whether the extension was made as an extension of Division Street qua street, or as part of the Harbor Works, authorized by statute? The land in question never formed part of the town of Cobourg, and this has been recognized by the municipality of Cobourg itself: see 22 Vic. c. 72. The evidence also proves this land or \u201cesplanade\u201d to be artificially formed land, over which the Harbour Commission has always exercised its control, independent of the town jurisdiction.\nAs to the fence, there was a necessity of putting it up in consequence of the sudden fall of 3 feet to get to the adjoining land. It is built on the crib works which the respondents had the right to put there in order to protect their wharf. This raising took place in 1852, and there was then that difference between the two properties. Can it be contended that the appellant would have had then lateral access to this wharf? and if not, can the fact of this gradual accretion give him more right now than he had in 1852?\nThen also, it cannot be denied that the rights of the Harbour Commission to the locus in quo have been recognized by subsequent legislation. And if it is admitted that the wharf has been recognized by legislation, surely the word \u201cappurtenances,\u201d which is to be found in sec. 2, of 13 and 14 Vic. c. 83, is quite sufficient to include \u201cland\u201d such as that in question in this suit. 36 Vic. c. 15, Ont., was passed after this esplanade was built and is an express recognition that it was one of the \u201cappurtenances\u201d of the Harbour.\nUpon such a state of facts it is contrary to law to hold, as was done in the first instance, that the artificially formed land in front of Division Street was itself street. This could only be, at most, if the extension of the street was formed by process of accretion.\nIn any case the works complained of were authorized by statute, and if they interfered with the right of the public reaching the water, to that extent this right, by necessary implication, was limited by statute.\nThe case cited by the Chief Justice, Corporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[15], is an authority on this point and coincides with the view taken by V.C. Blake in the Court below,\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply:\nMy contention is that they had no right to take this land to the prejudice of the public. The appellant must take his stand as one of the public, and submits respondents had no right to close the highway against the public.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by STRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff is the owner of land in the town of Cobourg. The defendants are the Commissioners of the Cobourg Town Trust, sued as individuals and not in a corporate capacity, and the Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario. The bill alleges that the defendants, other than the Attorney-General, have created a public nuisance by placing a fence and store-house on the highway, which causes peculiar damage to the plaintiff, by obstructing the access to his land.\nThe defendants set up that the fence and store-house are not placed upon the highway, but upon a pier, or wharf, forming part of the works of Cobourg Harbor.\nAt the time Division street, which is the highway in question, was originally laid out, the site of the storehouse complained of was a long distance lakewards from the water\u2019s edge, the land on which it is built being made land, which has been brought into existence by means of works constructed for the purposes of the harbor. The plaintiff\u2019s land has been created by gradual accretions, which have been caused more or less by the harbor works.\nThe plaintiffs title to the land, in respect of which he sues, cannot be disputed; and it is equally clear, that if the site of the store-house forms part of the highway, or the defendants\u2019 works have been unauthorized by statute, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which he asks; as, in either case, he would be entitled to sue for the special damage caused to him by a public nuisance interfering with the means of access to his land.\nFour distinct points have been raised for our decision. First, it is said, that the place on which the store-house stands is a public highway, forming part of Division street. Secondly, that even though the locus in quo be part of the highway, yet the store-house is an illegal interference with the rights of the public, inasmuch as the statute authorizing the construction of the harbor, gave no authority to the Harbor Company to erect works in front of public highways or streets. Thirdly, it is urged, that even though the harbor and works may be perfectly legal, the public have a right of way over the pier or wharf in question. Lastly, it is said that the defendants have no authority under their statutes to erect a store-house as part of their harbor works.\nThe discussion of these questions involves an examination of the several statutes relating to the harbor.\nBy the Act of 1829[16], the Cobourg Harbor Company were incorporated, and were authorized to construct a harbor at Cobourg, which should be accessible to, and fit, safe and commodious for the reception of such description and burthen of vessels as commonly navigate the lake, and also to erect and hold all such needful moles, piers, wharves, buildings and erections whatsoever as shall be useful and proper for the protection of the said harbor, and for the accommodation and convenience of vessels entering, lying, loading and unloading within the same, and to alter and amend, repair and enlarge, the same as may be found expedient and necessary.\nSection 3 provided for the determination by arbitration of the amount of damages to be paid to land owners whose lands might be taken for the purposes of the harbor, or of the roads, streets and approaches thereto.\nSection 4 gave powers to take toll on goods and merchandise shipped or landed from or upon any part of the lake shore between the east boundary of lot No. 13 and the west boundary of lot No. 19 in the township of Hamilton, and upon all vessels and boats entering the harbor.\nBy the Act of 1832[17], after reciting the progress made in the construction of the harbor, of which the wharf or pier in question formed part, a loan of \u00a33,000 by the province to the Harbor Company was authorized to be expended in finishing the harbor. In 1835, another Act[18] was passed, authorizing a further loan of \u00a31,000; and in 1839, the time for the completion of the harbor was further extended by 2nd Vic., cap. 42.\nIn 1837, a Board of Police was established for the town of Cobourg[19], and power was given to the board to lay out streets, subject to a proviso that no new street which might interfere with the powers conferred on the Harbor Company, should be established.\nThe Act of 1850[20] recited that the harbor had never been completed; that the harbor had been conveyed by the company to the Board of Works in security for such moneys as the Provincial Government had expended, and should expend on the harbor; that \u00a310,500, or thereabouts, had been expended; that it was desirable that the harbour should be made as safe, commodious and convenient as possible, and that the town council was interested in improving and keeping improved the harbor for the purposes of the trade of the town, and attracting thither vessels navigating the lake. The Act then dissolved the corporation of the Harbor Company, and vested in the municipal corporation of Cobourg the harbor and all land attached thereto, and the moles, piers, wharves, buildings, erections and appurtenances, and all other things erected, or being, or belonging to, or used with, or in the harbor, and theretofore vested in the company, and all other moles, piers, wharves, buildings and erections. By the same Act the town council were authorized to make additions and improvements in and to the harbor, and to borrow money for the purpose of completing and improving it, and of erecting additional wharves, moles and piers, and of making such other additions and improvements as the town council should resolve on and approve.\nIn 1859 there was a further statutory transfer[21] of the harbor, wharves, piers and appurtenances (together with other properties belonging to the town of Cobourg) to the Commissioners of the Cobourg Town Trust.\nLastly: By an Act of the Legislature of Ontario, passed in 1873[22], the Commissioners of the Cobourg Town Trust were authorized to issue debentures, not to exceed $100,000, charged upon the trust property, for the purpose of raising funds to deepen, enlarge, repair and improve the harbor.\nThe Harbor Company commenced their work in 1830 by running a wharf, which is shown on the plan, southerly from the line or road allowance between lots 16 and 17 of the township of Hamilton, which now forms Division street in the town of Cobourg. This wharf was constructed upon sunken cribs, the most northerly crib being Laid partially on the land. The wharf did not run in the line of the street but inclined to the west. This wharf is known as Cobourg wharf. Further to the west another wharf, also running in a southerly direction, and of similar construction, was built, thus partially enclosing the waters of the lake so as to form the basin which constituted the harbor. In 1850, after the transfer to the town council, a contract was entered into by the town with Cotton & Rowe for dredging the harbor, and in carrying out this work the contractors deposited the mud and earth, taken from the basin formed by the two piers or wharves already mentioned, on the east side of the easterly pier. To retain these deposits, and to prevent their being washed away, to the injury of the harbor, they were subsequently confined by crib work. This crib work was laid down between 1853 and 1856. After the creation of the Cobourg Town Trust in 1859 further dredging was done, the mud raised by which was also deposited to the east of the wharf and further crib work was laid down. By means of these deposits and additions, the original wharf was widened to the full width of Division street, not however to the full extent in length of the original wharf, but so as to project into the lake far beyond the shore line of the plaintiff\u2019s land adjoining, as shown on the plan. This plan also shows the line of the lake shore at the time the original harbor works were constructed, and at a later date, when, by accretion, that line had been advanced to what is called on the plan \u201cShore line on Perry\u2019s Plan,\u201d and it also shows the present shore line. The greater part of the fence and structure complained of are situate to the north of the present shore line. So much of the plaintiff\u2019s land as lies between Perry\u2019s shore line and the water\u2019s edge, in respect of which it is the plaintiff sues, has been gained by accretion since the addition to the original wharf was made. The addition is clearly delineated on the plan and distingushed from the original wharf.\nThe plaintiff complains that his access to this alluvial land is obstructed by the store-house and fence which the defendants have caused to be placed on the addition to the wharf. The deposits and crib work were, it is suggested, to some extent the cause of the accretion by which the plaintiff has acquired additional land, but whether this was so or not, it is beyond question that the accretion took place by imperceptible degrees. The addition to the wharf appears to have had several objects; the crib work was made in the first instance with a view to keep the deposits in their place, and to prevent their drifting away to the injury of the harbor; then a superstructure was added to widen the wharf and to enable, a line of railway to be laid down upon it for shipping purposes, which was afterwards done. The law applicable to the facts thus stated appears to be extremely plain. The plaintiff makes out his title to the land in respect of which he says he is damnified, for it can make no difference whether this land was gained by alluvial deposits arising from natural or artificial causes, or from causes in part natural and in part artificial, so long as the fact is proved that the accretion was gradual and imperceptible. The case of Doe dem. Seebkristo et al. v. East India Co.[23] is authority for this. Then the fact cannot be disputed that the fence and store house do obstruct the access from the plaintiff\u2019s land to the wharf.\nThe plaintiff, therefore, makes out a case entitling him to relief if he shows either that the addition to the wharf upon which the store-house and fence complained of are placed form part of a public highway, or that the addition to the wharf was an illegal and unauthorized work. One or the other of these propositions he must establish to entitle himself to relief. I may here point out that the bill makes no case for relief on the ground of dedication to the public of a right of way on the original wharf and the addition, and that point does not appear to have been made in any of the courts below, nor was it raised in argument at this bar, and if it had been, in the present state of the pleadings, it would have been clearly inadmissible. Then, how did the land which forms the site of the store-house and fence become part of the public highway? We may grant that if this land had been formed by accretion instead of having been artificially made by the defendants\u2019 predecessors, it would have constituted part of Division Street. This may be more readily assumed here where the soil and freehold of the highway, like all public road allowances and streets under the municipal system established by law in Ontario, are vested either in the Crown or in the municipality, for the use of the public, than would be the case if the public had only a right of way in the nature of an easement, the title to the soil being in private owners, as is generally the case in England.\nAssuming this to be the legal effect of an addition to a street by accretion, it does not in the least degree assist the plaintiff, since the undisputed facts do not warrant the application of such a rule of law, for the addition to the wharf was artificially constructed on what was, at the time, part of the bed of Lake Ontario. It is consequently out of the question to contend that the storehouse complained of is placed in a public highway.\nNext, it is pretended that the addition to the wharf was not authorized by the statutes giving powers to construct the harbor. Nothing can be more extensive than the terms of the original act. It empowers the company to build and erect all such needful moles, piers, wharves, buildings and erections whatsoever as should be useful and proper for the protection of the harbor, and to alter and amend, repair and enlarge the same as might be found expedient.\nThe evidence shows that this addition was made originally for the protection of the harbor, and that afterwards a superstructure was placed upon it for the purpose of enlarging in width the original wharf, thus bringing the work within the exact terms of the statute. It is then argued that the act did not confer power to erect the harbor works, so as to intercept the passage from the end of a public highway to the waters of the lake. The answer to this is to be found in the original statute which authorises the selection of any site at Cobourg, without any exception of streets, for works which are to be the private property of the company. The statute of 1837 establishing the Board of Police, which contains a provision that streets to be laid out are not to interfere with the works of the Harbor Company, has also an important bearing on this part of the case.\nFurther, the legislature has, by a series of enactments already referred to, coming down to as late a period as 1873, recognized the legality of the harbor works in a manner which entirely excludes the possibility of holding them to be ultra vires. A case, decided in England since the judgment of the Court below was delivered, has, however, been brought to our notice by the Chief Justice, which constitutes a conclusive answer to this objection. I refer to the case of The Corporation of Yarmouth v. Simmons[24], where the precise point I am now referring to arose, and where it was held that statutory powers to erect a pier, authorized the projection of such a pier on the line of a public highway, and that the public acquired no right on the erection of the pier, to pass over it, to reach the water; in that case, the sea. It was also there contended that a public right of way could not be taken away without express words, but this contention was distinctly denied by the Court. It was also said, that the right to get from the end of the street to the water was a right appertaining to the Crown, and could not for that reason be taken away without express words. The same point is adverted to by the learned Vice-Chancellor in his judgment in the present case. Mr. Justice Fry, however, denies that the prim\u00e2 facie right of the public to have access to the water was a right vested in any way in the Crown. This also is exactly applicable here, for, although the soil in the original road allowance was vested under the Provincial statutes in the Crown, yet, if the harbor works originally constructed were in the water, and south of the termination of the street, no right of the Crown can be said to have been interfered with, and a mere right of way in the public and the title of the Crown to land are, as is pointed out by Mr. Justice Fry, entirely different. The case just quoted is, therefore, an authority refuting nearly all the arguments by which the plaintiff attempts to support his case. It shows that there is nothing in the objection that the Harbor Company and their successors had no right to construct works in the lake opposite the line of a street. It also affords a conclusive answer to the claim that the public had a right of way from the street to the water over the harbor works, assuming them to be legal, and it shows that no rights of the Crown are interfered with.\nThe cases cited in the appellant\u2019s factum of The Eastern Counties Railway Co. v. Dorling[25], and Marshall v. Ulleswater Co.[26], are plainly distinguishable by the fact, that the barge and pier in those cases respectively were illegal, and unauthorized obstructions to the prim\u00e2 facie right of way to which the public were entitled to enable them to obtain access to the water; here, on the contrary, we think that the obstructions interposed are authorized by statute.\nThe last ground on which the plaintiff rests his case is, that granting the addition to the wharf and all the other works to be intra vires, the store-house was unauthorized.\nIf the pier or additional wharf is a legal construction and there is no public right of way over it, conclusions which have already been arrived at, the plaintiff can have no locus standi to maintain any objection to a storehouse being erected on the pier which he has no right to come upon, merely on the ground that it is ultra vires of the company. The Attorney General may always file an information to restrain a corporation from doing or continuing an act which is beyond the powers conferred upon it by law, but a private individual has no right to complain, unless the act which is ultra vires occasions him some special legal injury.\nAnother conclusive answer to this last objection is that the act of 1829 gave the company authority to erect such buildings as should be useful and proper for the accommodation of vessels entering, lying, loading and unloading in the harbor. The evidence shows that this store-house is not only a useful and proper, but a necessary adjunct to the harbor works, and, indeed, the fact is so apparent that, even without evidence, we should be justified in so holding. The plaintiff, therefore, fails in this, as in the other arguments by which he has attempted to support his appeal.\nBefore concluding, I think I ought to notice an objection to the constitution of this record, which, though not raised in the answers of the defendants, nor made in argument, appears to me a serious one. By the act of 1859 the commissioners of the Cobourg Town Trust are legally incorporated. It is true that the words \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201cincorporated\u201d are not used, but the legal effect of the first section clearly is to constitute the individuals named a corporation. The corporation ought therefore to have been at least a party to the cause and in my judgment the sole party.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W.I.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nElection appeal, notice of setting down forhearing\u2014Power of Judge who tried the petition to grant an extension of time for giving such notice\u2014Supreme Court Act, sec. 48\u2014Rules 56, 69.\nOn a motion to quash the appeal on behalf of the respondent, on the ground that the appellant had not, within three days after the Registrar of the Court had set down the matter of the petition for hearing, given notice in writing to the respondent, or his attorney or agent, of such setting down, nor applied to and obtained from the Judge who tried the petition further time for giving such notice, as required by the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act,\nHeld,\u2014That this provision in the statute was imperative; that the giving of such notice was a condition precedent to the exercise of any jurisdiction by the Supreme Court to hear the appeal; that the appellant having failed to comply with the statute, the Court could not grant relief under rules 56 or 69; and that, therefore, the appeal could not be then heard, but must be struck off the lists of appeals, with costs of the motion.\nSubsequent to this judgment, the appellant applied to the Judge who tried the petition, to extend the time for giving the notice, whereupon the said Judge granted the application and made an order, \"extending the time for giving the prescribed notice till the 10th day of December then next.\" The case was again set down by the Registrar for hearing by the Supreme Court at the February Session following, being the nearest convenient time, and notice of such setting down was duly given within the time mentioned in the order. The respondent thereupon moved to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal or failed to bring the same on for hearing at the next session, and that the Judge who tried the petition had no power to extend the time for giving such notice after the three days from the first setting down of the case for hearing by the Registrar of this Court.\nHeld,\u2014That the power of the Judge who tried the petition to make an order extending the time for giving such notice is a general and exclusive power to be exercised according to sound discretion, and the Judge having made such an order in this case, the appeal came properly before the Court for hearing. (Taschereau, J., dissenting.)\nThis was a motion by the respondent to quash the election appeal in the matter of the Controverted Election of the appellant as member duly elected of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of the North Riding of the County of Ontario.\nJudgment, allowing the petition of the respondent and personally disqualifying the appellant, was rendered by Mr. Justice Armour, on the 6th February, 1879, and the sum of $100 was, within eight days after the said judgment, paid into the Court, and also ten dollars, the prescribed fee for making up and transmitting the record.\nThe record was transmitted to the Registrar of the Supreme Court on the 11th June, 1879. On the 24th September, 1879, application was made on behalf of the appellant to the Chief Justice, under rule 55 (S. C. R.), to dispense with printing part of the record. It appearing, when this application was made, that the fee for entering the appeal had not been paid to the Registrar under rule 56 and schedule therein referred to, the Chief Justice refused to entertain the application until such fee should be paid, and the appeal duly entered. Thereupon the agent for the appellant's solicitor paid the fee, and the Chief Justice made the order as asked. On the same day the case was set down for hearing by the Registrar of the Court for the October session.\nOn the 20th October, 1879, the agent of the appellant's solicitor made another application to further limit the printing, and to limit the appeal to the personal charges, which was granted by a Judge in Chambers on payment of $5 costs to the respondent.\nOn the 28th October, 1879, although no application had been made to the Judge who tried the petition for further time to give notice, the appellant gave notice to the respondent that the appeal had been set down for hearing.\nThe respondent thereupon moved to quash the appeal upon the following, among other grounds:\u2014\n\"And for that the appellant did not cause his said appeal to be set down for hearing before this honorable Court, and a notice thereof to be given to the respondent pursuant to the statute and rules in that behalf, and did not obtain an enlargement of the time to give such notice.\n\"And for that, the said appellant caused the said appeal to be set down for hearing before the now ensuing session of this honorable Court without giving any notice thereof to the respondent.\"\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for respondent:\u2014\nThe notice served on the 28th October is not in accordance with the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act and rule 51 of the Supreme Court Rules. The provision in the statute that a notice in writing shall be given to the parties affected by the appeal is imperative, and the omission to give such notice is an objection to the jurisdiction of this Court, and cannot be waived. Moreover, the orders taken out since the appeal has been set down, were steps taken by the appellant, and respondent was bound to attend the applications made on the part of the appellant. An appeal in election matters is given by this 48th section of the Act, and as the notice that the appeal has been set down is a condition precedent, this Court has no jurisdiction, nor any power to relieve against failure to give it. See Maxwell on Statutes[1], and cases there cited.\nMr. McTavish for appellant:\u2014\nThe objection regarding the failure to give notice of the time of hearing within three days is only a formal one under rule 69 of the Supreme Court Rules; no proceeding in this Court can be defeated by any formal objection. A great deal of delay occurred in the Court of Queen's Bench in having the record prepared and forwarded to Ottawa, and it was impossible to find out when the proper time had arrived to give notice, as appellant did not know on what day the Registrar would set down the appeal for hearing. Since the delay to give notice within the time required by the statute had expired, the respondent, through his attorney, waived this objection by appearing on two applications made in Chambers by appellant for limiting the appeal, and on one of which appellant was condemned to pay $5 costs, which appellant paid, and respondent accepted. The appellant has been allowed to proceed with the printing of the record and fyling of his factum, and it is too late now to object that a proper notice has not been given.\nIt was on account of the orders issuing that the notice was not given. The objection is a formal one and under the 69th rule, the Court has power to allow the appeal to go on. Both parties agreed that the case was to be argued this session. Everything has been done except the giving of the notice. Under rule 70 of the Supreme Court Rules, this Court can extend the time. The constituency, if the appeal is quashed, may be unrepresented for two Parliaments, and the appellant be personally disqualified in the meantime. The objection should have been taken the first day of this session.\nThe court will see by the affidavit that both parties, knowing the difficulty with which the appellant had nothing to do, understood and agreed that the appeal would be argued on the merits in the October sessions.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis was an application to dismiss the appeal for want of the notice required to be given by the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, which regulates appeals in controverted election cases, and which enacts that thereafter \"any party to an election petition under the said Act, who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried such petition on any question of law or of fact, and desires to appeal against the same, may, within eight days from the day on which the Judge has given his decision, deposit with the clerk, or other proper officer of the court (of which the Judge is a member) for receiving moneys paid into such court at the place where the petition was tried, if in the Province of Quebec, and at the chief office of the court in any other province, the sum of $100 as security for costs, and a further sum of $10 as a fee for making up and transmitting the record; and thereupon the clerk, or other proper officer of the court, shall make up and transmit the record in the case to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, who shall set down the matter of the said petition for hearing by the said court at the nearest convenient time, and according to any rules made in that behalf under this Act; and the party so appealing shall thereupon, within three days, or such further time as the Judge who tried the petition may allow, give to the other parties to the said petition affected by the said appeal, or the respective attorneys or agents by whom such parties were represented at the trial of the petition, notice in writing that the matter of the petition has been so set down for hearing in appeal as aforesaid,\u2014in and by which notice the said party so appealing may, if he desires, limit the subject of the said appeal to any special and defined question or questions; and the appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by the Supreme Court, which shall pronounce such judgment upon questions of law or of fact, or both, as in the opinion of the said court ought to have been given by the Judge whose decision is appealed from.\"\nThis cause was, at the instance of the appellant, duly set down for hearing on the 24th day of September, 1879, for this present sitting of the court. No notice in writing was given to the respondent, the other party to the said petition affected by the said appeal, or the attorney or agent by whom such party was represented at the trial of the petition, within the three days, as provided by the Act, nor was any further time allowed by the Judge who tried the petition, nor has any reason been given, or excuse offered, for not giving the notice, nor has any consent or agreement to waive or dispense with such notice been shown, so that the case rests on the bald question of a non-compliance with a provision requiring notice in writing to be given.\nThe jurisdiction this Court exercises over cases such as this is purely statutory, and no discretion is given by the statute to dispense with its requirements, nor is any authority given to the Court, or the Judges, to enlarge the time for giving this notice; the power or discretion to do this has been specially delegated to the Judge who tried the petition, and no general power has been conferred on this Court to deal with the matter. The obvious intention of the Legislature was that the party interested in the appeal should have speedy notice, and that the appeal should be promptly heard. The appellant cannot ignore the provisions of the statute, nor can this Court dispense with the requirements of the law, and deprive a party to the petition, affected by the appeal, of any privileges or advantages the statute has given him.\nThis notice is the first and only intimation the respondent has of the appeal\u2014the previous steps by the appellant are ex parte; until this notice is given, as respects the respondent, as was said by Erle, C. J., in Scott v. Durant[2], \"there has been no completed appeal,\" and it is only when so completed that \"the appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined\" by this Court. The words of Wilde, C. J., in Norton v. The Town Clerk of Salisbury[3], in reference to an appeal against the decision of a barrister appointed to review a list of voters under the 6 and 7 Vic., c. 18, sec. 62, are very applicable to this case. He says: \"In dealing with this Act of Parliament, which has for the first time delegated to a court of law a duty of much interest to the community, it behoves us to confine ourselves as strictly as may be within the path the Legislature has marked out for us;\" and at the conclusion, he says; \"It appears, therefore, to me that the the condition upon which alone the power of the Court to entertain the appeal rests not having been observed, we are bound to decline to hear it.\"\nRule 69 has been invoked on behalf of the appellant, which is that \"no proceeding in the said Court shall be defeated by any formal objection;\" but this cannot avail him. This is not a formal objection, nor can the rule apply if it was, because the Judges of this Court can only make rules extending \"to any matter of procedure or otherwise not provided for by the Act, but for which it may be found necessary to provide, in order to insure the proper working of the Act and the better attainment of the objects thereof, and all such rules, not being inconsistent with the express provisions of the Act, shall have force and effect as if therein enacted.\"\nIt does seem hard, in a case such as this, that by any inadvertency, oversight, or neglect, the appellant should be shut out from his appeal; and were it in my power, I should gladly afford him an opportunity of having his case heard and determined in this Court. But the fault rests neither with the law, which is expressed in plain unambiguous language, nor with this Court, which must expound the law as it is written, regardless of consequences. Jus dicere et non jus dare is our province, or, as Alderson, B., says in Miller v. Salomens[4], \"My duty is plain. It is to expound and not to make the law; to decide on it as I find it, not as I may wish it to be.\"\nAs, then, the express requirements of the statute have not been duly complied with, I am of opinion, that this appeal cannot be entertained, and it must be struck out of the list of appeals.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion as the Chief Justice. The provision of the 48th section of the Supreme Court Act, requiring notice to be given within three days after the appeal has been set down for hearing, is imperative and not merely directory. The Interpretation Act requires us to place that construction on the words: \"shall thereupon within three days thereafter * * * give notice.\"\nThe notice is, therefore, a condition precedent to the exercise of any jurisdiction by this Court, and the authorities quoted by his lordship shew decisively, that it is a well established rule of construction that the performance of a preliminary act, upon which jurisdiction depends, can neither be dispensed with nor waived. The case of Peacock v. Reg.[5] is a direct authority for this position.\nAnother rule applied to statutory requirements similar to that in question here is, that the Court cannot relieve a party against an omission to take a particular step in procedure within a limited time, when the public or any class of persons other than the parties to the proceedings are interested. In my judgment the condition of giving three days notice, in this section, is not imposed for the benefit of the respondent alone, but the public have also an interest in its strict performance.\nFurther, it appears to me that the respondent did nothing which could be considered an act of waiver. The appearance of the respondent's solicitor on the application to the Chief Justice with reference to printing the case, was on the same day the appeal was inscribed for hearing, and, therefore, too early to have any such effect. The attendance on the motion before Mr. Justice Fournier could not have any such consequence, inasmuch as the respondent assented to nothing, but merely appeared and asked for his costs.\nLastly, I am of opinion, that even if the Court were not excluded from enlarging the time for service by the two rules of statutory construction I have before stated, it could not interpose, for the reason that the statute, by giving power to enlarge the time to the Judge who tried the petition, must be construed as precluding this Court from making an order of the same kind. The appeal should be struck out of the list of appeals with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred:\u2014\nHENRY, J.\nAfter giving a great deal of consideration to this matter, with a view of keeping it under the jurisdiction of the Court, I regret that I have been unsuccessful in finding any reason by which this Court would be justified in retaining this appeal. The statute which has been referred to is of too imperative a character to be called in question in regard to the petition which is now before the Court. In the ordinary cases, a notice of appeal is required to be given within eight days. In this case, there is no notice of appeal provided for, and the notice\u2014the want of which is complained of in this case\u2014is the first notice the party gets that any such appeal has been taken. I think, therefore, it is material to the jurisdiction of this Court that this notice should be given as the statute provides. In the ordinary cases of appeal, the notice, I think, perfects the appeal, and it is then within the jurisdiction of this Court to be dealt with, and, if so, might, in that case, I think, be brought under the terms of rule 70 of this Court.\nNow, had it been provided for in the statute that notice of appeal should be given, and that such notice had been given, I would consider the case was then legitimately in this Court; but, unless that notice were given in the ordinary appeals, I would consider the case was hardly here, and, therefore, not within our jurisdiction. I concur with my learned brethren in saying that this is a case which is specially provided for by the statute, and that the terms of it, by which the party is entitled to appeal, ought to be complied with; and, if not, under the authorities of all the cases which have been referred to and others I have turned my attention to, I regret to, say, this being, I think, a condition precedent, there is no appeal; and that the party is not regularly in this Court. I was in hopes that under the waiver that had been shown here, the case might still have been heard, but I think there is a fundamental objection, and that the waiver, such as it is, cannot be admitted. Under these circumstances I regret to say I feel myself bound to decide that this appeal is irregular, and, therefore, so far as it is now before us ought to be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nFor the same reasons, which it is needless to repeat, I concur with the decision and am of opinion that the appeal should be quashed. No doubt the appellant suffers great hardship, but, after all, he suffers from his own neglect.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI have endeavoured to support the position contended for upon the part of the appellant, that the notice, required to be given by the 48th section of the Supreme Court Act, is a matter of procedure only, and that the clause, requiring it to be given, is directory only and not imperative; but I regret to say that I am unable to arrive at that conclusion. True it is, that the same point may arise under the 68th section, on an appeal to this Court from the Exchequer Court, the notice there required being identical with that required by the 48th section, save only in so far as the words in the latter section, \"or such further time as the Judge who tried the petition may allow,\" may make, if it does make, any difference. Every thing required to be done in the 48th section preceding the giving the notice of appeal is authorized to be done ex parte\u2014behind the back of the respondent. The deposit of $100, as security for costs, within 8 days from the day on which the Judge has given his decision, is the ex parte act of the person against whom the decision is given, and this is made a condition precedent to the clerk of the Court making up and transmitting the record to the Registrar of the Supreme Court. The transmission of that record is an ex parte act, of which the person in whose favor judgment was rendered is not, in the contemplation of the statute, deemed to have notice, except by the notice required to be given of its having been received by the Registrar of this Court, and by him set down for hearing at the nearest convenient time. So that the only notice which the statute provides to perfect the appeal is the notice required to be given to the opposite party within three days from the matter of the petition being set down by the Registrar of this Court, \"or such further time as,\" not this Court, but \"the Judge who tried the petition may allow.\" This, then, being the only notice of appeal provided by the Act, without which the respondent would know nothing of an appeal being contemplated, the words in the section, \"and the appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by the Supreme Court,\" seem certainly to make the giving the notice a condition precedent to the hearing of the appeal, and so the objection is not merely one of procedure only, but affects our jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nIt was contended that the appearance of the respondent to two summonses, signed by a Judge of this Court, in respect of matters connected with the appeal, should be held to be a waiver of the want of notice, but our jurisdiction in this matter being wholly statutory, I fear we cannot adopt this view.\nRegina v. The Justices of Middlesex[6] is a strong authority upon this point. The motion was for a mandamus, directed to the justices of the County of Middlesex, commanding them to enter continunances, and hear an appeal against a conviction under 4 Geo. 4, c. 98, s. 87, which required notice of appeal to be given within six days after the cause of complaint shall have arisen. The conviction took place on Monday the 2nd May, the notice of appeal was received on Monday the 9th May\u2014the 8th being Sunday. The appeal came on to be heard at the sessions on the 6th July, when the appellant appeared in Court prepared to prosecute his appeal. On the appeal being called on, counsel for the respondent, without requiring service of the notice of appeal, or any other fact, to be proved, applied to have the hearing of the appeal adjourned to the next sessions, which was ordered accordingly. The next sessions commenced on the 7th August, when the case was again adjourned to the next sessions, which commenced on the 12th October. Upon that day both parties appeared by their counsel, and the appellant with his witnesses, when the respondent, by his counsel, admitted service of the notice of appeal on the 9th May as aforesaid, but objected to the appeal being heard on the ground that the notice of appeal was not served within the prescribed six days, and thereupon the Court of Quarter Sessions, acting upon the objection, refused to hear the appeal, and the conviction was confirmed. It was strongly contended, that the appearance of the respondent, and procuring the adjournment of the case without making the objection relied upon, operated as a waiver of the objection. It was also contended that, as the seventh day was a Sunday, the notice was good, but the Court, Williams J., said: \"The question I had to determine arises upon the distinct language of the statute, and upon that language how can I say that this notice was given within six days. I think the plain words of the Act are not to be got rid of.\" And he adds, \"I feel the less regret at coming to this conclusion because there were five days in which the notice might have been served, but the appellant chose to neglect and to raise this discussion.\" And the rule for the mandamus was discharged.\nI cannot see that the appearance of the respondent's attorney upon the summonses relied upon can deprive him of the right to insist that he has never received that notice, the giving of which constitutes the means provided by the statute to subject him to the jurisdiction of this Court in relation to the matter in appeal.\nThe cases relied upon by Mr. Cockburn were cases of want of, or of defect in, the notice, which was made a step preliminary to the party appealing. I at first thought, and was in hope that I should find, this constituted such a difference as would make them inapplicable in this case, but, as the notice required by this statute is made a step preliminary to our hearing the appeal, and is the only means provided by the statute for subjecting the respondent to our jurisdiction, they seem equally to apply here; for although we may have jurisdiction to hear and determine the case, if the parties should choose to argue it without any notice, we have no jurisdiction to compel the respondent to submit to our jurisdiction, if he has not received the statutory notice, or under such circumstances to hear the case ex parte, in the absence of the respondent.\n[Case struck out of the lists of appeals with costs of the motion.]\nSubsequently to this order, an application was made by the appellant to Mr. Justice Armour, who tried the election petition, to extend the time for giving the notice. On the 22nd November, 1879, the learned judge granted the application and made an order \"extending the time for giving the prescribed notice till the 10th day of December, then next,\" and within the extended time the case was again set down by the Registrar for hearing by the Supreme Court at the sitting of February, 1880, being the nearest convenient time, and notice of such setting down given.\nThe respondent on the 12th December, 1879, moved the Court to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal, and failed to bring the same on for hearing at the next session after the appeal had been instituted, and that the Judge had no jurisdiction to grant the order made on the 22nd November, 1879.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., appeared on behalf of the appellant, and Mr. Hodgins, Q.C., on behalf of the respondent. Their arguments, and cases cited, are referred to in the judgments hereinafter given.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis is an application to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal, or failed to bring the same on for hearing at the next session after it was ripe for hearing. The motion is in the matter of an election petition tried before Mr. Justice Armour, a Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench of Ontario, under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874, in which the present appellant was respondent and the present respondent was petitioner. Judgment was delivered on the 26th of February, 1879, and the sum of $100 was, within eight days after the said judgment, paid into the Court of which the said Judge was a member, and also ten dollars, the prescribed fee for making up and transmitting the record. The record was transmitted to the Registrar of this Court, who, on the 24th day of September, set down the matter of the said petition for hearing by this Court at its then next sitting, being the nearest convenient time. The party so appealing did not thereupon, within three days, give the notice required by section 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and did not obtain an allowance of further time for giving such notice from the Judge who tried the petition. On the third day of November, the respondent applied to this Court to have the said appeal struck out of the list of causes entered for hearing at the then sitting of this Court, for want of such notice, whereupon, and by reason of no such notice having been given, the Court did declare that the said cause could not, under the terms of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, be now heard and determined, and ordered the said case to be struck out of the list of appeals. Subsequently, an application was made to the Judge who tried the said petition to extend the time for giving the notice, whereupon the said Judge granted the application, and made an order \"extending the time for giving the prescribed notice till the 10th day of December then next,\" and within the extended time notice has been given, and the case has been again set down by the Registrar for hearing by this Court at the sitting in February next, being the nearest convenient time.\nThe respondent's contention is that, no extension of time having been allowed by the Judge before the cause was set down in this Court, and no notice in writing having been given within the three days after the case was first set down, the jurisdiction of the Judge who tried the petition was at an end; that he was functus officio, and had no power or authority to make the said order of the 22nd of November, and that therefore the case cannot be heard in this Court, and the appeal is consequently at an end, and should be dismissed. The learned Judge appears to have been of this opinion, but having been told that the Supreme Court thinks that he had the power, he assumed to make the order.\nAfter what took place on the argument, it is only necessary to repeat that the learned Judge was incorrectly informed, and to re-affirm that this Court never expressed any such opinion, but, on the contrary, carefully and avowedly refrained from doing so. As regards the present enquiry, this is now wholly immaterial. The only question we have to determine is: had, or had not, the Judge who tried the petition power to extend the time as he has done? If he had, then, having granted the extension, and notice having been given within the extension granted, the matter is now ripe for hearing, and the appeal cannot be dismissed. It cannot be disputed, that if the Judge had the power, the exercise of that power cannot be now questioned, it being purely a matter of discretion, resting with the Judge who tried the petition, and not appealable, and with which we have nothing to do.\nIn considering this case it is very important, as was suggested by my brother Strong on the argument, to refer to the 35th section of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act of 1874, which was repealed by the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, when the Supreme Court was organized and came into the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. That 35th section provided that any party to the petition, being dissatisfied with the decision of the judge, and desiring to appeal, might, within eight days from the day on which the Judge gave his decision, deposit in the Court of which the Judge was a member the sum of $100 by way of security for costs, whereupon the Clerk of the said Court was required to set the matter of said petition down for hearing before the full Court of which the Judge was a member, as therein provided; and the statute goes on to say that the party so appealing shall thereupon, within three days, or such further time as the Judge may upon application allow, give to the other parties to the said petition affected by the said appeal, or their respective attorneys, or agents, &c., notice in writing that the matter of said petition has been so set down to be heard in appeal as aforesaid. After providing that the party appealing may limit the subject of appeal, it proceeds: \"And the said appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by said full Court.\" The section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act which repeals this 35th section provides for a like appeal by any dissatisfied parties, and makes similar provision as to time, place, and amount of deposit of $100 as security for costs, and provides for the further sum of $10 as a fee for making up and transmitting the record, and that thereupon the Clerk or other proper officer of the Court (that is the Court of which the Judge is a member) \"shall make up and transmit the record in the case to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, who shall set down the matter of the said petition for hearing by the said Court at the nearest convenient time and according to any rules made in that behalf under this Act; and the party so appealing shall thereupon, within three days, or such further time as the Judge who tried the petition may allow, give to the other parties to said petition affected by said appeal, or the respective attorneys or agents by whom such parties were represented at the trial of the petition, notice in writing that the matter of the petition has been so set down for hearing in appeal as aforesaid,\" and by which notice said party so appealing may limit the subject of appeal, &c., and the appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by the Supreme Court.\nThe great difficulty which appears to have weighed on the mind of the learned Judge\u2014who, while extending the time, expressed so strongly his opinion adverse to his right to do so\u2014was his difficulty in conceiving that the Legislature could, in his own words, \"have intended that a Judge in the Court below should be making orders respecting, and meddling with, the proceedings of the Supreme Court, after the cause had become a cause in that Court,\" and apparently this forced the learned Judge to the conclusion that \"the application,\" that is, the application for an extension of time, \"could only have been made and such allowance granted before the matter of the petition had been set down for hearing in appeal, and not afterwards; that after the matter of a petition had been set for hearing in appeal in the Supreme Court the cause thereupon became a cause in the Supreme Court, and the Judge who tried the petition thereupon ceased to have any authority to make any order in the cause.\"\nIt is self-evident that the Legislature contemplated cases in which an extension of the very short period of three days might be necessary, and it is equally clear that such extension was confided to the discretion of the Judge who tried the petition, and to him alone. It was so vested in him alone under the first Acts, and when the Legislature took the appeal from the full Court of which he was a member and vested it in the Supreme Court, it still specially reserved to the Judge who tried the cause, in precisely the same terms, the power to extend the period of time, which would necessarily commence, under the repealing Act, to run from and after the time when the cause was entered in this Court. I cannot think it possible that the Legislature could have intended, as the Judge suggests, that the allowance could only be granted before the matter of the petition had been set down to be heard in this Court. Until the petition was set down, how could it be known that an extension would be necessary? In this case the decision was given on the 26th day of February, 1878, but the record was not transmitted till the 11th day of June last, over three months afterwards. By the affidavits in the case it appears this delay arose from the inability of the officers in the Court below to prepare the record of the proceedings for transmission, as to which, it appears, the appellant did not know when the same would be transmitted, and therefore in such a case it would be utterly impossible, it appears to me, for an appellant to know whether, when transmitted, he would be able or unable to give the notice, and as until the case was entered there were no three days to extend, I am somewhat at a loss to understand how an extension of a period that did not exist, and of which the applicant could have no knowledge, could be reasonably asked or granted, except possibly under very exceptional circumstances. Can there be a doubt that, under the Act of 1874, the Judge during the three days would have had authority to extend the time? I am at a loss to conceive upon what grounds it can be contended he could not. Or could it be possible that under the original section, if from exceptional circumstances it became impossible to give the notice within the short period of three days, and equally impossible to reach the Judge by reason of sickness or absence on judicial duty, or on account of some other cause, so that an extension could not be obtained within the three days, that appellant should be shut out by no neglect or fault of his own from his appeal, and should have inflicted upon him the irreparable injury of a disqualification for seven years without an appellate hearing[7]. And where, as the Judge says in this case, no party would be injured by the extension, I think this never could have been intended. It seems to me clear, that whatever power or discretion a Judge who tried the cause may have had under the 35th section of the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, he has under the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, because the power and the authority are confided to him in precisely the same language, and the matter to be remedied or provided for is likewise precisely the same. Therefore, I think the construction in both cases should be the same.\nIf, in acting under the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, the Judge, and he alone, might extend the time after the entry for hearing before the full Court of which he was a member, and during or after the three days, why should he be limited under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act to an extension before the cause is entered in this Court, and thus be excluded from extending the time during and after the three days, and so make the enactment practically comparatively, if not wholly, useless? In dealing with the matter during or after the three days under the 35th section of the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, there is admittedly no incongruity, as the Judge who acts is a Judge of the Court in which the cause is; but is there any substantial incongruity under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act?. Is it not rather fanciful than real? The application for an extension of time is not to the Judge as to the Judge of a Court having seizure of the case, and so, as such Judge, having a control over the proceedings in the Court of which he is a member by virtue of its ordinary jurisdiction, The application is in a purely statutory proceeding, of a very peculiar character, to a Judge who heard the case, for the exercise of his discretion, under a statutory authority which entrusts to him alone the exercise of such discretion, and whose jurisdiction has not wholly ceased, but is continued to enable him to extend the time for giving the notice, if in his opinion it is right to do so, not thereby in any way interfering or meddling, obstructively or objectionably, with any matter with which this Court has full power to deal, but, on the contrary, in aid of the proceedings before this Court, in a matter over which this Court has not power, to enable the appellant to get the appeal in a position to be heard in this Court, and so to give this Court full seizin thereof by giving it authority to hear and determine the merits of the case.\nBut if the incongruity was so great as the learned Judge supposes, that should not prevent us from giving the words of the statute their legitimate construction, or from recognizing the power conferred on the Judge who tried the cause, though not a member of this Court. There can be no doubt that the Legislature deemed the Judge who tried the case\u2014and who therefore would be necessarily conversant with all the proceedings therein and circumstances connected therewith\u2014the most competent to deal with this question, rather than this Court or its Judges, who could know nothing of all that had taken place\u2014a knowledge most necessary for the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.\nI may add also that the construction which has thus been put on the words \"shall thereupon within three days, or such further time as the Judge who tried the petition may allow\" is only in accordance with the strict literal language used, which is consistent with a well-known canon of construction\u2014that full effect should be given to the clear and definite words of the Legislature, there being nothing on the face of the statute to indicate a contrary intention. I think therefore that in this case, the statute not having limited the authority of the Judge, his power of extending the time is a general and an exclusive power, to be exercised according to sound discretion, and that so long as there has been no final disposition of the case, whenever that discretion is invoked the Judge, and he alone, has power to extend the time for giving the notice, and having done so in this case, it is now properly before this Court for hearing, and the appeal cannot be dismissed.\nThe question we decided when we refused to hear the appeal on a former occasion was entirely different from that now before us. We were then prevented from hearing the case by the express terms of the statute, which left us no discretion; we are now equally prevented from refusing to hear it, there having been a compliance with the provisions of the statute.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nWhen this case was under consideration at an earlier part of this Session, and when, owing to the notice of the setting it down for hearing not having been given within the three days from the time of such setting down, as required by section 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, we decided to strike out the appeal, as then before us, the position of the case was essentially different from that it now occupies.\nWhen our judgment was delivered the notice given was not within the prescribed three days; and the time for giving it had not been extended by the Judge who tried the merits of the petition. We felt therefore, that the requirements of the provision had not been fulfilled, and that, as the statute prescribed a limit and made necessary an order of the presiding Judge, to whose discretion alone it was left to extend the time, and as he had not exercised that discretion, we felt we could not extend the time, and had simply to say the proceeding was irregular and defective. The defect in the proceedings just mentioned has been since remedied by an order of the Judge; and that objection having been removed the appeal has been again set down for hearing, and the prescribed notice since duly given. The motion we have since heard was to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal or failed to bring the said appeal on to be heard at the first term of this Court after the appeal was ripe for hearing. The ground of the motion is, therefore, that the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal, or, in other words, failed to bring it on for hearing at the first term of this Court after the appeal was ripe for hearing.\nOur previous judgment was given on the motion of the respondent himself, alleging that the case was not then ripe for hearing. By the order of the Judge extending the time, the inscription for hearing, and the notice subsequently given, it has since then, for the first time, become ripe for hearing; and no delay has since occurred. The papers on file, and referred to on the argument, show that, since the making of the order of the Judge, before alluded to, everything is regular. If the Judge had the power to make that order the proceedings are altogether regular, and if he had not, is the act of his having done so, legitimately questioned by the motion now under consideration, which is founded only on alleged delay. It is stated to be founded on section 41 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, and the argument of the respondent was based on that section. Under it, the Legislature has limited our jurisdiction as to the dismissal of appeals, and, by it, we are to be governed. The words used in it are in substance the same as those we find in the notice of motion and in the motion itself. In the case, as at first before us, the notice of motion was for\nAn order setting aside all proceedings taken in this appeal by the appellant and striking the appeal out of the list of causes set down for hearing at the (then) \"next Session of this honorable Court, or for an order dismissing the appeal in this case out of this honorable Court,\" * * * or for such other order as might be deemed just.\nThe grounds were fully set out, and, amongst numerous others, the objection was taken that the notice of hearing, for the reasons before stated, was irregular and defective. Upon that objection we decided to strike out the appeal from the list of causes, as moved for.\nIn view of the present condition of the proceedings, can we consider them with the object of deciding upon their validity, under the present motion? If our power in such cases to dismiss an appeal was a general one for irregularity, we might, perhaps, go as far back as to consider the validity of the Judge's order (admitting that section 41 applies to election cases) and, on this motion, dismiss the appeal\u2014if irregularity or nullity were found. I am, however, of the opinion, that as we have been asked to grant the motion solely on the ground of delay, and as the statute restricts our inquiry to the matter of delay, we cannot, in my opinion, on this motion, decide upon an alleged irregularity or nullity of an order made by a Judge before or after the inscription for the hearing in this Court. Under the provisions of the statutes applicable to such cases, and the circumstances of this case, I think the proper, and indeed the only time, to raise the question of the validity of the Judge's order for the enlargement of the time to give the notice, is at the argument on the appeal.\nBy section 37, this Court is given power to quash proceedings (which I take to mean a power to be summarily exercised) on motion, but that summary power is confined to two cases, one where an appeal does not lie, and the other where such proceedings are taken against good faith.\nIt is under section 38 we derive the general power to dismiss an appeal, but the provision only applies to cases heard and decided on the merits of the subject matter of the appeal. The result, therefore, of my best consideration is that, under section 38, we can only inquire as to alleged delays after the appeal was had. That under section 37 our power to quash proceedings is confined to the two cases it provides for. That section 38 is limited, as I have just stated, and that our power being so limited, cannot be exercised on the motion made on the part of the respondent. This view of the position was not presented at either of the arguments, and as, at the time of the first one, we were occupied in session, and, therefore, unable to give the matter such full consideration as it has since had, and as the question was not raised at the first argument or considered by the Court, no decision was given on it. My present view, therefore, although apparently, is not really, opposed to the judgment we gave.\nThe validity of the Judge's order is now questioned; and as we have heard the parties fully on the point, it may be as well that we should give our views in regard to it. When the provision was originally made the Judge who tried the merits of the petition, was a member of the Court to which an appeal was given from his decision; and, it having been properly presumed he would be better qualified than the whole Court, or any other member of it, to judge of the proper extra time to be given, the legislature vested the power solely in him.\nWhen the Act was passed for the creation of this Court, by section 48 the appeal from the Judge's decision was directed to be to this Court, but with a provision as to the extension of time for giving the notice, in the same words as those employed in the repealed section of the previous Act. The irresistible conclusion is, I think, that the Legislature intended the Judge to exercise the same discretionary power in the one case, that he could have done in the other. I have called it a discretionary power, and I have done so advisedly, for if exercised within the prescribed three days, or as I think afterwards, no Court can question his decision; unless, indeed, it was founded in fraud or the extension was so great as to be unreasonable, and evidently an abuse of his power.\nIt is, however, contended that his discretion is confined to the prescribed three days, and that when they had passed he had no power to make, as in this case, an order for further time. His power is not expressly limited to the three days, but it is contended the Legislature must be considered so to have intended it.\nThe power being unlimited by the section as to the time during which it may be exercised, can we, or ought we to limit it\u2014or, in other words, are we bound to do so, No decision has been cited to sustain the latter proposition, and I can find none.\nThe decision of the appeal involves heavy penal consequences to the appellant, and we should be fully satisfied that we are bound by law to do so, before arriving at the conclusion contended for; and if after full consideration, a reasonable doubt remains, we are bound, I think, to resolve it against that contention. I feel justified in saying that by no rule of construction, nor for any other reason that I can discover, are we bound to say that the Legislature intended to limit the time to the three days. There is no principle or dictum that I can find which makes it obligatory on us to say so.\nIf right in that view we must say further that, although posessing, as contended for, the abstract power, we cannot claim to have the right to exercise it, when it would at least be doubtful that our doing so would be what the Legislature intended.\nAdmitting, however, we have the power, ought we to exercise it in this case which in many respects is peculiar? The difficulty has arisen from the failure to give the notice in the prescribed time; or to get the time extended. The giving of the notice was a condition precedent to the right, not to appeal, but to subsequently validate the appeal when taken. Some delay was caused, by the difficulty shown in getting the necessary papers returned to this Court, through the pressure of other business on the time of the officer of the Court at Toronto. The case was inscribed for hearing in this Court in October last, being the first Session after the record was transmitted, and it might, and would, no doubt, have been disposed of on the merits in its order, but for the objection founded on the want of the prescribed notice made by the respondent. The fact that the case was inscribed for hearing was brought very shortly afterwards to the knowledge of the respondent's counsel and agents; and other proceedings were had before a Judge or Judges of the Court limiting and defining the issues to be argued, in which the respondents counsel took part. The respondent's counsel were justified, as we have held, in taking the course they did to prevent a hearing of the appeal; but still, under the circumstances disclosed, the objection was purely technical, although one we felt bound to sustain. Being wholly of that character, it operated nevertheless to prevent a hearing. By the Judge's order, since made, that technical difficulty has been removed, and 1 don't think the case is one in which we are called upon to weigh very nicely the power of the Judge to make it, or in which justice requires that any doubts that exist should be resolved in favor of the respondents.\nI have fully considered the difficulties suggested by the learned Judge, when making the order, after the appeal had been taken to this Court and dismissed for the want of the notice. When, however, he made that order, the appeal having been dismissed, I think the case was remitted back to the same position it previously occupied, as fully as if no appeal had ever been had. His original jurisdiction, for a time suspended by the appeal, was, I think, restored by the order of this Court, which merely dismised it. When the Judge's order was made, this Court had parted with any jurisdiction as to its subject matter given it by the appeal. Where the Appellate Court has no jurisdiction, and so decides, the result is to remit back the case to the court appealed from. Such, I think, it must be considered was the result in this case.\nA question might have been, and was raised by the learned Judge, as to the entitling of his order, whether it should be in this Court or in the Court appealed from; but it is unnecessary to decide that point, as two orders have been made, one of which is entitled in this Court. I may remark, however, that the discretion as to the extension of the time must, according to the statute, be always exercised by the Judge after the appeal has been had, the case inscribed for hearing, and the matter then regularly in this Court. Any subsequent affidavits or other papers would then be properly entitled in this Court. The Legislature had the right to say by whom subsequent acts in this Court should be performed; and having provided that the Judge who tried the merits of the petition should be alone authorized to make such an order, no objection could be successfully raised to its validity, or to its being entitled in this Court, on the ground that it was made after the appeal was taken, for the statute expressly so provides. This peculiar duty was left with the Judge when the main subject was removed by the appeal.\nI think, therefore, we must conclude that the clear intention was, notwithstanding the appeal, to leave to the Judge the discretionary power of giving further time for the notice, and that his order was properly headed or entitled in this Court. The provision, to my mind, is too plain to admit of a doubt.\nI think for the reasons given that this motion should be refused, and the appellant allowed to be heard on the merits of the appeal; but, taking all the circumstances into consideration, without costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI have the misfortune to dissent from the judgment about to be rendered on the motions now before us in this case.\nIt seems to me that this right of the Judge, who tried the petition, to give an order which shall apply to proceedings in the Supreme Court, and, as in this case, to relieve a party from his default and negligence in his proceedings in the Supreme Court, should not be extended by interpretation. This power given to a Judge of the inferior Court to give an order in the case, when the case has gone out of his hands, and is before the court appealed to, is of an unusual character. It cannot be denied that the legislative authority had the right to give him such a power. But I think that we ought not to extend it in any way whatsoever, and I would hold that the Judge has that power only during the three days following the setting down for hearing. After these three days, he is functus officio. If we hold that he has that power, even when these three days have elapsed, where shall be the limit? In this very case, the Judge has actually given such an order almost two months after the case had been set down for hearing. Can the law have purported to allow this? In my opinion, if the law allows of an interpretation which would prevent such consequences, that interpretation should prevail.\nBut here, not only has this order been given after the three days following the day on which the case was set down for hearing, but it has been given after the day on which it was to be heard. Now, it seems to me that, even admitting that the Judge could give this order after the three days mentioned in section 48 of the Supreme Court Act, the case, on the 24th of September, having been set down for hearing on the 27th of October last by the Registrar of this Court, as he was bound to do under this section, it was only between these two dates, and before the day it was so set down for hearing, that, at any rate, the application to the Judge who tried the petition to allow a further time than the three days for giving notice of such hearing should have been made, and such notice should have been given. In other words, the statute provides only for one setting down for hearing, and it is this hearing, the one fixed by the Registrar at the nearest convenient time, of which notice must be given within three days, or of which the Judge may allow an extension of time to give notice. The statute seems to me to say so positively. \"Notice in writing that the matter of the petition has been so set down for hearing,\" are the words. Now so means the setting down by the Registrar, upon the transmission to him of the record, for hearing at the nearest convenient time. Of course, it is before the day fixed for hearing that the notice must be given of such hearing, and so it is before that day, and before that day only, that, in my opinion, the Judge who tried the petition can extend the time for giving such notice. It is the notice of the setting down by the Registrar on the reception of the record, that the Judge who tried the petition can allow to be given after the three days following the setting down. For this notice, and for no other, does the statute give him jurisdiction, and I fail to see how we can extend his jurisdiction in the matter to another setting down for hearing and another notice not provided for by the statute. That is always' even supposing that he can give this order after the three days mentioned in the statute. Then, it seems to me, and the learned Chief Justice has just expressed this to be his opinion, if I understood him correctly, that it is after the case is set down for hearing, that the Judge can extend the time to give notice of the day fixed for such hearing. Indeed, it is obvious that the appellant cannot give notice of the day fixed, before that day is actually fixed, and so, that it is only after the day for hearing has been fixed, that the appellant will, under any circumstances, ask an extension of delay for giving notice of the day so fixed. But here, the contrary has taken place. The Judge has extended the delay before the case was set down for hearing, that is to say before the setting down de novo for hearing in February next. Now, I fail to see in the statute that the Registrar had any power of so setting down the case for February next, or that any one had the power to authorize him so to do.\nAs to the cases cited by the appellant on his argument against these motions: In Lord v. Lee[8] it was held that a Judge may extend the time given by statute for the arbitrators to make the award, after that time has expired. But I do not think this applies. This case here, it seems to me, must be governed by different principles. There nothing but private rights, and contestation between private individuals as such, were in question. But election cases affect public interests. That is why Parliament, instead of leaving to the parties the power of setting down their case for hearing as in ordinary cases, has ordered the Registrar to do so, in election cases, for the nearest convenient time, after the transmission to him of the record. Parliament evidently intended that election appeals should not be delayed.\nScott v. Burnham[9], cited by the appellant, does not seem to me to have any application to this case; nor does Chowdry v. Mullick[10]. In St. Louis v. St Louis[11], also cited by the appellant, the Privy Council held that a motion to dismiss the appeal could not be granted, because the rule allowing a year and a day for prosecuting an appeal is not imperative on the King in Council, and the respondents had no right to complain of delay after laying by themselves eight months without making any application. The case is not in point. In Leggo v. Young[12], also cited, it was held that the Court will not entertain a second application upon grounds which might and ought to have been brought forward upon the former occasion. That was for ordinary acts of procedure, but here, I take it, we are dealing with a question affecting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine this appeal.\nIt has been held, in recent cases, in England, that the Court of Appeal will not enlarge the time for appealing where, owing to the mistake made bon\u00e2 fide by the appellant's legal advisers, the time within which the appeal should have been brought has been allowed to run out. I refer to International Financial Society v. City of Moscow Gas Co.[13]; Craig v. Phillips[14]; In re Mansel,[15]; and Highton v. Treherne[16].\nIn International Financial Society v. City of Moscow Gas Co.[17] James, L. J., said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that we cannot give any time. The respondents here say they are within the rule, and they have a right (and I think it is as valuable a right as anything which a subject has in this country,) to know when they can rely upon the decree or order in their favour. The limitation of the time to appeal is a right given to the person in whose favour a Judge has decided. I think we ought not to enlarge that time unless under some very special circumstance indeed, that is to say, if there has been any misleading, through any conduct of the other side, as was mentioned in the analogous case of vacating inrolment, which came before Lord Cottenham, and afterwards before Lord Chelmsford, in which it was laid down that the right of the suitor was ex debito justitiae to keep his inrolment of the decree, if it was made in due time, unless in very special cases. For instance, where there was anything like misleading on the part of the other side, or where some mistake has been made in the office itself, and a party was misled by an officer of the Court, or again, where some sudden accident which could not have been foreseen\u2014some sudden death, or something of that kind, which accounted for the delay; in such cases leave might be given. But simply where a man says, \"I looked at the order, and I bon\u00e2 fide came to the conclusion that I had up to a particular day, and I determined to take the last day I could,\" then he has taken upon himself to calculate the last day, and if he has made a mistake in calculating the last day he must abide by the consequences of that mistake. Beyond all question, in this case there was abundance of time to have brought the appeal, if it was intended really and bon\u00e2 fide to appeal from the order as pronounced.\nBaggally, L. J., in the same case, said:\u2014\nI am of the same opinion. This Court has before expressed an opinion that the mere fact of a misunderstanding by the parties concerned of the provisions of the rules is not such a special circumstance as to induce the Court to give that special leave which is required to extend the time.\nIn re Mansel, Jessel, M. R., said[18]:\nHas any sufficient case for extending the time been made? No reason has been given but that the solicitor's clerk made a mistake as to the meaning of the rule. If that is to be allowed as a sufficient reason for relaxing the rules they might as well be repealed. The opposite party is not answerable for the mistake, and is entitled to the advantage of it, unless he has done something to mislead the applicant.\nThese cases, I know, are not exactly in point, and as not one of the Judges doubted their right to grant this appeal after the time allowed therefor had elapsed, they may perhaps be invoked by the appellant as sustaining his contention, viz.: That even after the three days elapsed, Judge Armour could grant him an order extending the delay to give notice of the hearing.\nBut as to this contention of the appellant, it is not supported by these cases, because, the Supreme Court Act, sect. 26, virtually says that, in election cases, the time within which to appeal cannot be extended, and I think that, since the legislature specially made that provision as to election cases, for the right of appeal therein, we may apply the same principle as to the order of the Judge and the notice of hearing in such election cases.\nAnother feature of the case is this: Mr. Justice Armour, in fact, decided that he had no jurisdiction and no authority to grant this order. But, as it was stated before him, and even sworn to, I understand, that this Court had expressed the opinion that he had the power so to do, he, in deference to this view so stated to him, granted the order. Now, we have positively stated that this Court had never expressed the opinion that Mr. Justice Armour had such a power, and that this assertion made to him was erroneous and unfounded in fact, though we are satisfied that the gentleman who made it did not wilfully and knowingly assert a fact contrary to truth. Mr. Justice Armour's decision, in the exercise of his discretion, we could not review. He alone could give this order, and, if he refused it, the case was at an end. Now, he says that he, left to his own judgment, would have refused this order. He grants it, only in deference to an expresion of opinion which is stated to him to have been given from this Court. Now, this expression of opinion we never gave; the Respondent obtained, then, Mr. Justice Armour's order under false pretenees. Without these false pretences, without this assertion before the Judge of a false statement, through error and misapprehension, no doubt, but yet false, the Judge tells us that he would not have granted this order. Are we to allow the appellant the benefit of having obtained this order under such circumstances? Must we not treat Mr. Justice Armour's judgment as a refusal of the order?\nIt has been said that it would be a hard case for the appellant, if he could not appeal from a decision by which he is deprived of his civil rights for seven years. But whose fault would it be, if that was so? His, and his alone. He would have to bear the consequences of his own negligence. And, may I ask, is there no hardship in, for such a length of time, either depriving this North Ontario constituency of a representative in the House of Commons, or, still worse, in imposing upon it, as its representative, a man, whose election as such has been declared void, who, by a court of justice whose judgment in that respect is not impugned or appealed from, has been declared never to have been duly chosen as such by the electors thereof; and this, because this man himself has failed to conform himself to the law in his proceedings in this case, and because he has obtained an order upon the assertion of a fact which turns out to be untrue, though he may have believed it.\nWhen I see that the statute allows only eight days to appeal in election cases, instead of thirty days, as in the other cases; when I see that, though it gives the right to extend that delay in the other cases, it specially exempts the election cases from this extension of the delay to appeal; when I see that it gives only three days to the appellant to give notice of the hearing; when I see that, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, the rule of this Court orders the deposit of the factums only three days before the first day of the session fixed for the hearing of the appeal, instead of thirty days in the other cases, I think that we ought to pause before sanctioning proceedings by which the hearing of this appeal is so long delayed, and before relieving the appellant of an act of negligence and disobedience to the law for which he has not even attempted to give a shadow of excuse.\nOf course, these were considerations for Mr. Justice Armour, in the exercise of his discretion in granting the order, if he had jurisdiction to grant it, but they also seem to me to be material and important when we have to decide whether Mr. Justice Armour had jurisdiction, and at what time and what period of the case he ceased to have jurisdiction in the matter according to the statute. And when I see that by rule 12 of this Court and the form of the schedule A thereof, combined with section 14 of the Act, it is provided for a special session of this Court for the hearing of election cases, I think that the least the appellant should have done, even admitting that Mr. Justice Armour had jurisdiction to give him this order, at the time it was given, should have been to apply to this Court or to the Chief Justice for a special and early session to hear his appeal, which would undoubtedly have been granted to him, instead of having fixed for hearing for February next only a case in which judgment has been given in February last. Here again I find that the appellant has unduly delayed, under the circumstances, to prosecute his appeal.\nI would be of opinion to grant the respondent's motion to dismiss the appeal, under sect. 41 of the Supreme. Court Act, because the appellant unduly delayed to prosecute his appeal, in not giving notice within the three days after the case was set down for hearing on the 24th September, or having failed to do so, for not obtaining from Judge Armour within these three days, or, at all events, at any time before the 27th of October, the day on which the case was to be heard, an order extending these three days, and for not having given notice at any time before the said 27th of October of the said hearing on the said day, as also for having had the case set down for February only.\nI would, under the circumstances, think it better to grant the respondent's motion asking us to report to the Speaker of the House of Commons the proceedings in the case, such as they appear in the case and as they have taken place before us. It may be that this report could not be acted upon by the Speaker, because it would not be in strict conformity with the statute. But nevertheless, I should think it the best thing to do under the circumstances. We have not to decide what should be done on this report, and we may later, if we hear this case, find ourselves obliged to make to the Speaker a report not much more in accordance with the statute (1).\nGWYNNE, J., concurred with The Chief Justice and Strong, Fournier and Henry, J.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nSheriffs Sale Proc\u00e8s- Verbal what it should contain Art. 638 C.C.P.\nUnder a writ of rendition exponas issued in a suit wherein M. C. was plaintiff and D. G. was defendant, the latter's property was seized, advertized and sold to the appellants, under the following\n(1) 37 Vict.,ch.10, sect.30. description :\u2014\"4 lots of land or emplacements situate at Coteau St. Louis, in the Parish of L\u2019Enfant Jesus, heretofore forming part of the Parish of Montreal, in the District of Montreal, being known and designated in the official plan and book of reference of the Village of Coteau St. Louis in the said Parish of Montreal under the Nos 1819 20 and 21, of the subdivision of No. 167, of the said official plan and book of reference, with 4 wooden houses and dependencies thereon erected.' The sale was made in one lot only at the Sheriffs office, in the City of Montreal. The respondents demanded the nullity of the sale by means of an opposition.\nHeld,\u2014That it was not sufficient to give only the number of the official plan and book of reference in the proc\u00e8s-verbal of seizure and the advertisement of the Sheriff as under Art. 638 C. C. P. it is necessary to give the range or the street where the property is situated, in addition to the official number, and therefore the sale was null and of no effect.\n[As to sale having been made at the Sheriff's office instead of at the church door of the Parish of l'Enfant Jesus, see 42 and 43 Vic. oh. 25 Q.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), rendered at Montreal on the 21st December, 1878, which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court of 29th November, 1877, rendered in favor of the appellants and annulled and set aside a purchase, made by the appellants, of certain real property from the Sheriff of Montreal.\nThe Sheriff of the District of Montreal,. on the 5th December, 1876, under a writ of venditioni exponas issued in a suit wherein Moise Courtemanche was plaintiff, and David Gauthier was defendant, seized, advertized and sold under the following description : \" 4 lots of land or emplacements situate at Coteau St. Louis, in the parish of L\u2019Enfant Jesus, heretofore forming part of the parish of Montreal, in the district of Montreal, being known and designated in the official plan and book of reference of the village of Coteau St. Louis in the said parish of Montreal, under the Nos 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the subdivision of No. 167 of the said official plan and book of reference, with 4 wooden houses and dependencies thereon erected.\"\nThe sale was made in one lot only at the Sheriff's office, in the City of Montreal, and the appellants were the purchasers, adjudicataires, for the sum of $450.\nThe respondents, hypothecary creditors of the defendant, David Gauthier, demanded, by opposition, that the sale in question be annulled on four grounds :\u2014\n1st. That there was no interpellation to the defendant to designate his real estate, and in consequence that there had been a seizure made en bloc of what ought to have been seized in separate lots; 2nd. The omission to mention the requirements of par. 3 of art. 638, C. C. P., the concession, the range or the street; 3rd. That these alleged irregularities were repeated in the official notices published by the Sheriff; 4th. That the sale took place at the Sheriff's office contrary to law, inasmuch as the property was not in the city or banlieue of Montreal, and ought to have been sold at the church door of the parish where they were situated.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) reversed the judgment of the Superior. Court and declared the sale null and of no effect, on the ground that, as the property was situated in the parish of l'Enfant J\u00e9sus, a parish duly erected for all civil purposes, the property could only be sold at the church door of the said parish of l'Enfant J\u00e9sus, but the Supreme Court of Canada did not express any opinion on this point, as there was another reason sufficient to declare the sale null and void, and as this point had since been settled by legislation (1).\nThe evidence bearing upon the case sufficiently appears in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Laflamme Q. C., and Mr. Loranger Q. C., for Appellants :\u2014\n42 and 43 Vie. ch. 25 Q. The appellants submit that the property was rightly sold at the Sheriff's office in Montreal. The jugement appealed from is based exclusively upon the Sheriff having sold the property in question at the wrong place. If this decision is a sound one, hundreds of other Sheriff's titles, besides appellant's, will be invalid, as sales of property situate in the city and banlieue of Montreal have always been advertized to take place, and been held, at the Sheriff's office in Montreal, both before and after the subdivision of that parish.\nThe learned counsel entered into a lengthy and elaborate argument to show that the banlieue of Montreal was recognized by legislative authority, although no edict or law creating it can be found, and referred to a number of authorities, but as this point has since been settled by legislation and the judgment of the Supreme Court decided the case on other grounds, no further reference to this branch of the argument need be made.\nThe Court below was unwilling to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court on any of the other grounds taken. These grounds of nullity are three in number viz :\n1st.\u2014As to several lots being sold en bloc, there is no law requiring them to be sold separately, or forbidding the sale en bloc On the contrary, the Code distinctly contemplates several lots being sold together by the Sheriff for one and the same price. Vide Art. 735, Code of Procedure. Common sense dictates that there should be no unbending rule.\n2nd.\u2014As to no demand of description of property being made by Bailiff on defendant,. or refusal by him to give one. The proc\u00e8s-verbal of seizure shows that the seizing officer made the demand on defendant for description of his immovable property, at defendant's domicile, speaking to a grown person of his family; and that he seized the real estate mentioned in said proc\u00e8s-verbal such as described by the defendant, speaking as aforesaid and after having himself ascertained its correctness on the spot.\nArt. 637, Code of Procedure, does not require any personal requisition on the defendant; and the seizing officer fully complied with it. It is evident also that if there had been any nonobservance of its requirements, it is only the defendant who could complain of it, not the present appellants, and the defendant could do so by opposition a fin d'annuler; but only if the description in the proc\u00e8s-verbal was inexact. Vide Dupuis vs. Bourdages and Bourdages opposants ([1]).\n3rd. \u2014As to there being no indication of street range or concession. The description is in accordance with Act 2168 of the Civil Code. The Coteau St. Louis is given, the parish and the cadastral numbers of the lots which Art 2168 declares to be the true description and sufficient in any document whatever. It is also specially stated that the Sheriff shall so describe immoveable in his notices of sale. If appellants had fyled an opposition on the ground that the property was on a street and that it ought to be so described, they would be required to allege and prove the fact. Now, they have not alleged the lots to be upon any street, nor have they produced any evidence proving it.\nThere is no allegation as to the lots being on Robin Street or any street; and the only witness who speaks as to their situation is the defendant, David Gauthier, who states that the lots are upon Robin Street, Coteau St. Louis, parish of L'Enfant Jesus, and that there is a sign board with the name of the street, and that it is known by that name, and in the village of Coteau St. Louis.\nThis is altogether insufficient evidence to prove the existence of a legal street, such as the Sheriff would be justified in stating the lots seized to be situated upon. Respondents prove the village to be incorporated, and should have produced the proper municipal officer to prove that Robin Street was a duly homologated legal street acquired by the corporation and paid for, otherwise the Sheriff would expose himself to a demand by the purchasers to set aside the d\u00e9cret, or for a reduction in price, if the \" street \" proved to be merely one of sufferance, or a projected one (of which there are many in Montreal) the ownership of which was in private hands, and which the corporation would have at some future tim\u00e9 to acquire and assess the costs upon those interested; no one in the meanwhile being responsible for repairs, drainage, etc. There is documentary evidence in the record which goes to establish that this so-called street was in fact private property. In the deed of sale from respondents to defendant the lots in question are described as subdivision numbers of official No. 167 of Cote St. Louis and fronting on Robin Street, which is itself described, in parenthesis, thus \" (No. 52 du No. 167).\" Now, the fact that this \"Robin Street\" had a cadastral number proves that it was not a road or street in the eye of the law, but private property, cadastral numbers not being given to public streets. Vide 35 Vict., c. 16, sec. 2 Q.\nThe Code of Procedure does not set aside Sheriff's sales for informalities in the seizure which could be set up by opposition; on the contrary, it says that non-observance of the essential formalities prescribed for the sale shall have that effect; these formalities are set forth at length in Art. 665 to 689 C. C. P., and a violation of these, in some essential part, would be good ground for setting aside the sale, there being no other remedy open to the party aggrieved, as, of course, no opposition could then be fyled.\nSo far from these being grounds which could be set up after a Sheriff's sale in order to set it aside, it has been held that an opposition setting up such grounds should be fyled to the first execution under writ of fieri facias, and would be too late if opposed to the sale under the venditioni exponas; vide Abbott vs. The Montreal and By town Railway Company ([2]). A fortiori, it would be too late after the sale : Berthelet vs. Guy ([3]).\nMr. Doutre, Q. C., for respondents\u2014after arguing that the sale was properly made at the Sheriff's office in the City of Montreal, continued as follows :\nThe other grounds of opposition on which the respondents rely also are :\n(1). These four lots, bearing each a separate cadastral number, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the subdivision of No. 167, were four different immovable and should have been sold separately. The law is not so precise on this point as it is on the other; but it ought to be interpreted, and, as a matter of fact, it has generally been interpreted, in a common sense way, in the interest of all parties, which consists in obtaining the most possible from judicial sales,\u2014the plaintiff and other creditors in getting paid, the defendant in being released of his indebtedness. In the audience, at a sheriff's sale, there may be a number of persons capable of purchasing a house and lot and unable to buy four. The fact proved, that these houses were under one roof, in order to justify the sale of four houses in one lot, cannot go far to justify the very unusual proceeding of selling four houses in one lot. In every large city or town, there are terraces, containing fifteen or twenty houses, apparently under a continuous roof, but belonging to different owners.\nThe reason why they were sold in one lot, is given by the Sheriff's officer who made the sale, Mr. Vilbon, as follows : \" Before putting up the property for sale, the defendant requested me to sell it by lots, and Mr. Arthur Desjardins, who was the attorney ad litem for the plaintiff, objected to this; I then referred the matter to the Sheriff and to the Deputy Sheriff, and these gentlemen decided that the property should be sold en bloc; they consulted Mr. Lacoste, who was there, and they decided that the sale should be made in one lot only. Now we find that the property was adjudged to the same Mr. Arthur Desjardins, for the appellants, for the sum of $450 !\nArticle 2167 of the Civil Code says :\u2014Each lot of land shewn upon the plan is designated thereon by a number, which is one of a single series, and is entered in the book of reference to designate the same lot. Article 668 of the Code of Civil Procedure says that every bid must indicate, amongst other things, the immovable bid upon. The word \" immovable \" is in the singular number, implying thereby that one immovable only should be put up to sale at a tim\u00e9.\n(2). Then also, contrary to article 638 of the Code of Procedure section 3 the minutes of seizure did not indicate the street in which the immovable seized were situated. This is answered by art. 2168 of the Civil Code, where it is said that \" the number given to a lot upon the plan and in the book of reference is the true description of such lot and is sufficient as such in any document whatever, and any part of such lot is sufficiently designated by stating that it is a part of such lot and mentioning who is the owner thereof and the properties conterminous thereto.\"\nThe Civil Code came into force on the 28th June, 1866; the Code of Procedure on the 28th June 1867. By all the rules of interpretation the last statute prevails over the former one.\nCarr\u00e9 & Chauveau ([4]) say that in these matters, the law must be observed strictly and no latitude of interpretation is admissible.\nIn the official cadastre of which this Court can take judicial notice Robin street is well marked and described. The deed of sale which has been fyled in the case mentions the fact that this property is situated on Robin street. The provisions of the law have not been complied with, and it was for the appellants to show by authority that some of the formalities prescribed could be omitted.\nMr. Laflamme, Q. C., in reply :\u2014\nThe evidence clearly establishes that it is usual for the Sheriff to sell en bloc an unfinished terrace built on four subdivided lots. The law gives the Sheriff a discretionary power.\n[Fournier, J.:\u2014Must not that discretionary power be exercised at the time of the seizure and not at the tim\u00e9 of the sale?] '\nYes but the seizure in this case does not specify that the seizure was of four separate lots, but it is specified here in one description as four lots of land.\nAs to the omission of the name of the street this objection should have been taken before the sale and moreover it will be seen that there is no evidence of the legal existence of a street, and by referring to the amended cadastre, it will be seen that this property is not bounded by the street\nFOURNIER, J. :\u2014\nLes intimes devant cette Cour, opposites en Cour inf\u00e9rieure, ont demand\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret d'un immeuble saisi et vendu \u00e0 la poursuite de Moise Courte manche contre Pierre Gauthier, leur d\u00e9biteur d'une cr\u00e9ance hypoth\u00e9caire.\nCet immeuble est d\u00e9crit dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie et dans les annonces de vente faites par le sh\u00e9riff, comme suit :\n\"Quatre lots de terre ou emplacements situ\u00e9s au Coteau St. Louis en la Paroisse du St. Enfant J\u00e9sus faisant ci-devant partied de la Paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, dans le District de Montr\u00e9al, \u00e9tant connus et d\u00e9sign\u00e9s aux Plan et Livre de Renvoi officiels du village du Coteau St. Louis de la dite Paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, sous les num\u00e9ros dix-huit. dix-neuf vingt et vingt-et-un de la subdivision du num\u00e9ro cent soixante-et-sept (167) des dits Plan et Livre de Renvoi officiels\u2014 Avec quatre maisons en boss et d\u00e9pendances sus \u00e9rig\u00e9es.\"\nCes quatre lots ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus comme n'en formant qu'un seul.\nDans leur opposition, les intimes allegiant qu'ils ont sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 une cr\u00e9ance de bailleur de fonds au montant de $3,330.95, et que la vente qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite est nulle pour les raisons suivantes :\n10.

Le proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie constate que l'huissier s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne raisonnable de la famille du d\u00e9fendeur, et que parlant \u00e0 cette personne, \" il aurait s somm\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur de lui donner une d\u00e9signation de s ses immeubles.\" Le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait sans doute absent de chez lui lors de la saisie; mais son absence ne pouvait aucunement emp\u00eacher les huissiers de proc\u00e9der La loi n'exigeant pas que cette sommation soit faite personnellement au d\u00e9fendeur, elle peut l'\u00eatre \u00e0 son domicile et il est constat\u00e9 quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de cette mani\u00e8re. La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de ce fait ne peut \u00eatre mise en question, car le proc\u00e8s-verbal en fait une preuve authentique qui ne peut \u00eatre contredite que par la voie de l'inscription de faux \u00e0 laquelle on n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de recourir. Le d\u00e9fendeur Gauthier n'a pas d\u00fb d'ailleurs tarder \u00e0 \u00e9\u00eatre inform\u00e9 de cette saisie, et de la sommation qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, puisqu'un double du proc\u00e8s-verbal contenant cette sommation a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 son domicile. Le paragraphe 4 de l'article 638 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile dit qu'un exemplaire du proc\u00e8s-verbal sera laiss\u00e9 au saisi. personnellement ou \u00e0 son domicile r\u00e9el ou l\u00e9gal. On doit donc consid\u00e9rer l'interpellation comme ayant eu lieu suivant la loi.\nQuant \u00e0 la pretention que les quarter- lots saisis devaient \u00eatre vendus s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, la preuve a cet \u00e9gard est contradictoire, bien qu'il en ressorte certainement le fait que ces maisons inachev\u00e9es \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 faire des habitations s\u00e9par\u00e9es les unes des autres; mais \u00e9tant d'avis que les Opposants ont raison sur Un autre point, et qu'ils doivent obtenir leur conclusion, je me dis- penserai d'analyser cette preuve. Je m'abstiendrai aussi de me prononcer sur. une question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'objet m de beaucoup de recherches de la part des savants avocats des parties :\u2014 c'est celle de savoir si la vente aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la porte de l'\u00e9glise du St. Enfant Jesus, Fau lieu de l'\u00eatre au bureau du sh\u00e9rif. La raison de mon abstention est que cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9, depuis que cette cause est sous consid\u00e9ration, r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par un statut de la derni\u00e8re session de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec. Il est vrai qu'il fait exception des causes alors pendantes.\nIl reste maintenant \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la question de savoir si la description de l'immeuble donn\u00e9e par le sh\u00e9rif dans ses annonces de vente est conforme \u00e0 la loi, et si l'observation des formalit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet par le Code de Proc\u00e9dure sont \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9.\nL'article 648 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile oblige le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 donner dans ses annonces de vente la description de l'immeuble telle qu'ins\u00e9r\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s-verbal de saisie. D'apr\u00e8s l'article 638 la saisie est constat\u00e9e par un proc\u00e8s-verbal qui doit contenir d'apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 3 de cet article, l la description des immeubles saisis en indiquant la cite, ville, village, paroisse ou township, ainsi \" que la rue, le rang ou la concession o\u00f9 il sont situ\u00e9s, et l le num\u00e9ro de l'immeuble, s'il existe un plan officiel \" de la localit\u00e9, sinon les tenants et aboutissants \" Le langage de cet article suffit pour faire voir que les formalit\u00e9s qu'il prescrit sont \u00e0 peine de nullit\u00e9. Crest dans la forme imperative que s'exprime le Code, \" la saisie \" des immeubles est constat\u00e9e par un proc\u00e8s-verbal qui doit c contenir.\" Les formalit\u00e9s prescrites ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es dans le cas actuel?\nD'abord, quant \u00e0 la situation, on voit par le proc\u00e8s-verbal que les emplacements en question sont situ\u00e9s au Coteau St. Louis, en la paroisse du St. Enfant J\u00e9sus.\u2014 Qu'est-ce que le Coteau St. Louis? est-ce une cit\u00e9, ville ou village? Pour le savoir il faut recourir \u00e0 la preuve L'acte de vente des opposites qui conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1,210, paragraphe 2, fait preuve l\u00e9gale des \u00e9nonciations qu'il contient, d\u00e9clare que les lots en question sont\nSitu\u00e9s sur la rue Robin (No. 52 du No. 167), en la municipalit\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te St. Louis, dans la paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, connus et d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme lots num\u00e9ros dix-huit, dix-neuf, vingt et vingt-et-un (Nos. 18, 19. 20 et 21) des plan de subdivision et livre de renvoi faits du num\u00e9ro officiel cent soixante-sept (No. 167) des plan et livre de. renvoi du village incorpor\u00e9 de la C\u00f4te St. Louis, paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, et d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, en conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2175 du code civil du Bas-Canada, contenant environ chaque lot de terre quarante pieds de largeur sur une profondeur de quatre-vingts pieds, plus ou moins, mesure anglaise.\nLe d\u00e9put\u00e9 et le premier commis du sh\u00e9rif entendus comme t\u00e9moins d\u00e9signent cette localit\u00e9, l'un sous le nom de \" C\u00f4te St. Louis \" et l'autre sous celui de \" Coteau St. Louis\" Le d\u00e9fendeur entendu comme t\u00e9moin dit que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est dans les limites du village du Coteau St. Louis.\nLe doute que peut causer cette preuve sur le v\u00e9ritable nom de la localit\u00e9 est facilement tranche en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la proclamation qui l'a \u00e9rig\u00e9e en municipalit\u00e9 de village. Cette proclamation, dont nous sommes tenus de prendre judiciairement connaissance, \u00e9tablit que la d\u00e9signation donn\u00e9e dans l'acte de vente des opposants est correcte. Dans ce cas il est clair que la localit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e dans la saisie et les annonces de vente comme le veut l'article 638. On a omis une d\u00e9claration essentielle pour faire facilement reconna\u00eetre et identifier la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014celle que les lots en question \u00e9taient situ\u00e9s dans l le village de la C\u00f4te St. Louis \" nom sous lequel cette localit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9e en municipalit\u00e9 de village par proclamation en date du 14 octobre 1846.\n11 est aussi en preuve par l'acte de vente que ces lots sont situ\u00e9s sur la rue Robin. Ce fait est aussi prouv\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage du defender et par l'acte de vente. Pas un seul des t\u00e9moins entendus par l'appelante n'a prouv\u00e9 le contraire. Cette derri\u00e8re qui avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 justifier l'omission de la mention du nom de la rue n'a fait aucune tentative \u00e0 cet effet devant la cour infl\u00e9rieur. Le d\u00e9faut de transquestions au d\u00e9fendeur, seul t\u00e9moin qui \u00e0 part do l'acte de vente, constate l'existence de cette rue, semble indiquer quo l'appelante \u00e9tait satisfaite do la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du fait. Ce n'est que devant cette cour qu'elle a essay\u00e9 de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'insuffisance de sa preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, en produisant devant cette cour une copie du plan officiel fait en vertu de l'art. 2175, au moyen duquel elle pr\u00e9tend faire la preuve du fait qu'il n'existe pas l\u00e9galement une rue d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de rue Robin,\nCe n'est pas devant cette cour en appel mais devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lorsque cette cause \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate que cette preuve devait \u00eatre faite. Il n'est plus temps do la faire ici. Ce serait changer la position des parties devant la cour de premi\u00e8re instance et d\u00e9cider la cause sur une preuve diff\u00e9rente de cella qui a servi de base an jugement en cette cause.\nIl est bien vrai que le plan officiel quo l'on offre de produire doit faire une preuve authentique de la description des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s,\u2014mail ce n'est pas une preuve de la non existence \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la saisie d'une rue qui pouvait ne pas exister lors de la confection du cadastre, mais qui pout bien avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement ouverte depuis. Dans tous les cas, c'est une preuve susceptible d'\u00eatre contredite par une autre preuve d'\u00e9gale force, et elle devait pour cette raison \u00eatre produite comme toute autre preuve en temps et lieu convenable devant la Cour do premi\u00e8re instance.\nCette Cour no peut donc prendre connaissance de cette preuve,\u2014elle doit d\u00e9cider ce point de la cause sur la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en cour do premi\u00e8re instance et sur laquelle la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e.\nLa preuve faite par l'acte do vente cite plus haut et par le t\u00e9moignage du D\u00e9fendeur, me para\u00eet suffisante pour prouver l'existence de la rue Robin. Ainsi, il est \u00e9tabli que deux formalit\u00e9s essentielles pour la validit\u00e9 de la saisie et des annonces ont \u00e9t\u00e9 omises savoir : celle de la mention du nom du village et celle du nom de la rue. Quoique la d\u00e9cision de l'Hon. Juge en chef, Sir A A. Dorion, ne repose, que sur la question de la banlieue, il a cependant exprim\u00e9 son opinion dans laquelle je concours pleinement, sur l'effet de l'omission de ces formalit\u00e9s. Je ne peux mieux faire que de la citer textuellement :\nL'article 638 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure veut que la saisie des immeubles soit constat\u00e9e par un proc\u00e8s-verbal qui doit contenir, entre autres choses : \" La description des immeubles saisie, en indiquant l la cite, ville, village, paroisse ou township, ainsi que la rue, le \" rang ou la concession o\u00f9 ils' sont situ\u00e9s, et le num\u00e9ro de l'immeuble, \" s'il existe un plan officiel de la localit\u00e9, sinon les tenants et aboutissants.\" Les plans officiels auxquels r\u00e9f\u00e8re cot article sont ceux mentionn\u00e9s dans l'article 2168 du Code Civil Il n'y en a pas d'autres qui soient reconnus comme tels et quoique Ce dernier article porte que lorsque ces plans auront \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et qu'avis en aura \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, le num\u00e9ro de chaque lot indique \u00e0 ces plans et au livre de renvoi correspondant, sera Ia vraie description de ce lot et suffira dans tout document quelconque, cela ne peut s'appliquer que lorsque la loi n'exige pas d'une mani\u00e8re expresse uno plus ample d\u00e9signation.\nLe Code de Proc\u00e9dure, qui n'est devenu en force qu'apr\u00e8s le Code Civil, a d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 1 article 2168, en exigeant quo le proc\u00e8s-verbal do saisie et les annonces du sh\u00e9rif indiquent le nom des rues o\u00f9 sont situ\u00e9s los immeubles saisis et le num\u00e9ro du plan officiel ou los tenants et aboutissants, s'il n'y a pas do plan officiel. Il semble donne qu'il no suffit pas do donner le num\u00e9ro seul du plan officiel, il y a d'excellentes raisons pour cola. Ce que la loi veut c'est quo les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s soient inform\u00e9s que los immeubles sur lesquels ils ont des droits ou des r\u00e9clamations out \u00e9t\u00e9 saisis et doivent \u00eatre vendus par le sh\u00e9rif. La d\u00e9signation par le num\u00e9ro do l'immeuble, qui dans un contrat de vente ou d'\u00e9change serait suffisante, parce quo los parties connaissent ce qui fait l'objet do leur transaction, no l'est pas toujours pour porter a la connaissance des tiers la situation exacte d'immeubles saisis. C'est, sans doute, pour cola, quo le Code do Proc\u00e9dure Civile exige que l'on donne le rang ou la rue o\u00f9 est situ\u00e9 l'immeuble saisi, outre son num\u00e9ro, qui n'est l\u00e0 quo pour remplacer les tenants et aboutissants, qui sont encore requis lorsqu'il n'y a, pas de plan officiel.\nPour ces motifs je suis d'opinion que le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurred.\nSTRONG, J. :\u2014\nI concur in the judgment of my brother Fournier, and also in that of my brother Taschereau, so far as it holds the Sheriffs sale void for the insufficiency of the advertisement; but I cannot agree that the sale is null on the ground of fraud and artifice.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThe sale of the lands in question in this case is contested, and sought to be set aside by the opposants on several grounds.\nlst,\u2014that the sale should have taken place at the door of the Chapel of the Parish of L\u2019Enfant J\u00e9sus, and not at the Sheriff's office in the city of Montreal. 2nd,\u2014that the sale en bloc of four separate and distinct houses, although one tenement, was illegal under art. 6377 C. C. P. 3nd,\u2014that in the notice of sale the description of the property seized did not indicate the street, range, concession, or parish, where the lots were alleged to be situated, as required by art. 638, sec. 3, C. C. P.\nAfter what has already been said by my learned brother Fournier, and the views I entertain as to the third objection, I do not consider it necessary to refer particularly to the two preceding ones.\nIn reference to the first I may say, however, that although the existence of the banlieue may have been sufficiently shewn, it may be, that when the parish before mentioned was established, any portion of the banlieue included within the boundaries of the parish would be effectually separated from the city of Montreal for all purposes. In that case the sale, I think, should have taken place at the chapel door of the parish. As I did not intend to found my judgment on either that point or on the second objection, I do not consider it necessary to decide it. The Legislature having, since the proceedings herein were commenced, validated all such sales except those then in litigation our judgment on the point is not necessary.\nI think, however, the sale was irregular and void because of what I consider a defective notice. The terms of the Code seem to me to the last degree imperative. It requires that the street which the lands adjoin shall be designated in the notice, which was not done, and I think the evidence is sufficient to show the legal existence of the street upon the side of which the lots in question are situated. It was named long before the sale, and the name of it was indicated on a sign board stuck up on it.\nI therefore concur in the conclusion that the appeal herein should be dismissed and the judgment appealed from affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. :\u2014\nIn a case of Courte manche vs. Gauthier, the plaintiff, having obtained judgment against the defendant, seized the latter's immovable property, and caused it to be sold by the sheriff. The Montreal loan Company were the highest bidders at this sale, and the property was adjudged to them. A third party, Fauteux, who was a creditor of Gauthier, the defendant, and who had a mortgage on the immovable property so sold by the Sheriff, by an opposition demands that the said sale to the Montr\u00e9al Loan Company by the Sheriff be set aside and annulled, upon, amongst others, the following grounds :\u2014\n1st. Because this seizure in the said case and sale was of several lots en bloc, the opposant alleging that the selling en bloc constitutes fraud within the terms of Art 714 of the Code of Procedure, M because the property was adjudged to a Mr. Desjardins, who was the plaintiff's attorney at the sale and bought the said property for and in the name of the said Mont- real Loan Company, the said Desjardins having the said sale made en bloc, so as to get the property for the said company at a price far under its value, in consequence whereof the opposant, Fauteux, got nothing from the proceeds of the sale, and lost the amount of his mortgage. I will consider immediately this part of the case.\nThe Montreal Loan Company joined issue with the opposant and fyled pleas, equivalent to a general d\u00e9n\u00e9gation, to this ground of the opposition. Of the fact, that Desjardins was the bidder at the sheriff 's sale, and only substituted the Montreal Loan Company's name as adjudicataires after the sale, there seems to me to be ample proof in the record, though in the factum, the appellants, the said Montreal Loan Company not only deny it but state that the sheriff's proc\u00e8s-verbal of sale establishes the contrary. Now, this is an error. It appears by the minutes of the biddings at the sale returned by the Sheriff with his proc\u00e8s-verbal, that Desjardins bid twice in his own name and that it was only at the the last bid that he gave the company's name, whereupon the adjudication was made to the company. As to the fact that Desjardins was also the attorney of the plaintiff in the case, it is established by the sheriff's officer who made the sale So much for these two facts.\nI will now consider the points raised by the appellants on this ground of the opposition. They contend, first that the respondent should have fyled an opposition to stop the sale, and that they cannot be allowed now to ask that the sale be set aside for the reasons by him given. Well it must be remarked, that here the respondent attacks the sale, because the sale itself was irregularly made en bloc. Now, could he, before the sale, complain of the sale itself and of the manner in which it was made? How could he know before the sale that each lot would not be put up separately? Though the seizure had been made en bloc could not the Sheriff put up each lot separately? Then, though the judgment debtor himself is deemed to have acquiesced in the proceedings, if he did not complain by an opposition before the sale within the delay fixed by law this does not apply to third persons, who were not parties to the record; and not a single authority has been cited at the hearing applying to third parties the rule which binds the judgment debtor in such a case.\nThe appellants further contend, and this seems to be the ground upon which they insist the most, that this property could not be sold separately, because it was an undivided building. They have examined three witnesses as to this fact, Rielle, Decary and B\u00e9lair, whilst the respondent has also brought three, Gauthier, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux and Trudelle. A careful perusal of the evidence on this point has left no doubt whatever in my mind that the defendant's property consisted of four houses built on four separate official lots. Gauthier the defendant, who built them, says so positively, G\u00e9n\u00e9reux, a contractor and inspector of buildings, who specially inspected this property for another Loan Company, says,that these houses were built to be separate houses, that each house was forty feet and corresponded with each of the lots, which by the deed of sale are forty feet each. Trudelle, another inspector of buildings, and who also examined this property for a loan company, swears positively that these houses could be sold separately. So much for the respondents witnesses.\nNow when I come to the appellants witnesses, I see that Rielle, a provincial land surveyor, thinks that this block was to form only one building, but he is contradicted here by the man who built it, and being cross-examined, to the question, \"Were these houses built to be sold separately, \" so that each purchaser knew what he was buying?\" he answers, \"'It is possible.\" This witness corroborates, in fact, the respondent's proof. Decary gives a description of the property when the houses were building, and were in an unfinished state, and does not think that they were to be sold separately, yet, he cannot swear that such a sale was impossible. And Belair, the appellants third witness as to this fact on cross-examination, positively says that it would have been easier to sell this property, house by house, contradicting all that he had said before on the subject. When I take into consideration, that one of the respondent's witnesses to establish that there were four separate houses on four different lots is the man himself who built them and that the two others are inspectors of buildings, who, as such, examined this property for loan companies, and when I consider that these last three witnesses gave such positive, clear and logical testimony, and are unconstructed to any extent I am bound to place full reliance on it.\nNow, as to the facts upon which the respondent relies to urge that this selling en bloc was a fraud or artifice employed, with the knowledge of the purchaser, to keep persons from bidding ([8]), they are briefly as follows. It is established and to my mind conclusively proved : 1st. That Desjardins was the attorney of the plaintiff, who had the property sold and seized. 2nd. That he bought the property for the appellants, the Montreal Loan Company, at the Sheriff's sale, and that the said company were not creditors of the defendant, and had no mortgage or interest on the said property. 3rd. That a few minutes before this sale the defendant asked that his property should be put up and sold lot by lot, separately, and not en bloc, 4th. That Desjardins who was there, as was then supposed, as the plaintiff's attorney, and to direct and watch the proceedings as such, positively refused this demand of the defendant, and ordered the Sheriff's officer to make the sale en bloc, which was so done. 5th. That this property was then sold to the Montreal Loan Company, the same Desjardins bidding for them, for the sum of four hundred and fifty dollars. 6th. That these lots, with the buildings thereon were worth from four to six thousand dollars. 7th. That had each lot with each house thereon, been put up separately, they would have been certainly sold at a higher figure.\nNow what it the 'reasonable inference from these facts? To me it seems clear that, if this property worth at least four thousand dollars, was bought by the appellants for four hundred and fifty dollars, it is by the contrivance and device of Desjardins, their agent, and whose acts are their acts, in having this property sold in one lot, and so keeping from bidding other parties who, however desirous they may have been of buying one house and one lot, would not and could not think of buying four houses and four lots I say, then, to use the terms of art. 714 of the Code of Civil Procedure that at this sale, with the knowledge of the purchasers, or of their agent, fraud and artifice were employed to keep persons from bidding, and that such being the case, the respondents, being creditors and interested persons, are entitled to have the said sale vacated. Such being the conclusion I have come to upon this ground of the opposition, I might perhaps refrain from going into the other parts of the case, since, whatever views I may take upon them, it cannot affect the result that the appeal must be dismissed in my opinion. I will, however, say a few words about the ground taken by the respondent in his opposition, as to the insufficiency of the Sheriff\u2019s description of the property to be sold, in not indicating the street on which the property was situated. On this, Art. 638 of the Code of Procedure is positive. The seizure of. immovables is recorded by minutes which must contain * * * a description of the immovables seized, indicating the city, town, village, parish or township, as well as the street, range or concession in which they are situated. In the case submitted, the street, range, or concession is not given. That there is a street seems to be denied by the appellants, but I find ample evidence of it. 1st. In the deed of sale to the defendant of this property, where the property is sold as situated on Robin street. 2nd. In the deposition of Gauthier, who swears that it is situated on Robin street that this street is known as Robin street and is so marked as streets are usually marked. Now in the absence of contrary evidence, this seems to me to establish clearly that such property is situated on Robin street. And not a tittle of evidence to the contrary is to be found in the record. At the hearing before this court the appellants have fyled certain plans in which they desire us to find the proof, either that no Robin street exists, or that this property is not situated on Robin street. Surely no additional proof can be made before this court. This evidence was not given before the lower court and it therefore cannot be received here, in my opinion, and I cannot look at it. The appellants have also denied the respondents' right in law, to invoke now such a ground of nullity against the sale. I can only repeat here what I have said on the same objection, when taken to the ground of the seizure en bloc. It is the judgment debtor which the cases cited have held to be bound to invoke such nullities by opposition afin d'annuler before the sale, not third parties out of the record. These third parties are not bound to act till they are aggrieved; even if they are aware, before the sale, of such grounds of nullity, they are not obliged then to invoke them. It may be, that the sale will bring a sum sufficient to satisfy their claim, and they can wait till such sale takes place. It is quite time enough for them to move, when they find that they suffer. The law would be hard if it obliged them to do so, when they cannot tell whether their interests will be affected or not by the result of the sale. I even doubt if they could stop the sale by an opposition afin d'annuler upon such a ground. Art. 657 grants them that right if they have an actual interest in the seizure and sale. How can they be said to have an actual interest, before they are aggrieved? It is true that in Berthelet vs. Guy ([9]) third parties seem to have been allowed to fyle such an opposition but I remark that they were cessionnaires of the defendant, also that this point of law was not raised, and moreover, by the judgment of the Superior Court, that they specially alleged that the property, in which they were interested, would bring a higher price, if the irregularities they complained of were remedied. I may also state that in the Province Quebec oppositions afin d'annuler, for informalities in the seizure, by any other than the party whose property has been seized are not often met with. However it is unnecessary for me here to decide whether third parties interested have the right to fyle such oppositions upon such grounds. All that I say is, that they are not bound to do so to protect their rights, that they may wait till the sale, and then ask its nullity if they suffer from it.\nIs this a fatal irregularity y is the next question. I hold that it is so. The minutes of the seizure of an immovable property must contain the description of such property as indicated and ordered by art. 638 of the Code of Procedure, which is imperative in its terms. Sheriffs are bound to follow strictly the formalities required for the seizure and sale of property, and the court cannot sanction a relaxation of the stringent rules laid down by the law in such matters. If in one case the omission of the street was declared to be of no consequence, there is not one of the details required by art. 688 which could not be so declared, upon such a precedent. Sales by which the rights of third parties are swept away must be made in that way, and in that way alone in which the law has ordered them to be made. Upon this principle the tribunals of the Province of Quebec constantly maintain opposition\u2019s afin d'annuler by defendants, based upon the want of some of the formalities required by the said article 638. The nullities that a defendant can invoke by an opposition afin d'an-nuler, third parties interested can invoke by a demand en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret, and I think, in the present case that this point is well taken by the respondent in his opposition.\nThe judgment appealed from has annulled the Sheriff's sale and I am of opinion that the said judgment is right and that this appeal must be dismissed\nAnother reason urged by the respondent against this sale, and the only reason upon which the Court of Queen's Bench has vacated it is that the sale took place at the Sheriff's office instead of at the door of the parish church where the property lies. Since the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and in fact since the case was heard before us, the Quebec Legislature has passed a statute by which all doubts upon this question are removed, and all Sheriff's sales so made are declared good and valid. So, though pending cases are not affected by this statute, by a special provision thereof, I deem it unnecessary to consider a question upon which the conclusion I might arrive at could not affect my judgment in this case, and which is now of no public importance whatsoever.\nGWYNNE, J. :\nI had prepared a short judgment in this case, but having had the opportunity of considering the case in deliberation with my brother Taschereau, I adopt his judgment without reserve.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nAttorney for appellants : G.

The evidence is fully set out below.\nHeld,\u2014That there was no evidence to shew the land sold had been properly assessed, and, therefore, the sale of the land in question was invalid. [Strong and Gwynne, J.J., dissenting.] Per Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J.:\u2014Where it appears that no portion of the taxes have been overdue for the period prescribed by the statute under which the sale takes place, the sale is invalid, and the defect is not cured by section 155 of 32 Vic., ch. 36 O.\n[Strong, J., dissenting, holding that sec. 155 applied to a case where any taxes were in arrear at the date of the sale.]\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a decree of the Court of Chancery.\nThis suit was commenced by a Bill in the Court of Chancery, to restrain the defendants from trespassing upon the south half of Lot No. 15, in the 9th concession of Winchester, and to obtain possession of the lands, and asking for an account of the damages arising by the trespasses of defendants.\nThe defendants, other than McKay, the appellant, did not contest the respondent\u2019s claim. The appellant denied the respondent\u2019s title to the land, setting up that the tax sale of March, 1856, was Invalid, owing to five years arrears of taxes not being due when the sale took place, and claimed title thereto in himself by length of possession.\nThe following extract of p. 132, of Book \u201cB\u201d belonging to the office of the Treasurer of the united counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, was fyled in the case: The Treasurer in his evidence stated that these blanks indicated that no taxes were paid to him for these years, and that the south half of Lot 15, being charged for taxes for the years \u201946, \u201947, \u201948, \u201949 and \u201950, and for the years \u201952, \u201953, \u201954, the total sum amounting to \u00a32 6s. 11d., he returned it to the Sheriff to be sold, and sent his warrant, on 1st August, 1855, to the Sheriff, to realize taxes for these years.\nThe evidence referring to the manner in which the Treasurer\u2019s books were kept, and in explanation of the entries made in the book, is reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nThe case was heard before Proudfoot, V.C., at the Chancery Sittings at Kingston, in May, 1876, who pronounced a decree in favor of the defendant, and directed the plaintiff\u2019s bill to be dismissed.\nThis decree was re-heard at the instance of the plaintiff before the full Court, who reversed the decree of Proudfoot, V.C., Blake, V.C., delivering the judgment of the Court. The defendant thereupon appealed from the order and decree on re-hearing to the Court of Appeal in Ontario, when judgment was given affirming the decree of the Court of Chancery on re-hearing, and dismissing the appeal therefrom.\nThe principal question in dispute in the Courts below, as well as on this appeal, was the validity of the sale of the land in question for taxes, which took place on the 1st of March, 1856, through and under which the plaintiff claims title:\nMr. Leggo and Mr. Gormully for appellant:\nThe appellant contends that the sale of land for taxes which took place on the 1st March, 1856, through and under which respondent claims, is invalid. The first act of assessment was 59 Geo. 3. c. 7, and under that act wild unoccupied land, having no owner resident in the township, could not be assessed or sold. The Quarter Sessions evidently took no action to tax non-resident lands, for the simple reason that under Ss. 2, 3 and 7 they were compelled to raise all the money required from the property and persons mentioned in those sections; and therefore resort to the non-resident lands would be, not only useless, but wrong. This view of the statute is well and fully explained by Wilson, J., in Cotter v. Sutherland[2].\nThere can be no doubt that the treasurer taxed this land, without the slightest authority, the maximum of the taxation under the statute, which was one penny in the \u00a3. This tax is called the \u201cLand Tax.\u201d\nThe only statute under which this property could be taxed until 1850 was 59 Geo. III. c. 8 sec. 3, and that gave only a discretionary power to put a tax on wild lands, provided it did not exceed a certain sum. It is not pretended in this case that the Quarter Sessions ever moved in the matter. There is no evidence that they ever struck a rate in virtue of this statute, and if the rolls of the quarter sessions were never produced, it was no doubt because they did not move.\nThe only tax for which this property was liable was the \u201croad tax\u201d of one-eighth of a penny on every acre of wild land. This tax became a charge on the land by force of the statute and did not need the intervention of the Quarter Sessions or assessors.\nThere were, therefore, two taxes which the treasurer collected\u2014the \u201cland tax,\u201d which the appellant submits was an illegal one, and the \u201croad tax,\u201d which he concedes was properly leviable.\nThe \u00a31 0 3 appearing on the extract from the treasurer\u2019s book, as forming part of the sum of \u00a32 6 11, for which the property was sold, is made up of this illegal \u201cland tax\u201d of one penny in the \u00a3, and of the legal and valid \u201croad tax\u201d of one-eighth of a penny per acre.\nThe entry in 1850 column is as follows: But there is no evidence what the taxes were for that year, nor explanation given. Then, what right had the assessor to divide the lot and put against one-half the taxes which should have been put against the whole lot? It might perhaps be explained by the fact that in that year the whole system of taxation was revolutionized by the passing of the statute 18 and 14 Vic, c. 67, known as the \u201cAct of 1850.\u201d By this act the power of assessing was transferred to the municipal councils.\nThe first step under the new system was to ascertain the amount of arrearages due on each lot of land up to 1st January, 1851. Sec. 46 required the county treasurer to perform this duty,\u2014to certify the list and arrears to the municipal council:\u2014these were to be certified to the township clerk, who was directed to add the amount to the sums raised by By-Law under the new system and payable in 1851, which aggregate was to be collected with the taxes for that year. In column 1851 there is a blank.\nIt must be assumed that these officers performed their duties, and it follows that, if the taxes for the year 1851, imposed by the new authority of the county council, were actually collected, the sum of \u00a31 0s. 3d. was also collected. Now, how were these taxes to be collected, and to whom were they to be paid? Sec. 40 provides for this;\u2014it declares that \u201cit shall be the duty of the collector (not the treasurer of the county) to receive taxes upon the lands of non-residents, if tendered to him within the time of his collection.\u201d Sec. 41 provides that, on or before the 14th December of each year, each collector shall return his collector\u2019s roll to the treasurer of the township (not the county treasurer) and pay over the amount collected to him. Sec. 42 provides that if the collector cannot collect the taxes (in this case the taxes imposed by the county council for 1851, together with the \u00a31 0s. 3d.) he shall make a return to the township treasurer, and also to the county treasurer, shewing the reason why he cannot collect, by inserting in each case the words \u201cnon-resident,\u201d or \u201cno property,\u201d or \u201cno property to distrain,\u201d or as the case may be, and having done this under oath, he shall be credited with the amount, and \u201cthe account shall be sufficient authority to the county treasurer\u201d to sell the lands. Sec. 32 points out the mode of preparing the collector\u2019s rolls, and sec. 33 permits the county treasurer to receive, if so desired, the non-resident land tax; but it does not interfere with the duty of the collector to secure its payment under sec. 40. This clause is highly important.\nUnder this system the county treasurer must enter in his book the amounts reported to him by the collector as unpaid. If the collector had returned the taxes for the year as unpaid, we should have found an entry in that column, either of a sum composed of the \u00a31 0s. 3d. and the taxes imposed by the county council, or of the amount of taxes imposed by the council, without the addition of \u00a31 0s. 3d.; but in the absence of such an entry we are compelled to believe that the 1851 taxes were paid to the collector; and as we must assume that officer to have obeyed the positive injunctions of sec. 40, we must also assume that with this he collected the \u00a31 0s. 3d., and this is the necessary legal inference unless displaced by positive evidence to the contrary.\nThe result is, that on the 31st December, 1854, up to which date the taxes are computed for which the warrant for sale was issued, there were not five years\u2019 taxes in arrear. In fact, there were not five years in arrear, even adding 1851, and the default necessary to warrant a sale can not be made out without using part, at least, of the \u00a31 0s. 3d. for the purpose, and this, as has been seen, was doubtless paid along with the taxes of 1851.\nThe appellant further submits that the Assessment Act of 1859, 16 Vic., c, 182, is the only curative one on which the respondent can depend, all prior ones having been passed subsequent to this sale, and not being retrospective; and he submits that no sale is valid unless there be full five years\u2019 arrearages of taxes due before the issue of the Treasurer\u2019s warrant.\nNow, so far as the 155 sect. of the Assessment Act of 1869 affects this case, we must look upon that statute as an ex post facto legislation, and the Court should put the strictest possible construction on it, if we have proved that the land was not sold for the proper arrears of taxes. We contend this Act cannot make a sale valid which is invalid: see Hamilton v. Eggleton[3]. It does not validate anything but defects in conveyance, and no matters subsequent to the sale.\nThe learned counsel referred also to Proudfoot v. Austin[4]; Austin v. Armstrong[5]; Kempt v. Parkyn[6]; the cases collected in Mr. Harrison\u2019s Municipal Manual, Ed. of 1878, pages 682 et seq. and pages 716 and 717; and the remarks of Draper, C.J., in Payne v. Goodyear[7], on Cotter v. Sutherland[8].\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., and Mr. G.M. Macdonnell, for respondent:\nThere is nothing in the statute of 59 Geo. III, c. 7 to warrant appellant\u2019s contention that wild lands could not be assessed. A value is put on wild land for the purpose of taxation (sec. 2,) and by sec. 7 the quarter sessions to whom the assessment roll was sent determined the rate to be fixed, and the fact of their striking the rate affected the wild lands, as well as the lands of owners resident in the township; see also secs. 13, 14 and 15. Then, under the Act 59 Geo. III, c. 8 sec. 3, a positive definite tax was imposed upon all wild land for road purposes. We do not prove, it is true, any action of the quarter sessions, but the treasurer\u2019s evidence and book clearly shew that taxes had been imposed, and were in arrear for more than five years. The entries made in the book in 1850 and 1853, we contend, are evidence of the correctness of the arrears. It must be assumed the quarter sessions imposed the full rate and the treasurer, ascertaining the fact, made up the amount in accordance[9]. Then also, we have the fact that, in 1850, the statute required the treasurer to obtain from the best information he could get what the arrears were. He tells us what he did, made his enquires carefully and the \u00a31 0s. 3d. entered in the column of 1850 of his book is the result of his enquires.\nThe respondent contends further that, in order to support this decree, he is not compelled to prove that every part of this tax is due. If it is conceded the road tax was due, although the sum was small, the sale is valid, and it was for the appellant to show that it had been paid, which he has not done. But it is contended that this road tax also was paid, because the treasurer could not have left a blank in the column of 1851, if he had received the amount. Now, we have the evidence of Macdonnell, who says that the taxes due prior to 1850 should have been paid to him and that they were not paid.\nThe taxes of 1850 were no doubt paid for the whole lot by the resident on the north half of lot who was Alex. McDonald, and the arrears were not collected. But, as he was not a resident on the half lot in question, after that it was assessed as a non-resident. Then the sale of this land took place under 16 Vic., c. 182, sec. 55, which enacts that whenever a portion of tax is in arrear for five years a sale may be had; and sec. 62, whether the arrears are under this or prior Acts.\nThe respondent further relies on the fact, as stated by the Vice-Chancellor on the re-hearing, that sec 155 of 32 Vic., c. 36 seems plainly to apply, and thus the sale is validated. It is a limitation Act and its object is to quiet titles.\nWe say if any tax is due at all, the owner having three years to attack the sale, the title of the stranger who has paid the tax should be quieted after three years. The case of Jones v. Cowden[10] seems to have determined this point.\nThe respondent relied also upon the following authorities:\u2014Proudfoot v. Bush[11]; Bank of Toronto v. Fanning[12]; and Hall v. Hill[13].\nMr. Leggo in reply:\nThere is no section of 59 Geo. III, c. 7, which necessarily imposes a tax on non-resident wild lands. It was only in 1850 that these wild lands were taxed. There is no evidence that in 1850 the tax on the south half was paid. The collector must have found that there were arrears and he had no authority to receive the taxes for 1850 and leave the arrears unpaid. All he could do was to receive the amount charged on the assessment roll.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nIn this case there is, in my opinion, no sufficient evidence to shew the land sold was properly assessed, or, if assessed, that when sold there were any taxes in arrear; so that it is, in the view I take of the case, unnecessary to discuss what amount of arrearages should be shown, or what defects, substantial or formal, are covered by the 155th sec. of the 32 Vic., ch. 36.\nThe question of assessment and arrearages rests on the testimony of R. Macdonald, treasurer of the united counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, since the month of October 1846. It is as follows on these points:\u2014\nQ.\u2014How long have you been so [Treasurer]? A.\u2014Since the month of October, \u201946.\nQ.\u2014You have there with you the treasurer\u2019s book in which the arrears of taxes are entered.? A.\u2014Yes, in which arrears of taxes for a certain period.\nQ.\u2014From what dates? Turn to this particular lot, the south half of 15, in the 9th concession of Winchester. A.\u2014The lot in question is charged with taxes for the years\u2019 46, \u201947, \u201948, \u201949 and \u201950, and for the years \u201952, \u201953 and 54. The total sum of the taxes then amounted to two pounds six shillings and eleven pence (\u00a32 6s. 11d), for which I returned it to the Sheriff to be sold.\nQ.\u2014Have you your warrant? A.\u2014Yes. It is for arrears of taxes up to the 31st December, 1854. It gives the south half of 15, in the 9th concession of Winchester.\nQ.\u2014Have you the Sheriff\u2019s return? A.\u2014Yes. It says that the south half of 15, in the 9th concession of Winchester, was sold to Charles Rattery on the 1st March, 1856, (100 acres), for three pounds seven shillings and eight pence, including costs.\nQ.\u2014Was the land redeemed? A.\u2014No. [Mr. Macdonnell here placed treasurer\u2019s book before witness, referring to page where lot in question appears.]\nQ.\u2014What does that \u201cO\u201d and to \u201cD\u201d mean? A.\u2014By this letter \u201cO\u201d it made the land subject to be sold for taxe; \u201cP.S.H.\u201d shows that it was in the Sheriff\u2019s hands up to 1845, to be sold for taxes up to 1845.\nQ.\u2014So that the taxes for which it was sold were the taxes up to 1845? A.\u2014No, up to 1855.\nQ.\u2014The taxes for which it was sold commenced in 1846? A.\u2014Decidedly.\nQ.\u2014Then it was the taxes of 1854, going backwards. And what is this blank in 1851? A.\u2014That signifies that it was not returned; at all events it was not taxable by a certain return received from the township.\nQ.\u2014In other words, the taxes were paid? A.\u2014I do not know.\nQ.\u2014Would there be a blank there if the taxes were not paid? A.\u2014I think so.\nQ.\u2014Then the presumption is that they were paid to the township in 1851? A.\u2014Yes, for there is no charge for 1851.\nQ.\u2014There is none for 1845 or--------? A.\u2014That is the way we used to do the business; that is the system they followed, and I followed it up to 1850, when we got a new set of books.\nQ.\u2014You cannot swear that the taxes for \u201947, \u201948, and \u201949 were unpaid, at least from any information you get from these books? A.\u2014 The time is so far back that I cannot swear from perfect memory. I say that the system that would be followed when the assessment roll would be sent to us, and we had to examine it, and any lots that we would find upon the assessment roll they were supposed to be put upon the collector\u2019s roll, and collected in that roll. A lot that we would find upon the assessment roll we would charge the taxes against it by leaving it blank.\nQ.\u2014Can you say, from the mode that you adopted, that the taxes for \u201946, \u201947, \u201948, and \u201949 were not paid from the entries in the book? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You say from looking at the book. Now the book shews blanks in these years. Will you be kind enough to tell me how it is from these blanks that the taxes were not paid? A.\u2014Now, here is a lot (referring to another) that was found on the assessment roll when it came to our office, and the letter \u201cA\u201d was put after the year, signifying that it was assessed and put upon the collector\u2019s roll and assessed for the township, but when we found it was not on the assessment roll we left it a blank until the taxes were paid.\nBy Mr. MAGUIRE:\u2014\nQ.\u2014So far as you know, in those years the lot was not assessed? A.\u2014I think not\u2014that is, so far as I know.\nBy HIS LORDSHIP:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Do you say it was assessed or was not assessed? A.\u2014I think it was not assessed. If it was assessed and could be found on the assessment roll the lot would be credited with the taxes in that way.\nQ.\u2014Then if it was never assessed for these years there could be no arrears? A.\u2014Well, I think the statute provided\u2014it was assessed according to a certain scale.\nQ.\u2014You told Mr. Maguire just now that it was not assessed for these years. Can you tell from your books whether the property was assessed? A.\u2014I cannot tell, but I see here, from the system carried out then, I think they did not assess it for these years, because it was one of those lots that were considered to be wild lots, unoccupied, and nothing upon them.\nQ.\u2014Wild lands were assessed in a certain way. A.\u2014An act that was passed in \u201919 or \u201920 directed the way in which taxes could be raised on wild lands, and it was according to that scale that the system was carried out that I understood.\nBy Mr. MACDONNELL:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Supposing it was assessed, you do not know of your own knowledge that it was not assessed? A.\u2014That blank is to be taken as they were not paid. There was a new system adopted in \u201949 or there abouts. When I was treasurer I got very little assistance from my predecessor by way of opinion, but to inform myself went to Brockville and saw Mr. Buell, who was then treasurer, and he gave me that schedule to point out the system they followed in their county.\nQ.\u2014Then it could not be sold for less than eight years? A.\u2014No.\nQ. How did you return this to the sheriff as being for sale unless you were certain of these taxes being in arrears? You required all the years from \u201946 to be in arrears in order to justify the sale? A.\u2014We were instructed to make out schedule of all lots in arrears up to, that would be up to the year \u201950, including \u201950, as far as I can remember, and to send the schedule to municipalities so that the officers there would examine it and compare it with their own documents; and any lot that they would say was wrongly charged or ought not to be charged on they erased the return, sending the lots they themselves considered should have been in arrears, and upon that schedule we acted, and this lot here I am convinced they returned as in arrears on that schedule.\nQ.\u2014It is very likely that schedule is in your office? A.\u2014It is very likely it is.\nQ.\u2014Was the land in question assessed during the years \u201946 to \u201950? Can you say from your books that the land was assessed? A.\u2014From the books I can say that the lands were in some arrears for these years. I say so from my books; I may be in error in that; I cannot say positively, but my impression is, whichever way I may be understood\u2014my impression is that that lot has been in arrears for these years, and to strengthen me in that opinion this was examined by my auditors and marked as approved of.\nBy HIS LORDSHIP:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You returned this lot to the sheriff as in arrears for these years? A.\u2014Yes, returned it to the sheriff, and sent my warrant to the sheriff to realize taxes for these years. Q.\u2014You must then have been under the impression that the taxes were in arrears? A.\u2014Certainly I was.\nCross-examined by Mr. MAGUIRE:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You said something about that Schedule that had been returned to you, and based your impression that the taxes had not been paid, and I think had been in arrears, upon that Schedule received from the township? A.\u2014There was more reason than that. We were directed to return and make out a Schedule of all land in arrears in our office in each township, and I made out a scale of them, as appeared on the books of my office, and sent them to the township municipalities, so that officers there, who were supposed to have more local knowledge about matters in their own municipalities than we\u2014so that they would examine the Schedule, and if they would find that any lot was wrongly charged or in arrears, to correct the error; and if they found any lot against which charges had been made, if they found that they ought not to be charged with the taxes, they left it out altogether, and they corrected my own lots.\nQ.\u2014And this Schedule came back to you and and remained a record in your office? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014I suppose that the Schedule that contained particulars in regard to these lands is there now? A.\u2014It ought to be.\nBy Mr. MACDONNELL:\u2014\nQ.\u2014In regard to those years in which the entries appear blank, supposing the taxes for these years had been paid, what would the entry in your book be for the years \u201946, \u201947, \u201948 and \u201949? Supposing they had been paid in any way, what entry would appear in your books? A.\u2014Well, the book in which I enter items received for the lots is in my office; any taxes that have been paid to me as treasurer by any one, I have put down in the book in my office.\nQ.\u2014Would you have made any entries in this book of the payments? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Now if payments had been made you, the entries would have been in another book in your office? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Have you examined that book? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014You have not ascertained in that book whether any payments have been made? A.\u2014No, but I feel pretty sure that no payments have been made to me, otherwise the land would not have been returned to the Sheriff. Before I would make out the warrant I would be satisfied.\nI think this evidence quite too loose and unsatisfactory to justify the conclusion that five years taxes were duly assessed against this land, and that five years\u2019 or any number of years\u2019 taxes were in arrear at the time the sale took place. With respect to the particulars not helped by the act, they should, in my opinion, be made out beyond all reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the court, before any man\u2019s property should be taken from him by a forced sale such as this; and with respect to all such particulars, the party seeking to dispossess an owner by proceedings to which he is no party should, in the absence of any statutory enactment relieving him from the burthen, be prepared to show very clearly and conclusively, that all the requirements of the statute under which the land has been sold have been strictly complied with, and nothing left to mere theory or conjecture; and as in a case of this kind the records of the county or assessed district, or the officers or books of the officers of the county, or district, ought to furnish conclusive testimony as to all these particulars, I do not think these means of information should be ignored, as it appears to me they have been in this case, and the court be called upon to take this defendant\u2019s property from him on evidence so vague and unsatisfactory and inconclusive as has been offered to establish the assessment and arrears in this case. We must, I think, have better evidence, than the mere suppositions, understandings or impressions of the treasurer, or his merely \u201cfeeling pretty sure\u201d that no payments had been made to him, (for this is the exact character of his language and of his evidence on most material particulars), without the production of the schedule, which this witness says came back to him and remained a record in his office, and which contained the particulars in regard to these lands, and which the witness says ought now to be in his office, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary must be presumed to be there, but which he says he was not even subp\u0153naed to produce, and without production, or even examination, of the books in his office, in which entries, he says, would have been made if payments had been made.\nAnd as to the entries in the book produced, which, with reference to this \u00bd lot are as follows:\u2014\nI have been, and am, wholly unable to understand them, or to draw from them any intelligent conclusion as to whether taxes were in arrear or not, nor have I been in the least aided by the evidence of the treasurer; for in answer to a most pertinent question, viz.:\u2014\u201cYou cannot swear that the taxes for \u201947, \u201948, \u201949 were unpaid, at least from any information you get from these books?\u201d\u2014to this very plain and intelligent question we have this very unsatisfactory answer: \u201cThe time is so far back that I cannot swear from perfect memory\u201d\u2014with this, if not incoherent, certainly to me unintelligible addition: \u201cI say that the system that would be followed when the assessment roll would be sent to us, and we had to examine it, and any lots that we would find upon the assessment roll they were supposed to be put upon the collector\u2019s roll, and collected in that roll. A lot that we would find upon the assessment roll we would charge the taxes against by leaving it blank.\u201d\nAs I must assume the assessment and arrearages could have been made clear by reference to the official documents and records, I cannot feel myself justified in taking away this man\u2019s land on such unsatisfactory and inconclusive testimony.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court below reversed, with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, and on re-hearing, and the judgment of Proudfoot, V.C., dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill, confirmed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWas of opinion that sec. 155 of the Assessment Act of 32 Vic, ch. 36, applied to a case where any taxes were in arrear at the date of the sale. In other respects he concurred in the judgment of Gwynne, J.\nFOURNIER J:\u2014\nDans cette cause il s\u2019agit de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la vente de la moiti\u00e9 sud du lot No. 15, 9me concession du township de Winchester, faite par le sh\u00e9rif des comt\u00e9s-unis de Stormont, Dundas et Glengarry le 1er Mars 1856, pour arr\u00e9rages de taxes dues sur ce lot, depuis au\u2011del\u00e0 de cinq ans, avant le 1er D\u00e9cembre 1854.\nPour qu\u2019une telle vente puisse \u00eatre valablement faite, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9cisions des cours d\u2019Ontario, qui ont fix\u00e9 la jurisprudence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il est n\u00e9cessaire de prouver que, au moins une partie des arr\u00e9rages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s est due depuis au-del\u00e0 de cinq ans avant la vente. Le titre du sh\u00e9rif ne suffit pas pour prouver la vente ni l\u2019existence de taxes dues, condition essentielle du droit de vendre[14].\nLa principale, ou pour mieux dire, la seule difficult\u00e9 en cette cause, est de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 (demandeur) a fait cette preuve, sans laquelle il est admis que le titre produit ne lui serait d\u2019aucun service. Le warrant adress\u00e9 par le tr\u00e9sorier des susdits comt\u00e9s-unis autorisant, entre autres, la vente du lot en question en cette cause, ainsi que le titre du sh\u00e9rif, d\u00e9clare que cette vente devait se faire pour des arr\u00e9rages de taxes dues depuis au-del\u00e0 de cinq ans avant le 1er D\u00e9cembre 1854.\nLa premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, est sans doute, l\u2019existence d\u2019une taxe l\u00e9galement impos\u00e9e, ou par la loi m\u00eame, ou par une autre autorit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle ce pouvoir a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9. Pour faire cette preuve il faut, ou citer le texte de loi imposant la taxe dont il s\u2019agit, ou produire les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ou r\u00e9gl\u00e9ments de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 municipale par laquelle cette taxe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e plus haut, c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cette preuve. Pour s\u2019assurer s\u2019il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 cette condition, il faut d\u2019abord r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la loi en force \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la taxe en question est devenue due.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tat produit par le tr\u00e9sorier, M. McDonald, cette taxe para\u00eet \u00eatre due pour les ann\u00e9es 1852-3 et 4. Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1850, il y a l\u2019entr\u00e9e suivante: Pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1851, il n\u2019y a aucune entr\u00e9e, ce qui signifie, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du tr\u00e9sorier, qu\u2019il n\u2019est rien d\u00fb pour cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0. A moins de supposer qu\u2019une moiti\u00e9 des 4017 port\u00e9s pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1850, ne doive \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 sud du No. 15 pour les ann\u00e9es 1846, 7, 8 et 9, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu, lors de la vente, d\u2019arr\u00e9rages dus pendant le temps requis pour avoir droit de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette vente. Mais sur quoi s\u2019est-on appuy\u00e9 pour fixer le montant de 4017; comment et pour quelle raison est-il ainsi charg\u00e9 au compte du lot No. 15, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas facile de comprendre d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait cependant pas difficile de prouver ce fait par des documents \u00e9crits, soit par les listes de cotisations, les rapports des collecteurs, des tr\u00e9soriers, ou par les livres que ces derniers sont oblig\u00e9s de tenir d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, lesquels livres sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s faire preuve prim\u00e2 facie. Ayant n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de faire cette preuve, et comprenant la faiblesse de sa cause, quant aux arr\u00e9rages des ann\u00e9es 1852, 3 et 4, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il n\u2019insiste pas sur ce point et se retranche dans une autre position. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, dit-il, qu\u2019il y ait cinq ann\u00e9es enti\u00e8res d\u2019arr\u00e9rages dus, il suffit qu\u2019il y en ait une certaine partie due depuis au-del\u00e0 de cinq ans pour que la vente soit l\u00e9gale. Laissant alors de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les arr\u00e9rages pour les ann\u00e9es 1852, 3 et 4, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que le lot en question \u00e9tait par la simple op\u00e9ration de la loi, sans proc\u00e9d\u00e9 quelconque, sujet \u00e0 une taxe de \u215b de penny par acre, impos\u00e9e par sec. 3 de 59 Geo. 3 ch. 8. C\u2019est en s\u2019appuyant sur cette section que l\u2019intim\u00e9 essaie de prouver qu\u2019une partie de la taxe \u00e9tait due depuis au-del\u00e0 de cinq ans.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le statut en question les taxes sont impos\u00e9es comme suit: 1o. Toute personne dont le nom est ins\u00e9r\u00e9 sur la liste de cotisation d\u2019un township, sera, en proportion de la valeur de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s r\u00e9elles ou personnelles, assuj\u00e9tie \u00e0 travailler sur le chemin tous les ans. Le nombre de jours est ensuite d\u00e9termin\u00e9 dans une certaine proportion d\u2019apr\u00e8s la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La section 3 d\u00e9clare que toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 cotisable qui, pour une raison ou pour une autre, ne se trouve pas comprise dans la liste de cotisation, sera n\u00e9anmoins cotis\u00e9e annuellement \u00e0 raison de \u215b de penny par acre, pour \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 par le collecteur de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les autres taxes.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s cette disposition un lot inoccup\u00e9, mais cotisable, ne pouvait \u00eatre sujet \u00e0 cette taxe de \u215b de penny, (road tax), que dans le cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas compris dans la liste de cotisation, et que son propri\u00e9taire, s\u2019il \u00e9tait un non-r\u00e9sidant, naurait pas demand\u00e9 de l\u2019y faire ins\u00e9rer. Dans le cas o\u00f9 il faisait une telle demande il devenait exempt de la taxe, et sujet alors \u00e0 fournir un nombre de journ\u00e9es de travail ou leur \u00e9quivalant d\u2019apr\u00e8s la valeur cotis\u00e9e de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEn r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la sec. 2 du ch. 7, 59 Geo. 3, on voit que le lot dont il s\u2019agit \u00e9tait cotisable; cette section d\u00e9clare que les terres incultes, (uncultivated lands) seront cotisables, et pour les fins de l\u2019imposition de la taxe, la valeur en est fix\u00e9e uniform\u00e9ment \u00e0 4s. par acre. Toutes ces terres sont trait\u00e9es de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, soit qu\u2019elles appartiennent \u00e0 des r\u00e9sidants ou \u00e0 des non-r\u00e9sidants.\nLa section 3 oblige les propri\u00e9taires \u00e0 donner aux cotiseurs une liste de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s cotisables; la 4\u00e8me d\u00e9clare cotisables les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s tenues en fee simple, ou en vertu d\u2019une promesse de fee simple obtenue en la mani\u00e8re y sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e. Le lot 15 dont il s\u2019agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis de la Couronne par Chloe Froom et patent\u00e9 le 6 Juillet 1807.\nLors de la confection du r\u00f4le de cotisation son propri\u00e9taire pouvait donc le porter dans la liste de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019il devait donner aux cotiseurs pour \u00eatre ins\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le r\u00f4le de cotisation. Dans ce cas le propri\u00e9taire devenait sujet pour ce lot, comme pour ses autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, \u00e0 fournir une certaine quantit\u00e9 de journ\u00e9es de travail pour les chemins, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre soumis comme dans le cas o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait omis du r\u00f4le, \u00e0 la taxe de \u215b de penny par acre. Ce n\u2019est que dans ce dernier cas que cette taxe peut affecter le propri\u00e9taire. Elle ne peut exister de plein droit comme on l\u2019a dit. La loi n\u2019a d\u2019effet et d\u2019application, que si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est omise du r\u00f4le, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la confection d\u2019un r\u00f4le, constatant ce fait, que la taxe peut affecter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 omise. Puisque cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pouvait y \u00eatre l\u00e9galement port\u00e9e, on ne peut conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la taxe de \u215b de penny, qu\u2019en supposant qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 omise du r\u00f4le. Quelle raison nous oblige de recourir \u00e0 une telle supposition. Serait-il juste d\u2019adopter un semblable raisonnement lorsque la production du r\u00f4le, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait si facile de faire, e\u00fbt \u00e9tabli d\u2019une mani\u00e8re positive la v\u00e9ritable position? Oblig\u00e9 de faire preuve de l\u2019existence de cette taxe, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait la faire l\u00e9galement par la production du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, ou celle des livres officiels du tr\u00e9sorier, qui eussent fait preuve prim\u00e2 facie de l\u2019existence des taxes dues. Ilme semble que dans le cas actuel, cette preuve devait \u00eatre faite de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le tr\u00e9sorier du township ou du comt\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de la faire devant une cour, dans une action pour faire condamner un propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 payer ses arr\u00e9rages de taxe. Aurait-il pu obtenir un jugement sans produire le r\u00f4le de cotisation? Certainement non. Dans le cas actuel il aurait fallu \u00e9galement, pour prouver que le lot en question \u00e9tait, par son omission du r\u00f4le, soumis \u00e0 la taxe de \u215b de penny, produire le r\u00f4le m\u00eame. En l\u2019absence de cette preuve, un propri\u00e9taire qui en \u00e9tait exempt\u00e9 par l\u2019entr\u00e9e de son lot sur le r\u00f4le de cotisation, aurait pu \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer double taxe. Il n\u2019y en a pas deux qui soient exigibles pour les chemins, l\u2019une payable en journ\u00e9es de travail, et l\u2019autre en argent, \u215b de penny par acre. L\u2019une des deux seulement est due sur le m\u00eame lot et il fallait faire voir laquelle des deux est l\u00e9galment due. Cela ne pouvait \u00eatre fait que par la production du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation et des livres du tr\u00e9sorier qu\u2019il \u00e9tait si facile de faire.\nLe tr\u00e9sorier R. McDonald n\u2019a parl\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que du paiement, et non pas du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation. Quant au paiement son t\u00e9moignage est loin d\u2019\u00eatre suffisant. Il dit que le montant des arr\u00e9rages de taxe a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par une c\u00e9dule contenant toutes les terres de chaque township en arr\u00e9rages dans son bureau, laquelle c\u00e9dule fut envoy\u00e9e pour correction dans les municipalit\u00e9s du township, et renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 son bureau pour y demeurer de record. Il ne produit pas ce document, dont par cons\u00e9quent il n\u2019est pas possible de conna\u00eetre la valeur l\u00e9gale. Au sujet du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation il n\u2019est fait aucune question. Interrog\u00e9 pour savoir quelle serait l\u2019entr\u00e9e dans son livre pour les ann\u00e9es 46, 7, 8 et 9, en supposant que la taxe de ces ann\u00e9es eut \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, il r\u00e9pond que le livre dans lequel il fait ces entr\u00e9es est dans son bureau.\nCe n\u2019\u00e9tait pas son impression qu\u2019il devait donner en t\u00e9moignage mais les documents dont il fait mention. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit s\u2019imputer la n\u00e9gligence de ne pas en avoir exig\u00e9 la production, et si sa preuve est trouv\u00e9e insuffisante, c\u2019est \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019il doit s\u2019en prendre.\nLe d\u00e9faut de production de la c\u00e9dule en question, des livres du tr\u00e9sorier, et plus que tout cela, le d\u00e9faut de production du r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, rend insufflante la preuve faite de l\u2019existence d\u2019une quotit\u00e9 quelconque de taxes dues avant la vente.\nCette vente est encore nulle pour la raison que le statut oblige le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier \u00e0 faire dans son warrant adress\u00e9 au sh\u00e9rif, la distinction entre les les terres tenues en vertu d\u2019une patente de la Couronne de celles qui ne sont qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de bail ou permis d\u2019occupation, et dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (fee) demeure \u00e0 la Couronne. Le sh\u00e9rif est \u00e9galement oblig\u00e9 de faire cette distinction dans les annonces de vente. Ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre de ces deux officiers ne s\u2019est, dans le cas actuel, conform\u00e9 \u00e0 cette disposition de la loi, qui, pour l\u2019omission de cette formalit\u00e9, impose la peine de nullit\u00e9. Ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Hamilton vs. Egleton[15].\nPour faire \u00e0 cette vente l\u2019application de la section 155, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00fb des arr\u00e9rages de taxe au moment de la vente. C\u2019est la condition indispensable du droit de vendre, sans cela pas de vente l\u00e9gale. Enfin je concours dans l\u2019opinion de l\u2019Hon Juge Gwynne sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la 155me section Pour ces divers motifs, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre re\u00e7u et le d\u00e9cret du Vice-Chancelier confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe respondent filed a bill in Equity in the Province of Ontario against the appellant and two others, alleging, amongst other things, that he was the owner in fee of a certain lot of land in the Township of Winchester, and County of Dundas, known as the Southern half part of Lot Fifteen, in the Ninth Concession of that Township; that the appellant, for several years previous and up to the time of the filing of the bill, continually trespassed on that lot, by cutting down and removing timber and trees from the same, which he alleges to have been of the value of $1,500, and praying for an injunction against the appellant to restrain him from committing further trespasses thereon\u2014to be adjudged owner of the lot, and awarded damages for the alleged trespasses.\nThe appellant in his answer: 1st, denies that the respondent was seized in fee simple of the lands in question. 2nd, denies that the respondent had any title to the said lands. 3rd, alleges that he claims title by deed from one Uriah Manhart, in 1859, and that he and the said Uriah Manhart, and one Alexander W. Cornell, through whom Manhart claimed, had been in the exclusive possession of said lot from the year 1841. That Manhart went into and held possession from 1843 till he conveyed to the appellant, and that the latter has held possession under his deed in 1859, from that time till the filing of the bill 4th, He sets up the Statute of Limitations.\nThese are the main issues upon which the controversy rests.\nThe appellant under his deed from Manhart is enti- tled to set up a continued possession of twenty-three years, which I think is fully proved, and upon which he could successfully resist any claim made by the patentee, or those claiming through him\u2014they having been so long out of possession.\nThe respondent, however, claims title by several transfers, commencing with a deed from Charles Rattery, who, he alleges, purchased the lot at public auction from the Sheriff of the County, who, on the 1st March, 1856, sold it under a warrant for taxes said to be in arrear for five years previous to December, 1854, and who subsequently, on the 3rd May, 1857, made a deed to him. The question for our decision, appears to me, to be only as to the effect of that sale and deed.\nLeaving at present out of consideration the effect of section 155 of 32nd Victoria, in substance the same, as to this case, as sec. 156 of the Act of 1866, in relation to such sales and deeds, it becomes necessary to enquire what proof it would be incumbent on a party to adduce, to successfully maintain an action of ejectment. He should unequivocally in the first place show, by reasonably clear and legal evidence, that the taxes were imposed, either directly by force of some statute, or indirectly by the authorized acts of parties for that purpose duly appointed. In the next place the onus is upon him of showing some arrears for at least five years before the issuing of a warrant to sell land. The respondent contends that both municipal and statutory taxes for roads were in arrear for the required period. As to the first, I can see no satisfactory evidence that during the period in question any taxes upon the lot were assessed or imposed; and if not, could not be in arrear.\nIt is however claimed that, at all events, \u201cunder the Act 59 Geo. 3rd ch. 8 sec. 3, a positive definite tax was imposed upon all wild lands for road purposes.\u201d That Act provided for the amending and keeping in order of Public Highways and Roads.\nSection 2 enacted that * * * every person included or inserted upon the Assessment Roll of any Township, reputed Township, or place, should, in proportion to the estimate of his real and personal property stated on said Roll, be held liable to work on the highways and roads in each and every year. Then follows a scale apportioning the number of days work to be done, to the amount of each persons real and personal property.\nSection 3 enacts that \u201cevery lot or parcel of land in this Province, subject to be rated and assessed, but which, by reason of its remaining unoccupied, or for other cause, may not be included in the Assessment Roll * * * shall nevertheless be rated and assessed at one eighth of a penny per acre annually * * * to be levied by distress and sale in case of non-payment, in the same manner by collectors in the different districts respectively, as the other rates and assessments shall and may be levied and collected by virtue of the laws then in force for that purpose.\u201d\nBefore this section is applicable, three conditions must, by proof, precede any claim for taxation: 1st. That the land must be subject to be rated and assessed; 2nd. That it has not been included in the assessment roll; and 3rd. That the owner, if non-resident, did not request that he should be rated.\nSection 2 of the preceding chapter provides that uncultivated land shall be taxed, and that, for the purpose of taxation, it shall be rated at four shillings an acre as a valuation. It rates all lands alike, whether owned by residents or non-residents, excepting only from the operation of the Act crown property.\nSection 3 provides that assessors shall obtain from every ratable inhabitant a list of all their ratable per- sonal property and lands, of which they were required to make a true return each and every year.\nSection 4 provides \u201cthat all lands shall be considered as ratable property which are holden in fee simple, or promise of a fee simple, by Land Board certificate, Order of Council, or certificate of any Governor of Canada, or by lease.\u201d\nSection 12 requires the Surveyor General annually to furnish the Treasurer of each District with lists of granted and other lands.\nAnd section 13 provides, that all lands included in such lists of Schedules as granted or leased shall be subject to taxation.\nThus, then, the land in question was liable to be rated for municipal purposes, including the performance of statute labour, and if not included in the Assessment Roll of any year, but only in that event, became subject to the operation of sec. 3 of chapter 8, before recited.\nIt is argued that, because the land in question was what is called wild or uncultivated land, up to 1854, it could not be rated, but I have shewn that it was clearly ratable, if owned by a resident of the township. For all that appears from the evidence in this case it may have been rated in the assessment rolls for every one of the years in question, and if so, was unaffected by the provision in sec. 3 for the imposition of one eighth of a penny per acre. The respondent, I hold, was bound to show what would necessarily bring the land under the provisions of that section. The means, I presume, if it was not rated in the assessment rolls, were available by the production of the rolls, and no Court can be expected to presume it was not so rated when the law allowed it to be, if the owner were a resident one. Upon that point we have no evidence. Chloe Froom was the patentee, and the name is not mentioned or referred to in the evidence. Whether he, at the time of the trial, was alive or dead; or, if the latter, when he died, with or without issue; whether he, or his legal representatives, resided or not in the township when the alleged arrears occurred, or important parts of them\u2014the evidence does not state. I take it that the regular, and I think the only regular, mode of establishing the fact that the land in question was not rated in the assessment rolls, was by their production, if in existence, which we must presume in the absence of proof to the contrary. If lost or destroyed, secondary evidence of their contents might have been given, if available. Who can say from the evidence that those rolls would not show the land in question to have been rated; and if so, totally exempt from the imposition of the tax levied by sec. 3? The remainder from a particular quantity cannot be ascertained till the quantity to be deducted is given or ascertained.\nSo, in this case, no one could tell what lands were subject to the operation of sec. 3, till the contents of the rolls were known. In the absence then of the rolls, I think no evidence of a hearsay character can be allowed. In fact, as to the rolls in question, we have, in the evidence, not the slightest reference, and we are asked to decide as to their contents by intuition or by violent, rash and unreliable presumption, and, through them, turn a party out of property he has purchased and held so long. I cannot think that equity or justice would sustain our conclusion to do so. The respondent purchased, knowing, as he must have done, the possession and title of the appellant; and, as he himself says, as a speculation; the success in which must be by the deprivation of the long acquired rights and interests of the appellant. This he no doubt fully understood, and to secure that success we should not, under the circumstances unnecessarily contribute.\nTo sustain a rate under sec. 3, it was necessary to prove what the rolls contained, and that the land was not included therein. The evidence of the treasurer shows nothing on the point. It wholly refers to the question of payment, not to facts to show what is the important point, whether or not the rolls included the land in question. I have read over repeatedly and carefully the whole of the evidence, and can find no part of it relating to the contents of the rolls, in the absence of which it is a matter of impossibility for any one to say, whether or not the land in question was, during any one year, subject to the rate imposed by section 3. A party was not liable to perform statute labor under sec. 2 and to be taxed under section 3. The evidence does not enable us to decide under which section the land was liable, and we cannot resolve the doubt by a hap-hazard conclusion upon a point the respondent should have made clear, and in regard to which the evidence was at hand. In deciding such a point under the evidence, we would be as little certain of being right as would be a person called upon to say in which of two hands another had concealed a coin. In all cases the onus of making out a clear prima facie case is on the plaintiff, and in none is it more necessary than in ejectment,\u2014which this case substantially is,\u2014by which a party is turned out of his real estate. Every necessary link in the chain must be proved by the plaintiff, and if any one is left, by the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, in a state of doubt and difficulty, law and justice in every way call upon us to adjudge against him.\nUnder the statute all uncultivated lands of residents should, and no doubt in all cases would, be rated in the rolls of assessment; and, by another provision, the uncultivated lands of non\u2011residents would appear there also in the name of the owner, if he requested the assessor to rate them. In either case, the rolls would show the exact facts, and who can say that we have any evidence that in neither of the cases was the land in question rated or assessed in the assessment rolls. It may be objected, that such would be negative evidence, the onus of which was not on the respondent; but that objection is answered by sec. 3 being only operative in case the land is absent from the rolls, and that they, if produced, would show the true position. The tax of one-eighth of a penny was wholly conditional, and dependent on the absence of the land from the rolls, as otherwise a party might be taxed under both sections two and three, which was clearly not intended by the statute. From all that appears, the patentee, his heirs or devisees, may have, during the. years in question, been residents of the township, and not only included in the rolls for assessment, but have actually performed statute labor under section 2.\nThere is another position which is important for consideration. Sections 3, 4 and 8, show that it was the duty of the collectors to collect the taxes under section 3, and if paid to them, there could be no arrears. The taxes in question, as far as the evidence goes, may have been paid to the collectors. If they were alive and procurable they could, if so it was, negative the fact of payment, and, if dead, their returns under oath to the treasurer of the township would be evidence. Sec. 45 of 16 V. ch. 182 provides, that \u201cthe production of a copy of so much of the collectors roll as shall relate to the taxes so payable by such party, purporting to be certified by the clerk of the such city, town, township, or village shall be prima facie evidence of the debt.\u201d\nThe treasurer did not know except as to payments to himself; and although he says that the returns of the collectors and schedules are in his office, he does not even speak of any special knowledge he derived from them on that point, although, had he offered to do so, it would not be receivable evidence.\nThe Acts 59, Geo. 3rd, caps. 7 and 8 were repealed in 1850 by 13th and 14 Vic. chapter 66, which came into operation on the first day of January, 1851, and the provisions of section 3 of chap. 8, under which the tax of \u215b of a penny was imposed on all lands not included in the assessment rolls, have not since then been re-enacted. Sec. 3 cannot in any way affect the claim for arrears of taxes for 1851-52-53-54. We must see, therefore, even if there was shown to have been arrears for taxes for 5 years ending with and including 1850, under sec. 3 before mentioned, independently of the fatal objections I have already stated.\nSec. 46 of the Act 13th and 14th Vic. chap. 66 requires the county treasurers, before the 1st of January, 1851, to make out true lists of all arrears for taxes up to that date, including assessments for wild lands, with the names of the owners as far as known, and submit them to the county council, and the county clerk is required to certify to the clerk of the proper locality the said arrears, and provides they shall be added to the assessment roll for 1851, and collected in like manner. From the testimony of the county treasurer this was done, and the result would be the addition to the assessment in 1851 of all the arrears then certified to the township clerks, and the consequent power to collect all such arrears. When, then, the evidence shows no arrears for taxes in 1851, the reasonable presumption, in the absence of anything to the contrary, is that all arrears up to 1851 were collected by the collectors. Were it otherwise, the onus of shewing it was clearly on the respondent; and as the return of the collectors are pointed to in the act before mentioned as the satisfactory prima facie evidence on all such points, they should have been put in as the best, and indeed the only, reliable evidence. By section 14, ch. 7, of 59 Geo. 3rd., in force up to January 1851, the treasurer of each district was required to keep an account with every parish, town, township or place within his district, * * * in which account he shall particularly enumerate every lot or parcel of land in the said parish, &c. * * * and shall charge the same with or credit it for the amount of the taxes and rates payable or paid in respect thereof for each and every year. We may fairly assume the treasurer in this case kept such a book, for, in reply to a question put by the counsel of the respondent as to the fact of payments to him of taxes for \u201946.\u201947.\u201948 and \u201949, he said: \u201cWell, the book in which I enter sums received for the lots in my office; any taxes that have been paid to me as treasurer by any one I have put down in the book in my office\u201d and he says he would not have made any entries in the book then before him-that if payments had been made him the entries would have been in another book in his office; and that he had not examined the latter book.\nThe attention of the witness was called to a book, which the learned Vice-Chancellor in his notes calls the treasurer\u2019s book, a copy of a page of which forms part of the respondent\u2019s case. Who the treasurer was, whose book it was said to be, was not stated, or by whom it was kept, or by whom the entries were made. Entries in it appear five years before the witness became treasurer. No evidence shows who made them. It exhibits cabalistic marks, unintelligible to any one unaided by explanations, and I must say such have not been satisfactorily given, in several respects which might be stated. By reference to it, with the explanation given, we learn that the 200 acres, of which the lot in question forms the southern half part, appears from 1841 to 1845 both inclusive to have been rated as a whole; then for four years up to and including 1849 there is no entry. In 1850 appears the figures In 1851 there is another blank. Now what does the witness say in regard to them? He says that book is the one in which arrears of taxes were entered. He says further, that the lot in question (100 acres) is charged with taxes for the years \u201946.\u201947.\u201948.\u201949 and 50, and for \u201952.\u201953.\u201954. The book, however, for the first four years being a blank, shows no division of the lot and charges nothing. He is asked how the blanks show the taxes unpaid, but he evades the question and refers to a mark \u201cA\u201d in reference to another lot not touching the question put. He says further on, \u201cthat blank is to be taken as they were not paid\u201d What \u201cblank\u201d he referred to is not shown, but we may, I think, reasonably assume the blank he referred to was for the four years in question. Then again, as to the blank as to 1851, he is asked what that blank means. He replies \u201cthat signifies that it was not returned, at all events it was not taxable by a certain return received from the township.\u201d How then could he construe the blanks for the four years to mean that there were arrears for those years and that the blank for 1851 meant the very opposite? He says \u201cthe presumption is that the taxes were paid to the township in \u201951, for there is no charge for \u201951.\u201d As far however as the book shews, there is no more charge for the four years than for 1851, and why the \u201cblanks\u201d should be differently understood he did not explain if he could, which, with the data before him, I very much doubt. How the same mark or the same kind of blank can mean one thing with respect to some years and the opposite for another year, I confess my inability to understand. He says in reply to a question as to the payments for \u201947.\u201948 and \u201949, and when asked to refer to the books he then had for information, \u201cthe time is so far back that I cannot swear from perfect memory.\u201d Again as to \u201946 to \u201950, he says: \u201cFrom my books I can say that the lands were in some arrears for these years. I say so from my books. I may be in error in that. I cannot say positively but my impression is\u2014whichever way I may be understood\u2014my impression is that the lot has been in arrears for these years.\u201d What \u201cbooks\u201d did he refer to? Certainly not to the one before him, for from that alone he could get no information. He did not examine the proper book to get it, and the contents of it could not be given without its production. He was not subp\u0153naed, or I presume asked, to produce it, and the only legitimate conclusion is that it would not have aided the respondent\u2019s case if produced. The non-descript book referred to in the evidence could not regularly be looked at, even to refresh the memory of the witness, until he first laid the grounds for the permission by shewing the entries were those of the witness himself and made very soon after the occurrences they referred to.\nI might show further how incompetent the witness was to prove the essential facts the respondent was bound to establish, but I think I have shown quite enough. To turn a person out of property he bought, paid for, and occupied for so many years, upon such evidence, would be, to my mind, not only perpetrating great injustice, but destroying most salutary rules of evidence upon which the rights of property and even life and liberty depend. When \u201cimpressions\u201d are the extent to which a witness can go, I cannot receive such as evidence of facts to make out even a prima facie case, where positive and reliable evidence is required, and I know of no rule under which they can be substituted for any purpose, much less for the evidence located in available public documents, which the statute makes evidence.\nThe statute applicable to this case, 59 Geo. 3, chap. 7, sec. 7, requires the Courts of Quarter Sessions to apportion the amount to be assessed for the District upon each and every person named in the rolls, according to the provisions of sec. 2 of that act, but not in one year to exceed the rate of one penny in the pound. There is no evidence in the case of such rating and no sale for alleged arrears can therefore be upheld. It was hardly contended by the Respondent that the sale in question could be upheld for the ordinary municipal taxes, but his counsel contended that the sale for taxes under sec. 3 of chapter 8 was regular, and, therefore, the title passed by the Sheriff\u2019s deed. I felt great doubts on the argument of the correctness of that contention, and have since then satisfied myself that my doubts were well founded.\nIn Blackwell on Tax Titles[16], a work written apparently with great care and ability, he lays it down that \u201cIf land be sold for the non-payment of divers taxes, one of which is illegal and the residue legal, the sale is void; the land must be liable for all the taxes for which it was sold. In such cases all of the proceedings to collect are necessarily void, as it is impossible to separate and distinguish, so that the act should be in part a trespass, and in part innocent.\u201d In support of this doctrine he cites thirteen American cases. I will refer to some of them. In Elwell v. Shaw[17], it appeared that there were five distinct taxes assessed, for the non-payment of all which the land in controversy was sold. The only objection to the validity of the sale was, that in one of the assessments it exceeded by ten dollars and thirteen cents the amount authorized by the statute. The sale was held void. The Court said: \u201cTo suffer them\u201d (the assessors) \u201cto exceed this limit would be to subject the citizens to the payment of taxes, to the imposition of which they never as- sented, and to create uncertainty in the amount in violation of the manifest provisions of the statute.\u201d The case now under consideration is much stronger where there is no evidence whatever of the imposition and apportionment by the Sessions as the acts require.\nA still stronger case than the one just cited in support of the rule is Huse v. Merriam[18]. There the assessment was, $226.62; the amount to be levied was $225 75; excess, $00.87. It was insisted that the proceeding was void, because the assessor had exceeded the levy eighty\u2011seven cents. The answer was de minimis &c. Chief Justice Mellen, giving the judgment of the Court, says, that the maxim is not applicable to such a case, and that \u201cthe assessment was therefore unauthorized and void. If the line which the legislature has established be once passed we know of no boundary to the discretion of the assessors.\u201d\nThis doctrine would certainly apply to this case were it not for the legislation by the Validating Acts, 29 and 30 Vic. ch. 53 sec. 156, and 32 Vic. ch.36 sec. 155, O. The provisions of the two sections are indentical in language, except as to the time provided for questioning a deed made by a Sheriff or Treasurer.\nSection 155 has been under consideration in many cases, and before, I think, all the Superior Courts of Ontario, and so far as I can ascertain has been always construed to have no affect unless where taxes were in arrear, some of the Judges holding it was necessary in the application of the section to show some taxes due for the period of five years before the issuing of the Treasurer\u2019s warrant; and so appears was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case delivered by Mr. Justice Patterson. He cited four cases, in which it was held that it was necessary to show some arrears, and two where those arrears should have been for five years, upon which he says he might, but for those decisions, have had some hesitation in arriving at that reading of the words \u201csold for taxes in arrears.\u201d\nThe case of Jones v. Cowden[19], was cited in the respondent\u2019s factum. I have read the case in both reports, and it differs from this case in one important feature. In that it distinctly appeared that there were arrears, and the judgment is founded on that assumption; the main questions in the case being as to the application of the Registry Acts, and the validity of the sale. Objection to the validity of the Sheriff\u2019s deed was taken because arrears were not shown in the absence of the proof that the taxes had been properly imposed by the quarter sessions, and therefore, that there were no arrears, but the Court held the particular objections cured by section 155. Vice-Chancellor Blake, in the first sentence of his judgment, says: \u201cIt is proved that at the time of the sale in question there were some taxes in arrear, and that a sale actually did take place;\u201d and afterwards \u201cthe case is therefore brought within sec. 155 of 32 Vic. ch. 36, O., and so the sale is validated, notwithstanding there may have been defects in the proceedings.\u201d Mr. Justice Burton said: \u201cI think there is sufficient evidence of a sale, and a deed executed in pursuance of such sale, to bring the case within section 155 of the Assessment Act, and that it is consequently not open to the defendants to impeach the Sheriff\u2019s deed by reason of any alleged irregularities which were urged against it at the trial and renewed before us.\u201d\nThere is nothing therefore that I can see in the judgment in that case to weaken the decisions previously given with apparent unanimity, and all of which go to show the necessity of proving arrears at the time of the sale, and which necessity of proof I also feel bound to declare. To say that the section was intended to cover any thing more than mere irregularities would be giving to it too extensive an application; and to say that, as in one of the cases cited; where it was clearly shown there were no arrears, the rights of the owner, it might be, absent from the country at the time, should be transferred, through the mistakes or negligence of a public officer, to give credit for taxes paid, would, in my judgment, be going far beyond what I could conceive any civilized legislature could have intended.\nI think before the aid of section 155 can be properly invoked, a sale should be proved independently of the recital or mention of that fact in the deed, and that arrears should be shown. In regard to the first, I may here say that, as the validity of the deed depends on the fact of a sale having taken place, a sale should be shown otherwise than by the deed, for the latter is only valid when a sale has been had. No proof having been given of any sale having taken place, and the sale being the point which is to give effect to the deed, I cannot hold it to come in this case within the purview of the section. It is no answer to this objection to urge that after many years the proof might be difficult. That may be one of the consequences of purchasing lands sold for taxes, but I don\u2019t think the amount of time elapsed in this case sufficient to call upon a court to presume that a sale did actually take place, unless indeed it was first shown that some diligence had unsuccessfully been used to get proof, either primary or secondary, of the fact. I am of opinion that the evidence does not shew any arrears at the time of the sale, that the want of proof of the sale invalidates the deed so as to take it out of the provisions of sec. 155, and that that section only applies to a sale and deed when taxes are in arrears when a warrant is issued. I therefore think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment below reversed.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nOne of the points pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the respondent was that, four years having elapsed without the Sheriff\u2019s deed, under which the plaintiff claims, and which was executed upon the 23 May, 1857, having been called in question, the 156th sec. of the assessment Act of 1866, made that deed now to be wholly unimpeachable, even though no portion of the taxes, for the alleged arrear of which the sale took place, had been due for 5 years, or even though there was no amount of tax whatever due, or in arrear, in respect of the land sold. It may be convenient, that I should address myself to this point, before adverting to the ground upon which the court below has based its judgment.\nThe fair and legitimate conclusion, resulting from the judgments of all the courts in Ontario upon the construction of the Assessment Acts, both before and since the first enactment of the section referred to, according to my understanding of the reported decisions, is, that the section can only be construed to remedy all irregularities and defects existing, when the event, the happening of which the statute has made an essential condition precedent to the creation of the power to sell, has occurred, namely, when some portion of the taxes imposed has been suffered to remain in arrear and unpaid for the prescribed period, which was formerly five years, but now three; and that it cannot be construed as supplying the want of that condition precedent. Sitting as we do here as a Court of Appeal from the courts in Ontario, speaking for myself, I must say, that if I should find a judgment of any of those courts affirming the position contended for, I should feel it to be my bounden duty to raise my voice for reversal of such a judgment, as one which would be, in my opinion, subversive of all security for property, at variance with the plainest principles of justice, contrary to the whole scope, object and tenor of the Act in which the clause is found, and one which could only be arrived at by disregarding the elementary rule for the construction of all statutes, namely: that the construction is to be made of all parts together and not of one part only by itself.\nIn Hall vs. Hill in the Court of Error and Appeal, in 1865[20], Richards, C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nThe courts in this country have always held that the imposition of taxes on wild lands, and the selling those lands for the arrears of such taxes, with the additions and accumulations to the amount of taxes which these acts require, in effect works a forfeiture of the property of the owner of the lands. In relation to statutes of this class, Turner, L.J., in Hughes v. Chester and Holyhead Railway[21], says: \u201cThis is an act which interferes with private rights and private interests and ought therefore, according to all decisions on the subject, to receive a strict construction, so far as those rights and interests are concerned. This is so clearly the doctrine of the court that it is unnecessary to refer to cases upon the subject. They might be cited almost without end.\u201d\nIn that case, in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[22], Draper, C.J., referring to the Assessment Act, in pronouncing the judgment of the court, says:\nWe must confess we more readily concur with what was said in Doe v. Reaumore[23]: \u201cThe operation of this statute is to work a forfeiture, an accumulated penalty is imposed for an alleged default, and to satisfy the assessment charged together with this penalty the land of a proprietor may be sold, though he may be in a distant part of the world and unconscious of the proceeding. To support a sale made under such circumstances, it must be shewn that those facts existed which are alleged to have created the forfeiture and which are necessary to warrant the sale.\u201d\nIn Payne v. Goodyear[24], Draper, C.J., says: The primary, it may be said the sole, object of the Legislature in authorizing the sale of lands for arrears of taxes was the collection of the tax. The statutes were not passed to take away lands from their legal owners, but to compel those owners, who neglected to pay their taxes, and from whom payment could not be enforced by the other methods authorized, to pay, by the sale of a sufficient portion of their lands.\nAnd again, at p. 452:\nThe power to sell land was created in order to collect the tax.\nIn Connor v. Douglas, in the Court of Appeal[25], Richards, then C.J. of the Court of Common Pleas, (the Court of Appeal then consisting of all the Judges of the Superior Courts,) referring to the above language of the court in Doe v. Reaumore, draws a distinction between matters of procedure and other matters. Thus he says:\nThe Judges could not intend their language to apply to a mere defective or informal advertising of the lands for sale.\nThe language referred to,\n(quoting Doe v. Reaumore, as above, he goes on to say,)\nmay well apply to all those matters creating a charge on the property, fixing as it were the burden on it, and rendering it liable to be sold. When the charge has once been fixed on the land, and the period has elapsed after which it may sold, then the subsequent matters, as to how it may be sold, the manner of selling, advertising, &c., to a certain extent cease to be mandatory, and are, in fact, but the mode pointed out by the statute how the property is to be sold, which by all the requirements of law before the officer was directed to sell it, had been made liable to sale.\nAnd referring to the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in the then recent case of Cotter v. Sutherland[26], he says[27]:\nI think the language used by my brother Adam Wilson, in Cotter v. Sutherland, in the Common Pleas, is correct, and may be properly applied and laid down as the rule in those cases, viz: \u201cWe should require strict proof that the tax has been lawfully made, but, in promoting its collection, we should not surround the procedure with too unnecessary or unreasonable rigour.\u201d And again, he says:\nI would refer to the language used by the learned Judge from pages 405 to 408 inclusive. The conclusion arrived at is that: \u201cUnder these Acts there are certain things which must be strictly adopted, otherwise the whole proceedings following them must be void, There must have been an assessment in fact, and made by the properly authorized body. The writ must be directed to the Sheriff, and be returnable at the time named.\u201d * * * * *\n\u201cThese are essential elements in the constitution of any valid tax sale. There must be a charge rightly created on the land, there must be a power rightly conferred on the Sheriff to sell it. The sale must not be without some reasonable and sufficient notice, nor sooner than he is authorized to sell, nor otherwise than by public auction.\u201d\nThe learned C.J., then, while concurring in the above language, guards himself from being supposed to hold that there may not be in some instances, some other ingredients required than those stated, to make the sale valid.\nDraper, C.J., with whom Mowat, V.C., concurred, repeated his opinion, that the tax sale acts are to be treated as penal in their character, leading to forfeiture, and that therefore they should be construed strictly. We have in this judgment an affirmation by the Court of Appeal of the views expressed by the Court of Common Pleas in Cotter v. Sutherland, with the single exception that, whereas the Court of Common Pleas did not incline to regard these Tax Sale Acts as of a penal character, the Court of Appeal seemed to regard them in that light. However Mr. Justice Wilson, delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Cotter v. Sutherland[28], affirms the law imperatively to be, that the owner must be a defaulter for the prescribed period of years before his land can be sold. He regards the lawful imposition of the tax as creating a judgment debt, to satisfy which alone the law authorizes a sale. In either view of the statute, namely, whether it be regarded as penal, or as creating a debt in the nature of a judgment, the Acts sanction no sale, except to realize arrears of taxes actually imposed, and some portion of which has been suffered to remain in arrear for the prescribed period. We have here, then, the clearest judicial enunciation of the scope, object and intent of these acts.\nIn Hamilton v. Eggleton[29], the Court of Common Pleas, in perfect conformity with the principles above enunciated, held that sec. 155 of 32 Vic., ch. 36, which is identical with sec. 156 of the Assessment Act of 1866, does not make valid a deed executed upon a sale as for taxes in arrear, when, in fact, no taxes were in arrear at the time of the sale. In a matter which appears to me of such great importance, I may be excused for referring to a portion of the reasons given for that judgment, altho, it was pronounced in my own language, with the full concurrence, however, of my brother Judges. After pointing out the several clauses of the Assessment Acts, and shewing their scope to be, as laid down by other Judges in the cases which I have here quoted above, the judgment proceeds:\nThe whole object of the Acts, and the whole machinery provided, being for the purpose of enforcing the payment of arrears of taxes, and the only authority to sell conferred by the act being in case of there being such arrears due out of the land and unpaid, there can, I think, be no doubt that the 155th sec. of 32 Vic., corresponding with the 156th sec. of the Act of 1866, relates only to deeds given in such cases as were in pursuance of a sale contemplated by the act\u2014namely, a sale for the purpose of realizing payment of taxes in arrear and unpaid. The only deed authorised to be given being a deed in pursuance of a sale, which was authorized only in the event of there being taxes in arrear and unpaid, the natural construction is, that the 155th section, like all other parts of the act, relates to the like object\u2014namely, that which the Act authorized, not to an event not at all authorized or contemplated by the act\u2014namely, a sale of lands in respect of which there were no arrears of taxes due and unpaid, and the owner of which had never been in any default which called for or justified the intervention of the act.\nThe object of the clause relied upon, in my opinion, was, as its language appears to me plainly to express, and as is consistent with the whole tenor of the act, to provide that, when lands became liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, and were sold to recover such arrears, and a deed should be given in pursuance of such sale, that such deed should not be questioned for any irregularity or defect whatever, unless within a prescribed period, but it would be contrary to the whole scope and intent of the act, [which it is to be borne in mind was merely an act to amend and consolidate the several acts respecting the assessment of property], to hold that the object of the clause was to make good, after a period of two years, a deed given under circumstances in which the act had not authorized or contemplated any sale at all should take place\u2014in which, in fact, the very purpose for which alone a sale was contemplated was wanting.\nIn that judgment attention was also drawn to the provisions and effect of an Act, 33 Vic., ch. 23, to which, however, I propose now to draw more particular attention. That act was passed for the express purpose of making valid sales known to be absolutely invalid, and it enacted that, in cases where lands, which were liable to he assessed, had been sold and conveyed under colour of the statutes, for taxes in arrear, and the tax purchaser at such sale had, prior to the first day of Novr., 1869, gone into and continued in occupation of the land sold, or of any part thereof, for at least four years, and had made improvements thereon to the value of $200, or, in lieu of such occupation, shall have paid at least 8 years taxes charged on the land since the sale, such sale should be deemed valid, notwithstanding any omission, insufficiency, defect, or irregularity whatsoever, as regards the assessment, or sale, or the preliminary, or subsequent steps required to make such sale effectual in law. Provided always, that the statute should not apply, among other cases, to the following, namely, in case the taxes, for non-payment of which the lands were sold, had been fully paid before sale. And it was further enacted, that nothing in the act contained should effect the right or title of the owner of any lands sold as for arrears of taxes, or of any person claiming through or under him, where such owner at the time of such sale was in occupation of the lands, and the same have since been in occupation of such owner, or of those claiming through or under him.\nNow, is it conceivable, that the Legislature would have passed this act, so passed for the express purpose of making invalid sales valid, but which excluded from its operation the case of there being no taxes in arrear at the time of the sale, which was the case of Hamilton v. Eggleton, and the case of the true owner continuing in occupation from the time of the sale, and which, in cases in which it did operate, only made valid sales which had been followed by actual occupation by the tax purchaser for the full period of four years, accompanied by an outlay of $200 in improvements, or, in lieu of such occupation, the payment of taxes accrued due for eight years subsequent to the sale, if there was then a statute in existence having the effect, as is now contended\u2014for this is the whole contention\u2014that, even in a case where the owner of property may have continued in possession regularly, paying all taxes, both before and since the sale, and where, consequently, no taxes whatever were in arrear, nevertheless, if in such case a sale should take place, and a deed be given, as occurred in Hamilton v. Eggleton, the mere lapse of four years from such wrongful and inexcusable sale should divest the true owner of his property, although he had never been in default, and may have had no knowledge whatever of the sale, until after the lapse of the four years, the purchaser at such invalid sale, should proceed to evict him?\nTo my mind I must confess that the statute appears to convey a legislative recognition that the Assessment Act of 1866 is not open to the construction contended for. What a state of society would ours be, what a reproach would it be, not upon our system of jurisprudence only, but upon our state of civilization, if we should be obliged judicially to declare, that such is the frail tenure upon which property and civil rights are held in the Province of Ontario.\nLet us consider for a moment longer the proposition contended for, that we may be thoroughly familiar with the aspect of a proposition which is asserted in the name of an Act of the legislature. Lands are liable to assessment, whether they are resided upon or not. Those not resided upon, when the owner is not resident within the municipality, (or is unknown, if residing in the municipality,) are assessed upon a separate roll called the \u201cNon-Resident Land Roll.\u201d Those upon which the owners reside are assessed against the resident owners personally. Now, as to this latter class first. He may pay his taxes regularly to the proper officer every year; may carefully preserve all his receipts; he may never have been in default at all, and yet, as in Hamilton v. Eggleton, his land may be sold behind his back without his knowing anything about it. He may continue in possession after the sale, paying his taxes regularly as before, until, after a number of years, he finds he is no longer the owner of his own lands, the fee simple estate therein having, as is contended passed to a stranger by the mere lapse of two years now, formerly it was four, from the committal by a municipal officer of an unwarrantable act which is called \u201cA Sale under a Power.\u201d This may be done without any notice whatever to the owner; for, as advertisement of the sale is part of the procedure only, and as the clause, (according to the contention, and as is conceded,) cures all defects in procedure, the sale may have taken place without having ever been advertised, and without the owner, who was in no default, having ever had any notice whatever that his land was about to be, or had been, offered for sale. Then, the owner of lands assessed upon the non-resident land roll knows that the law permits him to suffer the taxes upon his land to fall in arrear, now for 3 years, formerly it was for 5 years, subject merely to the payment by him for that accommodation of compound interest, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. Knowing this to be the law, and in perfect confidence in its integrity, he makes his arrangements accordingly. His business takes him abroad for three years. He returns before the expiration of the third year, in time to pay up all arrears, with the accumulated interest, within the period prescribed by the law, and he finds that, immediately after he left the Province, his whole property consisting of a valuable estate, had been offered for sale without any authority of law by a municipal officer, as for one year\u2019s taxes due for the year before he left, when in fact none was due, and that a Deed has been executed by the municipal officer to a stranger, and that more than two years have elapsed since the sale, and he is told by the Courts of Law, where he seeks for redress, that his case is helpless\u2014that, notwithstanding he was never in default, and that the act of the municipal officer was inexcusable and unwarranted, still the lapse of two years from the committal of that unwarranted act has had the effect of divesting him of his estate and and of vesting it in the person to whom the municipal officer so wrongfully, without any legal authority, had executed a Deed purporting to convey it. Surely, if ever there was a case in which, if necessary, judicial astuteness should be called into action to avoid such a construction it is this. But in my opinion no astuteness is necessary, for the proposition seems to my mind to be so shocking that I never could feel myself to be justified in imputing to the Legislature an intent so arbitrary, so subversive of civil liberty, and of the right of the subject to the full enjoyment of his property, as such a construction would imply, unless I should find the intent expressed in language which admits of no other possible construction, and from which there is no possibility of escape.\nBut it is said, that unless this construction be given to the act the maxim of law omnia presumuntur rite esse acta would be disregarded. The clause relied upon, and other similar clauses in other assessment acts, form the best commentary upon the inapplicability of such a maxim, for it was the repeated illegal acts committed by the public officers in the conduct of these sales which formed the sole excuse for the enactment of these clauses. However, the rights of property are too sacred to be left to the mercy of this maxim: moreover, it never claimed to apply to the giving jurisdiction to deprive a man of his estate. Even in the case of a sale under an execution issued out of the Superior Courts, it is necessary that there should be a judgment obtained against the owner of land, in order to support a transfer of his estate under the execution. Here the contention is that neither a judgment, nor anything analgous to it, is necessary. The maxim, too, only purports to operate donec probetur in contrarium, whereas the construction sought to be put upon the act in which the clause in question is found asserts the right to pass an estate by the mere lapse of two years from the committal of an act proved, or admitted to have been, at the time it was committed, illegal and wholly unwarranted. If this construction should be established, the first fruits of that decision would be to divest the true original owner of the land, which was the subject of litigation in Hamilton v. Eggleton, of his estate, which the judgment in that case, so long as the construction it put upon the act is maintained, secured to him; for the action there having been ejectment is not final, and the party who there claimed under the wrongful deed may bring a new action and recover the estate from the rightful owner, if a new construction should be put upon the act by this court.\nAgain, it it is said that in these cases the innocent purchaser should be protected, but I cannot see that he, however innocent, has any greater claims upon our sympathy than the innocent owner of the property, who would be cruely wronged if the purchaser in the given case should succeed. In a matter so affecting the rights of property, there is something more to be considered than: which party is most entitled to our sympathies? That is a question with which we, as expounders merely of the law, have nothing to do. What the owner of the property submits to our adjudication is, whether or not the language used by the legislature warrants the construction, that the mere lapse of two or four years from the committal by a municipal officer of an utterly illegal and unwarranted act, (whether such act was fraudulent, or only done in ignorance, or by mistake, is alike to the owner) can have the effect of divesting the true owner, who was in no default whatever to the municipality, and who had been guilty of no breach of any law, of his estate in real property.\nIn Proudfoot v. Austin[30], the plaintiff, who was a purchaser at a tax sale, rested his case upon the sheriff\u2019s deed alone. Blake, V.C., held this insufficient, and that the 155th sec. of 32 Vic. ch. 36 only applies where there was an arrear of taxes due at the time of the sale, and where there has been an actual sale. He adds:\nI think, therefore, that here the plaintiff should have shewn that at the time of the sale there were some taxes due, and that an actual sale did take place.\nAnd he remitted the case for further evidence.\nThis sentence, extracted from the learned Judge\u2019s judgment, by no means implies that he was of opinion that it was not necessary that some part of the arrears should be due for the period prescribed by the statute; he was simply adjudicating that a sheriff\u2019s deed alone was not sufficient, but that proof of arrears of taxes, and of an actual sale for such arrears under the provisions of the statute, was necessary to be given.\nThis judgment is no more authority for the contention that an arrear for any shorter period than the statute has prescribed would be sufficient, than is the expression in the judgment of the court in Hamilton v. Eggleton[31], that the sec. refers \u201conly to cases of deeds given in pursuance of sales where some tax upon the land sold was in arrear.\u201d\nWhen the evidence should be offered would arise the question whether what was offered was sufficient. Upon this point I have referred to the records of the court in Proudfoot v. Austin, and I find that upon the 11th and 25th June, 1875, the Vice-Chancellor took the further evidence which his judgment at the hearing had directed to be given, and that then the treasurer of the county produced the several collectors rolls for the years \u201952, \u201953, \u201954, \u201955, \u201956, and \u201957, shewing arrears of taxes charged upon the lands for each of those years, to the respective amounts following in the order of the years, and which still remained due when the sale took place in 1858, viz.:\u2014\u00a31 9s. 5\u00bdd., \u00a33 6s. 7\u00bdd., \u00a34 7s. 4\u00bdd., \u00a319 5s. 7\u00bdd., \u00a318 18s. 5\u00bdd., and,\u00a319 7s. 2d; and it was upon this evidence and evidence of the sale that a decree was made in favor of the plaintiff upon the 28th June, 1875.\nIn Kempt v. Parkyn[32], the Court of Common Pleas held that the section under consideration did not cure the defect that no part of the tax was in arrear for the period prescribed by law, viz.: 5 years in that case, be- fore the Treasurer\u2019s warrant under which the sale took place issued.\nIn the case now in review before us Mr. Justice Patterson, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, says that he does not wish to throw any doubt upon the construction thus put upon the clause in the Court of Common Pleas, although he might have had some hesitation in arriving independently at that reading of the words \u201csold for arrears of taxes.\u201d He adds, however, language amply approbatory of the decision as just and sound. He says, and this is the language of the Court:\nI see nothing objectionable in principle, nor anything unreasonably restrictive of the beneficial operation of the clause, in holding that while it cures defects in procedure, either in the formal assessment of the land, or in the steps leading to and including the sale, its operation is excluded when it appears that the substantial basis of liability, viz.: the fact that a portion of the tax on the land had been over-due for the period prescribed by the law under which the sale took place, is wanting.\nThis language involves a complete affirmation by the Court of Appeal of the judgments in Hamilton v. Eggleton and Kempt v. Parkyn, for if the construction which in these cases is put upon the section is \u201cunobjectionble in principle,\u201d and is not \u201cunreasonably restrictive of the beneficial operation of the clause,\u201d then the canons of construction imperatively direct that this construction, which is reasonable, wholesome and \u201cunobjectionable in principle,\u201d must be preferred to a construction, such as that now contended for, which is unreasonable, unjust and mischievous in the extreme, inasmuch as it would, without any shadow of reason, deprive a man in no default whatever, and guilty of no breach of any law, of his legal rights in real property, without any value or consideration whatever.\nIn Nicholls vs. Cummings, reported in the 1st Vol. of the Reports of the decisions of this Court[33], I find langu- age relating to this same assessment Act confirmatory of that quoted from several of the cases which I have above referred to and conclusive, as it appears to me, upon the clause now under discussion. The question there arose under the 61st sec. of the Act 32 Vic. ch. 36, which enacts that the assessment roll as finally passed by the Court of Revision and certified by the Clerk as so passed\nShall be valid, and shall bind all parties concerned notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such Roll.\nUpon the Roll, so passed and certified, a party appeared to be assessed for $43,400.00 who had delivered to him an assessment slip stating his assessment to be only $20,900.00. It was contended that this 61st sec. made the Roll as passed binding and conclusive upon the party. I find however at p. 419 of the Report this language in the judgment of the Court:\nI think it more consistent with justice that the fundamental rule which ought to prevail is, that the provisions that the Legislature has made to guard the subject from unjust or illegal imposition should be carried out and acted on.\nAnd again at p. 422:\nWhen a statute derogates from a common law right, and divests a party of his property, or imposes a burthen on him, every provision of the statute beneficial to the party must be observed; therefore it has been often held that acts which impose a charge or a duty upon the subject must be construed strictly, and it is equally clear that no provisions for the benefit or protection of the subject, can be ignored or rejected.\nAnd again at p. 427:\nIt needs no reference to specific authorities to authorise the proposition, that in all cases of interference with private rights of property, in order to subserver public interests, the authority conferred by the Sovereign\u2014here the Legislature\u2014must be pursued with the utmost exactitude, as regards the compliance with all pre-requisites introduced for the benefit of parties whose rights are to be affected.\nAnd the Court held accordingly, that the 61st sec. applied only when pre-requisites ordained by previous clauses had been complied with. This case, as it appears to me, if it stood alone, ought to be conclusive authority in this Court, that the essential pre-requisite, which the statute ordains shall occur before the power to sell conferred by the statute comes into being, should occur to enable the clauses in question to apply; that the coming into existence of the power to sell under the conditions prescribed in the statute is an essential element in every deed authorised or confirmed by the statute.\nBut it is said, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Jones v. Cowden[34], is at variance with, and that therefore, being the judgment of a Court of Appeal, it in effect reversed, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Hamilton v. Eggleton. If that were the effect of the judgment in Jones v. Cowden, it ought in my opinion to be reversed here, for the reasons which I have given. But in truth Jones v. Cowden has never been regarded as at variance with Hamilton v. Eggleton, or as an adjudication upon the point now under discussion. If it had been, Kempt v. Parkyn would not have been decided as it was, nor in the case now under review before us would the Court of Appeal itself have expressed itself in the terms it has of the judgments in Hamilton v. Eggleton and Kempt v. Parkyn. The court would, on the contrary, naturally have felt itself bound by Jones v. Cowden, and would have decided this case upon the short point as to the construction of the clause, and have so got rid of the difficulty, with which it seems to have been pressed, in arriving at the conclusion that there was direct evidence of there having been some portion of tax in arrear for five years sufficient to support the sale. A reference, however, to Jones v. Cowden, will shew that neither did the point which arose and was adjudicated in Hamilton v. Eggleton, nor that which arose and was adjudicated in Kempt v. Parkyn, arise in Jones v. Cowden. The tax sale took place in 1839, for eight years arrears of taxes to the 1st July, 1837, made up as follows:\u2014\n200 acres at \u215b d. per acre under 59 Geo. 3 ch. 8 sec. 3, road tax 2s. 1d. which for eight years amounted to......................................................................\n\u00a30 16s. 8d.\nAdd 50 per cent, under 9 Geo. 4 ch. 3 sec. 4 .............................................\n8s. 4d.\n\u00a31 5s. 0d.\nThen assessment of 1d. on the \u00a3 on 200 acres at 4s. per acre, under 59 Geo. 3, ch. 7, sec. 3, 3s. 4d. per acre for eight years..........................................\n\u00a31 6s. 8d.\nAdd 50 per cent.................................................................................................\n13s. 4d.\nTotal.................................................................................................\n\u00a33 5s. 0d.\nThe evidence was that the clerk of the peace, on the 12th July, 1837, certified to the Quarter Sessions that there was this sum of \u00a33 5s. due on the lot for eight years ending 1st July, 1837. The chairman made an order that a warrant for sale should issue, and the warrant was issued. Wilson, J., in his judgment in the Queen\u2019s Bench, says:\u2014\nThere is no reason to doubt that the land was actually though, perhaps not formally, taxed.\nNow, as to the \u00a31 5s. that was a tax clearly charged upon the land, being a tax directly imposed by statute, so that this amount was certainly due, and for the eight years, whether the 1d. in the \u00a3 was properly charged or not. There was no evidence, as in Cotter v. Sutherland, that it was not\u2014the certificate of the Clerk of the Peace that it was charged upon the land, if not conclusive evidence upon that point would be sufficient prima facie evidence. When the learned Judge says that perhaps it was not formally taxed, he was alluding, no doubt, rather to his knowledge of the practice which used to prevail than to anything in the evidence showing it not to have been formally taxed. It was, he says, actually done. There was however no question that the \u00a31 5s. for road tax was due and in arrear for the proper time, and a sale did take place to realise \u00a33 5s. arrears of taxes; all of which was certified by the proper officers to have been imposed upon the land, \u00a31 5s. of which was imperatively and completely imposed by statute directly. There was no suggestion that anything appearing in the evidence raised a presumption, as is contended the evidence in the case now before us does, that this charge had been paid before the sale. The case therefore had all those elements to support a sale which Hamilton v. Eggleton and Kempt v. Parkyn pronounce to be necessary; and forthis reason Hamilton v. Eggleton appears to have been referred to for the purpose of distinguishing it. There were, however, in Jones v. Cowden objections taken to the sufficiency of the advertisement of the sale. In the Court of Appeal we have not, unfortunately, the judgment of Chief Justice Draper, which, although written, appears to have been mislaid. He certainly was not in the habit of going out of his way to over-rule, or to cast a doubt upon, a judgment of a Court upon a point not at all necessary for the decision of the case before him, and which, in fact, the evidence in the case before him did not raise. If V.C. Blake had changed the opinion he had then recently expressed in his judgment in Proudfoot v. Austin, he surely would have pointedly intimated that change, and he would not have thought it necessary shortly afterwards to take, as he did, the further evidence in Proudfoot v. Austin, and base his decree upon such further evidence; but that he had not changed his mind appears from the fact that he based his judgment expressly upon the ground that it was shown sufficiently in his opinion that at the time of the sale there were taxes in arrear; and, as I have already stated, whatever taxes were due upon the land were so due and in arrear for the period then required. The judgment of Burton J., wherein he says that by reason of the 155th sec. of the Assessment Act it was not open to the defendants to impeach the sale by reason of the alleged irregularities which were urged against it, must be confined to the objections as to the irregularities in the advertisement of the sale, and cannot be extended to refer to a matter which did not exist, and which therefore did not require adjudication, as the case was argued upon the assumption that there did sufficiently appear to be taxes in arrear for the period necessary to warrant a sale.\nThe result is, that in all the reported cases since the first enactment of the clause under discussion, which have been decided in favor of the purchaser, it was proved that the event, upon the happening of which alone the power to sell comes into existence, had occurred, and that in the only cases in which that event did not appear to have occurred, the title of the original and true owner has been upheld.\nBoth authority and principle concur, then, in laying down the law to be, as this Court should take this the earliest opportunity of affirming it to be, namely, that the section under discussion does not remove an infirmity arising from there not appearing to have been at the time of the sale some portion of tax due which had been in arrear for the period prescribed by law before the sale. That the section covers all mere defects of form which may have occurred in the procedure to impose an assessment actually charged against the land, and all irregularities and defects in the execution of the power, but cannot, upon any principle of justice, be construed to supply or cure the want of that condition precedent, the existence of which is essential to the coming into existence of the power to sell, namely, that some portion of the tax imposed was in arrear for the period prescribed by law, and was still unpaid at the time of the sale.\nUntil I heard my Brother Strong\u2019s judgment I had never heard that the case of The Bank of Toronto vs. Fanning[35] was relied upon as an authority governing the point before us. If I had, I could, I think, have shown that it has no more application than has Jones vs. Cowden; indeed if it had, being a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, that Court, no doubt, when this case was in judgment before them, would have proceeded upon that judgment, and have followed it, instead of quoting the language which they have used, and which is as inconsistent with the case of The Bank of Toronto vs. Fanning, being a judgment upon the point, as it is with Jones vs. Cowden being so.\nThe Court below has held that the necessary condition precedent has been fulfilled in the case before us. It is necessary therefore to dispose of that point also.\nThe plaintiff claimed title under a deed bearing date the 23rd of May, 1857, executed by the Sheriff of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry, in pursuance of a sale made by the Sheriff on the first of March, 1856, for arrears of taxes alleged to have been due in respect of the said piece of land up to the 21st of Dec\u2019r, 1854. The years for which these arrears were charged to have become due were the years \u201946, \u201947, \u201948, \u201949, \u201950, \u201952, \u201953 and \u201954. The contention of the defendant was, that there was no evidence of any rate having been imposed upon the land in question (which was wild unoccupied land), for the years \u201946 to \u201950, inclusive, under 59 Geo. III, ch. 7. It was also contended by the defendant, that certain matters appearing in a book produced by the Treasurer of the counties raised a presumption that in the year 1851 all taxes charged for the preceding years were paid, and that no sufficient evidence rebutting this presumption was offered. The effect of this contention, if well founded, would be that the sale in 1856 was illegal, for the reason that no part of the taxes in respect of which the sale took place was due for 5 years.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contended, that the judgment in Cotter v. Sutherland, upon the construction of the 59 Geo. III, ch. 7, and the wild land rate thereby authorized, was erroneous, and desired to bring that judgment in review before us in this case; but it is not necessary to express any opinion upon that point, for the reason that, as was conceded in argument, and as appears by the statute 59 Geo. III, ch. 8, the road tax therein mentioned was, by the statute itself, without more, rated and charged upon the land, and the question presented for our determination is, whether or not there was sufficient evidence of that tax or any part thereof remaining unpaid for 5 years when the sale took place; for sec. 55 of 16 Vic. ch. 182, and subsequent sections, authorized the sale of land for arrears of taxes, whenever a portion of the tax has been due for 5 years. Now, that the tax imposed by 59 Geo. III, ch. 8, s. 3, for road tax, became and was a statutory charge upon the lot in question for the years from \u201946 to \u201950 inclusive, I think there can be no doubt. But in order to understand the point raised by the defendant, namely: that the evidence offered by the plaintiff raised a presumption of payment in 1851 of all previous charges, it is necessary to refer to 13 and 14 Vic. ch. 67, which came into operation upon 1st of January, 1851.\nThe 46 sec. of that Act directed the Treasurers of the several counties to make out, and submit to the municipal council of their county, on or before the 1st of January, 1851, a true list of the lands in their respective counties on which any taxes shall then remain unpaid, and the amount of taxes due on each lot, or part of lot, both for taxes chargeable under the wild land assessment law, and for assessments imposed under By-laws of the municipal councils, and that the said arrears should be certified to the clerk of the proper locality by the County Clerk, and should be added to the assessment roll for the year 1851, and collected in like manner; and by the 33rd sec. it was enacted that it should be the duty of the Clerk making out any Collector\u2019s Roll to forward immediately to the County Treasurer a copy of so much of the said Roll as should relate to the taxes on the lands of non-residents. This same 33rd sec. enacted that every Collector, upon receiving his Collection Roll, should proceed to collect the taxes therein mentioned, and for that purpose should call at least once on the party taxed, or at the place of his usual residence, if within the Township, and should demand payment of the taxes charged on the property of such person. Provided always, that the taxes upon lands of non-residents in any township might be paid to the County Treasurer, who, on being thereunto required, should receive the same and give a receipt therefor; and that such County Treasurer should keep an exact account of all sums so received by him, and should pay over the same to the Treasurer of the township to which they should respectively belong. Then, the 34th section enacted that, in case any party should refuse or neglect to pay the taxes imposed upon him for the space of 14 days after demand, the Collector might levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the party who ought to pay the same. Then, the 38th sec enacted that the Collector should receive the tax on any lot of land separately assessed, or upon any undivided part of any such lot, provided the person paying such tax should furnish in writing a statement of such undivided part, showing who is the owner thereof. Then, by the 42nd sec. it was enacted that, if any of the taxes mentioned in the Collector\u2019s Roll should remain unpaid, and the Collector should not be able to collect the same, he should deliver to the Township Treasurer and to the County Treasurer an account of all the taxes remaining due on the said Roll, showing opposite to each separate assessment the reason why he could not collect the same, by inserting the words \u201cnon\u2011resident\u201d or \u201cno property to distrain,\u201d as the case might be. Then the 45th sec. enacted that the County Treasurer should prepare a list of such lands in each township, &c., &c., upon which any taxes should remain due at the time of the Collector making his return, distinguishing in separate columns, and opposite the respective lots, the amounts due for county rates, and the amounts due for township rates.\nThe Treasurer of the United Counties was called as as a witness upon behalf of the plaintiff and he testified that taxes, at the rate of 1d. in the \u00a3 for the wild land tax, under 59 Geo. 3, ch. 7, and \u215bd. per acre under 59 Geo. 3, ch. 8, were charged upon the land, and in arrear and unpaid in the years \u201946 to \u201950 inclusive; and he produced a book, which I understood to have been his Non-Resident Land Roll Book, but which did not appear to have the yearly entries made in it in the manner directed by the statute. In this book, opposite to the lot, viz: 15 in the 9th concession in columns headed respectively with the years \u201946, \u201947, \u201948 49, were blanks, instead of the rate for each year. The Treasurer stated that these blanks indicated, as he swore also the fact was, that no taxes were paid to him for those years. In a column headed with the year 1850 were two entries thus:\nThese entries were said to represent the amounts as returned to the municipal council in the Schedule furnished by the Treasurer in pursuance of the above quoted directions contained in 13 and 14 Vic. ch 67, as due upon the north and south halves of the lot respectively. In the column under 1851 there was no entry.\nEvidence was given to the effect that in 1851 the whole lot was assessed to one Alex. McDonald, although in 1850 he had been assesed for the north half only. In the years from \u201952 to \u201960, both inclusive, the south half was returned as non-resident. In the columns headed 1852 and 1853 were entered the taxes rated and imposed for those years only. Now, upon this evidence it was contended that it must be presumed that in 1851 all arrears had been collected by the Township Collector, upon whose roll, under 13 and 14 Vic. ch. 67, the arrears had been placed for the purpose of being so collected. The Treasurer had in his office, as I understand the evidence, the roll as returned by the Collector, which should have shown whether he had or not been paid those arrears, and he also swore that he had a book in his office in which payment of the arrears, if made in 1851, would appear, which book he had not brought to Court with him. The objection, as it appears to me, is not so much one of presumption of payment, arising from entries in the book produced, as an objection to the sufficiency of the evidence to show that at the time of the sale there remained unpaid an arrear of tax for the period necessary to warrant a sale, in the absence of the collector\u2019s roll for the year 1851, and of the book which the Treasurer said he had at his office; for if payment was made to the Collector in 1851 of the arrears as charged to the year 1850, and entered upon his roll, there were not arrears due for the prescribed period to warrant the sale. It certainly seems to have been great negligence upon the part of the plaintiff, and of the Treasurer I think also, (whose duty it was to produce the best evidence the case admitted of, and which the Treasurer swears he had in his office,) that such evidence was not produced to establish the fact beyond all doubt. In a case where a plaintiff claims title under a Power of Sale, such as the power in these cases is, the courts should, I think, be very particular in requiring the clearest evidence that the right to exercise the power arose before they adjudge a man to be divested of his estate, unless the law provides any particular evidence as prima facie sufficient in the particular case; and if the case had stopped here I should be decidedly of opinion that the collectors returned roll should have been produced, and that the case should have been adjourned to another day, if that was necessary, as was done in Proudfoot v. Austin, to have enabled the treasurer to produce the roll, and I gather from Mr. Justice Patterson\u2019s judgment that this was his opinion also, for he rests his judgment in favor of the plaintiff, upon the effect of the statute 16 Vic. ch. 182, the 51st and 53rd sections of which imposed upon the treasurer the duty of keeping a book in which he should enter from the returns made to him by the clerk of the municipality, and from the collector\u2019s rolls returned to him any taxes unpaid, and the amounts so due, and he was required upon the 1st day of May in every year to complete and balance his books, by entering against each piece of land the arrears, if any, due at the last settlement, and the taxes of the preceding year which might remain unpaid, and to enter therein the total amount, if any, chargeable upon the land at that date, and to add 10 p. c. thereto each year.\nThe main object, no doubt, which the Legislature had in view in requiring this book to be kept by the treasurer, was as well to serve the convenience of the public, who had an interest in the matters so required to be entered, as for preserving in a convenient shape evidence of the charges against the lands; such entries, so made by a public officer, in discharge of a duty imposed upon him by statute, are always received as prima facie evidence of the matters so entered.\nThe treasurer testified to his having performed the duty thus imposed, and that in the book which he did produce he entered under the years 1853 and 1854, as directed, the result; and he moreover pledges his oath to his belief in the correctness of those entries, to make which he had necessarily occasion to refer to the rolls in his office including that of 1851. The entries so made shew the amounts entered on the collector\u2019s roll of that year as still unpaid in 1853 and 1854. This evidence, therefore, unless and until displaced, shews that there remained still, as a charge upon the land, so much of the amount at least as consisted of the road tax imposed by 59 Geo. 3 ch. 8, and the accumulations thereon for interest: so that a sale was warranted within the provisions of the statute, as some portion of tax charged upon the land was due, and in arrear for the required period. No attempt was made to displace this evidence, which no doubt would have been, if it could have been, done. For this reason I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant:\u2014Stewart, Chrysler and Gormully.\nSolicitors for respondent:\u2014Macdonnell and Mudie.\n[1] 2 Ont.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAssessment of Ships\u201437 Vic., c. 30, sec. 1, and 27 Vic., c. 81, Rev. St. N. S.\u2014 Vessels not registered in Halifax not liable.\nK. resides and does business in the city of Halifax, and is owner of ships which are not registered at the City of Halifax, and which have never visited the Port of Halifax. Under the authority of 37 Vic. c. 30 sec. 1 and 27 Vic., c. 81 secs. 340, 347, 361, Rev. St. N. S., the assessors of the City of Halifax valued the property of K. and included therein the value of said vessels.\nHeld: That vessels owned by a resident, but never registered at Halifax, and always sailing abroad, did not come within the meaning of the words \"whether such ships or vessels be at home or abroad at the time of assessment,\" and therefore were not liable to be assessed for city taxes.\nAppeal from a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favor of the respondent on a special case submitted to that court for determination.\nThe following is the special case entered:\n\"Case entered into by consent of parties for argument before the Supreme Court at Halifax, between the City of Halifax and Thomas E. Kenny.\n\"Thomas E. Kenny resides and does business in the City of Halifax, and is the owner of ships which are not registered in Halifax.\n\"The assessors of the City of Halifax have valued the property of the said Thomas E. Kenny liable for city rates, and have included therein the value of said vessels, as if they had been within the city at the time of assessment. Said vessels were never in the port of Halifax.\n\"The question for the opinion of the court is\u2014whether or not the said Thomas E. Kenny is liable, under the laws in force in relation to the City of Halifax, to be assessed for city taxes in respect to said vessels, or on account of his being the owner of them.\n\"If the Court should be of opinion that the said Thomas E. Kenny is liable to pay such taxes, judgment to be entered against him for the City of Halifax for the costs of preparing this case and argument, otherwise judgment to be entered for the said Thomas E. Kenny against the City of Halifax for such costs.\n\"It is, however, expressly agreed, that this case shall not stay or interfere with the collection of the rates for this year, and no judgment shall involve the repayment by the city of any rates already assessed.\"\nThe statutes which bear upon the\" question are the following:\n37 Vict., c. 30, s. 1, (1874):\n\"The city council shall have power to assess on the inhabitants and the property within the city annually, such sum of money not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars, as may be necessary to defray the expenses which are by law authorized to be incurred on behalf of the city.\"\n(This is, so far as this question is concerned, a re-enactment of section 330 of 27 Victoria, c. 81, (the city charter). Section 330 was repealed and a new section substituted by 33 Vic., c. 47 ss. 1 and 2 The substituted section last aforesaid was itself repealed, and the section above set forth substituted therefor.)\n27 Victoria, c. 81, (The Halifax City Charter of 1864.)\n\"s. 340. The assessment shall be rated on the occupants of real estate, being yearly tenants, and in all other cases on the owners of property, by an equal pound rate upon the value of the real and personal estate within the city, whether such real and personal estate shall be possessed, occupied or owned by individuals, or by any joint stock company or corporation, and whether owned by parties resident or absent, according to the best knowledge and discretion of the city and ward assessors, subject to the exemptions hereinafter specified. The city council may direct the assessment to be made in the autumn of any year for the ensuing year, after the assessment has been made and the city rates imposed.\"\n\"Sec. 347. Under the term 'personal estate,' shall be included all household furniture, moneys, goods, chatties, wares and merchandise, kept in public or private premises, or in the Queen's or other public warehouses: all ships and vessels, or shares in ships or vessels, owned by persons residing or having offices, or doing business within the city, whether such ships or vessels be at home or abroad at the time of assessment; also all public stocks, except provincial and city debentures of the said city of Halifax: there shall also be included under the term personal estate, stocks in public or private banking companies, water, gas, fire, marine, or life insurance companies, or associations, or other joint stock companies or corporations, whether public or private, doing business within the city; and all moneys belonging to the inhabitants of the city, invested in public or private securities within the city, and all bullion and coin, of gold or silver, all province notes, and notes of solvent banks, in the province or elsewhere, which may be in the possession, and the property of any citizen, or in the custody of a bank, or other party, or moneys deposited on deposit receipt, shall be considered as his moneys, and be assessed accordingly.\"\n\"Sec. 361. As soon as the whole amount of real and personal property, on which any person, company, or corporation is to be assessed within any ward of the city, is determined, the city assessor shall serve or cause to be served a notice of such valuation upon the person assessed, or his agent, or on the company or corporation, their officer, clerk, or agent. This notice shall be in the following form, in print or ink:\nWard No.\nNAMES.\nValue of Real Estate as tenant or owner.\nValue of personal property.\nTotal amount on which Assessment is to be levied.\n\"I hereby give you notice that the assessors, to the best of their judgment, have made the above valuation of your real and personal estate within ward No.\u2014\u2014 of the city of Halifax, on which assessment for the current year is to be levied. If you wish to object thereto you are hereby notified to furnish me at my office in the city Court House, within fourteen days from this date, with a written statement under oath according to the form herewith served upon you.\"\n\"To Mr. City Assessor.\nDated at Halifax, day 18 \"\nThese notices are to bear date on the days which they are respectively served.\n\"After the service of the notice, fourteen days shall be allowed to the parties to be rated, or their agents, to furnish the city assessor with a written statement under oath of the real and personal estate in the following form: Statement of real and personnl property within Ward No.\u2014of the City of Halifax, liable to assessment.\n$ cts.\n1. Real estate in possession of subscriber not rented to yearly tenants, estimated at ten times the yearly rent or value 2. Household furniture and movable property in dwelling and premises occupied by subscriber\n3. Goods, wares and merchandize, within the ward\n4. Moneys in possession or in bank, &c.\n5. Ships or vessels, or shares and interest therein, whether at home or abroad\n6. Moneys invested in mortgage, or other security whatever, in the city.\nTotal amount\n$\"\n\"In making this statement, each item or class of property shall be separately valued; and the amount admitted under each of the six classes of assessable property shall be separately stated; and the assessor shall not be bound to adopt such statement where each is not expressly valued.\"\n\"The return of ships or vessels or shares therein shall, in every case, be made by the party rated in the affidavit or return by him or them made, in the ward in which such person shall reside. Such return or statement shall be verified in every instance by an affidavit in the form following:\"\n39 Vict., Chap. 32, s. 10.\n\"The failure to levy a Poll Tax has not affected nor shall it affect or diminish the validity or legality of any assessment made and levied within the City of Halifax.\"\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for appellants:\nThe point is whether a ship is at home at Halifax because her owner lives at Halifax. There are a number of authorities which establish beyond a doubt that a state can tax persons residing in the state for the personal property outside of the state. I submit also, that on the principle \"that personal property follows the person,\" and the property in question being movable and personal, and the Respondent's residence in Halifax being admitted (that being necessary to give jurisdiction to the city authorities), the case falls clearly within the scope of the Act above cited.\nThe case of Nickle v. Douglas[1], relied on by respondent, is not applicable, for under the Act of the Ontario Legislature personal property within the Province was alone assessable, and the property taxed was stock in a bank doing business outside the Province.\nThat the Legislature of Nova Scotia has power, for municipal purposes, to authorize the assessment of personal property elsewhere, but owned by persons within the Province, is undoubted, and the only question here is whether the Legislature have clearly exercised that power, which, it is submitted, must be established from a correct construction of the statute referred to.\nThe learned counsel relied on the following authorities: Bulstrode, p. 355; Tupper v. Treasurer of the Hospital of St. Peter Port[2]; The King v. Hull Dock Co.[3]; Re Ewing[4]; Thompson v. Advocate-General[5]; Minturn v. Hays[6]; Peabody v. County Comrs.[7]; Reman v. Shepherd[8]; Barratt v. Henderson[9]; Re Hood's Estate[10]; Lott v. Mobile[11]; Hilliard's Law of Taxation[12].\nMr. Gormully for respondent:\u2014\nIn order to interpret secs. 340 and 347 conferring the power of assessment they should be read together, and it will then be seen that the probable legislative intent was to authorize first the assessment of all inhabitants in respect of their property within the city, and then the assessment of all non-residents in respect of their property within the city. Possibly more felicitous language could have been found which would have defined more clearly and precisely the extent and the limits of the power intended to be conferred. But if the language used is at all vague or uncertain, if it gives rise to a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court whether the right to assess personal property is confined to personal property within the city or not, then the appellants, by virtue of a familiar canon of construction applicable to all tax laws, must certainly fail. The canon referred to is that \"every charge upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language.\" In Wroughton v. Turtle[13], Parke, B., says, that it is a well settled rule of law that every charge upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous words. See also Cooley on taxation[14], where a number of the English authorities are collected; Nickle v. Douglas[15]. The cases cited by the appellant are not applicable, they are founded on the maxim of jurisprudence that personal property follows the person, which is not applicable to the present case.\nThe maxim should be confined in its operation to cases of bankruptcy, marriage and succession.\u2014(See Wharton conflict of Laws. s. 311). It has no application to such property as ships, which have an actual situs when considering their locality for taxing purposes. The actual situs of a British ship for taxing purposes is her home port and her port of registry. This was the decision in The King v. White[16], cited in Mr. Justice Weatherbe's judgment; it was also so decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, in Hayes v. The Pacific Mail Co.[17], and Morgan v. Parham[18].\nAll principle and all analogy to be derived from statutes in pari materia seem to favor a construction which would, if possible, cut down the jurisdiction of the appellants to property within their territorial limits.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nI think this property could not be taxed. Under the act, I think, the rate upon the value of the real and personal estate means the real and personal estate within the city, it does not mean by fiction of law property which is in England. As regards ships, at home or abroad at the time of assessment, it must mean ships which have been registered at Halifax, the Port of Registry of a ship being her home port. It is too late now to raise the question whether appellant's vessels should have been registered at Halifax, Halifax being the place of the owner's residence. We must assume the vessels were properly registered. There can be no doubt, as the case is put, that the appellant's vessels were not registered at Halifax, and have never been in Halifax, and so never were at home in the port of Halifax, nor actually or constructively within the city of Halifax, and therefore do not come within the terms of section 347, of 27 Vic. ch. 81. Rev. St. N. S., which says:\nAll ships and vessels, or shares in ships or vessels * * * whether such ships or vessels be at home or abroad at the time of assesssment.\nUnder these circumstances, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred. GWYNNE, J:\u2014\nThe reasons given by the court below are conclusive, and I concur with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Wm.

S., ultra vires\u2014Queen's Counsel, Power of Appointment of\u2014Letters Patent of Precedence, not retrospective in their effect\u2014Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia,\u201440 Vic., c. 3, D.\nBy 37 Vic., c. 20, N.S. (1874), the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Nova Scotia was authorized to appoint provincial officers under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province. By 37 Vic., c. 21, N.S., (1874), the Lieutenant Governor was authorized to grant to any member of the bar a patent of precedence in the Courts of the Province of Nova Scotia. R., the respondent, was appointed by the Governor General on the 27th December, 1872, under the great seal of Canada, a Queen's Counsel, and by the uniform practice of the Court he had precedence over all members of the bar not holding patents prior to his own. By letters patent, dated 26th May, 1876, under the great seal of the Province, and signed by the Lieutenant Governor and Provincial Secretary, several members of the bar were appointed Queen's Counsel for Nova Scotia, and precedence was granted to them, as well as to other Queen's Counsel appointed by the Governor General after the 1st of July, 1867. A list of Queen's Counsel to whom precedence had been thus given by the Lieutenant Governor, was published in the Royal Gazette of the 27th May, 1876, and the name of R., the respondent, was included in the list, but it gave precedence and preaudience before him to several persons, including appellants, who did not enjoy it before.\nUpon affidavits disclosing the above and other facts, and on producing the original commission and letters patent. R., on the 3rd January, 1877, obtained a rule nisi to grant him rank and precedence over all Queen's Counsel appointed in and for the Province of Nova Scotia since the 26th December, 1872, and to set aside, so far as they affected R.'s precedence, the letters patent, dated the 26th May, 1876. This rule was made absolute by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on the 26th March, 1877, and the decision of that Court was in substance as follows:\u20141. That the letters patent of precedence, issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, were not issued under the great seal of the Province of Nova Scotia; 2. That 37 Vic., c. 20, 21, of the Acts of Nova Scotia, were not ultra vires; 3. That sec. 2, c. 21, 37 Vic., was not retrospective in its effect, and that the letters patent of the 26th May, 1876, issued under that Act could not affect the precedence of the respondent. On the argument in appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada the question of the validity of the Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia was declared to have been settled by legislation, 40 Vic., c 3, D., and 40 Vic., c. 2, N.S. A preliminary objection was raised to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the appeal. Held,\u20141. That the judgment of the Court below was one from which an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada; (Fournier, J., dissenting.)\n2. Per Strong, Fournier and Taschereau, J.J.,\u2014That c. 21, 37 Vic., N.S., has not a retrospective effect, and that the letters patent issued under the authority of that Act could not affect the precedence of the Queen's Counsel appointed by the Crown.\n3. Per Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.:\u2014That the British North America Act has not invested the Legislatures of the Provinces with any control over the appointment of Queen's Counsel, and as Her Majesty forms no part of the Provincial Legislatures as she does of the Dominion Parliament, no Act of any such Local Legislature can in any manner impair or affect her prerogative right to appoint Queen's Counsel in Canada directly or through Her representative the Governor General, or vest such prerogative right in the Lieutenant Governors of the Provinces; and that 37 Vic. c. 20 and 21, N. S., are ultra vires and void.\n4. Per Strong and Fournier, J.J.:\u2014That as this Court ought never, except in cases when such adjudication is indispensable to the decision of a cause, to pronounce upon the constitutional power of a Legislature to pass a statute, there was no necessity in this case for them to express an opinion upon the validity of the Acts in question. Appeal from a Rule of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia made on the 26th March, 1877, ordering that the rank and precedence granted to Joseph Norman Ritchie, Esquire, the respondent, be confirmed, and that he have rank and precedence in the said Supreme Court over all Queen's Counsel appointed in and for the Province of Nova Scotia since the 26th day of December, 1872.\nThe following are the material facts of the case:\nThe respondent, a barrister of the Province of Nova Scotia, was appointed to be one of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law in and for the Province of Nova Scotia on the 26th December, 1872, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Canada.\nOn the 7th May, 1874, the Legislature of Nova Scotia passed an Act whereby it was declared and enacted that it was, and is, lawful for the Lieutenant Governor, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia, to appoint from among the members of the Bar of Nova Scotia such persons as he may deem right to be, during pleasure, Provincial officers under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province of Nova Scotia[1].\nOn the same day the same Legislature passed another Act entitled, \"An Act to regulate the precedence of the Bar of Nova Scotia\"[2].\nBy the first section of this Act it was enacted that the following members of the Bar should have precedence in the following order: The Attorney General of the Dominion of Canada, the Attorney General of the Province, members of the Bar who were before the 1st July, 1867, appointed Her Majesty's Counsel for Nova Scotia, so long as they are such Counsel, according to such seniority of appointment as such Counsel.\nThe second section is as follows: \"Members of the Bar from time to time appointed after the 1st July, 1867, to be Her Majesty's Counsel for the Province, and Members of the Bar, to whom from time to time Patents of Precedence are granted, shall severally have such precedence in such Courts as may be assigned to them by Letters Patent, which may be issued by the Lieutenant Governor under the Great Seal of the Province.\"\nThe third section enacts \"that the remaining members of the Bar shall, as between themselves, have precedence in the Courts in the order of their call to the Bar.\"\nThe fourth section preserves the right and precedence of Counsel acting for Her Majesty or for the Attorney-General in any matter depending in the Courts in the name of Her Majesty or of the Attorney-General. On the. 27th May, 1872, Letters Patent, under the seal used as the Great Seal of the Province, were issued by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, appointing appellants, together with other barristers, \"to be, during pleasure, Provincial officers under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province of Nova Scotia,\" The patent was as follows: \u2014\n\"DOMINION OF CANADA,\n\"Province of Nova Scotia.\n[L.S.]\n(Sgd.)

Ritchie, Esq.\"\nSubsequently, the prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia at Halifax, in making up the dockets, &c., gave the appellants, with others, precedence over the respondent, which had not been accorded to them since the date of the respondent's appointment in 1872. Thereupon, on the third of January, 1877, the respondent obtained from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia the following rule nisi.\n\"Supreme Court Halifax, S. S.\n\"In the matter of the application of Joseph Norman Ritchie, for the recognition of his rank and precedence as Queen's Counsel.\n\"On hearing read the Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Canada, dated the 26th day of December, A. D., 1872, appointing the said Joseph Norman Ritchie one of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law, the affidavits of the said Joseph Norman Ritchie, sworn to on the twelfth and twenty-seventh days of December, 1876, and the exhibits annexed thereto, and the documents or Letters patent, dated on the twenty-seventh day of May, A. D., 1876, with reference to Queen's Counsel and filed in this Court on the seventh day of November last. It is ordered that the rank and precedence granted to the said Joseph Norman Ritchie by said Letters Patent of 26th December, A. D., 1872, be confirmed, and that he have rank and precedence in this Court over all Queen's Counsel appointed in and for the Province of Nova Scotia, since the said 26th day of December, A. D., 1872, on the following grounds:\n\"1. Because the Letters Patent of 26th December, 1872, give rank and precedence to Mr. Ritchie, as a Queen's Counsel from the date thereof, which have never been legally taken away.\n\"2. Because the document or Letters Patent of the 27th May, 1876, does not in any way affect said rank and precedence.\n\"3. Because said last mentioned document is not Letters Patent issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia under the Great Seal of that Province.\n\"4. Because no Patents of Precedence have been granted to any Queen's Counsel appointed after the 26th December, A. D., 1872, giving them rank and precedence over Mr. Ritchie.\n\"5. Because no Letters Patent, or Patents of Precedence, have been granted giving the Queen's Counsel appointed since 26th December, A.D., 1872, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Canada, precedence over Mr. Ritchie.\n\"6. Because chapter 24 of the Acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, for 1874, and all Letters Patent, or other documents granted thereunder, are illegal and ultra vires, in so far as they may affect the rank and precedence of Mr. Ritchie, as granted to him by the Letters Patent of 26th December, 1872.\n\"7. Because last mentioned chapter has not a retrospective effect.\n\"8. Because the Act of the Local Legislature of Nova Scotia, namely: Chapter 20 of the Acts of 1874, under which certain barristers were appointed Queen's Counsel by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, by the document or Letters Patent of the 27th May, A. D., 1876, is ultra vires, and such appointments are therefore invalid and of no effect.\n\"9. Because the Acts authorizing the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia to appoint Queen's Counsel, and to give precedence to certain members of the Bar of Nova Scotia, were not passed until long after the grant of the Letters Patent conferring the rank and precedence on Mr. Ritchie and cannot affect the rights thereby conferred.\n\"10. And for other grounds appearing from the said papers, affidavits and exhibits, unless cause to the contrary be shewn before the Court on the third Saturday of February next ensuing.\n\"And it is further ordered that a copy of this rule be served upon each of the following Queen's Counsel and Barristers, viz.:\u2014C. B. Owen, Esquire; S. H. Morse, Esquire; Henry Pryor, Esquire; William Howe, Esquire; Henry A. Grantham, Esquire; The Honorable P. C. Hill; Peter H. Le Noir, Esquire; M.H.

D., 1877.\n\"By the Court.\n(Signed) \"M. I. WILKINS,\n\"Prothonotary.\"\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, by a majority of Judges, made the rule absolute on the second of the above grounds, maintaining the validity of the acts mentioned, and also held that the seal affixed to the patent was not the true Great Seal of Nova Scotia.\nThe case was twice argued before the Supreme Court of Canada, in consequence of the resignation of two of the Judges who heard the first argument.\nAs to the validity of the Great Seal, before the second argument before the Supreme Court, two acts had been passed to settle this question[3], and therefore, no further reference need to be made to it.\nA preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondent to the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the appeal, on the ground that the rule absolute in this case was not a \"judgment,\" from which an appeal will lie under the 17 sec. of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, but the Court decided to hear the appeal on the merits.\nMr. Haliburton for appellants:\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has held that the Great Seal in use by the Government is invalid, and that, therefore, all grants, patents, &c., issued under it are void, and this ground is relied on in respondents factum. If that Court was right, the patent of precedence is merely waste paper, and the question at issue is disposed of at the outset. We contend that that Court should not have entered into the question, because the Court must receive the Great seal without proof of authenticity.\n\"Absolute faith is universally given to every document purporting to be under the Great Seal, as having been duly sealed with the authority of the Sovereign\"[4]. \"Royal grants are matters of public record\"[5], and as such import truth upon their face[6]. Lord Melville's case[7], is always referred to as the leading case, but on referring to it we find that it merely appears that the Great Seal was received without further proof, but the point was not discussed in it. The only treatise on the Great Seal, excepting a work of no value by Boyden, is one of Prynne's Parliamentary Tracts, entitled: \"The opening of the Great Seal of England;\" written at a time when Parliament was hesitating about making a new Great Seal in place of that that had been carried off by Charles I. Baron Maseres in the \"Canadian Freeholder,\" II, 238, 243, goes fully into this subject.\n[STRONG, J.: But I thought the Great Seal question was settled by a Dominion Statute?]\nI contend that, so far as this case is concerned, that question has been disposed of by 40 Vic. c. 3., D.\u2014\nNo question arises here as to whether the Crown had issued Letters Patent granting what did not belong to the Crown, or what was not within the exercise of its prerogative, precedence at the Bar being beyond question a matter of prerogative.\nThe only question here is whether the Crown through its Keeper of the Great Seal has not issued Letters Patent of Precedence which affect rights granted under previous Letters Patent. Mr. Ritchie claims that he has vested rights under his Patent which cannot be superseded, or affected.\nThe eighth ground relied on by him in his factum is the same as in his Rule nisi, and is the only one that touches upon the validity of chapter 21 of Acts of 1874, or of the Patent of Precedence issued under it: \"Because Cap. 21 of the Acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia for 1874, and all Letters Patent or other documents granted thereunder, are illegal and ultra vires, in so far as they may affect the rank and precedence of Mr. Ritchie as granted to him by Letters Patent of the 26th December, 1872.\"\nThe Crown, unless controlled by statute, can issue second Letters Patent which operate by way of extinguishment of previous Letters Patent. 17 Vin. (93 M. B. 5.) 100, 109, (Q. B. 2.) Sec. 8. See argument of Atty. General, also judgment of Court In re Bedard[8].\nTo prevent error or surprise on part of the Crown, 6 H. VIII. c. 15 makes second Letters Patent void where they do not refer to previous Letters Patent. But where there are no fees or emoluments attached to subject of grant, such recital is not considered necessary. Vin. 109. Q. B.; The King v. Foster, 2 Freeman 70.\nThough a subject may be injured by the issue of such subsequent Letters Patent, yet they must be recognized and respected by the Court until duly cancelled by issue of scire facias by leave of the Crown, such Letters Patent being not void, but only voidable.\n\"When a patent is granted to the prejudice of a subject, the King of right is to permit him, upon his petition, to use his name for the repeal of it in scire facias at the King's suit, to hinder multiplicity of actions on the case.\" 2 Vent. 344. 17 Vin. 98, 100, 109, 115, 122 (u. b) 155, sb. \"Scire facias may issue to revoke grants injurious to the rights and interests of third parties; though if the patent be void in itself, non concessit may, it seems be pleaded without a scire facias.\" Chitty on Prerog. ch. 12. s. 3. (cites 3 Comm. 260. 2 Rol. Ab. 191. S. pl. 2.) Sir Geo. Mackenzie says that by the law of Scotland, which on this point we find the same as that of England, the validity of second Letters Patent must be raised, not by pleading, but by an application to have them cancelled. \"No right once passed under the Great Seal can be annulled by way of exception, but only by way of reduction. When double rights are passed, the first is put to the necessity of a reduction\"[9].\nWe contend that 37 Vict. c. 21 and Letters Patent issued thereunder are not, as contended for by respondent, \"illegal and ultra vires in so far as they may affect the rank and precedence of Mr. Ritchie, granted to him by the Letters Patent of the 26th December, 1872.\"\nAs respects the precedence of Queen's Counsel appointed since 1867, sec. 2 of 37 Vic., c. 21 is merely declaratory, and did not alter or abridge the previous right of the Lieut.-Governor to issue the Letters Patent of precedence in question. See James N. S. R. 182.\nAs that Act refers to matters exclusively reserved for the Local Legislatures, it is not ultra vires so far as the rights of the Dominion Parliament are concerned.\nIt cannot be contended that the Act is ultra vires because it may lead to the passing of Letters Patent which may affect the priority of persons claiming precedence under Letters Patent issued since 1867 under a Greater Seal by the Governor-General. The Patent of 1854, issued by the Lieutenant Governor to Mr. Uniacke, gave him precedence over Queen's Counsel holding Patents directly from the Queen. The commission and instructions of the Governor General are unchanged, so far as any right to issue Letters Patent of Queen's Counsel is concerned.\nA Provincial Act within the limits of local legislation may, if assented to, limit the Royal prerogative as fully as if it were an Act of Parliament, or a Dominion Act within the scope of Dominion Legislation. The effect of the assent given to the Prince Edward Island Land Act is in point\u2014it being held by the Crown that it was bound by the assent given to that Act, and that the prerogative was thereby limited.\nThe Crown does not regard this Act as infringing upon its prerogative, as it was passed at the suggestion of the Imperial Government.\n\"When an Act of Parliament doth authorize the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper to make or grant any commission under the Great Seal, he may make or grant the same without any further warrant, because the King is a party to the Act of Parliament, and there cannot be a greater warrant to the said Chancellor than an Act of Parliament.\" 4 Inst., ch. 29, p. 169.\nFrom 1863 the use of the Royal Warrant was dispensed with by a dispatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the case of all appointments except in the Admiralty Court.\nThe intent of the Act and of the Letters Patent of precedence is clear and explicit.\nNo reasonable doubt can exist that the Legislature by this Act proposed to regulate the precedence of all Queen's Counsel not appointed prior to July, 1867, as it was entitled \"An Act to regulate the precedence of the Bar of Nova Scotia,\" and was passed with the sole object of enabling the Lieutenant Governor to assign to the Queen's Counsel whom he might appoint such relative rank as he might think fit, as respects the Queen's Counsel that had then been appointed since July 1st 1867.\nSection 2 of the Act provides that Members of the Bar appointed Queen's Counsel since July 1st, 1867, and members of the Bar to whom, from time to time, Patents of Precedence maybe granted, \"shall severally have such precedence as may be assigned to them by Letters Patent, which may be issued by the Lieut.-Governor under the Great Seal.\"\nThe Act being therefore clear, the intent of the Letters Patent of Precedence, which profess to carry out the provisions of the Act, is equally clear. After appointing seventeen Members of the Bar Queen's Counsel, the Letters Patent, reciting sec. 2 of the Act, proceed: \"we do hereby assign to the several persons above appointed, precedence in the following order, that is to say\" \u2014. It then gives, according to the dates of their being called to the Bar, the names of thirty-four Queen's Counsel, including the seventeen first appointed and all not appointed prior to July 1867. By this list the appellants, who were then appointed Queen's Counsel, have rank given to them before Mr. Ritchie who had been appointed in 1872.\nThe Court is asked by Respondent to adopt one of two interpretations.\n1st. (In direct contradiction to the very words of the Letters Patent), that they only regulated the precedence of the Queen's Counsel then appointed \"as between each other,\" and not \"as to all members of the Bar whose precedence is not fixed by the said Act,\" (i. e. all not appointed prior to July, 1867).\n2nd. A nugatory and absurd intent\u2014that though the Patent of Precedence proposed to give some of the Queen's Counsel then appointed precedence before Mr. Ritchie, it did not affect his precedence as respects them.\nIt is impossible to see how the Court, unless it is able to cancel or ignore the Letters Patent, can assume that a list of precedence which includes Mr. Ritchie by name was not intended to affect his precedence.\nEven if he had not been mentioned, his precedence would have been affected by implication. The commission of a Justice of the Peace may be superseded \"by a new commission, which virtually but silently discharges all the former justices not named therein, for two commissions cannot exist at once.\" 1 Comm. 353.\nAs the Act in question provides that members of the Bar from time to time appointed after the first day of July, A.D. 1867, to be Her Majesty's Counsel for the Province, &c., shall severally have such precedence in such Courts as may be assigned to them by Letters Patent which may be issued by the Lieutenant-Governor under the Great Seal, he can claim no precedence not assigned to him by such Letters Patent.\nThere are no vested rights in Patents of Queen's Counsel, or Patents of Precedence, but the Crown as \"the Fountain of Justice and of honors\" can at all times, at its will, regulate precedence at the Bar. The Attorney-General In re Bedard[10] contended that \"the Crown by Letters Patent can give precedence at pleasure, except so Jar as this prerogative is limited by Statute.\" \"All degrees of nobility and honor are derived from the King as their fountain, and he may institute what new title he pleases. It is a part of the prerogative at common law. No one can doubt that the Queen can give precedence among Queen's Counsel. The Court decided in that case that Letters Patent of precedence to a Judge affecting precedence under previous Letters Patent were valid. \"A custom has for some time prevailed of granting Letters Patent of Precedence to such barristers as the Crown thinks proper to honor with that mark of distinction, whereby they are entitled to such rank and preaudience as are assigned in their respective patents, sometimes next after the Attorney General, but usually next after Her Majesty's Counsel then being.\" 3 Comm. 28. See also James N. S. R. 182. 4 Inst. 167, 362. 1 Comm. 272. Chitty Prerog. 77, 82, 107, 112, 132, 330 note g., also 331. Manning's Case of the Sergeants, 127. Droit Public de Domat, Liv. i. tit. ii. sec. 2 p. 10, (Fol. Ed 1745).\nIn ex parte Robinson[11], the Court refused to enquire into the issue of Letters Patent by a Governor and Council superseding previous Letters Patent, the office in question being held at will.\nRespondent's application is irregular and unprecedented.\nEven assuming that no Act had been passed, authorizing the Lieutenant-Governor to issue Letters Patent of Precedence, or, if passed, that it was ultra vires, and that the Keeper of the Great Seal improperly and without any warrant affixed the signature of Royalty to Letters Patent of Precedence, yet these are matters between the Crown and its Keeper of the Great Seal, into which the Court cannot enquire, but it must recognize the Letters as valid and binding upon the Court until an Act of Parliament has been passed to annul the Patent, or the Crown itself issues a scire facias to cancel it. \"The Great Seal shall always be credited, and where the certificates under it are not strictly true, there is no remedy but an Act of Parliament, or by authority of the Chancellor of England to cause parties to bring them into Chancery\"[12].\nThat the Crown to this day jealously preserves its prerogative of enquiring into the validity of its grants, is clear from the fact that in the recent Supreme Court of Judicature Act, whereby it was proposed to transfer to the new Court of Appeal the Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, as well as of the House of Lords, and of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, one of the few things reserved was \"any jurisdiction vested in the Lord Chancellor in relation to grants of Letters Patent, or the issue of Commissions or other writings to be passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom.\" 36 and 37 Vict. c. 66, s. 17. \"By this section it will be seen that the most important branch of the existing Common law jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, viz: holding plea by scire facias to repeal a patent, is not given to the High Court. It is supposed that this will be retained as a personal jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, as it is not given to the High Court, and of course, not to the Court of Appeal.\" See Griffith, Sup. Court of Judic. Act, p. 17.\nThe prerogative of the Crown of directing scire facias to issue to repeal its grants is not vested in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. See Rev. Stat. (4th series), c. 106, s. 1; c. 95, s. 1 and 7; c. 11, s. 18. Roy n'est lie par auscun Statute, si il ne soit expressement nosme. See Chit. Prerog. 366,383, 374. Broom Leg. Max, 74, 75.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was asked to pronounce these Letters Patent to be void, in proceedings to which the Crown was not made a party, though there is not a single authority or precedent to be found for such a course, nor has any been cited in support of Mr. Ritchie's application.\nMr. Ritchie's application is highly irregular and unprecedented, inasmuch as, instead of praying the Crown to sue out a Scire Facias to cancel its Patent, he takes proceedings to which the Crown is not made a party, and without citing a single precedent or authority in support of his application, he asks the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in a summary way to cancel or ignore Letters Patent that have been granted under the Great Seal.\nIt is therefore contended that, as the Great Seal is the official signature of Royalty, these Letters Patent are a Royal grant as fully as if issued by the Lord Chancellor, or by the Queen herself; that they do not come within the class of Royal grants which a series of Statutes have rendered void, and which the Courts of Law can therefore treat as void; that, if voidable, it can only be by Scire facias issued in the name and by leave of the Crown; that this remedy was open to Mr. Ritchie when he took these proceedings, and is still open to him should he consider himself injured by these Letters Patent.\nIn all matters that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Local Legislature, the Lieutenant Governor represents the Queen, and all powers enjoyed by him prior to Confederation in relation to the organization of the courts and the administration of Justice were confirmed by the B. N. A. Act.\nThe act regulating precedence having been passed at the suggestion of the Crown, thereby received the previous assent of the Crown, and also subsequently received the assent of its representative the Lieutenant Governor.\nIn The Queen v. Burah[13] it was held, where the prerogative of pardon had been exercised by the official governing a newly created district in India, that \"where plenary powers of Legislation exist as to particular subjects, whether in an Imperial or Provincial Legislature, they may in their Lordships' opinion be well exercised either absolutely or conditionally.\"\nTne B. N. A. Act gives the Provincial Legislature, as respects a large number of important subjects, \"exclusive powers of legislation.\" If in these matters plenary powers are not possessed by it, where do they exist?\nMr. Ritchie has not questioned the validity of the act, except so far as it affects his precedence. Any decision of the Court which goes beyond this, and decides that the Lieutenant-Governor is not the Queen's Representative, and that the Queen is no part of Provincial Legislatures, is a serious one, that vitally concerns the whole Dominion. This is a constitutional question which was not argued before.\nSupposing the Patent void, or rather voidable, we are dealing with the Lieutenant-Governor here as Keeper of the Great Seal, an office which does not necessarily require the person holding it to be the Queen's Representative. The Keeper of the Great Seal in England is not the Queen's Representative, If he has improperly used the Great Seal, there are recognized modes of cancelling the patent.\nIt cannot be said that the Queen has not authorized the issue of this patent, for it is signed by the Sovereign. The B. N. A. assented to by the Crown continued to the Provinces the use of their Great Seals, and the Great Seal is recognized everywhere as \"the most solemn signature of the Sovereign\" Whether the Crown was wise in allowing its signature to be used by the Lieutenant-Governor is not a question for this Court. It has authorized the use, and the signature must be recognized and respected, until the patent is properly cancelled by scire facias, or an Act of Parliament.\nWhether the title of Queen's Counsel is a legal rank or a title of honour does not arise here, as the patent of Queen's Counsel issued in 1876, under c. 20 of Acts of 1874, did not affect Mr. Ritchie's rank under his patent of 1872. The patent of precedence, however, issued under c. 21 did affect him, and the only question for our consideration is as respects its validity. It confers no rank or status outside the Courts, and is merely a mode of regulating the business of the Courts by specifying the order in which Counsel will be heard.\nI find the responsibility unexpectedly thrown upon me of defending the status hitherto claimed and enjoyed by Lieutenant-Governors, and Provincial Legislatures, and I therefore do not profess to do so, as the subject was not discussed in the argument before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. It was quite unexpected by me, and apparently also by respondent, who, in his factum, has given no authority or reference on this point, except the Governor-General's Commission, which as respects these questions is the same as before the Union. The subject is of such grave public importance that it is to be hoped it will not be necessary under the circumstances for the Court to consider it.\nMr. Cockburn, Q.C., for respondent:\nI will not follow the learned Cousel in his argument as to the great seal, that question has, so far as this case is concerned, been disposed of by the Statute of Canada, 40 Vic., c. 3. I contend, however, that the Statute of the Province of Nova Scotia, 37 Vic., c. 20, respecting the appointment of Queen's Counsel, and so much of the Statute 37 Vic. c. 21, as affects the right of precedence and of preaudience of Queen's Counsel, are ultra vires, and that the letters patent of 27th May, 1876, issued under the authority of the latter statute, are wholly inoperative.\nThe appointment of Queen's Counsel is a prerogative of the Crown, and no such power is conferred on the Lieutenant Governors of Provinces, nor could the Provincial Legislatures under the constitution (see B. N. A. Act, sec 92) legislate on any subject of prerogative law. By the royal commission granted to the Governor General under the great seal of the United Kingdom certain limited powers to represent the Crown in its prerogative rights are conferred (paragraph 3 clearly embraces the appointment of Queen's Counsel). But the royal instructions which accompany the commission guardedly require that all bills passed by the Parliament of Canada which touch the prerogative shall be reserved for Her Majesty's pleasure. And while the Provincial Legislatures may enact laws for the amendment of their own' constitutions, they are prohibited from altering the office of the Lieutenant Governor (B. N. A. Act, sec. 92, sub-sec. 1), so that unless this officer has power conferred upon him by the Constitutional Act to represent Her Majesty in the exercise of her prerogative powers, he can neither do so now, nor can he at any future time be empowered to do so by the Legislature of the Provinces. The office of the Lieutenant Governor is defined in sec. 58 and 59. He is the representative of the Governor General, not of the Queen; he assents to bills in the name of the Governor General, not of the Queen, and in the exercise of his powers withholds bills for the Governor General's, and not for the Queen's assent. All the laws of the Parliament of Canada are made by the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Commons. The Queen is present, and is a constituent part of Parliament. She does not merely assent to bills, she is also an enacting party; not so with the Provincial Legislatures. Those bodies exclusively make the laws within the limit of their authority. While the most jealous care is taken in the B. N. A. Act to provide for the speedy transmission of authentic copies of all bills passed by the Parliament of Canada for Her Majesty's pleasure, no similar provision exists as to the Provincial Legislatures. The Queen may be wholly unadvised and uninformed as to the laws they are enacting, and there exists no necessity for supervision, inasmuch as Imperial and Prerogative questions do not fall within the scope of their powers.\nThere have been three important occasions in which the powers of the Lieutenant-Governors, in respect of their being representatives of the Crown, have been brought up for consideration since the Confederation.\nThe first was the claim of the Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick to exercise the pardoning power (see the report of the Minister of Justice, 21st of December, 1868, and the despatch of Lord Grenville to the Governor-General of 24th of February, 1869.)\nThe second was the question as to the amnesty claimed to have been promised by the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba in the Lepine case. (See the despatch of Lord Carnarvon of 7th of January, 1875.)\nOn both of these occasions the pretension was clearly refuted and refused.\nThe third occasion arose (indirectly) on the question of the Ministerial responsibility of the Governor General's advisers for his disallowances of Bills passed by the Local Legislatures within the scope of their powers. See the report of the Minister of Justice, 22nd December, 1875, in which he says: \"The powers of Provincial Legislatures are, by their constitution, limited to certain subjects of a domestic character, so that their legislation can affect only Provincial, and at most, Canadian interests. Provincial Acts to the extent to which they may transcend the competence of the Legislature are inoperative ab initio, there is no power to allow them nor can any attempt at allowance give them vitality, so that void Acts left to their operation are void altogether.\" * * * * The contention of this state paper was that the Dominion Government alone should supervise and control the provincial legislation.\nThe theory that the Queen is bound by certain statutes because she is an assenting party, has no application to the Provincial statutes. These must stand or fall on a strict interpretation of the powers of the Local Legislatures. The two Acts in question are clearly ultra vires for the reasons given, and the Letters Patent appointing Mr. LeNoir and others to be Queen's Counsel must therefore fall to the ground.\nIn any case those statutes could not have had a retrospective effect so as as to annul the right of preaudience already granted to Mr. Ritchie under the Great Seal of the Dominion. On the constitutional question, the learned Counsel referred to Sessional papers, 1867 and 1868, Vol. 1 No. 22; Sessional papers, 1869, Vol. 2, No. 16; Sessional papers, 1875, Vol. 8, No. 11; Sessional papers, 1876, Vol. 9, No. 116; return to an address for correspondence relating to the appointment of Queen's Counsel, Session of 1873, No. 50; British North America Act, sections 9, 17, 91, 92 (sub-sec. 1), 56, 58, 59; Mr. Todd's Pamphlet on a Constitutional Governor, p. 29; Chitty's Prerogative, pp. 107, 331; Bac: abr: Title Prerogative.\nI further submit that the writ of scire facias is not as contended for the only proceeding to avoid Letters Patent, their validity may be questioned in actions at law, Perry v. Skinner[14]; William's Saunders rep.[15]; Foster on Scire Facias[16]. As to the Crown being bound generally by Acts of Parliament, see Weymouth v. Nugent[17]; also that statutes should be construed so as not to operate retrospectively against vested rights, Perry v. Skinner[18], (cited above); Thisleton v. Frewer[19]; Maxwell on Statutes[20]; Dwarris on Statutes[21]. Finally that powers conferred by the Legislature, such as to the power to regulate the Bar, should be exercised not arbitrarily as was done here, but with sound and judicial discretion. Lee v. Buda & Torrington Ry. Co.[22]; Marshall v. Pittman[23]; Maxwell on Statutes[24].\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nWas of opinion that the Nova Scotia statute did not affect the precedence of Queen's Counsel appointed by the Crown, and that consequently the Court was not called upon to pronounce upon the Constitutional power of the Legislature to pass that statute. He was therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.:\u2014\nL'Intim\u00e9, J. N. Ritchie, avocat du barreau de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 Conseil de la Reine, par lettres patentes sous le grand sceau du Canada, le 26 D\u00e9cembre 1872.\nLe 7 Mai 1874, la l\u00e9gislature de la Nouvelle-Ecosse a pass\u00e9 deux actes, les ch. 20 et 21,\u2014le premier, autorisant le Lieutenant-Gouverneur \u00e0 nommer des Conseils de la Reine pour cette province\u2014le deuxi\u00e8me, lui donnant le pouvoir de r\u00e9gler l'ordre de pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance entre eux.\nLe 27 Mai 1876, l'Appelant et plusieurs autres membres du barreau de la Nouvelle-Ecosse furent nomm\u00e9s Conseils de la Reine en vertu de lettres patentes leur donnant rang et pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l'Intim\u00e9, Le protonotaire de la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, ayant cru devoir se conformer \u00e0 ces lettres patentes dans la pr\u00e9paration du r\u00f4le des avocats, assigna \u00e0 l'Appelant et \u00e0 d'autres une pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance qu'aucun d'eux n'avait eu sur l'Intim\u00e9 auparavant. Ce dernier obtint de la Cour, le 3 Janvier, 1877, une r\u00e8gle pour se faire r\u00e9int\u00e9grer et maintenir dans l'ordre de pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance dont il \u00e9tait en possession depuis le 26 D\u00e9cembre 1872, date de ses lettres patentes.\nC'est du jugement d\u00e9clarant cette r\u00e8gle absolue que le pr\u00e9sent appel est interjet\u00e9.\nLes principales questions soulev\u00e9es en cette cause sont: 1o. Si le jugement rendu sur cette r\u00e8gle le 26 Mars 1877 est susceptible d'appel \u00e0 cette Cour: 2o. Si les ch. 20 et 21, 37 Vic., des Statuts de la Nouvelle-Ecosse ne sont pas au-del\u00e0 de la juridiction de la l\u00e9gislature; 3o. Si ces actes peuvent avoir un effet r\u00e9troactif affectant la position des Conseils de la Reine nomm\u00e9s en vertu de lettres patentes \u00e9mises sous le grand sceau du Canada avant la passation des deux Statuts en question.\nUne autre question \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 attach\u00e9 une importance consid\u00e9rable\u2014celle de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du grand sceau avec lequel les lettres patentes du 7 Mai 1876 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 scell\u00e9es, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9, pendente lite, r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par deux lois, l'une du Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et l'autre de la l\u00e9gislature de la Nouvelle-Ecosse\u2014il devient en cons\u00e9quence inutile de s'en occuper. Je me contenterai de dire que je partage l'opinion exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet par le juge en chef Sir William Young.\nApr\u00e8s avoir eu beaucoup de doute sur la question, de savoir s'il y avait lieu \u00e0 l'appel d'un jugement rendu dans une instance, introduite comme l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle dont il s'agit, par une motion pour obtenir une r\u00e8gle nisi, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que cette Cour a juridiction dans le cas ou le jugement qu'elle rendrait, soit pour affirmer ou infirmer le jugement dont il y a appel, serait de nature \u00e0 \u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution.\nEn effet la clause 17, d\u00e9finissant la juridiction d'appel de cette Cour, n'a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'exercice de ce droit d\u00e9pendrait du mode de proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9 en Cour de premi\u00e8re instance pour faire valoir ses droits. Le mot \"case\" employ\u00e9 dans cette section n'est pas synonime de \"cause,\" il a une signification plus \u00e9tendue et s'applique \u00e0 toutes les proc\u00e9dures au moyen desquelles on peut arriver \u00e0 un jugement sur ses droits dans une Cour de juridiction sup\u00e9rieure.\nPour donner le m\u00eame droit d'appel dans toutes les provinces il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'employer une expression d'une signification aussi \u00e9tendue que celle-l\u00e0. Si ce droit e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s la nature du mode de proc\u00e9dure, ou action, il en serait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 que dans certains cas, \u00e0 cause de la diff\u00e9rence des syst\u00e8mes de proc\u00e9dure existant dans les diverses provinces de la Puissance, un jugement sur une m\u00eame question aurait pu \u00eatre appelable dans une province et ne pas l'\u00eatre dans l'autre. C'est, sans doute, pour \u00e9viter un semblable inconv\u00e9nient et donner, sauf certaines restrictions, l'appel d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la sec. 17 de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame d\u00e9clare, en se servant de cette expression tr\u00e8s vague, qu'il y a appel dans les cas o\u00f9 se rencontrent les conditions suivantes, savoir: 1o. Que le jugement dont on veut appeler soit un jugement final de la plus haute Cour de dernier ressort; 2o. dans le cas o\u00f9 le jugement est d'une Cour Sup\u00e9rieure exer\u00e7ant une juridiction en premi\u00e8re instance ou d'appel, mais d\u00e9cidant en dernier ressort. Pour qu'il y ait appel il suffit que l'une ou l'autre de ces conditions se rencontrent, quelle que soit d'ailleurs la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der qui ait pu \u00eatre employ\u00e9e pour arriver \u00e0 jugement. La signification du mot case employ\u00e9 dans notre acte est au moins aussi \u00e9tendue que celle du mot suit qui se trouve dans la 25e section de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame des Etats-Unis, et dont le juge en chef Marshall a donn\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition suivante:\nThe term (suit) is certainly a very comprehensive one, and is understood to apply to any proceeding in a Court of justice, by which an individual pursues that remedy in a Court of justice, which the law affords him. The modes of proceeding may be various, but if a right is litigated between parties in a Court of justice, the proceeding by which the decision of the Court is sought, is a suit[25].\nEt Story on Const. U. S.[26].\nWhat is a suit? We understand it to be the prosecution, or pursuit of some claim, demand or request. In law language, it is the prosecution of some demand in a Court of justice. The remedy for every species of wrong is, says Judge Blackstone, \"the being put in possession of that right whereof the party injured is deprived.\" The instruments whereby this remedy is obtained, are a diversity of suits and actions, which are defined by the Mirror to be the \"lawful demand of one's right; or, as Bracton and Fleta express it, in the words of Justinian, jus prosequendi in judicio, quod alicui debetur...\nOr, le jugement en question en cette cause \u00e9tant final, du moins sur la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, et rendu par une Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (la Cour Supr\u00eame de la N.-Ecosse) d\u00e9cidant en dernier ressort,\u2014ce jugement se trouve sous ce rapport dans les conditions voulues par le statut pour qu'il y ait appel. Dans deux causes o\u00f9 les instances ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9es comme dans le cas actuel, par motion, cette cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 decid\u00e9 qu'il y avait appel,\u2014ce sont les causes de Wallace vs Bossom, [27]et Wilkins vs Geddes.[28]\nAussi, je serais dispos\u00e9 pour ces raisons \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer le jugement comme susceptible d'appel si, d'ailleurs, il s'y rencontrait deux autres conditions que je consid\u00e8re essentielles pour donner juridiction: c'est 1o. que le jugement n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qu'exercent les Cours pour la conduite des affaires et le maintien de la discipline pendant leurs s\u00e9ances; et 2o. que le jugement rendu f\u00fbt susceptible d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution.\nPour s'assurer si ces deux conditions existent dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il est utile de se rappeler les termes de la motion qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la base du jugement. Quel est d'apr\u00e8s cette motion l'objet de la contestation, the matter of record? c'est la demande de pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance que l'Intim\u00e9 fait en ces termes:\nThat it be ordered that the rank and precedence granted to the said Joseph Norman Ritchie by said letterspatent of 26th December, A.D. 1872, be confirmed, and that he have rank and precedence in this Court over all Queen's Counsel appointed in and for the province of Nova Scotia since the said 26th day of December A.D. 1872.\nC'est l\u00e0 toute la demande; suivent les raisons au nombre de dix, donn\u00e9es \u00e0 son appui. Elle se r\u00e9duit donc exclusivement \u00e0 la question d\u00e9 pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur les C. R. nomm\u00e9s depuis le 26 D\u00e9cembre 1872, in and for the Province of Nova Scotia, quoique les raisons invoqu\u00e9es pour la faire triompher, attaquent la validit\u00e9 des deux statuts en vertu desquels ces nominations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. Mais ce ne sont pas ces propositions de droit qui constituent la demande.\nBien que le jugement sur cette motion soit une reconnaissance du droit de l'Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur l'Appelant, il n'en laisse pas moins subsister les lettres patentes conf\u00e9rant \u00e0 celui-ci la distinction de C. R. En effet, on ne pouvait les faire d\u00e9clarer nulles que par le moyen d'un scire facias, ou d'un quo warranto, peut-\u00eatre; dans tous les cas, on ne pouvait atteindre ce but que par une proc\u00e9dure demandant sp\u00e9cialement l'annulation de ces lettres patentes. Toute proc\u00e9dure de ce genre e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 longue et aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 la mise en cause de la Couronne. Le meilleur moyen de mettre un terme, au moins temporairement, \u00e0 un conflit qui se manifestait devant la Cour et d'en \u00e9viter les d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables cons\u00e9quences, \u00e9tait sans doute de s'adresser \u00e0 la juridiction sommaire de la Cour concernant la conduite des affaires le maintien du bon ordre et de la discipline \u00e0 faire observer pendant les s\u00e9ances des tribunaux. C'est ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en adoptant le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 suivi en cette cause. Mais dans l'exercice de ce pouvoir, les d\u00e9cisions des Cours Sup\u00e9rieures sont sans appel; elles \u00e9chappent \u00e0 toute r\u00e9vision, si ce n'est \u00e0 celle du comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9, lorsqu'il y a\" eu condamnation \u00e0 l'amende ou \u00e0 l'emprisonnement. Je crois pour cette raison que l'appel ne devrait pas \u00eatre admis.\nUn autre motif qui me porte \u00e0 croire que, dans le cas actuel, il ne devrait pas y avoir d'appel, c'est que le jugement de cette cour qui infirmerait celui de la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse serait inex\u00e9cutable.\nC'est un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral auquel cette cour est soumise, comme tous les autres tribunaux, qu'une cour n'a pas juridiction dans les cas o\u00f9 le jugement qu'elle prononcerait ne serait pas susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution, Pour qu'un jugement soit ex\u00e9cutable, il faut que la cour puisse faire mettre la partie r\u00e9clamante en possession de ce qui fait l'objet de sa demande, ou \u00e0 d\u00e9faut qu'elle lui accorde une indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire, ou enfin qu'elle puisse prononcer une condamnation par corps contre la partie r\u00e9calcitrante.\nPour faire voir la difficult\u00e9, pour ne pas dire l'impossibilit\u00e9 de faire ex\u00e9cuter le jugement de cette cour, supposons qu'elle infirme le jugement de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance et qu'elle reconnaisse aux Appelants le droit de pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance qu'ils r\u00e9clament sur l'Intim\u00e9. Qu'arriverait-il dans ce' cas? Comment et contre qui s'ex\u00e9cuterait le jugement? Pourrait-on faire \u00e9maner un bref quelconque adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Sir Wm, Young, le juge en chef de la Cour inf\u00e9rieure, pour lui enjoindre de reconna\u00eetre la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance des Appelants? Et s'il s'y refusait, serait-il lanc\u00e9 contre lui un ordre pour m\u00e9pris de cour? Les jugements s'ex\u00e9cutent contre les parties et non pas contre les juges. Les Appelants auraient-ils au moins quelques moyens de forcer l'Intim\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9sister de sa pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance ou de le contraindre \u00e0 refuser de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'interpellation que lui adresserait le juge en chef nonobstant notre jugement? Aucun, certainement, le jugement ne serait donc dans ce cas qu'une expression d'opinion qui resterait lettre morte.\nSi je ne puis pr\u00e9sumer qu'une Cour inf\u00e9rieure se refusera \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution des jugements de cette Cour dans les cas ordinaires, parce qu'ils seraient contraires aux siens,\u2014je n'ai peut-\u00eatre pas tort de, croire que dans un cas comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 il s'agit de l'exercice d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui n'est pas soumis \u00e0 notre contr\u00f4le, elle se croirait justifiable de ne pas s'y conformer, afin de conserver intacts ses pr\u00e9rogatives et son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Dans le cas suppos\u00e9, nous serions expos\u00e9s \u00e0 voir la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, malgr\u00e9 notre opinion contraire, maintenir sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision. Rien de semblable ne pourrait arriver, si au lieu de s'adresser \u00e0 la juridiction disciplinaire de la Cour, on e\u00fbt attaqu\u00e9 par scire facias la validit\u00e9 des lettres patentes. Dans ce cas, le jugement s'ex\u00e9cuterait comme tous les autres et il n'y aurait pas de conflit possible entre les deux Cours. Je serais port\u00e9 pour ces motifs \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que cette Cour n'a pas juridiction, et qu'elle devrait s'abstenir de juger. Mais comme je suis sous l'impression que je suis seul \u00e0 entretenir cette opinion, je donnerai bri\u00e8vement les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision sur le m\u00e9rite de la question soumise.\nApr\u00e8s la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, des difficult\u00e9s s'\u00e9lev\u00e8rent dans les provinces d'Ontario et de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, au sujet du pouvoir des Lieutenants-Gouverneurs de nommer des Conseils de la Reine. Cette question affectant la pr\u00e9rogative royale, fut, pour cette raison, r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 du Canada au Secr\u00e9taire d'Etat pour les Colonies, afin d'obtenir l'opinion des officiers en loi de la Couronne. Le m\u00e9moire du Conseil Priv\u00e9, sign\u00e9 par Sir John Macdonald, apr\u00e8s avoir cit\u00e9 le paragraphe 14 de la section 92, relativement \u00e0 l'organisation des tribunaux, contient la d\u00e9claration suivante:\u2014\nUnder this power, the undersigned is of opinion, that the legislature of a province, being charged with the administration of justice and the organization of the Courts, may, by statute, provide for the general conduct of business before those Courts; and may make such provision with respect to the bar, the management of criminal prosecutions by counsel, the selection of those Counsel, and the right of pre-audience, as it sees fit. Such enactment must, however, in the opinion of the undersigned, be subject to the exercise of the royal prerogative, which is paramount, and in no way diminished by the terms of the Act of Confederation.\nA cette partie du m\u00e9moire le ministre des Colonies, Lord Kimberley, a fait la r\u00e9ponse suivante que l'on trouve dans sa d\u00e9p\u00eache du 1er f\u00e9vrier 1872:\u2014\nI am further advised that the legislature of a province can confer by statute on its Lieutenant Governor the power of appointing Queen's Counsel; and with respect to precedence or pre-audience in the Courts of the province, the legislature of the province has power to decide as between Queen's Counsel appointed by the Governor General and the Lieutenant Governor, as above explained, Le juge en chef, Sir Wm. Young, dans les motifs de son jugement sur cette cause, parlant de l'effet de cette correspondance sur les deux actes en question, s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nAmong the grounds taken in the rule it is urged that the 20th and 21st chapters of the Provincial Acts of 1874 are ultra vires, and the appointments under them invalid and of no effect. But the Crown, through its Secretary of State, having authorized such enactments and the Acts having gone into operation, this contention is quite untenable.\nLa d\u00e9cision de cette cause ne l'exigeant pas, je n'examinerai pas la question de savoir si la r\u00e9ponse de Lord Kimberly, faisant conna\u00eetre l'opinion des officiers en loi, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme comportant en m\u00eame temps un consentement suffisant de la part de Sa Majest\u00e9 pour autoriser la l\u00e9gislation qui s'en est suivie. Il me suffit de dire que je reconnais la sagesse de la r\u00e8gle qui fait pr\u00e9sumer en faveur de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 des actes l\u00e9gislatifs, et qui porte les tribunaux \u00e0 n'examiner la question de leur validit\u00e9 que dans le cas seulement o\u00f9 la solution de la question soumise au tribunal l'exige imp\u00e9rieusement. La pr\u00e9sente cause n'offre pas un de ces cas-l\u00e0, et la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 laquelle je viens de faire allusion doit ici recevoir son application. La question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider ici est bien moins de savoir si les actes en question sont ultra vires, que de savoir si l'un d'eux, le ch. 21, peut avoir un effet r\u00e9troactif affectant les lettres patentes du 26 d\u00e9cembre 1872, accord\u00e9es \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9. Il est en cons\u00e9quence tout-\u00e0-fait inutile de s'occuper de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de ces deux actes, et on ne pourrait le faire dans la pr\u00e9sente cause sans violer la r\u00e8gle mentionn\u00e9e plus haut. Pour ce motif je m'abstiendrai de me prononcer sur la validit\u00e9 des actes attaqu\u00e9s, limitant mes observations \u00e0 la question de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par rapport au ch. 21.\nLa 2me section de ce chapitre est en ces termes:\nMembers of the bar from time to time appointed after the 1st day of July 1867, to be Her Majesty's Counsel for the provinces, and members of the bar to whom from time to time patents of precedence are granted', shall severally have such precedence in such Courts as may be assigned to them by letters patent, which may be issued by the Lieutenant Governor under the Great Seal of the Province.\nLes Appelants pr\u00e9tendent que les termes de cette section donnent un pouvoir absolu au gouvernement provincial d'assigner aux C. R. qu'il nommera en vertu de cet acte, rang et pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur ceux nomm\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieurement par Sa Majest\u00e9 ou son repr\u00e9sentant. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est certainement erron\u00e9e. Cette section est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e dans les termes dont on se sert pour donner effet aux lois pour l'avenir seulement. Elle ne contient pas une seule des expressions employ\u00e9es ordinairement pour leur donner un effet r\u00e9troactif. Admettre la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de cette loi serait une violation de la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'interpr\u00e9tation suivante:\nIt is a general rule that all statutes are to be construed to operate in future, unless from the language a retrospective effect be clearly intended.\nIl serait inutile de citer ici d'autres autorit\u00e9s sur ce principe. Il me suffit de dire que je m'appuie aussi sur les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es dans la cause de The Queen vs. Taylor,[29] d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par cette Cour, au sujet de l'effet r\u00e9troactif que l'on voulait donner \u00e0 une section de l'acte qui constitue cette Cour.\nMe fondant sur ces autorit\u00e9s je suis d'opinion que la section du chapitre 21, ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, n'a point d'effet r\u00e9troactif; que les lettres patentes donnant rang et pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance aux Appelants ne doivent pas avoir plus d'effet que l'acte lui-m\u00eame, ni affecter en aucune mani\u00e8re la position de l'Intim\u00e9.\nJe suis en cons\u00e9quence d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. HENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on an application sustained by affidavits of the Respondent, asserting a right of precedence as Queen's Counsel over the Appellant, he, the respondent, having been appointed by the Governor-General in Council, previous to the appointment as Queen's Counsel of the appellant by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in Council, under an Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, passed subsequent to the appointment of the respondent, and by which precedence over the respondent was given to the appellant. The Court of Nova Scotia, while upholding the constitutionality of the Act, held that, while the right to regulate the matter of precedence generally appertained to the Local Legislature, it had not by the act exercised the power to the extent of giving precedence to Counsel appointed under it over those previously appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and that it consequently had no retrospective operation. I feel bound to dissent from that proposition.\nThe second section of chapter 21 provides that:\nMembers of the Bar from time to time appointed after the first day of July, in the year of our Lord 1867, to be Her Majesty's Counsel for the Province, and members of the Bar, to whom from time to time patents of precedence are granted, shall severally have such precedence in such Courts as may be assigned to them by Letters Patent, which may be issued by the Lieutenant Governor under the Great Seal of the Province.\nThe retrospective operation is not only seen, but the limit of it is to be back to a certain date. How then can I conclude the Legislature did not mean what it so plainly says? This section in plain words is retrospective. It provides that all Queen's Counsel appointed after the first day of July, 1867, with those subsequently appointed shall have the precedence awarded them by the letters patent to be subsequently issued. Both classes are by the provision put upon the same footing, and an individual is to have precedence irrespective of any position he formerly held. If, indeed, the words were merely that Queen's Counsel thereafter should have the precedence awarded by the patents, for the issuing of which it provided, a question might then be fairly raised that it was not intended to be applied to previous appointments; but here the provision by unmistakable language includes all appointed since the date specially limited, and applies as forcibly to the respondent as to the appellant. The words \"from time to time\" in the section do not only authorize the interference with the patents issued since the date mentioned, but would, in my judgment, authorize the change \"from time to time\" of the precedence given by any patent previously issued under the same section. Having arrived at these conclusions, it becomes necessary to ascertain whether the Local Legislature had the power to pass an Act with such a provision.\nIn the argument before us it was contended, as it had been previously, that the Act of the Local Legislature was ultra vires; and that the patent of the appellant was not verified by the affixing thereto of the seal contemplated by the Act and was therefore void. In the view I take of the first objection it is unnecessary to refer to the second; and as, through the means of subsequent legislation, any doubts upon that question have been removed, I shall, passing it by, devote my consideration to the one first mentioned.\nThe Act in question was passed in 1874, and to decide the point raised it is necessary to ascertain the extent of the functions of the Provincial Legislatures and their right, if any, to deal with the matter of the appointment of Queen's Counsel, and to confer on the Lieutenant-Governor in Council the power of awarding precedence to Counsel in the Provincial Courts. No special reference is made to the subject in the British North America Act, or in the powers given by it to the Local Legislatures; and, unless included in and covered by the general provisions of sub-section 14 of section 92 for \"the administration of justice in the Province,\" and \"the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts,\" it is difficult to discover whence the Local Legislatures derive any power over it.\nThe Local Legislatures are now simply the creatures of a statute, and under it alone have they any legislative powers. The Imperial Parliament by the Union Act prescribed and limited their jurisdiction; and, in doing so, has impliedly but virtually and effectually prohibited them from legislating on any other than the subjects comprised in the powers given by that Act. The right of the Imperial Parliament, when conferring legislative powers on the Local Legislatures, to limit the exercise of them cannot be questioned; and any local Act passed beyond the prescribed limit, being contrary to the terms of the Imperial Act, must necessarily be ultra vires.\nThat the right of granting Letters Patent of Precedence to barristers is personal to the Sovereign, is a proposition that has never been questioned, and there is no record of any parliamentary attempt to interfere with its exercise. Chitty, in his work on \"Prerogative\" (at page 116), says:\u2014\nIf a Peer be disturbed in his dignity, the regular course, says Lord Holt, is to petition the King, and the King endorses it and sends it into the Chancery or the House of Peers, for the Lords have no power to judge of Peerage unless it be given to them by the King.\nAt page 118:\nTo the Crown belongs also the prerogative of raising practitioners in the Courts of Justice to a superior eminence by constituting them Sergeants, &c., or by granting Letters Patent of Precedence to such barristers as His Majesty thinks proper to honor with that mark of distinction, whereby they are entitled to such rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their respective patents.\nAt p. 107:\nThe Crown alone therefore can create and confer dignities and honors. The King is not only the fountain but the parent of them; nor can even an ordinance of the House of Lords confer Peerage.\nThe sovereign in England manifests his will by the issue of patents, but I can see no objection to the delegation, without any legislation, of the power to any immediate representative of the Crown to issue such patents within his territorial jurisdiction. The Imperial Parliament, by an Act assented to by the Sovereign, could, no doubt, otherwise provide for conferring dignities and for giving precedence to barristers in the Courts, and could specially authorize Colonial Legislation for that purpose; but, without that authority, I cannot discover, in the present constitution of the Local Legislatures, any power to deal with the subject.\nA despatch of Lord Kimberly, Colonial Secretary, in 1872, addressed to the Governor General of Canada, has been referred to as giving sufficient authority to Local Legislatures; but I feel bound to except to the affirmative ruling on that point in one, at least, of the judgments of the Court in Nova Scotia. His lordship in that despatch, after negativing the power of a Lieutenant Governor since the Union to appoint Queen's Counsel, says:\u2014\nI am further advised that the Legislature of a Province can confer by Statute on its Lieutenant Governor the power of such appointment, and, with respect to precedence and pre-audience in the Courts of the Province, the Legislature of the Province has power to decide as between Queen's Counsel appointed by the Governor General and the Lieutenant Governor, as above explained.\nThis despatch makes no reference to the source of the power thus attributed to the Local Legislatures, or of the advice upon which such is alleged; and I am, therefore, unable to consider the grounds upon which the position is taken; and for which otherwise I have been unable to find any authority. Unless within the scope of the Imperial Act we find evidence of the power in question, from what other source could it be derived? It is contended that, without any legislative power to deal with this subject, the Act of the Local Legislature is not ultra vires because, first, it is in the terms of that despatch; and, secondly, it has been assented to by the Governor General representing the Sovereign. The Sovereign could, no doubt, under her royal sign manual, give the necessary power to a Governor, but the mere despatch of a Colonial Secretary cannot be held sufficient to transfer to any body the exercise of a purely prerogative right of the Sovereign, when merely suggesting the usurpation of that right by a subordinate, or, indeed, any Colonial legislature. If, as I have already shewn, the Local Legislative power is limited by the Imperial Parliamentary authority which created it, a statutory prohibition is thereby interposed to legislate beyond the prescribed subjects, and that prohibition is operative to make void any Act embraced within any subject matter of such prohibition. This doctrine is applicable independently of any question of conflict in legislation between the Dominion Parliament and the Local Legislatures. The power of the Imperial Parliament in the matter of the creation and distribution of the Colonial Legislative powers is supreme, and no Colonial Secretary has ex officio the right by a despatch, or otherwise, either to add to, alter, or restrain any of the legislative powers conferred by the Imperial Act in question, or, indeed, by any Act, or to authorize a subordinate legislature to do so.\nThe special assent of the Queen to the Local Act, providing for the issuing of patents of legal precedence could not, in my opinion, validate it. The Local Legislatures have, as 1 have already stated, a prescribed and limited jurisdiction, and, if the subject in question is beyond their legislative limit, the mere sanction of the Queen could not validate the Act passed in reference to it.\nBut, as the Sovereign is the source of all honors and dignities, it is argued that the royal assent to the Act, however otherwise ultra vires, must be taken as a legislative declaration of the waiver and transference of the Sovereign's functions. Several difficulties, however, present themselves. The first is that by such a conclusion the Act of the Imperial Parliament would be extended, if not in part repealed. Second, if the Local Act be ab initio void, it cannot become law merely by the assent of the Sovereign. It might as well be claimed that an ordinance of a City or County Council of the same tenor, giving power to a Mayor or Reeve to appoint Queen's Counsel, if assented to by the Queen, would be valid? If the Imperial Statute has not given the necessary legislative power to the Local Legislatures, an Act of theirs would be of no higher value than a city ordinance such as I have stated. The argument of this question, however, is unavailable, for the Queen has not signified her assent to the Local Act in question. By the provisions of section 90 of the Imperial Act the Governor General, and not the Queen, assents to Local Acts made in his name as provided. The Lieutenant Governors are appointed not by the Queen, but by the Governor General in Council. It cannot, therefore, be successfully contended that the Queen has assented to the Local Act in question; nor can it be with greater success contended, that by assenting to it the Governor General had any power in doing so to interfere with the royal prerogative in question. It is not necessary to say what means directly used by the Sovereign would be operative to authorize the issuing of patents for the appointments in question. Some may be found, but it is only necessary at present to deal with the course which has been already taken.\nLooking then at sub-section 14 of section 92 let us ascertain the ground it covers:\u2014\nThe administration of justice in the Province including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts, and including procedure in civil matters in those Courts.\nThe matter of the administration of justice, the constitution, maintenance and organisation of Courts and procedure therein, has for centuries challenged and obtained parliamentary consideration in England, and statutes have been frequently passed to regulate them; but in none of them is found provision for the appointment of Queen's Counsel. The prerogative of the Sovereign has been universally and at all times admitted and exercised. Such being the case, how can we say that it was intended by the section in question, that the Imperial Statute should give to the Local Legislatures a power to regulate the appointment of Queen's Counsel, when Parliament itself, recognizing at all times the Royal Prerogative, exercised no such power. The legislative powers given by sub-section 14 are full and complete as far as they extend; and may be fully executed without including the right to provide for the appointment of Queen's Counsel.\nProvisions for such appointments are not necessarily included in those for the administration of justice, or for the constitution, maintenance, or organization of Courts; and, as at the time of the passing of the Imperial Act, the Royal Prerogative in regard to them had never been questioned in England, we are bound to conclude, in the absence of express legislation, that its Parliament did not intend to interfere with its exercise, and did not intend to give to subordinate Legislatures a power to deal with a subject which it had never itself exercised or contended for.\nIndependently of that construction, we have to be governed by the well settled doctrine that the Crown is not affected by legislation, unless specially referred to, and consequently that its fully admitted prerogative of regulating precedence at the Bar can only be affected, or taken away, by constitutional legislation in clear and express terms.\nI entirely agree with a remark contained in one of the judgments of the Court in Nova Scotia, that it would be ridiculous, and an absurdity,\nThat a scale of precedence should be adopted by the Lieutenant-Governor to-day to be over ruled by another framed in Ottawa tomorrow, and that reversed the next day by a fresh Gubernatorial Act in Nova Scotia.\nBut I cannot concur in the conclusion drawn that\nTherefore the Act confers on the Lieutenant-Governor the exclusive right of regulating the precedence of Counsel in this Province,\u2014\nfor the best of all reasons, that, in my opinion, the local statute is ultra vires\u2014gives no power to the Lieutenant-Governor to issue patents for such appointments\u2014and therefore no such ridiculous or absurd condition of matters can arise or exist. The anomally and absurdity would appear only by the improper assumption of the right by which they would be created, and the suggestion of them is rather an argument against the right claimed for the Local Legislature.\nThe preamble to the Local Act in question is as peculiar as illogical. It recites that\nWhereas the regulation of the bar in Nova Scotia is vested in the Provincial Legislature, it is expedient for the orderly conduct of business before the Provincial Courts that provision be made for the order of precedence of the members of such bar in such Courts.\nIt rests the right to legislate in respect to precedence upon the properly alleged right to legislate in respect to the bar generally, but the latter right, being limited short of the matter of precedence, cannot in its exercise affect that subject. It might have been considered expedient to deal with the matter of the appointment of Queen's Counsel, but that consideration has little value in determining the matter of legislative jurisdiction.\nIn England, the sovereign, as a general rule, uses the prerogative to confer honors and dignities upon eminent and deserving barristers, noted for the exhibition of superior legal talents and abilities and public services. The object of the Local Act in question, as the preamble exhibits, is not only very different, but novel.\nOn behalf of the appellant an objection was taken which demands notice. It is that the only mode of attacking the patent issued to him was by scire facias. Had the proceeding been to vacate or repeal a patent of the Crown, valid until set aside, the objection would have been good, but it does not require any such proceeding in a case where the fact of a valid patent having been issued is negatived, as it is in this case by an adjudication that the patent was ab initio void. It does not require a procedure by scire facias to avoid the consequences of an unauthorized patent. A scire facias admits the validity of a patent. A Court is asked, for reasons shown, to vacate or repeal it, in the same way as an action for divorce must be shown to be based upon a legal marriage. And, in an action for infringing a patent, a plea denying that it was issued would put in issue the validity of it.\nThe position of the respondent, as given by the patent under the Great Seal of Canada, when issued, was not only unassailed, but admitted at the arguments, and, as to it, I am not, therefore, called upon to express an opinion; and, as in my opinion, the subsequent local Act is ultra vires, I can come to no other conclusion than one in favour of the precedence acquired by the respondent under his patent. His application to the Court below was for the judgment of that Court in favoring and ordaining it, and the Court having so decreed, although on other and different grounds, I think, for the reasons I have stated, their judgment should be affirmed, and the appeal therefrom dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI am also of opinion that the judgment appealed from should be confirmed.\nI have come to this conclusion upon the ground taken by four of the learned Judges of the Court appealed from, that the second section of c. 21st, 37 Vic., of Nova Scotia, has not a retrospective effect. It can be construed as to have a prospective operation only, and must be so construed, upon the universally admitted rule that Courts of Justice will give all statutes a prospective operation only, unless their language is so clear as not to be susceptible of any other construction.\nBut I go further than the learned Judges, and I say that, if by this statute 37 Vic., c 21, entitled \"An Act to regulate the Precedence of the Bar in Nova Scotia,\" it was intended to invest the Lieutenant-Governor with the power of superseding the nominations of Queen's Counsel made by Her Majesty at Ottawa or in England, and consequently with the power of setting at naught Her Majesty's prerogatives in the Province of Nova Scotia, as regards Queen's Counsel and patents of precedence at the Bar, then the Act is ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nThough, with the view I take of the non-retroactivity of this c. 21, 37th Vic., it is not absolutely necessary for the solution of this case that I should consider the constitutional questions raised therein, yet, as they appear on the face of the record to form an important part of the issue between the parties, and have not only been considered by the learned Judges of the Court appealed from, but also have been fully and ably argued before us at the hearing, I feel that I cannot, by deciding the case on minor issues, rid myself of the responsibility of considering these grave and important questions, the determination of which this Court has been more specially created for.\nIt is perhaps better that I should first consider the statute authorizing the appointment by the Lieutenant-Governor of Queen's Counsel in Nova Scotia, 37 Vic. c. 20, as one of the respondent's contentions is that the appellants are not Queen's Counsel at all, and that the said chapter 20, under which they claim to have been named as such by the Lieutenant Governor, as well as chapter 21, under which the Lieutenant-Governor has assumed to give them precedence over the respondent, is ultra vires and inoperative.\nThis chapter 20 is in the following terms:\u2014\nWhereas the Lieutenant-Governor of right ought to have the power to appoint, from among the members of the Bar of Nova Scotia, Provincial Officers who may assist in the conduct of all matters on behalf of the Crown, under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the Law for such Province; and, whereas doubts have been cast on the power of the Lieutenant-Governor to make such appointments; Be it therefore declared and enacted, by the Governor, Council and Assembly as follows:\u2014It was and is lawful for the Lieutenant-Governor, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Nova Scotia, to appoint, from among the members of the Bar of Nova Scotia, such persons as he may deem right to be, during pleasure, Provincial Officers, under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province of Nova Scotia.\nNow, does this statute authorize the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia to confer the honour and dignity known as Queen's Counsel, the dignity which Her Majesty has, by one of Her prerogatives, the right to confer? I do not think so, and I will state why hereafter, but, if such was the intention of the Legislature, if this statute is taken as vesting the Lieutenant-Governor with Her Majesty's prerogative rights of appointing such Queen's Counsel, I hold, then, that it is ultra vires and an absolute nullity.\nIt is trite to say that the Sovereign is the fountain of honors and dignities. \"The Crown alone,\" says Chitty, \"can create and confer dignities and honours. The King is not only the fountain but the parent of them.\"[30]. It must also be admitted that, in the exercise of that prerogative, the Crown has the right to appoint King's or Queen's Counsel, and to grant Letters of Precedence to members of the Bar. \"To the Crown belongs also the prerogative of raising practitioners in the Courts of justice to a superior eminence, by constituting them sergeants &c., &c., or by granting Letters Patent of precedence to such barristers as His Majesty thinks proper to honour with that mark of distinction, whereby they are entitled to such rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their respective Patents\"[31]. And I may here add that these prerogative rights are rights inherent in the person of the Sovereign himself, which he alone, and without advice or consent, may exercise how and when he pleases. I need hardly add that the Sovereign has this prerogative of conferring honours and dignities over the whole of the British Empire, and that, by the British North America Act, the Crown has not renounced or abdicated this prerogative over the Dominion of Canada, or any part thereof.\nI will now proceed to state the grounds upon which I have come to the conclusion that this statute is ultra vires, if the Legislature intended thereby to give to the Lieutenant-Governor the power of appointing Queen's Counsel; I mean here, of course, the rank and honour known under this name throughout the British Empire. I will consider afterwards the appointment of the Provincial officers created by this statute in Nova Scotia under the same name.\nIt is now conceded, I believe, though the Nova Scotia Legislature seems to have been of a contrary opinion, that the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia had not, before the statute now under consideration, any such power. Indeed, there is not a single clause, a single word of the British North America Act upon which it can be seriously contended that the Lieutenant-Governors are vested with Her Majesty's prerogative rights of conferring such honours and dignities. It cannot be under section 65 of the Act, which defines the powers of the Lieutenant-Governors. The purport of this sec. (which applies only to Quebec and Ontario) is to give them the powers previously vested in the Governors, or Lieutenant-Governors, under any Act of the Imperial Parliament, or any Act of Upper Canada, Lower Canada, or Canada, and the dignity of Queen's Counsel does not exist in virtue of any such Act or Acts. It cannot be under section 58. This section merely enacts that\nFor each Province, there shall be an officer, styled the Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General in Council by instrument under the Great Seal of Canada.\nIn fact nowhere in the Act, can a single expression be found to sustain the contention that the Lieutenant-Governor has such a power. Well, if he has not this power in virtue of the British North America Act, how can the Provincial Legislature give it to him? In which clause of the Act can it be found that these Legislatures have such a right? Which part of section 92, where the subjects left under their control and authority are enumerated, gives them the power to legislate upon Her Majesty's prerogatives? There is a clause, it is true, giving them exclusive authority over the administration of justice, but, surely, the creation and appointment of Queen's Counsel has never been considered as a part of the administration of justice. They have the power to legislate on the Bar and its regulations, but the rank of Queen's Counsel, either here or in England, does not derive and never derived its origin from the Bar, or from the statutes incorporating the Bar, or defining its power and privileges and concerning it. The Legislatures of the different Provinces, before the Union, had also full power and authority over the administration of justice and the regulation of the Bar, in their respective Provinces, yet, I am not aware that they ever claimed the right to appoint Queen's Counsel. Then, under the rule that Her Majesty is bound by no statute, unless specially named therein, and that any statute which would divest or abridge the Sovereign of his prerogatives, in the slightest degree, does not extend to or bind the King, unless there be express words to that effect[32], even if the power of creating Queen's Counsel could ever have been interpreted to be included in the power over the administration of justice, it remains in Her Majesty, and in Her Majesty alone, as the Imperial statute does not specially give it to the Legislatures. The Legislatures have no more the right to authorize the Lieutenant-Governors to appoint Queen's Counsel in Her Majesty's name, than to appoint them themselves, or authorize any one else in the Provinces to do so. Yet, to contend that they have the right to so authorize their Lieutenant-Governors is to contend, not only that they can themselves make such appointments, but also that they can authorize any one else in the Province to do so. One is the consequence of the other. If they have it for the Lieutenant-Governor, they have it for any one else. To grant to these Legislatures the exercise of Her Majesty's prerogatives, or the power to give to any one the exercise of these prerogatives, it would require, in my opinion, a very clear enactment, and I cannot find it in the British North America Act. The appellant's contention, forsooth, is that the Provincial Legislatures have, under Confederation, more extensive powers, in the matter, than the Legislatures in the different parts of what is now Canada had before the Union. This proposition seems to me quite untenable.\nBut, said the appellants, Her Majesty has assented to this Act of the Nova Scotia Legislature. This, in my opinion, is a grevious error. Her Majesty does not form a constituent part of the Provincial Legislatures, and the Lieutenant-Governors do not sanction their bills in Her Majesty's name. The sections of the British North America Act on the respective constitutions of the Federal Parliament and of the Provincial Legislatures are now so well known that I need not here cite them. But I may perhaps refer to the sections concerning the sanction of the bills. As to the Federal Parliament, section 55 enacts that:\nWhere a bill passed by the Houses of Parliament is presented to the Governor General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to the provisions of this Act and to Her Majesty's instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Queens name, or that he withholds the Queen's assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Queen's pleasure.\nNow, by section 90 of the Act, this section 55, as regards the Provincial Legislatures, is to be read as follows:\nWhere a bill passed by the Provincial Legislatures is presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for the Governor-General's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to the provisions of this Act and to the Governor-General's instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Governor-General's name, or that he withholds the Governor-General's assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Governor-General's pleasure.\nAnd section 56, for the Provinces, must be read as follows: Where the Lieutenant-Governor assents to a bill in the Governor-General's name, he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the Act to the Governor-General, and if the Governor General in Council within one year after receipt thereof by the Governor-General thinks fit to disallow the Act, such disallowance (with a certificate of the Governor-General of the day on which the Act was received by him) being signified by the Lieutenant Governor by speech or message to each of the Houses of the Legislature or by proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the day of such signification.\nI really do not see on what the appellants can rely to support the contention that Her Majesty has sanctioned the Act now under consideration. It seems to me that the theory that the Queen is bound by certain statutes because she is a party thereto can have no application whatever to the Provincial statutes. In the Federal Parliament, the laws are enacted by the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons. Not so in the Provinces. Their laws are enacted by the Lieutenant Governors and the Legislatures. The Governor General is apppointed under the Royal Sign-Manual and Signet; the Lieutenant Governors are not even named by the Governor General, but by the Governor General in Council. They are officers of the Dominion Government. Their office, as the heads of the Provinces, is a very high and a very honourable one indeed, but they are not Her Majesty's representatives, at least quo ad the matter now under consideration, and so as to bind Her Majesty in any matter not left exclusively under the Provincial control by the British North America Act. I mean that, admitting the theory that the Provincial laws must be held to be enacted in Her Majesty's name, and I need not consider how far this may be admissible, this can be so only when such laws are strictly within the powers conceded to the Provincial Legislatures by the Imperial Act. When they go beyond the limits assigned to them, they act without jurisdiction. Her Majesty's authorization to make laws in Her name, which, according to this theory, she has given to them by the Imperial Act, can apply only to the laws passed within the limits assigned to them by the Act. They cannot avail themselves of that authorization to make laws outside of these limits.\nThe appellants further contend that, though it may be that the Lieutenant-Governor's sanction is not Her Majesty's sanction, the Act in question, not having been vetoed by the Governor-General, under the clause I have just cited, this is equivalent to a sanction of the Act by Her Majesty.\nWell, in the first place, the power of veto is given to the Governor-General in Council, not to the Governor General himself. And it cannot be contended that the Governor-General in Council is the Queen or the representative of the Queen, or that the Governor-General in Council exercises the prerogatives of the Queen, or can give, directly or indirectly, to any person or public body the right to exercise such prerogatives. (Of course, I speak here only of the power to grant dignities and honours.) The Governor-General, alone, exercises the prerogatives of the Queen in Her name in all the cases in which such prerogatives can be exercised in the Dominion by any one else than Her Majesty herself. So that it is impossible to say that Her Majesty is bound by a Provincial statute, because it has not been vetoed at Ottawa by the Governor-General in Council. It is well known that Provincial statutes cannot be disallowed in England, and that they are not transmitted to the Imperial authority, under the British North America Act, as the Federal statutes are.\nIn the second place, a Provincial statute, passed on a matter over which the Legislature has no authority or control, under the British North America Act, is a complete nullity, a nullity of non esse. Defectus potestatis, nullitas nullitatum. No power can give it vitality. Still less can it get vitality from the mere non-vetoing of the superior authority. In fact, the veto, in such a case, does not add to its nullity. It records it; it gives notice of it, but it cannot avoid what does not exist. Quod nullum est ipso jure, rescindi non potest. The Legislatures have the power conceded to them by the British North America Act, and no others. And no one, no authority (except the Imperial Parliament, of course) either impliedly or expressly can add to these powers, and give to these Legislatures a right or rights which they do not have by the Imperial Act. If they pass an Act ultra vires, this Act is null, whether it is vetoed at Ottawa or not. Still less can it be pretended, as it seems to have been in this case, indirectly at least, that the Imperial Secretary of State for the Colonies could add to the power of the Provincial Legislatures, or, which is equivalent to it, that the statute now under consideration is valid and legal because it has been approved of or authorized in England by a Secretary of State, or the Colonial Office, or because a high officer of state has given his opinion that the Provincial Legislatures had the power to pass such a statute. An interpretation of the law in a despatch from Downing Street is not binding on this, or any Court of Justice, and is not given as such. And the despatch referred to by the appellants does not purport to authorize the Provincial Legislatures to pass a statute appointing Queen's Counsel. It merely gives an opinion that they may do so in virtue of the British North America Act. How could any officer, either here or in England, give to the Provincial Legislatures other powers than those they have by the Imperial Act, or authorize the Lieutenant-Governors or any one else to appoint Queen's Counsel in Her Majesty's name, or give to the Provincial Legislatures the right to so authorize their Lieutenant-Governors.\nSo far, I have considered this Nova Scotia statute, 37 Vic., c. 20, as if the Provincial Legislature had purported thereby to vest the Lieutenant-Governor with one of Her Majesty's prerogatives, and to authorize the appointment by him of Queen's Counsel as such are usually named by Her Majesty, or by the Governor-General in her name; and I hold, that if such is the power which the legislature intended to assume, this Act is ultra vires and null.\nBut, as I have already mentioned, the Legislature of Nova Scotia, it seems to me, did not, by that Act, assume that power, and they have not thereby legislated on this dignity and honour of Queen's Counsel. They have merely appointed provincial officers connected with the administration of justice. They have guardedly stated in the preamble that it is Provincial officers that, in their opinion, the Lieutenant-Governor ought to have the right to appoint. And in the enacting clause, they simply authorize the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint Provincial officers. Now, no one can deny them their right to this legislation. These Provincial officers, it is true, are to be known under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province of Nova Scotia. But that does not make them of the rank and dignity of that name grantable by Her Majesty, and the statute does not pretend to make them so. It is a new Provincial office under the name that has been created in Nova Scotia, and nothing more. The Legislature had, in my opinion, full power and authority to do so. They can create Provincial offices for the administration of justice and call their officers by any name they choose. They can be Provincial officers known as Nova Scotia Queen's Counsel just as well as there can be Provincial officers known as Quebec Knights, Ontario Baronets, or Manitoba Lords. No one, probably, would have the least objection (at all events, it is not the objection raised in this case) to such Provincial titles being taken in the Province by such Provincial officers as would be authorized to do so by the respective Provincial Legislatures, no more than there is any legal objection, in this case at least, to the Provincial officers named in Nova Scotia under the statute in question taking the name of Queen's Counsel, so long as it is not in Dominion Courts, nor anywhere else out of Nova Scotia, and only as members of a Provincial officer or order that they lay claim to it, and without assuming to be of the rank of Queen's Counsel, known under that name in the Empire. And this may explain satisfactorily why this Act was not vetoed at Ottawa. It may have been considered as creating a Provincial office only, and so not affecting Her Majesty's prerogatives. The Act so taken being constitutional, the Federal authority had no reason for interfering and allowed the law to stand.\nBut the appellants read the Letters Patent naming them, issued under that law, as creating them of the same rank and dignity as the respondent, who has been appointed a Queen's Counsel by Her Majesty through the Governor-General in 1872. That is an error. If they read the statutes, they will see that, though they are called by the same name, it is only a new order or office which was created thereby; and a reference to their Letters Patent will convince them that it is merely of this order or new office that they have been appointed officers: \"Now know that we have appointed and do hereby appoint\" Messrs. Lenoir and Haliburton \"to be during pleasure\u2014Provincial Officers,\" say their Letters Patent. Evidently, these words \"Provincial Officers\" in the statute and in these Letters Patent have been inserted purposely, because the legislator was not prepared to openly and frankly assert his rights to legislate on one of the Queen's prerogatives, and he felt himself that his powers to do so were very doubtful.\nI say, then, that the appellants are not Queen's Counsel at all in the sense attached to this name in, for instance, the respondent's commission, and that, for this reason, independently of the reason I gave in the first instance, their appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed.\nNow, as to the other statute, the 31st Vic. c. 21 regulating the precedence of the Bar in Nova Scotia, little remains for me to say. Applying to it the principles which I have enunciated, and which must also govern it, I hold that though it may be legal in the enactment regulating the precedence of the Provincial officers named under the preceding statute between themselves, it is ultra vires and unconstitutional in so much as it purports to regulate the precedence between Queen's Counsel named by Her Majesty herself, or by the Governor-General in Her name, and in so much as it purports to give to other members of the Bar precedence over such Queen's Counsel. The Provincial Legislatures cannot, directly or indirectly, interfere with Her Majesty's prerogatives, or with Her acts done in the exercise of these prerogatives. As remarked by one of the learned judges in the Court below, it would be absurd if a scale of precedence could be adopted by the Lieutenant-Governor to-day, to be overruled by another framed at Ottawa to-morrow, and that reversed the next day by a fresh gubernatorial action in Nova Scotia. The learned judge is of opinion that to prevent such absurd consequences, it must be held that the Lieutenant-Governor has the exclusive right of regulating the precedence of counsel in the Province. This, I hold, cannot be done. Her Majesty's prerogative rights over the Dominion of Canada, as the fountain of honours, have not, in the least degree, been impaired or lessened by the British North America Act, and Her Majesty, as heretofore, either directly from England, or through the Governor-General from Ottawa, has the right to appoint Queen's Counsel and regulate the precedence at the bar[33]. This the appellants do not deny, but they claim that the Lieutenant-Governor has a concurrent power to exercise the same right in Her Majesty's name. Well, I repeat it, I cannot see that he has that power by the Imperial Act, and still less that the Provincial Legislature could invest him with it, and authorize him to so use Her Majesty's name. The confusion of powers and conflict of authority which would inevitably ensue if this right could be exercised in the Province as at Ottawa or in England cannot have been intended by the Imperial Act.\nThe Provincial Legislatures have the right to regulate the Bar, but they cannot, by any legislation, either directly or indirectly, limit or lessen Her Majesty's rights or render them inoperative. They cannot, in any degree, lessen or take from the ranks and dignities which it pleases Her Majesty to establish and confer. It would be a singular state of things, indeed, if a Queen's Counsel appointed by Letters Patent in England or Ottawa by Her Majesty could be the next day superseded in his rank by the Lieutenant-Governor, and put at the foot of the Bar by the issue of new letters of precedence. Yet, such is the appellants' contention, or, at least, where their contention leads to.\nMr. Ritchie, the respondent, was duly appointed a Queen's Counsel on the twenty-sixth day of December, 1872, by Letters Patent from Ottawa, under the Great Seal of Canada. On the twenty-seventh day of May, 1876, Letters Patent were issued, under the two Statutes, chs.20 and 21, to which I have referred, by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, purporting to name the appellants Queen's Counsel, and to give them precedence over Mr. Ritchie. The prothonotary of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, subsequently, in making up the dockets, &c., gave the appellants precedence over Mr. Ritchie. Of this Mr. Ritchie complained to the said Court, and obtained a rule nisi to confirm the precedence given to him by his Letters Patent of 1872, and to direct that he should have precedence in Court over the appellants. The Court granted his demand, and made the said rule absolute in the following terms:\u2014\nIt is ordered that the rank and precedence granted to the said Joseph Norman Ritchie by his Letters Patent of 26th December, 1872, be confirmed, and that he have rank and precedence in this Court over all Queen's Counsel appointed in and for the Province of Nova Scotia since the said 26th day of December, A. D., 1872.\nFrom this judgment and rule the appellants have brought the present appeal to this Court. I am of opinion their appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe respondent has raised three points of objection to the present appeal:\n1st. He contends, that the order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against which this appeal is brought is not one from which an appeal lies within the meaning of the statute constituting this Court; but that order is undoubtedly a final disposition of the matter relating to which it is made, and, if the contention of the appellants be well founded, materially impairs the legal rights of the appellants, and does, therefore, clearly, as it appears to me, constitute appealable matter.\n2nd. He contends, that the Letters Patent by which the appellants were purported to be made Queen's Counsel were not under the Great Seal of the Province as they professed to be. It was admittted on the argument, that we have been relieved by an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 40 Vic., c. 4, from the necessity of determining this point, and of entering into the interesting heraldic research which it seemed to open: from this necessity, however, in the view which I take, we should have been relieved independently of that Act.\nAnd 3rd, which is the sole objection on the merits, he contends that the appointment of Queen's Counsel is ultra vires of the Provincial Executive, and that the Act of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, 37 Vic., c. 20, (in virtue of which the appointment of the appellants is, by the Letters Patent under which they claim, professed to be made,) is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature. This latter point the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, while deciding in favor of the respondent upon other grounds, pronounced to be quite untenable, but, with great deference to the learned Judges of that Court, it seems to raise a very grave constitutional question.\nIt was not disputed, as indeed it could not be, that the right to appoint Queen's Counsel is a branch of the Royal Prerogative, that it, (equally with the power to grant Letter Patent of Precedence, to make Sergeants-at-law, Judges, Knights, Baronets, and other superior titles of dignity and honour) flows from the fountain of honour which has its seat and source in the person of royalty. In England, in point of form, a Queen's Counsel is the standing Counsel of the Queen, retained by her to be of her Counsel in all matters in which she may require his services. Substantially, the title is one of honour and professional rank, conferring precedence upon the person invested with the honour. Though, in point of fact, the recipients of this honour are nominated and selected by the Chancellor for the time being, yet, in point of form, the Queen's pleasure is taken upon their appointment.\nIn the Colonies the appointments were made sometimes, I believe, under the Royal Sign Manual, but. more usually by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the particular Province of whose Bar the recipient is a member, signed by Her Majesty's representative within the Province in virtue of the authority vested in him by his commission appointing him Her Majesty's representative, and in pursuance of royal instructions from time to time given to him, governing him in the execution of the powers vested in him in respect of matters in which the Royal Prerogative is concerned.\nAn Act of Parliament passed by the old Legislatures of the respective Provinces which now constitute the confederated Provinces of the Dominion of Canada, under the constitutions which they had before confederation, of which Legislatures Her Majesty was an integral part, as she is of the Imperial Parliament, upon being assented to by the Crown; was competent to divest Her Majesty of the right to exercise within the Province any portion of Her Royal Prerogative; but, at the time of the dissolution of those old Provincial constitutions, upon the passing of the B. N. A. Act, and of the creation of the new constitutions under which those Provinces were made members of the confederation now existing, there had been no Act passed detaching the right to appoint Queen's Counsel from the Royal Prerogative, or in any manner impairing or affecting Her Majesty's exclusive right to appoint them. The questions, therefore, which now arise are: Has the B. N. A. Act invested the Lieut-Governors of the respective Provinces constituting the confederation with the right and power to exercise this branch of the Royal Prerogative? or has it invested the Legislatures of those Provinces with any control over it? For, if Her Majesty is not, by that Act of Parliament, divested of this her prerogative right, it must follow from the nature of the new constitutions which that Act confers upon the several Provinces, that no Act of any of the Provincial Legislatures thereby constituted can in any manner divest Her Majesty of this or any other branch of her prerogative, or impair or affect her exclusive right to the exercise of it.\nIt is a well established rule that the Crown cannot be divested of its prerogative even by an Act of Parliament passed by Queen, Lords and Commons, unless by express words or necessary implication. The presumption is that Parliament does not intend to deprive the Crown of any prerogative right or property, unless it expresses its intention to do so in explicit terms, or makes the inference irresistible.\nNow, when we consider the object of the B. N. A. Act, the first thing which occurs to us is, that from anything appearing in it, there does not seem to be any reason or necessity for stripping the Crown of its prerogative in respect of the particular matter in question, for the purpose of placing it under the control of the subordinate Executive or Legislative authorities of the respective Provinces which the Act brings into existence. The particular right in question cannot consistently be vested in the Crown, and also at the same time in either the Executive or the Legislative authorities of the respective Provinces. To be invested in either of the latter, it must be absolutely separated from the prerogative, for if Her Majesty should still retain the power to appoint Queen's Counsel, or to grant Letters Patent of Precedence, she must retain it in virtue of that prerogative in virtue of which she orginally held it. It would be quite anomalous, and unwarranted by anything in the British constitution of an analogous character, and it would be quite derogatory to the royal dignity, that this power to confer rank and precedence, which, by the constitution, Her Majesty possessed in right of her prerogative, should be shared by her with any subordinate person or authority. If either authority should have power at pleasure to make appointments superseding those made by the other, the right to confer rank and precedence would in fact rest with neither. In order, therefore, to vest the power in the subordinate, Her Majest must, quoad the power, be divested of Her prerogative. Now, does the B. N. A. Act, in express terms or by irresistible inference, divest Her Majesty of this branch of Her prerogative?\nBy this Act, which is the sole Constitutional Charter of the Dominion of Canada and of the respective Provinces constituting the confederation, Her Majesty expressly retains all Her Imperial rights, as the sole and supreme executive authority of the Dominion, and her position as an integral part of the Dominion Parliament. The Dominion of Canada is constituted a quasi imperial power, in which Her Majesty retains all her executive and legislative authority in all matters not placed under the executive control of the provincial authorities, in the same manner as she does in the British Isles; while the Provincial Governments are, as it were, carved out of, and subordinated to, the Dominion. The head of their executive Government is not an officer appointed by Her Majesty, or holding any commission from her, or in any manner personally representing her, but an officer of the Dominion Government, appointed by the Governor-General, acting under the advice of a council, which the act constitutes the Privy Council of the Dominion. The Queen forms no part of the Provincial Legislatures, as she does of the Dominion Parliament. The Provincial Legislatures consist in some Provinces of such subordinate executive officer and of a Legislative Assembly, and in others of such executive officer and of a Legislative Council and Assembly.\nThe use of Her Majesty's name by these Provincial authorities is by the act confined to the summoning and calling together the Legislatures; and, singular as it seems, this is, by the 82nd section, rather by accident, I apprehend, than design, confined to the Lieutenant-Governors of Ontario and Quebec.\nBy the 91st section it is declared that the acts of the Dominion Parliament shall be made by the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, treating the Queen herself as an integral part of the Parliament, while the 92 section enacts that the \"Legislatures\" of the respective Provinces, that is to say, the Lieutenant-Governor and the Legislative Assembly in Provinces, having but one House, and the Lieutenant-Governor and the Legislative Council and Assembly in Provinces having two houses, shall make laws in relation to matters coming within certain enumerated classes of subjects, to which their jurisdiction is limited. Nothing can be plainer, as it seems to me, than that the several Provinces are subordinated to the Dominion Government, and that the Queen is no party to the laws made by those Local Legislatures, and that no act of any of such Legislatures can in any manner impair or affect Her Majesty's right to the exclusive exercise of all her prerogative powers, which she continues to enjoy untramelled, except in so far as we are obliged to hold that, by the express terms of the B. N. A. Act, or by irresistible inference from what is there expressed, she has, by that act, consented to being divested of any part of such prerogative.\nIt is contended, that the 92nd sec., sub-sec 14, involves such consent. That sub-section places under the exclusive control of the Provincial Legislatures\nThe administration of justice in the Province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts both of civil and crimnal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those Courts.\nBut, applying the well established rule as to the construction of statutes, namely: that the Crown cannot be divested of its prerogative by statute, unless by express words or necessary implication, it appears to me to be very clear that nothing in this section can have the effect contended for; for Queen's Counsel have never been, nor can they be, regarded as a necessary element in the constitution and organization of Courts either of civil or criminal jurisdiction. Those Courts, in fact, were constituted and in perfect organization before ever the title or rank of Queen's Counsel was created, and they could still be conducted in full and perfect efficiency though that rank should never have been conferred. They are not in any sense officers of the Courts, nor Provincial officers. In the whole course of Imperial and Provincial Legislation, although Courts of Justice have been constituted by Act of Parliament, never has provision been made for the appointment of Queen's Counsel as part of the constitution and organization of such Courts, nor has it ever been suggested, I venture to say, until now that they form a part of such organization. The power to create this rank or order having, by the constitution, existed always in virtue of the Royal Prerogative right to create titles of dignity and honor, the transfer of such branch of the prerogative from the Crown to the Provincial Legislatures could only be effected by language expressed in the most explicit terms. By the 96th sec. of the Act, the power of appointing Judges, who do form a most essential element in the constitution of Courts for the administration of justice, is transferred\u2014not however to the Provincial, but to the Dominion Government. As to the appointment of Queen's Counsel, nothing is said, nor is there any subject placed under the exclusive control of the Provincial Executive or Legislative authorities which, by the most forced construction, can, in my opinion, be said necessarily to involve the right to appoint Queen's Counsel. The result must therefore be, that the right still continues to form, as it ever has formed, part of the Royal Prerogative vested in Her Majesty (who still retains her Supreme Executive authority over the Dominion of Canada equally as over the British Isles), to be exercised by her at her pleasure, either under her sign manual, or through the high officer, the Governor General of the Dominion, who alone within these confederate Provinces fills the position of Her Majesty's representative.\nThe Provincial statute, in virtue of which the Letters Patent appointing the appellants are professed to be issued, recites, that the Lieutenant-Governor of right ought to have the power of appointment. I fail to see, however, by what right that officer, who is not by the constitution Her Majesty's representative, ought to have the power to confer this title of honour in preference to Her Majesty herself, and to her representative the Governor-General of the Dominion. I presume it will not be contended, that greater discretion in conferring the rank upon the most worthy would be thus secured. The Imperial Parliament, however, is the only power which can vest the right in the Provincial Executive, and, if it has not done so, no other power, not even the Provincial Legislature, is competent to say that of right the power ought to be vested in it.\nThere are other considerations also which appear to shew the inconvenience of vesting such a right in the Provincial authorities. If vested in them, it might with much force be asked, what right could their Letters Patent confer to entitle the recipient to recognition in this Court, or in any other Dominion Court, as for example, the Maritime Courts, or an Insolvent Court, if such should be established? while Her Majesty's appointment can confer the like rank in all those Courts, as well as in her Provincial Courts, and as well out of those Courts as within their precincts.\nThen, again, by an old law of the Province of Upper Canada it was enacted, that it should no longer be necessary that commissions should be issued for holding Courts of Assize and Nisi Prius, Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, but that if they, should issue, they should contain the names of the Chief Justices and Judges of the Superior Courts of Common Law, and that they might also contain the names of any of the Judges of the County Courts and of any of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law of the Upper Canada Bar, one of whom shall preside in the absence of the Chief Justices and of all the other Judges of the said Superior Courts, and that, if no such commissions should be issued, the said Courts should be presided over by one of the Chief Justices or of the Judges of the said Superior Courts, or, in their absence, then by some one Judge of a County Court, or by some one of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law of the Upper Canada Bar, upon such Judge or Counsel being requested by any one of the said Chief Justices or Judges of such Superior Courts to attend for that purpose. Now if, by any chance, a gentleman, claiming to hold the rank of a Queen's Counsel in virtue of Letters Patent signed by the Lieutenant-Governor, should preside at a Court of Oyer and Terminer upon the trial of an important criminal case, and the validity of the trial should be called in question, upon the ground that the gentleman presiding was not qualified to sit as a Judge, not having any commission from the Dominion Government, conferring upon him the rank of \"Judge,\" and not having any appointment from Her Majesty conferring upon him the rank of \"Queen's Counsel,\" a very embarrassing question might arise, and the ends of justice might be frustrated. Convenience, therefore, as well as the observance of uniformity in the exercise of the power, would seem to concur with other considerations in pointing to the propriety of this branch of the Royal Prerogative being maintained, as of old, inseparably annexed to that prerogative, and to be exercised at the sole discretion of Her Majesty, through her sole representative in the Dominion, His Excellency the Governor-General.\nThe Provincial Act which contains the above recital proceeds to declare and enact that it was and is lawful for the Lieutenant-Governor, by Letters Patent, under the Great Seal of the Province of Nova Scotia, to appoint from among the members of the Bar of Nova Scotia such persons as he may deem right to be during pleasure Provincial officers, under the name of Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law for the Province of Nova Scotia.\nNow, if \"it has been and is lawful\" for the Lieutenant-Governor to make Queen's Counsel, it can only be so by the provisions of the B. N. A. Act. If that act does confer the power upon the Provincial Executive, no doubt the Lieutenant-Governor has it, and a Provincial Act can add no force to the Imperial Act; but if the Imperial Act does not confer the power then the Lieutenant-Governor has it not, nor can any act of the Provincial Legislature effectually declare that he has, or by enactment pointing to the future confer it upon him.\nThe futility of a declaratory Act, passed by a subordinate Legislature, for the purpose of authoritatively defining the intention entertained by the supreme Parliament in the act which gives to the subordinate its existence, and professing to put a construction upon a doubtful point in the act as to the powers conferred upon the subordinate, is too apparent to need comment. The office of a declaratory act is of a nature which requires that it should be passed only by the power which passed the act, the intention of which is professed to be declared. And as to an act, providing for the future for the extension of the limits of the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor, it is equally plain that no power but the Imperial Parliament, which has set limits to the jurisdiction of the Provincial Executive, can extend those limits and enlarge that jurisdiction.\nIt has been said, that the Grown officers in England at some time have given it as their opinion that the power claimed to be exercised by the Lieutenant-Governor might be conferred upon him by an Act of the Provincial Legislature, of which he himself is a component part. I have not seen their opinion, nor have I been able to suggest to myself the arguments by which such an opinion could be supported; all I can say, therefore, in the absence of the light of the opinion given, is that, in the best exercise of my own judgment, which I am bound to exercise here to the utmost of my ability with such light as. I have, I have been unable to bring my mind to any other conclusion than that the Letters Patent under which the appellants claim rank as Queen's Counsel, and the Provincial Statute in virtue of which those Letters Patent issued, as well as the Act regulating precedence, are, for the reasons above given, null and void, and for this reason I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Robert G.

In addition to the count on the agreement the plaintiff inserted in his declaration the common counts for work and labor.\nHeld: That there was not a sufficient fulfilment of the agreement, and inasmuch as L. had given no particulars nor any evidence under the indebitatus counts, the rule absolute of the court below ordering judgment to be entered for the defendants should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nTHIS was an action commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, for breach of a contract to pay for work and labor in running a tunnel to test a supposed formation of anthracite coal on defendants' land.\nThe declaration contained two counts ut seq:\n1. For that in consideration that the plaintiff would run, according to his best art and skill, a tunnel for the purpose of thoroughly testing the presence of a formation of anthracite coal on the ground of the defendants, situated on the Kokesalia river, the said tunnel to be of the following extent and dimensions: The length to be two hundred feet, the floor to be five feet wide, the width of the roof to be four feet, and the height to be six feet; the mud sills, caps, and all the necessary timbers to be substantial and serviceable, the defendants promised to the plaintiff to pay to the plaintiff four dollars per running foot for the said tunnel. And the plaintiff did, according to his best art and skill, run a tunnel for the purpose aforesaid, in conformity with the terms of the said agreement. And all conditions were fulfilled, and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to payment for the said tunnel at the rate of four pollars per running foot aforesaid. Yet the defendants did not pay the plaintiff for the said tunnel at the rate of four dollars per running foot as agreed.\n2. The second count consisted of the indebitatus counts.\nThe writ was specially endorsed as follows:\u2014\n\"To balance of account due plaintiff by defendants for work and services of the plaintiff done and rendered for the defendants, under and in pursuance of an agreement under seal dated 12th July, 1876, and made between the plaintiff and one Thomas C.

And for a second plea the defendants, other than the said Thomas C. Nuttall, say that the said alleged agreement in the said count mentioned was by deed and in the words and figures following and no other, that is to say:\u2014\nMemorandum of Agreement entered into the twelfth day of July, 1876, between Thomas C. Nuttall, acting for and on behalf of the Kokesalia Mining and Agricultural Company, of the first part, and Frank Lakin, miner, Victoria, of the second part. That is to say, the said party of the second part agrees to run according to his best art and skill a tunnel for the purpose of thoroughly testing the presence of a formation of anthracite coal on the ground of the above company, situated on the Kokesalia river, the said tunnel to be of the following extent and dimensions: The length to be two hundred (200) feet, the floor to be five (5) feet wide, the width of the roof to be four (4) feet, and the height to be six (6) feet, the mud sills, caps and all the necessary timbers to be substantial and serviceable; and the said party of the second part agrees to do all the work as specified, for the sum of four (4) dollars per running foot, he finding himself with all the tools, provisions, labor, freight, and passages necessary for the performance of the said work; in other words he is to receive four (4) dollars per running foot in full of all demands whatsoever. And the parties of the first part agree to allow the party of the second part the use of whatever tools may be on the ground free of charge, and the parties of the first part agree to advance to the party of the second part the sum of one hundred and fifty ($150) dollars on account of this contract, the balance to be paid on the satisfactory completion of the work; and it is further agreed between the said parties that the work is to be commenced with all possible dispatch.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF we hereunto set our hands and seals the day and year first above written.\nFor the Kokesalia Mining and Agricultural Company\nTHOS.

Nuttall, further say the causes of action in the second count mentioned are the same as those in the first count.\n3rd, 4th and 5th pleas in substance denied the completion of the contract, and alleged that certain parts of the work done were not serviceable.\nPlea to the second count, \"never indebted as alleged.\"\nThe appellant took issue on all the pleas. The facts of the case are as follows:\nThe respondents, an unincorporated company owning land on the Kokesalia river, British Columbia, supposed to contain anthracite coal, sanctioned and accepted the above contract, under seal, signed by Nuttall, one of the respondents, for and on behalf of the company. The appellant immediately after his arrival at the scene of the work, wrote to Mr. Nuttall the following letter:\n\"SUNDAY, July 23, 1876.\n\"Mr. Thomas Nuttall:\n\"SIR,\u2014I embrace the opportunity to write a few lines to the Coal Company of the Cocosila river. I am starting on the north side, the south side is not worth anything at all. I am commencing now as low down as I can for water but the face of the coal does not look so well as I would like to see it. I have a hard job to get my provisions and tools into the mines I will be able in a little time to give you further information.\n\"I remain your humble servant\n\"F. LAKIN.\"\nAnd on the 13th August, 1876, he wrote to respondents the following letter:\n\"AUGUST the 13, 1876.\n\"To the Gentlemen of the Cocosila Company. As far as I have run tunnel No 1, it is as far as it is necessary to run it; it is in forty eight feet but no indications of coal. No 2 tunnel is across the seam, no indications of coal, and the two tunnels run one hundred and ten feet. I am going to turn this tunnel in another direction. I am thinking to run another tunnel in Robertson's top seam. I am now gentlemen doing the best that lies in my power to find the seam, may be it will bother you, the reason that I started two tunnels, by starting two tunnels I have cut off about a hundred feet which will give a much better test. I will be through in about three weeks. I hope that some of the Company will be up soon.\n\"I remain gentlemen your humble servant\n\"F. LAKIN.\"\nRespondents did not reply, but sent one James Johns, a coal miner, to report, and he reported that the tunnels run by appellant were of no use.\nAppellant made five tunnels, none of which were two hundred feet, but claimed he had done in all 204 feet.\nThe learned Judge at the trial ruled as follows:\n1st point.\u2014As to construction of agreement, plaintiff has failed. His course was pointed out. It was not discretionary with him.\n2nd point.\u2014As to 2nd point, agreement binding on defendants and adopted. Nuttall had authority, etc., to execute, etc.\n3rd point.\u2014Under particulars plaintiff at liberty to go to Jury as to whether benefit conferred exceeded amount paid.\nCase to go to Jury, subject to Mr. Drake's right to move Court that non-suit or verdict be entered for defendants, in case of verdict for plaintiff, if I am right in my construction of the agreement, or wrong as to the question under the particulars. As to the construction of the agreement, if wrong, and there should be a verdict for the defendants, Mr. Robertson to be at liberty to apply for new trial, as in case of misdirection.\nIn answer to several questions submitted to them in writing, the Jury found a verdict for appellant for $350.00\nA rule was afterwards obtained to set aside the verdict, and enter a non-suit, or a verdict for defendants, or a new trial.\nThe Rule was argued before Begbie, C. J., and Gray, J., on the 17th December, 1877. and the following order was made: Upon reading the Rule Nisi in the cause on the 15th day of November, 1877, and hearing Mr. Robertson, of Counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. M. W. Tyrwhitt Drake, of Counsel for the defendants, it is ordered that the verdict found for the plaintiff, on the issues joined, be set aside, and that judgment be entered for the defendants an those issues.\n(Signed) M. B. BEGBIE, C. J.\nAfter the appeal was allowed this rule was twice altered\u2014first, by directing that judgment of non-suit be entered for the defendants on the ground reserved at the trial; secondly, by striking out all the words after the word \"plaintiff\" and inserting in lieu thereof, \"be set aside and a non-suit entered on the following grounds reserved at the trial,\" setting them out at length.\nIt was, however, decided by the Supreme Court of Canada when the case came up for argument that the only rule which could be taken into consideration was the one made before the allowance of this appeal.\nDr. McMichael, Q. C., for appellant:\nThe written contract is very open, and if the appellant has done what is reasonable and fair, it should be read in that way.\nAppellant was to use his best art and skill. He understood this left him a large discretion, and he exercised it, advising the respondents from time to time as to what he was doing, and they did not dissent. The true meaning of the contract, it is submitted, is therefore that appellant should, by his best art and skill, test the presence of the supposed seam of coal, and that he was not to run a single tunnel of 200 feet, if such a tunnel obviously would not tend to the accomplishment of the object proposed in the contract. If respondents intended to select and determine mode of testing the presence of a seam, they would have indicated their views by annexing a plan and specifications of the work to the contract, shewing initial point of tunnel, direction, dip and curvature (if any).\nIt is contended that respondents were not parties to this sealed instrument and therefore are not liable under the contract. The evidence, however, clearly shows that the contract was adopted by the defendants, and it cannot be said that appellant cannot recover because one of the parties only has verified the document. See Thomas v. Wilson[1].\nMoreover, in this case there is evidence of a verbal agreement with defendants to do this very work in accordance with the sealed instrument. See Whitehaven v. Buffalo and Lake Huron Rly. Co.[2]; Ottawa Gas Company v. Currier [3].\nNow, assuming that the special contract was unperformed, a new contract is to be implied from the conduct of the parties, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover on an implied assumpsit arising from work done under the deed. When work is done by one party under a special contract, but not according to its terms, and the other party accepts and takes the benefit, he may be sued for the value. Acceptance is a question of fact, and the Jury have found there was an acceptance.\nThe action here is for work done and accepted by the company.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C. for respondents:\nThe agreement was signed after the interview between appellant and the respondents, and the parol agreement was merged in and destroyed by the sealed instrument. To enable appellant to recover against Nuttall, he must prove the performance of his contract.\nThe evidence of the plaintiff shows that, instead of one tunnel, two hundred feet long, he ran five tunnels, none of which were two hundred feet long, and none of which, in other respects, accorded with the specifications in the contract: Appelby v. Myers[4].\nThe appellant limited his demand by the particulars endorsed on the writ, and no other particulars of demand were furnished under the common counts of the declaration; the result is that he was bound to prove that he had performed his contract, and that there was a balance due under it.\nIf the appellant had proved a substituted contract in lieu of the one sued upon, he would be in a dilemma, because the action having been brought on the original contract, he could not recover on the first count of the declaration, and neither could he recover on the second count, because he is restricted by his particulars of demand to the original contract.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was of opinion the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe appellant in this case seeks to recover from the respondents money claimed to be due to him for work done under a contract under seal for the respondents.\nBy sec. 2 of ch. 104 of the Acts of British Columbia, 1869, \"The English Common Law procedure Acts, and the rules and practice of pleading made in pursuance thereof,\" were adopted, as far as practicable, to regulate the practice and procedure of the Superior Courts of the Colony in all actions and proceedings at law. The evidence on the trial on both sides shows clearly that the contract was not completed, and consequently that the appellant could not recover under the first Count of his declaration. The issue under the pleadings was simply and singly as to the question of performance of the contract, and any side issues found by the Jury cannot affect the case as to the first Count.\nAt the conclusion of the plaintiff's case the Counsel for the respondents moved for a non-suit on the grounds, substantially: 1st. That the contract was shown by the plaintiff's evidence not to have been fulfilled; 2nd. That the defendants other than Nuttall could not be sued on the covenants; 3rd. That the plaintiff could not give evidence under the Common Counts, being limited by his particulars.\nThe learned Judge decided the first point in favor of the respondents, but the other two in favor of the appellant\u2014the \"case to go to the Jury subject to Mr. Drake's right to move the Court that a non-suit or verdict be entered for defendants in case of verdict for plaintiff. It I am right in my construction of the agreement or wrong as to the question under the particulars. As to the construction of the agreement, if wrong, and there should be a verdict for the defendants, Mr. Robertson to be at liberty to apply for a new trial, as in case of misdirection.\" The verdict being for the appellant for $350, a rule nisi was subsequently granted to shew cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a verdict entered for the respondents, or a non-suit, on the first two grounds taken for the motion for non-suit\u2014for the erroneous admission of evidence under the Common Counts, or for a new trial, 1st, on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, and 2nd, that the verdict was contrary to the evidence and perverse.\nI have already disposed of the first objection, and have only to repeat my opinion that the appellant is not entitled to recover on the first count. Such being the case, I need not consider the second objection, which is but subsidiary to and covered by the decision on the first.\nAt the conclusion of the respondent's evidence the learned Judge, at the instance and request of the appellant's counsel, submitted certain propositions to the jury in connection with the issue raised by the plea of \"never indebted,\" to the second count. It is contended by the respondents, that under the particulars of the plaintiff applicable only to the first count, any evidence to sustain the common counts could not be legitimately received, and should therefore have been rejected. I am of the opinion that the evidence in question was improperly received and should have been rejected, and consequently that the Judge should have directed and the jury should, under the pleadings and particulars, have found a verdict for the defendants.\nBy C. L. P. Act 1852, sec. 25, it is enacted that the particulars endorsed on the writ of summons under that section shall be considered as particulars of demand.\nRoscoe in his work on evidence at nisi prius p. 96, 13th ed., says:\nWhen the plaintiff has delivered a particular of his demand he will be precluded from giving any evidence of demand not contained in it[5].\nIf the appellant's counsel at the trial wished to have had the benefit of the second count, his only course, I take it, under the practice, was to have asked leave to amend his particulars, and his application would no doubt have been granted, subject to such terms, as to the postponement of the trial, costs and otherwise, as the presiding judge might have considered proper, and which amendments the opposite party must always be prepared for; but without any such amendment, the statutes and rules very wisely provide that the particulars limit the plaintiff's right to what they contain.\nThe respondents here got notice by his particulars that the appellant intended only to try the question as to the performance of the contract, and it would be as irregular as unjust to allow the appellant to apply the evidence given under the first count to the second without any previous notice or intimation to the respondents of any such intention. For this issue, being totally different and requiring evidence of a different and more extensive character than that required for the issue on the first count, the respondents could not reasonably be assumed to be prepared.\nI have, however, fully considered the value of the whole evidence, and can find nothing in it to sustain the second count. It cannot be doubted that if, in the event of the failure to perform the whole of a contract, the party accepts and gets the benefit of a partial performance, the law renders him liable to pay pro rata or a quantum meruit therefor. Here, however, the work was done on the property of the respondents, and in that case an express acceptance was necessary to be shown; and it is to be distinguished from a case wherein a change of possession might be evidence of acceptance. In this case I can see no evidence of any acceptance of the work, and there is evidence I think to show that what was done was of no value to the respondents; but even if it were, unless they adopted it either expressly, or by acts which amounted to the same thing, they would not be bound to pay for work they had never requested to be done for them. They bargained for a tunnel 200 feet long and of prescribed dimensions, and secured and supported in a prescribed manner. What their object was, it was not for the contractor to consider. He was to be paid whether their object failed or not, and if he even found the coal sought for he could only claim payment for such work as was prescribed by his contract and he had fulfilled it.\nFor the reasons given I think the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Court below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\nI am of opinion, that taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, the contract made by Nuttall with the plaintiff was binding on all the defendants. But I am also of opinion that the plaintiff failed to perform his contract. The evidence on this point seems to me conclusive. There can be no two interpretations of the memorandum of agreement of the 12th July, 1876. One tunnel, two hundred feet long, was what the plaintiff contracted for. He never ran such a tunnel. That is clear. But he contends that he ran four or five tunnels, and that these tunnels together are more than two hundred feet long. That was certainly not what he undertook to perform. The defendants contracted for one tunnel of two hundred feet in length; the plaintiff, for a certain consideration, bound himself to run that tunnel; he-cannot now, not having performed his contract, claim the contract price. His right to sue on the contract depended on his performance of it.\nOn the quantum meruit, the plaintiff's action must also fail. What he did was under a contract, and that contract he did not perform. But even admitting the evidence adduced upon that count, I am of opinion that the plaintiff cannot succeed. There is not in the record a single proof of the value of the work done by the plaintiff. It cannot be contended that four dollars a foot was agreed upon by the contract, and that this is to be taken as the value of the work done and declared upon under the indebitatus counts. If the plaintiff, on these counts, leaves the contract aside, and says that he did for the defendants something else than that contracted for, he cannot have it taken for granted that what he did was of the same value as what was contracted for. He was bound to prove the value of what he did: he did not do so. He would probably have failed to prove that what he did was worth four dollars a foot, as it must generally be cheaper to run five tunnels of forty feet each than one of two hundred feet; at the mouth of a tunnel the work does not amount to much; it is as the sinking goes on that the difficulties and the cost increase.\nThe plaintiff argued that the defendants had accepted his work as performance of his contract. I can see nothing of the kind in the evidence.\nAltogether, I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in favor of the defendants must be confirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nIt is unnecessary to enquire whether the instrument upon which this action has been brought is the deed of the defendant Nuttall alone, or whether, under the circumstances attending its execution, it might, upon the authority of Ball v. Dunsterville[6], be held to be the deed of all the defendants, who appear to have been present at its execution and to have authorized the defendant Nuttall to sign for them all; for, assuming the instrument to be the contract of all the defendants \u2014Whether their deed or their simple contract only, (as which latter it seems to have been declared upon,) matters not\u2014it is quite clear that the plaintiff never did fulfil what he had undertaken by the contract, and until completion of his part of the contract nothing was payable further than what was paid when the contract was made. The plaintiff therefore never could sustain an action upon the special contract. It is equally clear, that he could sustain no action as for work and labour upon a quantum meruit; for there was no evidence whatever to go to a jury of the defendants having accepted what work the plaintiff did do as a fulfilment of the special contract upon his part. Nor was there any evidence of any mutual abandonment of the special contract, and the substitution of a new implied contract to pay for the work done according to its value[7]. Nor was there any evidence that the plaintiff was prevented from fulfilling the special contract upon his part by any default of the defendants[8].\nThe plaintiff at the trial rested his case upon the construction of the special contract, which he contended he had fulfilled by the work he did. The learned Judge thought the plaintiff should be non-suited, and I think he was right. He consented, however, to submit the case to the jury, reserving leave to the defendants to move the court in term for leave to enter a non-suit, or a verdict for the defendants, in case the jury should render a verdict for the plaintiff.\nWe must regard this reservation as having been made upon the consent of the plaintiff in the usual way\u2014indeed, that is not disputed, and that, but for such consent, the learned Judge would have charged the jury, that upon the evidence they could render no verdict other than one in favor of the defendants.\nUpon this reservation the Court rightly set aside the verdict which the jury, without any evidence whatever to warrant it, found for the plaintiff, and the Court made absolute a rule to enter a verdict for the defendants, in accordance with the reservation at nisi prius. Afterwards, and after the plaintiff had appealed from that rule to this Court, the Court below changed the rule into a rule absolute for a non-suit. Whatever difference, if any, was made by this rule, was a difference in favor of the plaintiff, who, however, now objects here that the Court had no right to alter the former rule, which, as is contended, is the rule now before this Court on Appeal.\nIf the plaintiff is unwilling, as he says he is, to accept the non-suit, I see no objection to our holding him to the consent involved in the reservation of the case at nisi prius, and to our dismissing his appeal, and upholding the rule directing the verdict and judgment to be entered for the defendants, that being the only verdict which the facts warrant; or, if the plaintiff now consents, we may direct the rule to issue in the Court below for judgment of non-suit. It matters little which form the rule is in, for in any case the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau, and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nAdditional Plea, Supreme Court no power to allow.\nD. McM., the respondent, sued S. W. B. Co., the Appellants, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of the obstruction of the River Miramichi, by appellants' booms. The pleas were not guilty, and leave and license. On the trial the counsel proposed to add a plea, that the wrong complained of was occasioned by an extraordinary freshet. The counsel for the respondent objected on the ground that such plea might have been demurred to. The learned judge refused the application, because he intended to admit the evidence under the plea of not guilty.\nOn appeal, the counsel for the appellant contended that the obstruction complained of was justified under the Statute 17 Vic., c. 10, N. B., incorporating the South West Boom Company.\nHeld:\u2014That the appellants, not having put in a plea of justification under the Statute, or applied to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Banco for leave to amend their pleas, could not rely on that ground before this court to reverse the decision of the court below.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, discharging a rule nisi for a new trial.\nThis was an action brought by the Testator Miles McMillan, against the appellants and one Daniel McLaughlin, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of the obstruction of the River Miramichi by the appellants' booms, and also for short delivery of quantities of McMillan's lumber, which floated down the river into the appellants' boom.\nThe three first counts of the declaration were for obstructing the river, whereby the plaintiff was unable to float down a quantity of deals, and sustained damages by the loss in the price, from his inability to fulfil a contract he had made, and by the deterioration of the deals in value in consequence of lying in the water for four months. The fourth, fifth and sixth counts were for the loss of a quantity of logs through the defendants' negligence. The seventh count was in trover.\nThe South West Miramichi,\u2014the river in question,\u2014is a tidal river and navigable for some distance above the boom for boats and small steamers.\nThe appellants were incorporated by the Act of the New Brunswick Legislature, 17 Vic., cap. 10, (N. Brun. L. & P. Acts, p. 856.) Their act of incorporation, being about to expire in 1872, was extended by 35 Vic., cap. 44, (Acts of 1872, p. 86,) until the year 1882. By a subsequent Act, 37 Vic., cap. 107, (Acts of 1874, p. 334,) the capital stock of the Company was increased, and they were authorized to extend their works.\nThe pleas were not guilty and leave and license.\nThe following extract, taken from the Judge's Fisher's notes at the trial, and agreed upon as part of the case between the parties to be submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada, shows what took place in reference to the addition of pleas.\n\"Mr. Davidson moves for trial.\n\"Mr. Wilkinson\u2014The pleas are, not guilty, and leave and license. I propose to add a third plea, that the defendant, McLaughlin, was a lessee of the company. 4th plea. That the wrong complained of was occasioned by the extraordinary freshet. (See proposed plea). It was through the extraordinary circumstances of the river that caused the difficulty.\n\"Davidson objects that they have no power to lease the boom.\n\"1. Dr. Barker objects that the pleas are demurrable, bad in form and substance, and under no circumstances can a plea be added which requires separate and distinct replication, because of the practice we are entitled to the time which we could not get.\n\"Wilkinson\u2014As to separate replication, a general replication puts in issue the whole plea.\n\"2. Judge can impose such terms as are just.\n\"I refuse the application, as I intend to admit the evidence under the plea of not guilty.\"\nThe Jury found a verdict for the plaintiff on the count for obstructing the navigation of the river and also on the count in trover.\nAn application was made to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and a rule nisi granted, calling upon the defendants to shew cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a new trial granted, which rule, after argument, and the court taking time to consider, was discharged.\nMr. Weldon, Q. C., for appellants:\nThe first question is whether the New Brunswick Act of Incorporation which authorized them to construct these booms so \"as to admit the passage of rafts and boats, and to preserve the navigation\" is ultra vires.\n[STRONG, J.:\u2014How can that question be raised on the pleas to the first three counts? You plead not guilty, which only puts in issue whether the obstruction was put there by defendants.]\nWe contend that the main boom did not do damage, and we are not responsible for swing boom.\n[STRONG, J.:\u2014You should have pleaded justification under the statute.]\nIf the Court below had decided on the pleadings, I would have applied to amend, but Mr. Justice Fisher tried the case as if the plea of justification was put in and no preliminary objection has been taken here.\n[HENRY, J.:\u2014In this case it seems very hard, but we cannot send back the case because the pleas are insufficient.]\nDr. Barker, Q. C., for respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nA plea of justification under the statute was not pleaded, and we have no power to add one now. And there are many good reasons for that, one of them is that the defendant might raise, as in this case another issue altogether, which would have to be tried in the Court below; and the plaintiff might choose to demur to this additional plea, and that would have to be argued in the Court below. Under these circumstances the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with, costs.\nSolicitor for appellant; L. J. Tweedie.\nSolicitor for respondent: A. A. Davidson.\n"

S., upholding the validity of the last will and testament of Beamish Murdoch, deceased.\nMr. W. F. MacCoy, for respondent, moved to quash the appeal, on the ground that the Supreme Court of Canada had no jurisdiction to hear the cause, because the Court of Probate, where the cause originated in Nova Scotia, is an Inferior Court, (R. S. N. S., c. 90); and contended that under the 17 section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, an appeal does not lie in cases in which the Court of original jurisdiction is not a Superior Court, and cited Hilliard on new trials[1]; King v. Hanson[2]; Queen v. Stock[3].\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nI do not think there can be any doubt in this case. The statute puts it beyond all doubt that the cause must originate in a Superior Court in the Province, then go to the highest Court of final resort, and then here. In no other case will an appeal lie; except, of course, when brought under sec. 27 of The Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, allowing an appeal by consent of parties direct from a Superior Court of original jurisdiction, or when brought in a criminal case under sec. 49 of the Act. The Court of Probate from whose decision the appellant now appeals is in every sense of the word an Inferior Court. The proceedings before that Court are entirely different from those of a common law court, and are subject to a writ of prohibition from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nThe appeal should be quashed.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER, HENRY and GWYNNE, J.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nTrover, action of, against Sheriff\u2014Transfer of property by execution debtor\u2014Misdirection of Jury.\nIn an action of trover or conversion against appellant, High Sheriff of the County of Cumberland, N.S., to recover damages for an alleged conversion by the appellant of certain personal property found in the possession of the execution debtor, but claimed by the respondent, the pleas were a denial of the conversion, no property in plaintiff, no possession or right of possession in plaintiff, and justification under a writ of excution against the execution debtor. The learned judge at the trial told the jury that he \"thought it was incumbent on the defendant to have gone further than merely producing and proving his execution, and that if a transfer had taken place to the plaintiff, and the articles taken and sold, defendant should have shown the judgment on which the execution issued to enable him to justify the taking and enable him to sustain his defence.\"\nHeld: That the sheriff was entitled under his pleas to have it left to the Jury to say whether the plaintiff had shewn title or right of possession to the goods in question, and therefore there was misdirection.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, discharging a rule nisi to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff.\nThis was an action of trover or conversion brought in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, by the respondent against the appellant, High Sheriff of the County of Cumberland, to recover damages for alleged conversion by the appellant of certain personal property claimed by the respondent.\nThe pleas were a denial of the conversion, no property in the plaintiff, no possession, or right of possession in the plaintiff, and a justification under the writ of execution. The cause was tried before Smith, J., and a jury at Amherst.\nThere was no evidence tendered on behalf of the defendant, and the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses showed that part of the personal property, viz: one mare and one two year old colt, belonged to the execution debtor and was in his possession when the seizure took place. That the balance, viz: a waggon, was left with the execution debtor in exchange for another waggon. That the plaintiff was the son of the execution debtor and claimed the mare and foal, as having purchased it from his brother, and the waggon from one Wilmot.\nThe learned Judge delivered the following charge to the Jury:\n\"I told the Jury I thought it was incumbent on the Defendant to have gone further than merely producing and proving his execution, and that if a transfer had taken place to the plaintiff, and the articles taken and sold, defendant should have shown the judgment on which the execution issued to enable him to justify the taking and enable him to sustain his defence.\" The Jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.\nA rule nisi to set aside said verdict was taken out by the appellant, and argued before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, which gave judgment discharging said rule nisi with costs, from which judgment this appeal was taken.\nMr. Gormully for appellant was not called upon.\nMr. Halliburton for respondent:\nThe appellant was bound to prove the judgment on which the execution issued. See White v. Morris[1], and he should have pleaded that the sale was fraudulent or void against creditors.\nIn Adams et al v. Kingsmill[2], \"where a Sheriff justified under an execution, and alleged that the goods had been fraudulently sold and delivered to the plaintiffs by the debtor to defeat the execution, the plea was held bad, because it did not show the judgment upon which the execution issued.\"\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The Sheriff was not a wrongdoer as against this third party, and the Judge should have left the Jury to decide whether there was any title in this third party, but instead of this the learned Judge says it was incumbent on the defendant to make out his case.]\nThere was proof of a sale, and even if the transaction was colorable, it was good between themselves, and the Sheriff must show he represented a creditor. White v. Morris is relied on in Atkinson's Law of Sheriffs[3]; and it has also been accepted as the leading case on this point by the Ontario Courts.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Your authorities are all good law, but not applicable to this case.]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nThe sheriff seized under an execution goods which he found in the execution debtor's possession. A third party sues the sheriff, claiming the property as his under an alleged transfer from the execution debtor. The sheriff pleads several pleas, inter alia no property, or right of possession in plaintiff, also a justification under a judgment and execution. The plaintiff gives evidence of a transfer from the judgment debtor, and the sheriff gives evidence which, he contends, shows that such transfer was a mere sham, and that the property and possession never passed, nor was ever intended to pass out of the judgment debtor to the plaintiff. Unless the plaintiff could make out that he had the right of possession, by showing that he had a valid title, how could he recover the property which was not taken from his possession? And if he had no title, even against the execution debtor, what right of action could he possibly have against the sheriff or anybody else, who might have taken the goods from the judgment debtor. But the Judge, instead of submitting the question of the plaintiff's title to the jury, ruled that the defendant could not succeed, because he did not prove the judgment, as well as the execution under which he seized the goods. If this action had been brought by the judgment debtor for improperly seizing his property, this would be all well enough, but what right has a third party to sue the sheriff and recover against him for taking goods under an execution out of the execution debtor's possession, unless he is able to establish that the goods are his, or that the transfer under which he claims is, as against the judgment debtor, valid; in which case it might be necessary for the sheriff to shew the judgment, if he contested the validity of the transfer as against creditors.\nSTRONG, FOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe property having remained in the possession of the father, there was no transfer of it; and that being the case any body could take it and it would not be for the plaintiff to complain. The first question which should have been put to the jury was, in whose possession was the property; and secondly, who was the owner of it.\nGWYNNE, J.:\nAs the Court below proceeded on White v. Morris[4], it is only necessary to refer to that case. Now, White v. Morris has no application to this case. It proceeded upon its being shewn by the plaintiff that he claimed under a deed executed by the judgment debtor, conveying to the plaintiff the property and right to immediate possession, and which deed was good, valid and indisputable against the grantor and all the world except his creditors. The onus being thus shifted from the plaintiffs to the defendants, it was necessary for them to justify under a judgment. In the case as reported in 11 C. B. Jervis, C. J., as the basis upon which the judgment rests, says the first point urged was on the plea of not possessed; it was contended that no possession passed to the plaintiff by the deed of assignment of the 11th October, 1850, sufficient to entitle him to maintain the action, and in support of this view, Bradley v. Copley[5] and Wheeler v. Montefiore[6] were cited.\nBut a comparison of the deeds in those cases with the language of the deed here, will shew that they have no application. Here, a right to the possession did pass to the plaintiffs by the deed, though it was incumbered with a trust, but which trust is quite consistent with the right to the possession remaining in the plaintiff. In the cases cited, however, instead of a trust, there was a proviso to the effect that until default made the assignors should have possession, and no right to the present possession passed to the assignees.\nThen he proceeds:\nIt must be assumed that the instrument of the 11th October, 1850, was intended by the parties to operate as a deed; and, though fraudulent and void as against creditors (as the Jury have found), it is a perfectly good deed against all persons except creditors. It is an established rule of law,\u2014never doubted until the case of Bessey v. Windham[7],\u2014that the mere production of the writ and nothing more, will not enable the Sheriff to show that a deed, good as against all except creditors, is fraudulent and void. He must show that he represents a creditor. For this purpose the mere production of the writ is not enough.\nAnd again:\nI think, that, to entitle the defendants in this case to dispute the title of the plaintiff, they ought to have produced and proved the judgment.\nAnd Maule, J., says[8]:\nThe deed was one under which plaintiff was bound to take possession of the goods assigned for the purpose of enabling him to perform the trusts.\nAnd upon this he bases his judgment, that to avoid the plaintiff's title so shewn, it was necessary to shew a judgment as well as a writ.\nCresswell, J.,[9], puts it in like manner:\nThe assignment was clearly an operative assignment as between the parties; it was intended to convey the legal property in the goods to the plaintiff, subject to the trusts. I can understand that parties may go through the ceremony of executing a thing which it is not intended to operate as a deed, but it is not suggested that that is the case here. This assignment can only be disputed by creditors.\nThe question here is one which a Jury alone can determine, namely: whether there was or not any validity whatever in the transaction set up by the plaintiff as the evidence of his title?\nAs to the pleading, which Mr. Haliburton objects to as insufficient to raise the point, it is well settled that in trover, both writ and judgment can be proved under the plea of not guilty and not possessed, but in reality the case never went so far as to call upon the defendant to show anything.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Townshend and Dickie.\nSolicitor for respondent: William M.

(the appellant), the sitting member, against whom an election petition had been fyled by L, (the respondent), an unsuccessful candidate, presented a cross-petition under the 8th sec., sub-sec. 2, of the Dominion Controverted Election Act, 1874, alleging that L. was guilty, as well by himself as by his agents, with his knowledge and consent, of corrupt practices at the said election. This cross-petition was not fyled within thirty days after the \"publication in the Canada Gazette of the return to the writ of election by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery but within the delay mentioned in the last part of said sub-sec 2, sec 8 viz.: fifteen days after the service of the petition upon V., complaining of his election and return.\nThe cross-petition was met by a preliminary objection, maintained by Meredith, C.

(Henry, J., dissenting.)\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Meredith, C. J., of the Superior Court for the Province of Quebec, maintaining the preliminary objections to the cross-petition of the appellant. The appellant (the sitting member), in his cross petition, alleged that the respondent, the petitioner against him. was a candidate at the same election, and was guilty, as well by himself as by his agents, with his knowledge and consent, of corrupt practices at the said election.\nThe cross-petition was not served within the thirty days mentioned at -the beginning of sub-sec. 2 of sec. 8 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, 1874, hereinafter given at length in the judgment of his Lordship the Chief Justice, but was served within the fifteen days mentioned towards the end of the same sub-section.\nMr. Pelletier, Q. C., for appellant, contended that the delay of fifteen days for presenting a cross petition expired only fifteen days after the day of the service of the petition on the sitting member.\nMr. Langlois, Q. C., contra, contended that the fifteen days allowed by sub. sec. 2 of sec. 8, was an extra delay allowed only when the petition alleged corrupt practices after the return, and the cross petition in this case was \"an election petition \" coming within the general rule in sec. 8, as to the delay of 30 days.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis was an appeal from the decision of Chief Justice Meredith, on the preliminary objections, rejecting the cross-petition of sitting member.\nBy the Dominion Controverted Elections Act 1874 37 Vic., c. 10, sub. sec. 2 of sec. 8, it is provided that:\nThe petition must be presented not later than thirty days after the day of publication in the Canada Gazette of the receipt of the return to the writ of election by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery; unless it questions the return or election upon an allegation of corrupt practices, and specifically alleges a payment of money or other act of bribery to have been committed by any member, or on his account, or with his privity, since the time of such return, in pursuance, or in furtherance of such corrupt practice, in which case the petition may be presented at any time within thirty days after the date of such payment or act so committed; and in case any such petition is presented, the sitting member, whose election and return is petitioned against may, not later than fifteen days after service of such petition against his election and return, file a petition complaining of any unlawful and corrupt act by any candidate at the same election, who was not returned and who is not a petitioner, and on whose, behalf the seat is not claimed.\nThe sitting member seeks to file a cross-petition within these fifteen days against a person who was a candidate, but who is a petitioner, complaining of unlawful and corrupt acts by such candidate. This is in direct opposition to the statute, which provides that the sitting member can only file such a petition against a candidate \"who,\" inter alia, \"is not a petitioner.\" I think, therefore, on this ground alone, without expressing any opinion on the other point raised, that the learned Chief Justice was right in allowing the preliminary objection and that this appeal should be quashed, with costs.\nSTRONG, J., gave an oral judgment, stating his reasons for holding that the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nFor the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice Meredith of the Court below, I am of opinion that the preliminary objections should be maintained, and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe petitioner in this case is the sitting member for the County of Montmorency, in the Province of Quebec, and against his return a petition had been presented by the respondent, and was in process of trial when the appellant's petition was served and filed. In the respondent's petition the seat was not claimed.\nThe latter clause of sub-section 2 of sec. 8 of the Controverted Election Act, 1874, in reference to the filing of a counter petition, is as follows: \" And in case any such petition \" (meaning the petition against the return of the sitting member) i is presented, the sitting member, whose election and return is petitioned against, may not later than fifteen days after the service of such petition against his election and return, file a petition complaining of any unlawful and corrupt act by any candidate at the same election who was not returned, and who is not a petitioner, and on whose be-half the seat is not claimed.\nWithout that provision no such petition could be legally filed; and, as by the provision of the clause, the right to file it is contingent and conditional on its being done not later than fifteen days after the service of the petition against the return, the right to file it ceases by the effluxion of that time. The appellant's petition was filed before the expiration of the fifteen days; and an objection to it is taken, on the ground that it should have been filed within thirty days, as prescribed by the opening clause of that section.\nA right to present a petition against a candidate who has not been returned for any unlawful act, \" by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, at any election held after the passing of this Act,\" is given by section seven; but the time at which and under what circumstances, is not there given or stated. The time for presenting a petition against the return of a,member is limited in sub-section two to thirty days.\nNo evidence of corrupt practices at an election can be received on the trial of a petition complaining of an undue election and return, unless the seat be claimed by or on behalf of another candidate\u2014either by statute or common law; but when the seat is claimed recriminatory evidence may, under both, be given to prevent a candidate guilty of corrupt practices from obtaining the seat, and to disqualify him subsequently. Section 66 makes the statutable provision for such evidence.\nParliament has, however, gone further, and in subsection 2, after limiting the time for the presentation of the election petition to 30 days after the publication of the receipt of the return to the election writ, and providing for an allegation of corrupt practices, specifically alleging payment by a member after the return in pursuance of such corrupt practices, and limiting the time for the presentation of a petition in such a case to 30 days after the date of such payment, is found a provision as follows:\u2014\nAnd in case any such, petition is presented, the sitting member, whose election and return is petitioned against, may, not later than fifteen days after service of such petition against his election and return, file a petition complaining of any unlawful and corrupt act by any candidate at the same election who was not returned, and who is not a petitioner, and on whose behalf the seat is not claimed.\nIt is necessary, in view of the decision appealed against, which dismissed the petition that we should construe this latter clause for it is upon that construction the parties rely, and upon which our judgment should be based. I differ with the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Quebec who limited the operation of this clause to the case of bribery by a payment after the return. I am of opinion that the true construction of the section can be obtained only by reading that clause parenthetically as a provision for a petition in a case not otherwise provided for, and allowing merely a further time for the presentation of it. The section first limits the time for the presentation of an ordinary election petition but to meet a specific offence extends that time. The petition in both cases is against the election and return; but the provision for the specific offence allows a further time for its presentation.\nThe concluding clause of the section must, in my opinion include both cases that in the case of an ordinary election as well as that in the case specially provided for The latter clause of the section commences thus \u201cAnd in case any such petition is presented, the sitting member, whose election and return is petitioned against, may, &c.\"\n\"We must construe any doubtful words in a clause not only by the section in which they are found, but by the whole Act, and its obvious scope and meaning. What do, then, the words \u201cany such petition against a sitting member \u201cmean? Clearly, to my mind, any petition against the election and return of a sitting member. Why should a sitting member, petitioned against for the specific offence, have the right to initiate a proceeding to disqualify another candidate that a party petitioned against independently of it should not have or exercise? Or why should a candidate guilty of corrupt practices escape merely because the petition against the sitting member is not for bribery by payment after the return? The object of the legislation was to disqualify an unsuccessful candidate guilty of corrupt practices at an election, and that object would fail to be carried out in any but an exceptional and rare case, if I am wrong in my construction of the provision. I think the object of the legislation is patent on the face of the provision and that the meaning and application of the terms used are abundantly plain and pointed to support my contention.\nA difficulty of a more serious nature is however found in arriving at the proper construction of the last clause of the section as affecting at all the position of the respondent in this case, as well as in reference to the time in which the petition against him should have been presented, or what, indeed, is of much more consequence, whether the provision in it is at all applicable to the case of the respondent. If it be, then it appears to me quite plain, that the time limited is fifteen days after service of the petition against the sitting member. The peculiar wording of the clause being somewhat involved, there is some difficulty in ascertaining what is intended by it. The petition must be against \" any candidate at the same election who has not been returned and who is not a petitioner, and on whose behalf the seat is not claimed What we have to consider is whether the clause contains two or three propositions The first is the condition that the party petitioned against under it was a candidate, and not returned. That proposition is affirmatively settled, and the uncertainty arises as to the remaining provision. Had the respondent in this case claimed the seat, no counter-petition would have been necessary or permitted. What, then, did the legislature mean by the words \"and who is not a petitioner, and on whose behalf the seat is not claimed.\" In const-ruing them we must consider that in the absence of any petition claiming the seat, no enquiry could otherwise be had as to charges of corrupt practices against an unsuccessful candidate, and the \"provision in the clause was for the institution of an enquiry in cases where the seat was not claimed either in a petition of an unsuccessful candidate, or of others, against the election and return of a sitting member. The main object and intention of the clause I take it, was to disqualify a candidate found guilty of corrupt practices at the same election, and I think we should construe a clause like this one so as to give effect to the obvious intentions of the Legislature and not so as to defeat them. If then the mere fact of his being a petitioner would prevent any inquiry as to corrupt practices by him, which would not be the case if the election and return of the sitting member were petitioned against by others, a great anomaly would L appear in the legislation on the subject, and all the guilty unsuccessful candidate would have to do to pre-vent inquiry would be to present a petition in his own name against the sitting member. If such a petition were presented by others, no one could contend that an inquiry could not be had into charges ef corrupt practices against any unsuccessful candidate at the same election, and in that case why should the mere presentation of a petition against a sitting member by any such unsuccessful candidate shield him from an inquiry by not claiming the seat, which would be legitimate if such a petition were presented by others. I cannot conclude that any such anomaly was intended, nor do I think a reasonable construction of the words will necessarily establish it. I think the words \u201cand on whose behalf the seat is not claimed\" are copulative and, therefore, apply as well to a petitioner who does not claim the seat himself as to other petitioners, who do not claim the seat on his behalf. I think for the reasons given, the clause may, and should, be read as if in these words: \" and who is not a petitioner claiming the seat or one on whose behalf the seat is claimed by others.\" The object in view is clearly to permit the presentation of the petition in any case where the seat is not claimed, and, in my opinion, it applies as forcibly to a case where the seat is not claimed by the petitioner on his own behalf as well as where the seat is claimed on his behalf by others. The words \u201con whose behalf \" would include the one case as well as the other.\nFor these reasons, I think, the petition against the respondent was provided for and covered by the clause in question, and that the limitation of time for presenting it was fifteen days from the service of the petition on the sitting member. I, consequently, am of opinion the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the appeal allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nIt seems to me that the judgment appealed from in this case is right. Valin's petition is against Langlois, the petitioner in first instance against him, Valin. And on referring to the latter part of sect. 8 sub-sect. 2 of the controverted Elections Act of 1874 I see that the petition therein allowed to be presented after the usual delay of thirty days is a petition against a candidate who is not a petitioner. Langlois is a petitioner, so that this part of the clause does not sustain Valin's s contentions. Then, it seems to me, that this enactment, allowing a petition to be presented after the thirty days mentioned in the first part of the clause, applies only to petitions based upon corrupt practices, or upon an illegal payment made since the return to the writ of election. A reference to the French version of the statute clears any doubt which the English version leaves in my mind upon this point.\nI see that this enactment allowing a sitting member to present in certain cases a petition after the usual 30 days against a candidate not returned, and who is not a petitioner and on whose behalf the seat is not claimed, is not in the Imperial Statute, 31-32 Vic. c. 125, sec. 6, sub-sc. 2. I fail to see why it has been introduced in our statute. It may lead to queer results. Now, in this . case, for instance, even supposing that Langlois had petitioned after the usual 30 days against Valin, the sitting member for acts committed by Valin since the return, Valin, as I read the statute, could not have petitioned within fifteen days after against Langlois; because Langlois was a petitioner, and it is only against a candidate not returned, on whose behalf the seat is not claimed, and who is not a petitioner, that this counter petition is allowed. A counter petition, it seems to be, yet, it must not be against the first petitioner ! Of course, I can understand that if the seat is not claimed the sitting member has no interest in contending that his adversary was guilty of corrupt practices, and that such contention could be no answer to the petition demanding the annulling of the election. But why allow to the sitting member a petition against his adversary, provided that such adversary is not a petitioner, is what I can't understand. Why, in this case, for instance, if the election was attacked for acts commited since the return, deny to Valin his right of petition against Lang-lois, because Langlois is the petitioner against him, and, if another person had been first petitioner instead of Langlois, grant to Valin the right to petition against Langlois? Why give it in one case and not in the other? Langlois does not claim the seat, and, in any case, when the seat is not claimed, this counter petition should not be allowed. It is not allowed in England, and, in my opinion, this new enactment in our statute might be advantageously stricken out. Any candidate, not returned, guilty of corrupt practices, may be sued for the penalties enacted by the Act, and if found guilty will b\u00e9 disqualified.\nThe respondent's motion to quash the appeal must, I think, be dismissed. The appeal, in this case, had been allowed and duly filed before the fifteenth of May last when the Supreme Court amendment Act of last Session came into force, and, under the tenth section of the Act, the appeal lies.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nI entirely concur in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court in Quebec in this case. A petition, complaining of an undue return, may be presented within thirty days after the day of publication in the Canada Gazette of the receipt of the return of the writ of election. Such petition may be presented by a candidate, or by any person having had a right to vote at the election. So, likewise, within the same period, a petition complaining of any unlawful act by any candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons, may be presented by the returned candidate, or by any other candidate, or by any person having had the right to vote. If the petition is filed against the sitting member by another candidate, or by a person entitled to vote, and the seat is claimed for a candidate not returned, whether he be the petitioning candidate or not, then charges of corrupt acts, committed by the candidate for whom the seat is claimed may be entered into upon the trial of the petition against the sitting member, without any cross-petition being filed by the sitting member; but, if seat is not claimed for a candidate not returned whether the petitioner be himself a candidate or only a person entitled to have voted no enquiry can take place as to any corrupt practices committed by a candidate not returned unless a petition be filed charging corrupt practices against such candidate within the thirty days after the publication in the Gazette of the result of the election; save only, that in case a petition be presented after the thirty days, as it may be, if it alleges a payment of money or other act of bribery to have been committed by any member or on his account or with his privity, since the time of such return, in pursuance of corrupt practices, (in which case, the petition may be presented at any time within 30 days after the date of such payment, &c.); and, in that case, the sitting member, whose return is petitioned against, may, within 15 days after service upon him of such petition, file a petition complaining of any corrupt practice committed by any candidate at the same election for whom the seat is not claimed and who is not himself a petitioner.\nThe object of this provision would seem to be to make provision that, when a friend of a candidate, who had been guilty of corrupt practices, should, under the circumstances stated, file a petition which might result in disqualifying the sitting member, the candidate, in whose interest the petition was filed, should, if guilty of corrupt practices, be himself also exposed to the same disqualification to become a candidate at the election to take place upon the removal of the sitting member. The petition of the sitting member here is against the person who is the petitioner against his return; and the present respondent was a defeated candidate, who filed his petition against the sitting member within the thirty days. He, therefore, is clearly not a person against whom, under this provision of the Act, a petition can be filed within fifteen days after service of the petition on the sitting member, unless it shall be also within the original thirty days after the publication in the Gazette.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: H. Cyrius Pelletier.\nSolicitor for Respondent: Jean Langlois.\n"

J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne, J.J.\nON APPEA L FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE.)\nBenefit society Expulsion of member\u2014Prior notice not necessary under By-laws Mandamus.\nL. was expelled from membership in L. U. St. J., an incorporated benefit society for being in default to pay six months' contributions, Art. 20 of the society's by-laws, sec. 5, provides that \" When a member shall have neglected during six months to pay his contributions, or the entire amount of his entrance fee, the society may erase his name from the list of members, and he shall then no longer form part of the society; for that purpose, at every general and regular meeting, it is the duty of the Collector-Treasurers to make known the names of those who are indebted in six months contributions or in a balance of their entrance fee, and then any one may move that such members be struck off from the list of members of the society.\"\nL. thereupon brought suit under the shape of a petition, praying that a writ of mandamus should issue, enjoining the company to reinstate him in his rights and privileges as a member of the society. 1. On the ground that he had not been put en demeure in any way; and that no statement or notice had been given him of the amount of his indebtedness; 2. On the ground that many other members of the society were in arrear for similar periods, and that it was not competent for the society to make any distinction amongst those in arrears: 3. On the ground that L no motion was made at any regular meeting.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for L. C. (appeal side) held that L. should have had \u201cprior notice \u201cof the proceedings to be taken with the view to his expulsion.\nHeld: On appeal, that as L. did not raise by his pleadings the want of \"prior notice,\" or make it a part of his case in the Court below, he could not do so in appeal.\nPer Taschereau and Gywnne J. J., a member of that society who admits that he is in arrears of six months' contributions, is not entitled to \" prior notice \" before he can be expelled for non-payment of dues.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) rendered at Montreal, 21st December, 1877.\nThis was a suit instituted under the shape of a petition for a peremptory mandamus and requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, by the respondent, who alleged in his petition, among other things, that, having been duly admitted, he continued for many years to be a member of the defendant society, which is a body corporate established in the City of Montreal, whose object (as stated in the petition) was and is to aid those belonging thereto in case of sickness and to secure similar assistance and other advantages to the widows and children of deceased members.\nThe petition further stated that the society was and is governed by a constitution and by-laws, and admitting that, on the 13th of January, 1877, the petitioner had neglected during more than six months to pay his contributions, and that it was then competent for the defendant society to strike his name from the list of members and to prevent him from any longer forming part of the said society averred that to that end it was necessary for the society duly to require the member thus in arrear to pay the said arrears and that at a general and regular meeting? The collector-treasurers should make known the names of those who are in- debited in six months' contributions, and then that someone should make motion that such members be struck from the list of members, and he referred to the by-laws of the society in support of this contention. The petitioner then alleged: That no request was ever made to him for the payment of his arrears either by the Treasurer, or by the Collector or his assistant. That no account was ever sent to him and that he has never known and does not know what is the amount due by him for the arrears. That no motion was made on or before the 13th January, 1877, by any member of the society defendant, at any general and regular meeting, with the object of striking from the list of members the names of those members which the collector-treasurers are obliged to make known as being indebted in six months' contributions or more and that in reality no motion was adopted to that effect. That on and before the said 13th day of January, and even after there was and there is still a great number of members who are in arrears for more than six months' contributions and who are in the enjoyment of all the benefits and advantages of membership. That the defendant society has often consented to receive the payment of more than six months' arrears from its members. That the defendant had no right to erase the name of the petitioner from its list of members under the pretext that he owed more than six months' contributions, without erasing at the same time the names of all members who likewise owed more than six months' contributions The petition further alleged that on the 23rd of April, 1877, the petitioner presented himself at a general and regular meeting of the society defendant held at the society's ordinary place of meeting, and that there and then the petitioner did offer, in presence of the president, the officers and members of the society assembled in regular meeting, in good current money, the sum of $20.00 to pay the arrears which he may; have owed the defendant, that he might be again received as a member of the said society, which the defendant illegally and unjustly refused, and that ever since the said the 13th of January the defendant has refused to reinstate the plaintiff petitioner in his rights and privileges as a member of the said society, and that illegally and fraudulently and without cause or reason: wherefore the petitioner prayed that a writ of mandamus should issue, enjoining the defendant to reinstate the petitioner in his rights and privileges as a member of the said society.\nTo this requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e and to the writ of mandamus the defendant filed an exception p\u00e9remptoire, wherein the defendant society says and alleges that it avails itself of the important admissions contained in the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, to wit, that the petitioner was indebted for more than six months and that he has been regularly expelled from the society.\nThat in fact the petitioner was well and duly expelled, according to the constitution and by-laws of the said society, conjointly with twelve other members in default like himself, by a resolution adopted unanimously at a meeting of the society held in the assembly hall on the 8th day of January, 1877.\nThat the said resolution of expulsion was in order and had been preceded by the reading of the names of the members in default whom the society desired to expel,\u2014that the defendant is not obliged to collect at their domiciles the contributions of members in arrears, but that, on the contrary, the members are obliged to pay all their contributions, fines and other dues at the hall of the said society where it holds its meetings and where all its business is transacted, at the general, as well as at the weekly meetings. That the right of the defendant to expel its members in arrears is optional, and it is responsible therefore to no one.\nThat the defendant has a right to expel either all or any part of its members in arrears, and it considers of essential importance the power to expel when it chooses, and those whom it chooses, consulting merely the Opportunity of circumstances and its own well understood interests wherefore the defendant prayed, that the writ of mandamus be quashed, and, that the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e be dismissed.\nFor answer to this peremptory exception the petitioner replied, declaring that all the facts tending to contradict the allegations of the requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e are false and unfounded in fact wherefore the plaintiff, persisting in the conclusions by him taken in his said requ\u00eate prayed that the peremptory exception should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff filed the following articulations of facts to be proved by him, to which the defendant gives the respective answers following:\n\u201cArticulation 1. \u2014Is it not true that before the month of January last, (1877) the plaintiff was a member of the society defendant? Answer.\u2014Yes, but liable to be struck off.\n\u201cArticulation 2. Is it not true that when the name\nof the defendant was erased from the list there were at the same time other members in arrears with the payment of their contributions, whose names remained on the said list? Answer. Yes.\n\u201cArticulation 3. Is it not true that in the month of January last and at the time of the institution of. this action, there were persons owing more than six months' contributions who are still in the enjoyment of the rights and privileges of members of the society defendant? Answer. Yes a number remain members, but the fact of being in arrears deprives them of some of the benefits.\n\u201cArticulation 4.\u2014Is it not true that all the facts allegged in the said requite are true? Answer.\u2014No.\"\nCertain extracts from the constitution and by-laws of the society were produced in evidence and admitted, whereby it appeared that each candidate for admission to membership promised to be faithful to the by-laws of the society. That by article 5 of the by-laws the regular contribution of members was forty cents per month, payable each month; and by article 11 that it was the duty of the collector-treasurers to collect those dues during the meetings, and at each regular and general meeting to call over the names of members who were indebted in contributions for six full months or over * * *; and by article 22 that every member who should fail to attend any general and regular meeting should be liable to a fine of 5 cents without appeal except in cases of sickness or absence from the city; and by article 20 sec. 5, that when a member should have neglected during six months to pay his contributions, the society might erase his name from the list of members and he should then no longer form part of the society; that for this purpose it should be the duty of the collector-treasurers at every general and regular meeting to make known the names of those who are indebted in six months' contributions, and then that any one might move that such members be struck off from the list of members of the society; and further by sec. 6 of the same article, that every member who should have compromised the honor, the dignity, or the interests, of the society, might be expelled therefrom; that a member should be held to have compromised the honor of the society when guilty of immoral conduct, and the corresponding secretary, having warned him in writing and by order of the society to reform his conduct, if he does not amend his ways in the space of the month he might be expelled on motion. And by article 10 of the constitution it was provided that every member forfeits his right to the benefits and his other rights who does not fulfill the obligations required by the by-laws. And by article 7 of the constitution it was declared that the members should pay the monthly contribution as fixed by the by-laws.\nThere was also produced and filed as evidence in the cause an admission in writing signed by the attornies for the petitioner in the words following:\n\u201cThe parties admit that the exhibits produced are true copies of the documents they purport to be, and that the name of the plaintiff was read at the meeting at which his name was erased before the motion was made for expulsion as well as the names of the members mentioned in the resolution produced in the record.\"\nThis motion, extracted from the minutes of the general meeting of the 8th January, 1877, was also produced, and was as follows: \"Moved by Mr. Leclerc, and seconded by Mr. J. Bte. Mass\u00e9, that the following named gentlemen be struck from the list of members of the society on account of arrears, to wit:\" (here follows the names of 13 members, including the petitioner).\nUpon this record and evidence the learned Judge of the Superior Court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants, considering the exceptions of the defendants to be well founded in law, and he granted the conclusions thereof and dismissed the petition of the petitioner with costs.\nMr. Carter Q. C., and Mr. Mousseau Q. C., for the appellants:\nIn this case the respondent was expelled for the mere cause of non-payment of his monthly contributions. In his petition he admits he was in arrears for six months and that it was competent for the appellants to strike his name from the list of members, and by the admission of facts which is of record admits that in accordance with the by-laws his name was read at the meeting where his name was erased before the motion was made for expulsion. Nothing else was required by the constitution and by-laws of the society. Contributions are payable at the hall where the members meet at the monthly meetings, and as all members are bound to attend these meetings, every member must be presumed to be present, and know what is going on.\nThe only grounds of complaint, such as laid down in his petition are three in number: 1st No mise en de-meure, or demand of payment. 2nd. Many other members of the society were equally in arrears, and the society had no right to discriminate amongst them; 3rd. No motion made to expel respondent. The Superior Court deemed these grounds insufficient and on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, their decision was reversed because respondent had been expelled without \"prior notice.\" This was a new argument, it was not one of the grounds chosen in limine, before the Superior Court, and it would be a great injustice to allow it. And why? No evidence is allowed in appeal l if the point had been raised in the Superior Court the appellant would have proved a usage a coutume followed by unanimous consent, and prove that the mode of procedure to expel members in arrears was and has been the one adopted against Lapierre, and hundreds of members have in fact been struck off in the same manner.\nNow we come to the merit of the contention that prior notice was necessary. Why should such a notice be necessary in the present case? Lapierre is not accused of misbehavior, of having compromised the honor or the dignity of the society. If such a charge had been preferred against him, notice would have been necessary, as provided and required by sub-section 6 of art. 20 of the by-laws.\nLapierre has been expelled for the mere cause of non- payment of his monthly contributions, burial dues and fines. In such cases, prior notice is not necessary.\nThis case is to be viewed as a matter of contract, and we contend that this by-law is equivalent to a notice. The case of Ragget v. Musgrave ([1]) is in point, and in this as in that case the rules provided for the manner of payment. When the date and the place of payment is determined as in the present instance, the law prevailing in the province of Quebec requires no mise en demeure, no demand of payment, nor any notice whatever prior to the time of payment.\nThe rules and by-laws of this society fall under the provisions of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec. See Arts. 1056 1131 and 1134.\nThe society is not and cannot be bound to pass a trial on a member on the mere question of non-payment of his dues The question of prior notice does not apply. A member of a society such as the society appellant in default is never notified in advance that he may defend himself on a charge of non-payment, and there are English authorities clear on this point. See Scratchley's Practical Treatise on Building and Lands Societies ([2]); Card v. Carr ([3]).\nMr. Doutre, Q. C, for respondent:\nThe petition sufficiently alleges the want of notice. In one paragraph it is alleged that the respondent was illegally and fraudulently and without cause or reason refused by the appellants to be reinstated in the enjoyment of all rights and privileges belonging to members. According to all authorities, when it is desired to deprive a member of his rights in a society; where there is a question of property, he is entitled to receive notice. This is unwittingly admitted by the appellants, who filed of record a paper, being the account intended to be sent to respondent which account contained a notice. The motion for expulsion does not ever contain any statement that the- member was in arrears for six months and that his name was erased because he was six months in arrears. It was the duty of the appellants to prove that prior notice had been given. I will refer the Court to Angell and Ames on Corporations ([4]); King v. The Chancellor of the University of Cambridge ([5]); Rex. v. Mayor, &c. to Liver-pool ([6]); Grant on Corporations ([7]); Brice on ultra vires ([8]); Field on Corporations ([9]); Bagg's Case ([10]); Mereweather and Stephens on Municipal Corporations ([11]); Schmitt v. Saint Franciscus Benevolent Society ([12]).\nThe charter being silent as to conferring any power to inflict forfeiture operating ipso facto on the respondent, the appellants are governed by the common law which requires prior notice.\nTo say that the petitioner did not complain of want of notice is playing on words. He was taken by surprise, and thereby deprived of rights for himself, his widow and his children, to secure which he had paid contributions for twenty years. If it be sound law that such notice should have been given it was sufficient for him to say that he had been illegally expelled.\nAs to the articles of the Civil Code relied on by the counsel for appellants it is sufficient to say that the whole policy of our civil law has been that no lapse of time was fatal. By referring to art. 1069 of the Civil Code it will be found to be only applicable to commercial matters, and even this is new law. The only way the appellant could expel the respondent was according to law, and by law respondent was entitled to a notice of some kind.\nMr. Carter, Q. C., in reply:\nWhen motion was made, it must be taken as having been made in conformity with the by-laws. The learned counsel also referred to Littleton v. Blackburn ([13]).\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nThe only matter put forward which could have availed the plaintiff in this case was the want of notice of the proceedings to be taken with a view to the expulsion of the plaintiff from the society, and his expulsion in his absence without having such notice This point was not raised in the suit by the pleadings, nor put forward in the Superior Court where the question should have been raised and tried, and so in my opinion, is not now open on appeal to plaintiff, who made it no part of his original case.\nFOURNIES, J.:\u2014\nL'Intim\u00e9, membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Secours Mutuel appelante en cette cause, \u00e9tant tomb\u00e9 en arr\u00e9rages pour six mois de sa contribution mensuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour cette raison expuls\u00e9 de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 5 de ses r\u00e8glements. Cet article est ainsi con\u00e7u:\n(5) Whenever a member shall have neglected during six months to pay his contributions, or the entire amount of his entrance fee, the society may erase his name from the list of members, and he shall then no longer form part of the society: for that purpose, at every general and regular meeting it is the duty of the Collector-Treasurers to make known the names of those who are indebted in six months contributions, or in a balance of their entrance fee, and then any one may move that such members be struck off from the list of members of the society.\nApr\u00e8s son expulsion 1 Intim\u00e9 s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, district de Montr\u00e9al, pour en obtenir un bref de Mandamus pour se faire r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans tous ses droits et privil\u00e8ges comme membre de la dite society se fondant lo. sur ce qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure de payer et qu'aucun \u00e9tat de ses arr\u00e9rages ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement fourni; 20. Que d'autres membres se trouvant dans le m\u00eame cas que lui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expulses, et que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'avait pas le droit de faire une telle distinction parmi ses membres; 30. Qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait motion \u00e0 cet effet \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nL'Appelante a plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'Intim\u00e9 par une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et par une exception p\u00e9remptoire dans laquelle elle all\u00e8gue que l'Intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l'article ci-dessus cit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s contestation li\u00e9e, preuve et audition au m\u00e9rite, la Jour Sup\u00e9rieure, par jugement en date du 19 juin 1877, a renvoy\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition pour insuffisance de ses all\u00e9gations.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 en appel; et l'appelante se plaint que c'est uniquement pour un motif que l'Intim\u00e9 n'avait ni plaid\u00e9, ni invoqu\u00e9 en Jour de premi\u00e8re instance, savoir: que lui, l'Intim\u00e9, n'avait re\u00e7u de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aucun avis l'informant des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s adopt\u00e9s pour son expulsion, et qu'il avait en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de son droit de d\u00e9fense. C'est \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question seule que se r\u00e9duit la contestation entre les parties devant cette Cour. L'Intim\u00e9 le d\u00e9clare formellement dans son factum.\nAvant de consid\u00e9rer la question de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un tel avis dans un cas comme celui dont il s'agit, il faut d'abord savoir si la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et mise directement en contestation (in issue) par des all\u00e9gations suffisantes dans les plaidoyers des parties On a vu plus haut quells sont les principaux moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l'Intim\u00e9 pour attaquer la validit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de son expulsion; mais on ne trouve nulle part dans la proc\u00e9dure qu'il ait allege le d\u00e9faut d'avis de ces proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour les faire declarer nuls. * Cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour soulever la question et mettre la d\u00e9fenderesse appelante en \u00e9tat, si elle le jugeait n\u00e9cessaire, de se justifier en prouvant que de fait un avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'une semblable all\u00e9gation est admise par 1 intim\u00e9, qui pretend l'avoir faite d'une mani\u00e8re suffisante. Pour prouver cet avanc\u00e9 il nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 deux endroits de sa p\u00e9tition: lo. \u00e0 la ligne 31, page 3, de sa p\u00e9tition o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s avoir admis le droit de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'expulser pour d\u00e9faut de paiement pendant six mois, il ajoute \" but to that end \u201cit was necessary for the said society duly to require \" the members then in arrears to pay the said arrears, \"&c\"; 2o dans l'all\u00e9gation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de ses conclusions, l'intim\u00e9 en se plaignant du refus de l'appelante de le r\u00e9habiliter dans ses droits, ajoute que ce refus an \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ill\u00e9galement et frauduleusement et sans cause ni raison, at and that illegally and fraudulently and without cause or reason.\"\nLe d\u00e9faut d'avis ou de sommation d'avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre contre une motion d'expulsion peut il \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme compris dans ces deux all\u00e9gations?\nDans la premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation il se borne \u00e0 dire que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pouvait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son expulsion \u00e0 moins de l'avoir requis de payer ses arr\u00e9rages. Cette demande de paiement est bien diff\u00e9rence du d\u00e9faut d'avis d'avoir \u00e0 se d\u00e9fendre contre une proposition d'expulsion, et ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme son \u00e9quivalent. Je ne puis trouver l\u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation du d\u00e9faut d'avis qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 le motif unique sur lequel la Cour du Bane de la Reine a base son jugement.\nDans la derni\u00e8re all\u00e9gation les mots illegally, fraudulently, and without cause or reason, s'appliquent au refus de le r\u00e9habiliter dans ses droits comme membre, et ne sont certainement pas susceptibles d'\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme une all\u00e9gation du d\u00e9faut d'avis de la motion d'expulsion\nIl me para\u00eet en cons\u00e9quence clair que cette question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en contestation par les plaidoiries, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'intim\u00e9 n'aurait pas d\u00fb obtenir gain de cause devant la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nLa contestation ayant \u00e9t\u00e9, lors de l'argument, r\u00e9duite \u00e0 ce seul point, il devient inutile de s'occuper des autres moyens invoqu\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9tition.\nHENRY, J., concurred.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThe appellant is a benevolent society in Montreal, of which Lapierre, the respondent, was a member. By one of the rules of the society, any member who neglects during six months to pay his contributions may be expelled from it, Under that rule Lapierre was expelled on the 8th January, 1877, for non-payment of his contributions. By a writ of mandamus, he demands that the society be ordered to reinstate him as one of its members. He alleges that it is true that he had been more than six months without paying his contribution, but that his expulsion was irregularly made and illegal: 1st, Because he was not put en demeure to pay. 2nd, Because many other members of the society in arrear as he was were not expelled as he was; and 3rd, Because no motion to expel him was made at any regular meeting, according to the rules of the society.\nThe second of these reasons is unfounded in law and was, I believe, abandoned at the argument before us. A creditor may sue only one out of a hundred of his debtors, if he chooses; so could this society expel one of its members in default and allow others in the same case to remain in its ranks.\nThe third of the reasons invoked by Lapierre against the legality of his expulsion was that his name was not called out as being m default at any of the regular meetings of the society, according to one of its rules, and that no regular motion was ever made to expel him, according to the said rules. This ground is unfounded in fact. The motion to expel him is proved to have been duly made and adopted and he admits that his name was read at the meeting where his name was erased, before the motion was made.\nI come now to the first ground of his requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, that he was not asked for payment, or put en demeure before being expelled. He says:\nI admit that I had not paid my contribution for more than six months, but I was not called upon to pay, and could riot be expelled from the society before being so called upon.\nThis contention, it seems to me, is entirely unsupported by the rules of the society.\nArticle 7 of its constitution says that\nThe members pay a monthly contribution which is fixed by the by-laws.\nArticle 10 that\nEvery member who does not fulfill the obligations required by the by-laws forfeits his rights to the benefits and his other rights,\nArticle 5th of the by-laws fixes the amount of the monthly contribution at 40 cents per month. Article 11 defines the duties of the treasurer and other affairs; it enacts that the treasurer shall receive from the collector-treasurers the money collected by them at each meeting, namely, at each general and regular meeting, held on the first Monday of every month. By same article the collector-treasurers are required to collect during the meeting the monies and contributions of the members They must also at each regular general meeting call over the names of the members indebted for six months or more.\nArticle 20 provides that if a member neglects during six months to pay his contributions, it is lawful and optional for the society to strike his name off the list of members, for which purpose at each meeting' thetas collectors are required to mention the names of those \"who are indebted for more than, six months of contribution\nArticle 22 enacts that every member who fails to attend any general and regular meeting is liable to a fine of five cents except in the case of sickness or absence from the city.\nNow, taking all these rules together, it seems to me that Lapierre cannot contend that the society had to request him personally to pay his contribution before expelling him. The reading of his name at a regular meeting, where he was bound to be, was the only mise en demeure that he could ask for.\nThe contributions of the members are payable at such meetings, since the rules say that it is at such meetings, and there only that these contributions are to be collected This reading of his name on the list of defaulters is the only demand of payment required by the contract he entered into with the society when he joined it. By the express terms of this contract he has agreed to pay forty cents a month to the society itself at its regular meetings and that if he should allow six months to elapse without paying, all his rights as a member were to be forfeited; he has agreed that in such a case his name should be called out at one of the regular meetings, and that thereupon any member might immediately move his expulsion. All this has been done: he admits that he did not pay for more than six months, that his name was called out regularly that his expulsion was therefore moved and decreed. What else could he ask for? Any demand of payment under our law. may be made at the place where the debt is payable. Lapierre's $ debt was payable at the meeting, where demand of payment to him was made by calling out his name according to the rules. Everything seems to me perfectly regular.\nLapierre, at the argument, invoked, as another ground against the legality of his expulsion, the absence Of prior notice. He urged that not only was a demand of payment necessary, but that the society should have notified him that on such a day a motion to expel him would be made. I do not think that as the record stands he can-avail himself of this want of notice * this case must be taken as he has himself made it. There is not a word of this want of notice in his requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e nor in any of the pleadings in the record. This precludes him from invoking it now. Being of that opinion, it is perhaps unnecessary for me to say what would have been the consequences of this want of prior notice if it had been pleaded. I may, however, say that I have not been able to find a single case under the French law where such a notice has been held necessary in case of expulsion for payment of contribution. These benevolent societies exist in large-numbers in France Tinder the words Association de secours mutuel l in Dalloz Repertoire, the law which regulates them is clearly demonstrated, and cases are cited but not a word of this prior notice in such a case is mentioned. The principle of our civil law which rules this case is it seems to me, that if a party is en demeure to pay he may be expelled without prior notice of the motion for his expulsion ([14]). According to the terms of his contract with the society, Lapierre was en demeure to pay and no prior notice to him was required. And how could a notice be given to him? Art. 20 sub-sec. 5, of the by-laws says that when a member is six months in arrear he may beL expelled: that for this purpose, at every general meeting the names of the members so in default shall be read, and that then any one may move the expulsion. What notice does Lapierre now say he was entitled to Surely not a notice that he had been six months without paying Then can it be a notice that his name would be read as a defaulter at the regular meeting? That cannot be what he means; this calling of the defaulters is done in virtue of the by-laws and must be done, in fact, at each meeting by the collector-treasurers, upon whom this duty is imperatively imposed. It must be the notice that a motion for expelling him would be made that he means. Well any one of the members was at liberty to make that motion immediately after his, Lapierre's, name was called out as a defaulter. How could that member know before this that Lapierre was a defaulter and would be so called out and if so how could he give him notice that immediately after such calling out of his name he would move to expel him? How could the officers of the society or any one, know that such a motion would be made?\nLapierre has been, it seems to me, regularly expelled. I also notice that he had been over ten months without paying his monthly contribution of forty cents, so that he does not seem to have been harshly treated by the society.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court quashed his writ of mandamus and dismissed his demand. The Court of Queen's Bench reversed that jugement, and ordered the society to reinstate him as a member The appeal before us is from this last judgment. I am of opinion to allow the appeal, and to confirm the judgment rendered by the Superior Court with costs in the three courts against the respondent. GWYNNE J.:\u2011\nFrom a perusal of the case of the record and issues joined therein, of the evidence adduced in support thereof and of the admissions made in the cause it appears that the only points presented to the learned Judge of the Superior Court for his adjudication were: 1st, Was it, or not, necessary that a demand should have been made upon the petitioner for payment of his arrears before a motion for erasing his name from the list of members should have been made or carried? And 2nd Was it, or not, competent for the society to erase the names of the petitioner and the others comprised with him in the same motion there being other members of the society equally in arrear, whose names were not erased?\nTrue it is, that the petitioner had rested the claim assserted in his petition upon another ground also namely\u00ab that no motion was in fact made by any member of the society, nor adopted at any regular or general meeting, with the object of striking from the list of members the names of those members who were six months in arrear; but the admissions made upon that point, and the motion itself, which was produced, displace this ground of complaint and shew that the course indicated by the by-law in that behalf was strictly complied with, unless it was necessary, in order to make the motion effectual, that the names of all members in default for six months should be struck off if any were.\nIn these societies which are of the nature of mutual insurance societies in which the contributions of the members are the premiums paid by them for the benefits insured, it is apparent that punctual payment of the contributions imposed upon each member by the bylaws is essential to the success of the society. Every person upon becoming a member enters into a contract to comply with all the articles of the by-laws and. of the constitution of the society. Now, looking at the by- LU laws and constitution we find, that in the case before us, the petitioner, upon becoming a member, contracted with the society to pay monthly the contributions established by the by-laws which was a known determinate G sum, and as it was provided by the by-laws that these contributions were to be collected by the proper officer at the general regular monthly meetings, which the petitioner was required to attend under a penalty of 50. for every default the fair construction of the contract is that the petitioner undertook to pay his contributions to the proper officer every month at the regular monthly meeting of the society. It is clear, then, that upon default by the petitioner in payment of his. dues, an action for their recovery might have been maintained against him without proof of any special demand of the amount in arrear before action. Upon non-payment at the times and place agreed upon he became in complete default, but we further see by reference to sec. 5 of article 20 of the by-laws incorporated into the petitioner's contract, that he in effect contracted with the society, that in case he should neglect to pay his contributions during six months, the society might erase his name from the list of members, upon a motion being made to that effect at any general regular meeting of the society, after the collector-treasurer should make known, as was his duty to do, the petitioner was indebted in six months' contributions; while by sec. 6 of the same article it was contracted between the petitioner and the society that upon any charge compromising the honor, the dignity or the interests of the society he could only be expelled after a warning in writing should be served upon him by order of the society.\nIt is impossible to import into this contract the further condition, which is not expressed therein, that after the expiration of the six months during which the petitioner was in arrear, and. notwithstanding he may have been duly reported by the collector-treasurer as so in arrear, it was nevertheless necessary that a special demand should have been made upon him for payment of those arrears before a motion for erasing his name from the list of members could be entertained by the society.\nIn Rex vs. Lyme Regis ([15]), it was held, that where residence was a condition of the enjoyment of a corporate office the corporator, in case of non-residence, might be removed, without any notice to come and reside being first given, for that he was bound to know the law under which he held office; the principle of that case appears to apply to this, for the petitioner was bound to know that by his contract he had promised to pay his contributions without any special demand at a particular time and place and that if he should make default, and therein continue for six months, he might be erased from the list of members, upon a motion to that effect made by any member of the society.\nIn Rex vs. Mayor of Axbridge ([16]), upon shewing cause against a mandamus to restore a corporate officer, namely the town clerk who had been removed sufficient cause for removal was shewn the prosecuting counsel admitted there was sufficient cause of amotion, but objected that the town clerk had been removed without notice to appear and defend himself and the Court Lord Mansfield presiding declared that they would not grant the writ to restore an officer, when it was acknowledged that the corporation had sufficient cause to remove him.\nThis case was followed in Rex vs. The Mayor & c., of London ([17]) where the Court refused a mandamus to restore a corporate officer who had been suspended from an office to which emoluments were attached, without L notice, it appearing upon his own shewing that there was good ground for the suspension.\nThe plaintiff in his petition here expressly admits that he was in default for the full period of six months mentioned in the by-law in payment of those contributions which were in the nature of premiums, agreed to be paid by him as the consideration of the benefits assured to him; that he had broken the contract in virtue of which alone he was to continue to be a member of the society in its most essential particular and that by reason of such breach of contract it was competent for the society to strike his name off the list of members and to prevent him from any longer forming part of the society, provided only, as he contends, that a demand of payment of the arrears should be first made upon him. I do not see, as I have already said, that we should be justified in importing this proviso into the contract, and as to the other point namely, that other persons who were also in arrear for six months, were not also struck off no case has been cited in support of the contention that it was not competent for the society to erase the names of some without at the same time erasing the names of all in like default which is not clear if it be the case there were at that time others in like default whose names were not erased. The rule upon this point to be gathered from the cases is, that the Court never interferes between societies of this kind and their members where the action taken by the society has been in good faith and in the exercise of their judgment for the benefit of the society, and not founded upon mere individual caprice; where the decision has been arrived at bona fide without any caprice or improper motive, and where the plain principles of justice do not appear to have been violated. Osgood y.. Nelson ([18]), Hopkinson v. Marquis of Exeter ([19]).\nIn so far, therefore, as relates to the case as expressly set up on the record, the decision of the learned Judge of the Superior Court, before whom the case came in the first instance, appears to me to have been well founded, nor do I understand the learned Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench on its appeal side to reverse his judgment upon any of the special grounds upon which the petitioner, as it appears to me, rested his case, but upon this ground, namely, that in their judgment it was contrary to the principles of natural justice to erase the plaintiff's name, not because a prior demand for payment of the arrears was not first made upon him but because he had not first been served with a notice that a resolution to erase his name would be proposed to the society at some meeting named in such notice\u00bb This judgment and the application of the maxim '' nemo rebus suis interdictas exislemelur '' to this case are rested upon Rex. v. Richardson ([20]) * Rex* v. The Mayor & c .,, of Liverpool ([21]); a passage in Angel\u00ed and Ames on corporations 3rd Ed. p. 413, citing a case of the Common-weath v. Pensyluania Beneficial Society ([22]); and Regina v Saddler's Co ([23]).\nNow, Rex. v. Richardson was the case of the removal of a freeman of the Borough of Ipswich without sufficient cause, and Rex. v. The Mayor & c., of Liverpool, was the case of the removal of a corporator from a freehold office without sufficient cause by a court of the corporation not shewn to have been duly assembled That portion of the corporation which assumed to dismiss the officer, not being assembled upon a charter day or general day of meeting, it was among other things held that to enable a special meeting to assemble it should have been averred in the return to the mandamus that all the members of the court had been notified to attend.\nRegina v Saddlers' Co. \"was the case of a freeman of the company having been removed, upon a charge of fraud committed by him in procuring his admission, without notice of any proceeding to establish the charge against him. The remarks of the learned members of the respective courts through which the case passed to the House of Lords as to the removal of the party complaining without notice, plainly apply to the nature of the charge of which in effect he was condemned unheard, but that they do not apply to cases where there is admitted, upon the proceedings taken for the purpose 01 obtaining redress, that there was sufficient cause of removal, is apparent from the reference made by Lord Ghelmsford ([24]) to Rex. v. Griffiths ([25]), that it is idle to grant a mandamus to restore where the party could be removed again immediately. The appositeness of the above cases, relied upon in the judgment of the Court of Appeal to the circumstances of the case before us, is not very apparent when we reflect that the plaintiff here in his petition admits that he was liable to have his name struck off for breach of his contract in its most essential particular, and that it is shewn in evidence that the action taken was taken at a general regular meeting of the society which it was the plaintiff's duty to attend, and that all the conditions concurred and proceedings were taken which he had contracted with the society should be sufficient.\nAs to the case in 2 Serg. and Rawl. 141, its report is very meagre; enough, however, does appear in it to weaken its authority as applicable to the case before us, even if it contained the expression of opinion entertained by a court whose judgments were binding upon us. For,\n(3) 5 B. & Aid. 731. firstly, as to the necessity of notice of an intention to expel 50. in the given case, that point does not appear to have E been raised in the case its determination was not at all necessary to support the judgment of the Court, which proceeded upon the ground that there was no expulsion. Morover, secondly, the contention of the party applying to the Court for relief was not only that no expulsion had. in fact been effected and that therefore he was still en-titled to all the benefits of membership, but that in truth he was not liable to be expelled, for that the society was indebted to him for services as secretary in a larger sum than the amount of his arrears, so that in effect there was no sufficient cause to justifty expulsion. And lastly, the judgment professes to proceed upon the terms of the charter, and it does not appear that each member of the society had contracted as the plaintiff here has, that upon his continuing in default for the specified period, and upon his being repotted to the society at any general meeting as such defaulter, . any member might then make a motion that his name should be struck off the list of members, and that upon such motion being carried the plaintiffs right of membership should cease, and he should in fact no longer be a member of the society. In the\"argument before us it was strongly urged by the learned counsel for the appellants, that the point upon which the judgmentof the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal proceeded was not raised upon the record. This contention appears to be well founded. The learned counsel for the respondent combated it upon the ground that it was sufficiently raised by force of the words \" without cause or reason in the last paragraph of the plaintiff s petition, which alleges\nThat since the 13th of January last until this day the defendant has refused to reinstate the plaintiff petitioner in his rights; and privileges as a member of the said corporation, L' Union St. Joseph de Montr\u00e9al, and to put him into the enjoyment of aright and privileges belonging to such membership, and that illegally and fraudulently and without cause or reason.\nNow it is to be observed that what is here said to; have been illegal and fraudulent, and without cause or reason, relates to certain action said to have been taken upon the 23rd of April, when the plaintiff, after three G months' notice of his expulsion, applied to be reinstated, and has no reference to anything done or omitted at the time of expulsion in the preceding January. But, further, assuming the allegation in the last paragraph to have pointed in express terms to the removal in january, namely, that it was charged that the plaintiff's removal then was without cause or reason, that would have been insufficient to amount to an averment that the removal was illegal for want of a preceding notcce of the intended motion. Default in payment of his contributions for the period of six months constituted the cause and reason of his removal. Notice of the intended expulsion, if necessary to have been given, was part of the proceeding, necessary to effect the removal for the pre-existing cause, and cannot be said to be a part of the cause, but the general scope and frame of the petition clearly shews that its framer never had in his mind the idea that he was raising an issue upon the point of removal without notice being given of the intended motion. In the paragraph preceding the last, he alleges that three months after his expulsion, and after he had notice thereof, the petitioner applied at a general regular meeting of the society to be received again as a member, which application he says the d\u00e9fendant illegally and unjustly refused. The natural construction of the petition read all together, is that the plaintiff's contention was that it was illegal and unjust to refuse to receive him again, because, although true it is he had committed such default as justified his removal, yet that it was not legal to remove him because, 1st. Payment of the arrears had not been first demanded of him; 2nd. Because he had not been reported by the collector-treasurer as having been six months, in default; 3rd. Because in fact as he alleged, no motion to remove him had been made by any member of the society as required by the by-laws, and; 4th. Because the society had no legal right to remove him without at the same time removing all others in like default.\nThese are the points upon which he rests his case. Now, assuming the contention of the plaintiff upon these points to fail, I cannot see upon what principle of justice, after what the plaintiff, himself alleges took place upon the 23rd of April, which appears to be a full unequivocal confirmation of what took place in January, he could with any reason be heard to urge the want of notice of the intended motion in January. After a full consideration of the matter, upon the application of the plaintiff after three months further default, the society in effect confirms the action taken in January. After this action of the society upon the 23rd of April I fail to see what legal right the plaintiff has to invoke the interferenee of the Court, (or what right the Court has) to impose upon the society the obligation against its will to receive from the plaintiff his overdue contributions so long in arrear. The society itself alone in the untramelled, bona fide exercise of its discretion, is the sole tribunal to decide whether it should, or not, waive the forfeiture of his rights, which the plaintiff's default has incurred. I see no principle upon which the Court can compel a society of this nature to waive the ground of forfeiture, and to accept now from the plaintiff payment of all arrears in condonation of his default; and if that cannot be done, it would be contrary to another principle which governs the Courts in cases of this kind, to order the name of the plaintiff to be placed again upon the list, for it would be still subject to removal for the old default, a point already conclusively decided upon the plaintiff's own application for a rehearing upon the 23rd of April.\nAdopting the language of Mr. Justice Blackburn in \u00cd Res. v Saddler's Co ([26]) I think that in this case. relief ought to he granted or refused according to the legal right upon the Record, and I am of opinion that the plaintiff has not raised upon the Record the point upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is rested and further that in view of the circumstances of this case if it had been so raised, it would not have established a legal right in the plaintiff to be reinstated, or have justified the decree made in his favor, in the face of his own admission that he had committed such a default as justified his removal, and of the evidence, which shews that the removal took place precisely in the manner in which the plaintiff contracted it might take place, and of the admission contained in the plaintiff's petition, to the effect that, upon his application upon the 23rd of April, the society deliberately refused to waive the cause of forfeiture and has substantially affirmed the action of the society in January.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal must therefore be reversed and that of the Superior Court he reinstated.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mousseau, Chapleau & Archambault\nSolicitors for respondents: Doutre, Doutre & Robidoux.\n[1] 2 C. & P. 556.\n[2][2] P. 78 and ease their cited.\n[3] 1 C.

When vessel was well advanced C. disclosed the facts and nature of his interest to the agent of the respondent's company, and the company issued a policy of insurance against loss by fire to C. in the sum of $3,000. The vessel was still unfinished, and in B's possession when she was burned.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the Court below, that C's interest, relating, as it did, to a specific chattel, was an equitable interest which was insurable, and therefore C. was entitled to recover.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] making absolute a rule nisi to set aside a verdict, and enter a non-suit.\nThe action was on a policy of insurance against fire.\nA special case agreed upon by the parties for the purpose of the appeal states that:\n\"The Scottish Imperial Insurance Company now is, and in and prior and subsequent to the year 1874, was a corporation established and legally authorized under the laws of the Dominion of Canada to issue policies of fire insurance in the Dominion of Canada.\n\"The said company in said year had an office in the city of Saint John, in the Province of New Brunswick, and W. Colebrook Perley was its lawful Agent, and as such had power to act for said company.\n\"On or about the tenth day of August, 1874, the said company issued a policy of insurance against loss by fire to the plaintiff, in the sum of $3,000, 'on a schooner in course of construction by John Bishop in his ship-building yard at Hopewell, Albert Co., N. B., $3,000 insurance valid, launched or not launched, with liberty to complete, fit out and load cargo, the liability under this policy to cease when any marine policy exists covering said schooner,' for the period of six months, and the premium of said insurance was duly paid. The policy was put in evidence on the trial, but was subsequently burnt, and all other papers used or put in evidence at the said trial have since been burnt.\n* * * *\n\"That by consent of both parties a verdict was taken for the plaintiff for the sum of $3,318, being the amount plaintiff claimed to be interested in such vessel, with interest, with leave to the said defendants to move the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for leave to enter a non-suit, should the said Court be of opinion that the plaintiff had no insurable interest.\n\"That the said Supreme Court subsequently granted a rule nisi, calling on the plaintiff to show cause why a non-suit should not be entered, and after argument and time having been taken to consider, the judgment of the Court was delivered by Allen, C. J., (the other Judges concurring in such judgment, but giving no reasons therefor.)\n\"The said rule was made absolute, as follows:\n\"In the Supreme Court, \"Trinity Term, 41 Victoria,\nJames Clark v. The Scottish Imperial Insurance Comp'y.\n\"Upon reading the rule granted in this cause, and on hearing Mr. Thomson against the said rule, and Mr. Weldon in support thereof, and the Court having taken time to consider, doth now order that the said rule be made absolute, and a non-suit granted.\n\"By the Court,\n(Signed) W. Carman.\nFrom this rule plaintiff appealed.\nClark, the plaintiff, who carried on business in Saint John, describes, in his evidence, his connection with the builder, who resided in Hopewell, and through him, with the vessel, and what took place between himself and the agent on effecting the insurance and after the loss had taken place. He says:\u2014\n\"In 1872 I commenced supplying Bishop on this vessel. In this year he commenced getting timber out. The arrangement was that I was to supply him to build this vessel, and hold the vessel as security for my advances. I was to dispose of the vessel in shares, or the whole, as I saw proper, and when the vessel was disposed of, what was remaining after I got my pay was to go to Bishop. That was the arrangement. In pursuance of that arrangement, I made advances to him, to over $2,000. At the time I made application for insurance, Mr. Perley was agent. I went to effect insurance in August, 1874.\"\nMr. Armstrong, who went with plaintiff to agent to effect the insurance, says: \"Perley was away. I told his young man Clark wanted to make application for insurance. I got blank from Clark and filled it up, Clark signed it and left it there. I cannot state what was on the paper. I can only state what took place at the time. I am satisfied it was an application for insurance on a vessel which was building by Bishop, and that it stated plaintiff had been advancing on her, and the insurance was to cover advances.\"\nPlaintiff then says: \"I signed a paper\u2014the one spoken of by Mr. Armstrong. The paper was not given back to mo. After Perley returned home, I thought it best to see him as he was the agent. I saw him, and I said: 'Mr. Perley, I have made application for insurance on a vessel that was building by one John Bishop, in Hopewell, A. C.' Says 1: 'Mr. Perley, I want you distinctly to understand that the vessel is not building for me directly, but I hold her as collateral security. She is in my hands and for sale, to dispose of any way I see fit to getting money out of her.' He said he had seen the application, but he said Mr. Armstrong had made a mistake in figuring up the premium\u2014he had charged me some $2 or $3 too much. He took the paper\u2014I suppose it was the same paper I had signed before\u2014and altered the figures, and it reduced it down to some $31, it had been $33. He said that it was proper I should have insurance on a vessel where I had been making such large advances, it would be foolish if I didn't. I didn't sign any paper except the one which I signed when Mr. Armstrong was with me. I said: 'Mr. Perley, I have made application for $3,000. I haven't advanced that yet, but I have advanced something over $2,000, but it would take $3,000, and more, probably, to put her off.' Perley said if I advanced more I could further insure, but that I couldn't get more than my advances if I insured ever so much. I told him I was aware of it. I got the policy; this is it. The young man who was in the office brought this round to me. The young man's name is Wade.\"\nPlaintiff then says he went on making advances. Vessel was destroyed 3rd or 4th October, 1874. First intimation he got of the fire was by letter from Bishop, which he showed to Perley the same day he got it. \"Vessel was burnt to ashes on Saturday night. I can give no information how fire originated.\" He says: \"Mr. Perley read this letter. He said: 'Clark, its a bad job\u2014but you're a fortunate man that you insured. Now you see the necessity of having proper insurance when you're making advances.' I said: 'Mr. Perley, what steps am I to take? I'm not much acquainted with insurance business' He said: 'its my duty, as agent, to go and see where vessel was burnt.' I directed him how to go there. He told me afterwards that he had been up. After he returned, I went in, and he smiled and said: 'It was the cleanest burn I ever saw, and there was nothing left but a pile of iron\u2014didn't look if there had ever been much there.' I made out my claim\u2014it amounted to $2,960, or thereabouts. Young Mr. Charles Clark kept my books. Goods would be sent generally to Bishop in his son's vessel, and save freight; sometimes by other vessels. I had transactions with Bishop before of a similar kind. I knew it took him a long time to build a vessel. I told him I would charge him interest, which he agreed to, and I made up an interest account. Bishop had built three or four vessels before this, under advances from me, under same terms. I would always hold them. Sometimes I bought an interest in them\u2014half or three-quarters. I signed a letter addressed to Mr. Perley, and delivered it at his office to his young man.\"\nOn cross-examination, he proved the correctness of advance account. He says: \"Bishop has dealt with me fourteen or fifteen years. He got all kinds of advances. I always held the vessel. I would sell the vessel or get a mortgage on her. When vessels came down they were registered in the name of Bishop. Before selling I would ask Bishop what vessel would be worth, as a guide for me to sell. I never saw this vessel. Used to sell the vessels at from $16 to $18 a ton, hull and spars. They were iron fastened. When I commenced to supply this vessel former vessel was off. I had security on her. Former vessel was built by Bishop for his son. It was in the fall of 18721 commenced on this. Former vessel I charged advances to son. When she came down and was registered, I got mortgage on her. His son gave the mortgage. Former vessel was the 'Minnie.' On this vessel I supplied iron, oakum, spikes, etc.\"\nRe-examined\u2014Had been in the habit of making these agreements with ship-builders, Always held on to the vessel. Sold her or got a mortgage on her. There was no written agreement. Question\u2014\"Did you make the advances on the faith of this agreement?\" Mr. Weldon objects. \"Admitted, subject to Mr. Weldon's objection. Answer\u2014I did. I would not make them without.\"\nBishop, the builder, speaks as to the correctness of plaintiff's account as amounting \"to pretty near $3,000.\" He then describes the state the vessel was in; that he considered the vessel at the time of loss worth near $5,000, and that he had no insurance on her, and lost everything he had in her; and, as to his agreement with plaintiff, he says: \"Clark managed principally all my business in Saint John. I never sold any of the vessels. Don't think Clark sold any. I allowed him the privilege of doing so. We would talk the price over. Clark would either take a share in vessel, or take a mortgage on her when she came down for his advances. If he took a share, he would credit me with price of share, account of advances. I don't think I ever gave a mortgage to him. I built four vessels. This was the fourth. He was part owner of three vessels. In fall of 1873, after Christmas, I had the vessel pretty nearly half in frame\u2014about one-third framed. Laid keel in August, 1873. Worked on her all winter. At time of fire I considered vessel about half done\u2014more than that, for I had timber there to finish her. Don't think that we came to an arrangement as to price at which Clark should sell her. Think about $18 was spoken of, and I thought I should get $20. I bought part of her keel from Uriah Bennett, and I built on to it. I laid it before I got any timber in my yard, and it was two months after I laid the keel before I made the arrangements with Clark. It was Christmas, 1872, she was one-third timbered. We were two winters and two summers building her. In 1873 we had her all timbered out and top sides on and clamps in. In summer, 1874, we finished her at as far as she was when she was burnt. We finished laying decks, covering boards, waterways, etc.\"\nRe-examined.\u2014\"Think plaintiff commenced advancing in 1872\u2014in July. I wanted to build a vessel, and I wanted plaintiff to supply her, and I told him that he should have the vessel as security for what he supplied me with. That I would put in all I could myself. I said I could not tell him how much I could put in. That was about all that passed. He was to sell her, or make any bargain he could with her, and then to pay me the balance of what was paid him.\"\nThe defendant called no witnesses.\nThe question to be determined on this appeal was whether plaintiff had an insurable interest.\nMr. Thomson, Q.C., for appellant:\nIn this case the nature and extent of the appellant's interest in the subject matter of this insurance were fully and fairly disclosed to the respondent company, which, through its agent, admitted the interest to be an insurable one. The Court below decided that the appellant had not an insurable interest in the property. The appellant contends that it was only necessary to have an equitable interest, in other words such an interest as a Court of Equity will recognize and protect. The Chief Justice of the Court below says there never was any written agreement with regard to the advances, but an oral or written declaration may be as effectual as the most formal instrument.\nThe promise of the appellant's advance, and the advances made in pursuance of it, and on the faith of Bishop's agreement to place the vessel after being launched in his hands, in order that he might sell her, and pay himself, did create a valid lien in equity on the the vessel; and therefore he had an insurable interest. See Lucena v. Craufurd[2]; Ex parte Houghton[3]; Ex parte Yallop[4]; Gurnell v. Gardiner[5]; Riccard v. Prichard[6].\nAn equitable assignment is thus defined by Sir John Leach, V. C., in Watson v. The Duke of Wellington[7]:\n\"In order to constitute an equitable assignment there must be an engagement to pay out of a particular fund.\"\nIn Field v. Megaw[8], Montague Smith, J., says: \"If the plaintiff had agreed that the fund should be held specifically for Weld, the agreement might have been enforced by a bill in equity.\"\nNon-existing property to be acquired at a future time, although perhaps not assignable at law, is clearly so in equity. Brown v. Tanner[9]; Wilson v. Wilson[10].\nIt was assumed that the appellant claimed that there had been a sale, but that such a sale was void under the statute of frauds.\nThe contract was not for the sale of the vessel, but for the making of advances to build a vessel, on the agreement that the vessel was to be the fund out of which the appellant was to be paid, and for the purpose of making such fund available, the vessel was to be placed in his hands for sale, after she should be launched.\nNeither was there anything in the contract, which necessarily prevented its being carried out within a year. How does the statute of frauds apply to such a contract?\nThe case of Stockdale v. Dunlop[11], relied on by the respondent and the Court below, has no bearing on the present case. Moreover, the decision of Leroux v. Brown[12] virtually overrules that decision; and what right have the company to set up the statute of frauds. It does not affect a contract so as to make it void. It only declares that you cannot enforce it, but that is only between vendor and vendee, and not a third party.\nIt was also stated that there was no mutuality.\nThe appellant contends the agreement was mutual. It was an agreement by Clark to make such advances to Bishop as might be necessary to complete the vessel, and as Bishop might require, in consideration of which Bishop agreed that Clark should have a lien on the vessel, sell her, and pay himself out of the proceeds. Why is such agreement not mutual? The effect of it, moreover, was to suspend any right of the appellant to sue Bishop for the advances, at all events, until the fund out of which the advances were to be paid (the vessel) failed or was exhausted. Could Clark have sued Bishop for the advances at any time while the vessel was in the course of construction and before launching? It is submitted that he could not.\nThe Court seems to have been under the impression that to pass an interest in property not in esse requires, even in equity, an agreement possessing peculiar requisites not necessary in contracts relating to property actually in existence, and that such requisites are wanting here.\nThis view of the law, however, is wholly at variance with the authorities cited above, and with Lord Westbury's judgment in Holroyd v. Marshall[13]. The learned Chief Justice says: \"There was no such agreement as would pass property not in esse at the time it was made, or create any lien upon it, without a transmutation of possession; there was no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to make any specific amount of advances, and, therefore, the agreement, if such it might be called, was entirely wanting in mutuality. There was not even such a contract as could be enforced either at law or in equity.\"\nUnder the evidence it is by no means clear that the property was not in esse when the agreement between Clark and Bishop was made. It would seem, in fact, that the vessel had been some time in course of construction before Clark was asked to advance upon her.\nIn any case the appellant had clearly such an insurable interest as was decided to be sufficient by Lawrence, J., in Lucena v. Craufurd, \"To be interested in the possession of a thing is to be so circumstanced with respect to it as to have benefit from its existence, prejudice from its destruction.\" Davies v. The Home Ins. Co.[14].\nMr. Weldon Q. C., (Mr. Haliburton, with him), for respondent.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts of the case.\nWe contend appellant had not an equitable interest which a Court of Equity could enforce. The policy states that the insurance is \"on a schooner;\" the peculiar interest of the insured is not inserted. The party here insures a vessel; the question is, if company paid, would they have a right of subrogation.\nThere is a broad distinction between the cases cited and the present one. The article was not in existence when the agreement was passed; it was an article to be manufactured, and this was not a contract of which a Court of Equity would decree a specific performance, at all events, while the vessel was in an incomplete state and unfinished. There was no contract that could be enforced. In its inception it lacked mutuality. Clark was under no obligation to continue his advances. There was nothing in that agreement which could prevent Bishop from disposing of the vessel to a bona fide purchaser, for until vessel was complete appellant had only an inchoate right in an article to be manufactured. That is the distinction between this case and Holroyd v. Marshall, and others cited.\nThe right to insure cannot be only \"an expectation of possession on the part of the plaintiff, founded on a mere promise of Bishop,\" as held in the case of Stockdale v. Dunlop[15].\nA Court of Equity would even compel the party to give a mortgage for that part, but in this case respondent submits the Court could not compel Bishop to give a mortgage.\nA right to insure must be of such a nature as to constitute an interest which the law will recognize and enforce. In this case the appellant chose to trust Bishop, and he has only a mere moral title which will not sustain an insurance.\nThe learned counsel referred to Angell on Insurance, sec. 69; Seagrave v. Union Marine Insurance Co.[16]; Anderson v. Morice[17]; Folsom v. Merchants' Mut. Mar. Ins. Co.[18]. Mr. Thomson, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J., after referring to the evidence given above, proceeded as follows:\nThe defendants, by their first plea, claimed that the plaintiff had no insurable interest in the vessel, and it was, as the learned Chief Justice in the Court below says, upon this plea, upon which issue was joined, that the case turned. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff by consent for $3,318, with leave to move to enter a nonsuit, and with power to the Court to draw inferences of fact. The Court was of opinion that the evidence showed no insurable interest whatever in the plaintiff, and made a rule absolute for a non-suit.\nThere is no contradictory evidence in this case, nor is it disputed, that there was a verbal agreement and understanding between Bishop and Clark, that if Clark would make the necessary advances to Bishop to enable him to build this vessel, he, Clark, would be in a position to look to the vessel when completed as security for his pay\u2014in other words, that the advances were to be made on the security of the vessel, and that the advances were made on the faith of this agreement.\nIt is quite true, as suggested by the learned Chief Justice, that there was not any such agreement as would pass the property in this unfinished vessel, or any such transmutation of possession as would create a lien upon it in the legal technical sense of that word; but this by no means determines the question in controversy, nor does the fact put forward by the learned Chief Justice, assuming such to be the case, that \"there was no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to make any specific amount of advances,\" in my opinion affect the case.\nThe contract of insurance being a contract of indemnity, it is abundantly clear that the plaintiff must establish some interest in the subject-matter insured. The questions we have to determine are, what constitutes such an insurable interest? And did the verbal agreement and the advances made on the strength of it, confer on Clark an insurable interest in the vessel while in course of construction?\nAs to the first, it is easily answered, negatively, that an insurable interest is not confined to a strict legal right of property; and, affirmatively, that any interest which would be recognized by a Court of Law or Equity is an insurable interest, or, as Mr. Bunyon thus sums up the question[19], \"that any legal or equitable estate or right which may be prejudicially affected, or any responsibility which may be brought into operation by a fire will confer an insurable interest.\" There must therefore be a valid subsisting contract, susceptible of being enforced between the parties themselves, in order to constitute an insurable interest, or right of action against the insurer, not a mere expectancy or probable interest, however well founded. Was there, then, in this case such an existing contract between Clark and Bishop, in respect to this vessel in course of construction, as conferred on Clark an interest in it binding in law or equity, which a Court of Law or Equity would recognize and enforce, and which interest was prejudicially affected by the fire?\nThough, as put by the Chief Justice, there may have been no obligation on the plaintiff's part to make any specific amount of advances, and though a Court of Equity will not decree performance of a mere agreement to advance money, I take it to be a well established principle, that where money has been advanced on an agreement that it should be secured on or paid out of a certain fund, or out of the proceeds of property to be sold for that purpose, a Court of Equity would, as between the parties to such an agreement, prevent the borrowers or debtors from appropriating such property or fund to another purpose; therefore, as Clark actually made the advances, and so on his part fully performed his side of the agreement, a clear mutuality was established, and an agreement subsisted which Bishop was bound to perform; he received the benefit of the agreement and should not be permitted to repudiate the burthen; and that agreement, in my opinion, was a specific appropriation of the specific property to the discharge of these particular advances; an engagement (distinct from the legal estate or actual possession), to pay out of this particular property, sufficient to bind the property in equity and clothe it with an equity in favor of the plaintiff, and which gave to Clark a privilege or claim on such property, an equitable lien in the nature of an equitable assignment for the advances made, and by means of which the builder was enabled to proceed with its construction. Had the fire not occurred, and had the vessel been completed, as the agreement contemplated, and had Bishop attempted to divert the vessel to other purposes to the detriment of plaintiff's claim, I think a Court of Equity would, at plaintiff's instance, have interposed and compelled Bishop to act in good faith and carry out his side of the agreement, either by granting a formal mortgage on her in Clark's name, or by ordering a sale, or by placing her in Clark's hands to be sold, and the proceeds applied, as far as necessary, to the liquidation of Clark's advances; in other words, that a Court of Equity would recognize an equitable security on the property for the advances, and would enforce an appropriation of the property for their re-imbursement; for it would be the grossest fraud for one party to refuse to perform after performance by the other, and the ground of the doctrine of part performance is fraud.\nIn Fry on Specific Performance[20], it is said: The principle upon which Courts of Equity exercise their jurisdiction in decreeing specific performance of a parol argeement accompanied by part performance is the fraud and injustice which would result from allowing one party to refuse to perform his part after performance by the other upon the faith of the contract[21].\nThat this agreement, though by parol, and the advances made under it, created an equitable charge on this property and gave Clark an equitable interest therein, principle and numerous authorities clearly establish, and it is, in my opinion, equally clear that if such equitable interest existed it was an insurable interest.\nIn Rodick v. Gandell[22], Lord Truro says:\nI believe I have adverted to all the cases cited which can be considered as having any bearing upon the present case, and the extent of the principle to be deduced from them is, that an agreement between a debtor and creditor that the debt owing shall be paid out of a specific fund coming to the debtor, or an order given by a debtor to his creditor upon a person owing money or holding funds belonging to the giver of the order, directing such person to pay such funds to the creditor, will create a valid equitable charge upon such fund; in other words, will operate as an equitable assignment of the debts or fund to which the order refers.\nIn Gurnell v. Gardiner the head note is as follows[23]:\nParol authority by a debtor to a creditor to go and take certain goods and sell them and pay himself a particular debt out the proceeds.\nHeld, to amount to the creation of an equitable lien upon such goods, and as such to be valid as against a claim by the personal representative of the debtor after his death\nThe Vice-Chancellor says:\nIn this case everything was by parol; the words are clear; and that, coupled with the conduct of the intestate, amounts to the creation of a valid equitable lien. It seems to me to be impossible to resist the plaintiff's claim on the ground that this was not a valid equitable assignment in writing. I find no law which says that a valid equitable lien cannot be created by parol, and the conclusion, if these premises be just, is inevitable, that where all things are by parol, and associated together for the purpose of giving an authority, where all is one transaction, and the power and the purpose are coupled together by the same evidence, they operate to confer a valid right which this Court is bound to enforce.\nIn Malcolm v. Scott[24], the Vice Chancellor says:\nThe of case Burn v. Carvallio was relied on as an authority in the plaintiff's favor. In that case the creditors requested the debtor to order Rego, the holder of property of the debtor, immediately to hand over to the creditors' agent such property as Rego might have belonging to the debtor, equivalent in value to the amount of certain bills; in answer to which request the debtor promised that he would write to Rego and direct him to hand over to the creditors' agent property of the debtor to cover the amount of the bills which might not eventually be paid. Lord Cottenham describes this as the result of the state of facts before him, he says: \"The question, is whether such promise and agreement would not give a lien in equity?\" and he decides that the letters containing the requests and the promise amounted to an equitable assignment of the funds in the hands of Rego. That was a promise to pay out of a particular fund in answer to an application for payment out of that very fund. I do not conceive that Lord Cottenham meant to decide anything more in that case, than that, when you make out the agreement to give the lien the form of the transaction is not material.\nPreviously to this, the Vice-Chancellor said:\nI accede to the plaintiff's argument that where there is, as in this case there clearly is, a good consideration for the lien, it is immaterial what may be the form of the transaction. It is only necessary that the transaction should be evidence of an agreement for a lien; the real nature of the transaction, and not the mere form of it, must, I apprehend, be regarded: Bill v. Cureton[25], which case I followed in Hughes v. Stubbs[26].\nThe loss the parties in the present case sustained by the fire was this, that by reason of the destruction of the property, they were prevented from even \"perfecting\" their equitable title by lawfully clothing it with the possession of the property. This was, as was said by the Vice-Chancellor in Langton v. Horton[27]:\nThe first and the substantial question in this cause is, whether the future cargo of the Foxhound\u2014that which was the future cargo at the time of the assignment\u2014passed either at law or in equity, by the assignment, from Birnie to the plaintiffs. I lay out of view all question as to the operation of the instrument at law, and look at the case only as a question in equity.\nIs it true, then, that a subject to be acquired after the date of a contract cannot, in equity, be claimed by a purchaser for value under that contract? It is impossible to doubt, for some purposes at least that, by contract, an interest in a thing not in existence at the time of the contract may, in equity, become the property of a purchaser for value. The course to be taken by such purchaser to perfect his title I do not now advert to, but cases recognizing the general proposition are of common occurrence. A tenant, for example, contracts that particular things, which shall be on the property when the term of his occupation expires, shall be the property of the lessor at a certain price, or at a price to be determined in a certain manner. This, in fact, is a contract to sell property not then belonging to the vendor, and a Court of Equity will enforce such contracts, where they are founded on valuable consideration, and justice requires that the contract should be specifically performed. The same doctrine is applied in important cases of contracts relating to mines, where the lessee has agreed to leave engines and machinery not annexed to the freehold, which shall be on the property at the expiration of the lease, to be paid for at a valuation. The contract applies in terms to implements which shall be there at the time specified, and here neither construction nor decision has confined it to those articles which were on the property at the time the lease was granted. But it is not necessary that I should refer to such cases as these, for Lord Eldon, in the case of the ship Warre[28] and in Curtis v. Auber[29], has decided all that is necessary to dispose of the present argument. Admitting that those cases are not specifically and in terms like the principal case, they are not of the less authority for the present purpose; for they remove the difficulty which has been raised in argument, and decide that non-existing property may be the subject of valid assignment. I will suppose the case of the owner of a ship, which is going out in ballast, proposing to borrow of another party a sum of \u00a35,000 to pay the crew and furnish an outfit; and agreeing that, in consideration of the loan, the homeward cargo should be consigned to the party advancing the money. It cannot reasonably be denied, in the face of the authorities I have just referred to, that a Court of Equity, upon a contract so framed, would hold that the party advancing the money was, as against the owner, entitled to claim the homeward cargo. And if a party may contract for the consignment of a homeward cargo, I cannot see why he may not contract with the owner of a ship engaged in the South Sea fisheries, that the fruit of the voyage\u2014the whales taken or the oil obtained\u2014shall be his security for the amount of his advances; I cannot, without going in opposition to many authorities which have been cited, throw any doubt upon the point, that Birnie, the contracting party, would be bound by the assignment to the plaintiffs.\n* * * * * * * * *\nIn the course of the argument I suggested the case of the purchaser of an estate, who having paid his purchase-money, prevailed on the occupying tenant to give him possession, and I enquired whether equity, affecting the validity of the contract, would say that possession was unlawful, and would permit the vendor who had received the money to turn the purchaser out of possession. This question may be tried by that test, for though this is not in the form of a purchase, it is yet a transaction in respect of which a price was paid, for the price of the security was the money they advanced. It appears to me that whether McG. acted or not under the authority of B., the plaintiff had, on the 9th of January, perfected their equitable title by lawfully clothing it with the possession of the property.\nIn Ebsworth v. The Alliance Marine Insurance Co.[30] there was no difference of opinion as to the right of plaintiffs to recover their own actual advances, but two of the judges thought they were neither the legal owners of the cotton, nor in equity trustees as to the surplus for the consignors.\nBovill, C. J., says[31]:\nThe bill of exchange, being drawn by the shippers and accepted by the plaintiffs against the consignment, that consignment immediately became an equitable security to the plaintiffs for the amount of their acceptance; and they would have been entitled in equity to have the cotton appropriated for their re-imbursement: Exparte Barber[32]; Exparte Mackey[33]; and see also the recent case before the Lords Justices of Exparte Smart[34]; and Bank of Ireland v. Perry[35].\n* * * * * * * * *\nIn the judgment of Chambre, J., whose views were ultimately adopted by the House of Lords, he says[36]: \"I am not disposed to question the authorities in general; on the contrary, there appears to me to have been great propriety in establishing the contract of insurance, wherever the interest declared upon was, in the common understanding of mankind, a real interest in or arising out of the thing insured, or so connected with it as to depend on the safety of the thing insured and the risk insured against, without much regard to technical distinctions respecting property, still, however, excluding mere speculation or expectation and interests created no otherwise than by gaming[37].\"\nBrett, J., says:\u2014\nThe first point is, thus raised whether plaintiffs had any insurable interest. I think they had: because they had an existing contract with regard to the cotton by virtue of which they had an expectancy of benefit and advantage arising out of or depending on the safe arrival of the cotton[38].\nIn Hoare v. Dresser[39], The Lord Chancellor (Lord Chelmsford) says:\nIf this question had arisen at law, the case of Wait v. Baker[40] would have appeared to me a decisive authority that no property passed in these cargoes to Dresser, so as to enable him to maintain an action for them. But the question in equity is not whether the property in the cargoes actually passed to Dresser, so as to give him a legal right, but whether there was not a contract for timber, which, though general at first, was, by the subsequent transactions between the parties, rendered specific, so as to enable Dresser to assert an equitable title to it? I entertain no doubt that, although at the time of the acceptance of the bill of exchange for \u00a3500 no timber had been specifically appropriated as the cargoes to be sent to Dresser, yet that when the \"Verene\" and \"Christiana\" were laden with timber expressly for the purpose of satisfying the contracts which had been entered into on account of Norrbom for the supply of the exact quantities shipped for Bristol and for London, Dresser had an equitable title to the property in these cargoes which he could enforce against Norrbom. or against any other person claiming from Norrbom with no better title than he possessed.\nLord Cranworth[41] says:\nAt law there must be a positive appropriation to give a legal title: that was established in Wait v. Baker. So that, however unjustly a party may be acting who says I shall send you from abroad some timber by a particular ship, if in truth he sends it so as to make it the legal property of another, that legal property must prevail. The difference between law and equity I take to be this: that if there has been an engagement to appropriate a particular cargo, or an engagement to satisfy a contract out of a particular thing, such as to appropriate a part of a larger cargo, in either of those cases equity will interfere, in the one case, to decree what in truth is a specific performance, or something very like a specific performance, of the contract to appropriate a particular cargo; and, in the other, to give the puchaser a lien upon the larger cargo in order to enable him to satisfy himself of the smaller demand.\nIn the United States of America the same principles are enunciated.\nIn Hancox v. Fishing Insurance Co.[42], Story, J., says:\nIf in the present case the vessel had been successful in her outward voyage, and upon the homeward voyage had been lost with her catchings and other proceeds on board, it would be difficult to resist the claim of the plaintiff to a recovery for a total loss. He would have had a lien on the shares of the seamen in those proceeds, or some interest in the nature of a lien. It seems perfectly clear that a person having a lien, or an interest in the nature of a lien, on the property outward has an insurable interest, and it will make no difference in such a case that he might still have a right to pursue his debtor personally for the debt on account of which the lien attached. There are many authorities in the books to this effect.\nAnd citing, among others, Wolf v. Horncastle[43]. And Chancellor Kent, in speaking of Lucena v. Craufurd[44], says:\nThe decision was that commissions to become due to public agents and all reasonable expectations of profits were insurable interests. The interest need not be a property in the subject insured. It is sufficient if a loss of the subject would bring upon the insured a pecuniary loss or intercept a profit. Interest does not necessarily imply a right to or property in the subject insured. It may consist in having some relation to or concern in the subject of the insurance, and which relation or concern may be so affected by the peril as to produce damage. Where a person is so circumstanced he is interested in the safety of the thing, for he receives a benefit from its existence and a prejudice from its destruction, and that interest is, in the view of the English law, a lawful subject of insurance.\nIn this case nothing like misrepresentation or fraud is alleged by the assured. The nature of the property and the appellant's interests were in the most full and frank manner disclosed to the assurers, and with such knowledge the interest was by them recognized as insurable, the premium accepted and risk undertaken, and their action now in repudiating their liability after a loss, the fairness of which is not questioned, presents their conduct before the Court in anything but a favorable light, and it is a satisfaction to know that the law will not aid them in depriving the plaintiff of what is not only his legal but his just due.\nThis appeal must be allowed with costs, and the rule absolute to enter a non-suit discharged.\nSTRONG, J., delivered a written judgment, in favor of allowing the appeal, which the Reporter has been unable to obtain[45].\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.\nI entirely concur in the judgment delivered. The doctrine, that under the circumstances of this case an equitable lien existed, is so firmly established and unequivocally recognized by so many authorities that it cannot now be questioned.\nThe circumstances are such as we find in many of the cases reported, including those cited in the judgments just delivered.\nIt is equally well settled that a party has a right to insure property over which he has an equitable lien; and if a party goes to an insurance company, and offers to have such an interest insured and they take the risk, the contract is valid. The judgment of the Court below seems to have been founded altogether on a misapprehension of the law applicable to equitable liens. In the view taken on this point by the Court below I entirely disagree. Neither the actual or constructive possession of the property is necessary to be in the insurer, either at the time of issue of the policy or when the loss insured against takes place. It is sufficient if he have an equitable lien on the specific chattel property covered by the policy. The appellant had in this case such a lien on the vessel in question which then was covered by the policy, and I think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered in his favor with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe question arising in this case may be determined wholly upon the authority of Holroyd v. Marshall[46]. Lord Westbury there lays it down as an elementary principle long settled in Courts of Equity, that in equity it is not necessary for the alienation of property that there should be any formal deed of conveyance, that a contract for valuable consideration, by which it is agreed to make a present transfer of property, passes at once the beneficial interest, provided the contract be such as a Court of Equity will decree a specific performance of.\nNow, applying the principles here laid down to the present case, there can be no doubt, that immediately upon the first advance being made by the plaintiff under the contract with Bishop, the beneficial interest in the vessel then on the stocks was, in equity, transferred from Bishop to the plaintiff by way of security to the latter for his advances, and such interest increased in value from day to day as the vessel progressed, and became a security to the plaintiff for all his advances from time to time, as they were made. That interest was one which, relating as it did to a specific chattel, was such that a Court of Equity would have secured the benefit of it to the plaintiff by specific performance, or by injunction restraining Bishop from dealing with the vessel otherwise than in accordance with his contract with the plaintiff. This is a proposition which, at the present day, cannot admit of a doubt, and as an equitable interest is sufficient to create an insurable interest, the plaintiff at the time of the insurance being effected, and at the time of the loss, had an insurable interest in the subject of the insurance under the circumstances as established by the evidence. Between this case and Stockdale v. Dunlop[47], upon the anthority of which the Court below rest their judgment, there is no parallel; there the agreement was to sell oil to arrive. It was proved that the expression oil to arrive was a mercantile term, and that if the oil should not arrive by the vessel, the purchaser had no right to it; until arrival, in effect, the contract did not profess to transfer any interest to the purchaser, and as the vessel did not arrive with the oil, but was lost on the voyage, the intending purchaser had not, either at the time of the insurance being effected, or at the time of the loss, any beneficial interest in the property insured; he had only an expectation that the event, the happening of which was a condition precedent to the accrual of his interest in the property, would happen, namely, the arrival of the ship with the oil; until then there was, as Parke, B., says, no contract which could be enforced. Between that case and the present it is apparent that there is no parallel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant\u2014J. R. Armstrong.\nSolicitor for respondents\u2014C. W.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENSS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nContract, terms of delivery\u2014Reasonable time\u2014Damages Arts. 1061, 1073, 1544, C C. L. C.\nOn the 7th May, 1874, the appellant sold to the respondent five hundred tons of hay. The writing, which was signed by the appellant alone, is in following terms: Sold to G. A. C. five hundred tons of timothy hay of best quality, at the of $21 per ton f. o. b. propellers in canal, Montreal, at such times and in such quantities as the said G. A. C, shall order. The said hay to be perfectly sound and dry when delivered on board, and weight tested if required. The same to be paid for On delivery of each lot by order or draft on self, at Bank of Montreal, the same to be consigned to order of Dominion Bank, Toronto\",\nIn execution of this contract, the appellant delivered one hundred and forty-seven tons and thirty-three pounds of hay, after which the respondent refused to receive any more.\nThe appellant having several times notified the respondent, both, verbally and in writing, by formal protest on the 25th of July, 1874, requested him to take delivery of the remaining 354 tons of hay.\nOn the 11th of November following, the appellant brought an action of damages for breach of contract, by which he claimed $3,417.77, to wit, $2,471 difference between the actual value of the hay at the date of the protest and the contract price, and $943.77 for extra expenses which the appellant incurred, owing to the refusal of the respondent to fulfil his contract.\nHeld, That such a contract was to be executed within a reasonable time, and that, from the evidence of the usages of trade, the de livery, under the circumstances, was to be made before the new crop of hay, and that the respondent, being in default to receive the hay when required, was bound to pay the damages which the appellant had sustained, to wit, the difference at the place of delivery between the value when the acceptance was refused, and the contract and other necessary expenses, the amount of which, being a matter of evidence, is properly within the province of the court below to determine ([1])\nAPPEAL from the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Court of Review and maintaining the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAction of damages for breach of the following contract:.\n\"May 7th, 1874.\"\n\u201cSold to G. A. Chapman, five hundred tons of timothy hay of best quality, at the price of twenty-one dollars per ton, f. o. b. propellers in canal, Montreal, at such times and in such places as the said G. A. Chapman shall order. The said hay to be perfectly sound and dry when delivered on board, and weight tested if required. The same to be paid for on delivery of each lot, by order or draft on solf at Bank of Montreal and same to be consigned to order of dominion Bank, Toronto\n\"C. Larin.\"\nThe respondent alleged by his declaration, that on the 7th May, 1874, he sold to appellant 500 tons of timothy hay, at the rate of $21 per ton; which was to be delivered . o. b.(which he interprets to mean, \" taken from on board \") propellers in the Ldchine Canal at Mon-treat, at such time and in such quantity as the appellant should order, to be paid fur on delivery of each lot; the whole in accordance with the terms of a written agreement prepared by appellant and signed by respondent.\nThe respondent further alleged that at the date of that contract, hay was increasing in value; and that the hay in question was bought by appellant on speculation. That it was then and there understood and agreed between the parties, that the delivery of the hay would be ordered, and the hay paid for, within a reasonable delay, and before the new crops. And that by the terms of the agreement, the nature of the contract, the pourparlers which took place at the time of the said contract, and the custom of trade the execution of said contract on the part of both parties was to take place within a reasonable delay, and before the depreciate ion in the price of hay, which would necessarily take place after the new crops.\nThat accordingly the respondent, a few days after the date of the contract, delivered to appellant 146 tons of the said hay, for which appellant paid respondent according to the agreement.\nThat since the delivery of the said quantity, appellant had neglected and refused to order any more hay, or to receive the balance of the quantity mentioned in the agreement; although the respondent had, at different times, tendered the said hay to the appellant and always declared himself ready, and was ready to deliver it; and had in fact the said hay, at different times after the notification to appellant and more particularly in the months of July and August then last, ready to be delivered in the Lachine Canal, as agreed\nThat about the 30th July then last, the respondent notified and protested in writing appellant, that he had the balance of 354 tons of hay ready for delivery; that it had been stored ready for that purpose; that he was obliged to remove it for storage to other places, which would entail expense and trouble; and that he would hold appellant liable for all loss, damage and expenses which would be incurred with the hay on account of appellant not receiving the same. And he protested against keeping the hay any longer; of which so called protest he produces a copy.\nBut that appellant still neglected and refused to order and receive the remainder of the hay and to pay respondent the value of the hay at the contract price, viz., $7,266.\nThat since that period hay had only averaged from $12 to $14 per ton, and the respondent had had the balance of the hay resold at an average of $14 per ton. That he had to incur extra expense for the cartage, \u00a1storage, weighing and selling of the hay, and thereby had sustained damage to the extent of $3,414.77; that is, $94377 for expenses in labor, cartage, storage, weigh In and selling the hay, and $2,471, difference between the actual value at $14 a ton and the price at which it was sold.\nThat appellant had often notified respondent that h\u00e9 \"would not receive the balance of the hay.\nWherefore he prayed for a condemnation against the appellant for the above two sums, amounling together to $3,414.77.\nThe appellant pleaded the general issue, and thereupon the parties proceeded to evidence, which is reviewed in the judgments.\nThe Superior Court, Mr. Justice Rainville presiding, -, rendered judgment, maintaining the respondent's action to the extent of $2970.87 * being the difference between $14 per ton, and the price agreed upon; and $500, for expenses; but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Review, and the action was unanimously dismissed* with costs. Thereupon the respondent appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench: and the judgment of the Court of Review was reversed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rainville, sitting in the Superior Court, was confirmed in its material points.\nMR. KENNEDY for appellant :\u2014\nThe contract is within that class of cases where the consideration for the promise is contingent; that is, it consists in the doing of something by the promisor which he need not do unless he chooses. The appellant need not order unless he chose and until the order is given no binding contract was made Great Northern R.W Co. V. Within ([2]) ; Burton V. Great Northern R. W. Go. ([3]); Benjamin on Sales ([4]).\nThe respondent had the right before the appellant ordered to notify the appellant that unless he ordered within a reasonable time he would rescind the contract.\nThe contract must be construed so as to give the literal meaning to every sentence; and although the word sold is used in the beginning of the contract, its use is consistent with the fact of it being a conditional sale that is contingent on the appellant's order. To construe other would have the effect of eliminating the words, \"at such times and in such quantities as the said G. A. Chapman shall order, \" for a contract without these words would imply a delivery within a reasonable time '. Ellis v. Thompson ([5]) Leak on Contracts ([6])\nNo parole evidence can be given to alter or vary a writ ten contract; and importing into the contract in question that delivery is to be within a reasonable time is an alteration and variation as the contract states that the delivery shall be as the appellant \" shall order,\" thereby negative the implied time of delivery: Civil Code, article 1234 Leak on Contracts ([7]), Greenleaf on Evidence ([8]).\nWhen the contract itself is plain, no usage or custom can be proved to vary the terms of delivery. Here the contract is plain that the time of delivery should be at the option of the appellant; Taylor on Evidence ([9]), Greenleaf on Evidence ([10]); Le\u00edais v. Marshal ([11]), particularly the remarks of Tindal, C. J., at p. 745: Bowes v. Shand ([12]), and the remarks of Lord Hatherley, at p. 473: u If the contract bears a plain natural sense and meaning, nothing should make us deviate from that plain natural sense and meaning but the strongest evidence, not the opinion of this or that witness, but of a custom of the trade or business which forms the subject matter of the contract.\" And of Lord Gordon at p. 486: \" We must construe the contract itself according to its reasonable and literal sense; and again: '' the safest rule in all these cases is to allow the parties who were interested in making the contract to explain themselves.\"\nNo particular custom as to this trade was proved, the witnesses themselves not agreeing and the evidence being simply an opinion; and no evidence was given of any case where this custom was followed. As to evidence necessary to establish a custom, see Williams v. Ayers ([13]), Bowes v. Shand ([14]), Taylor on Evidence ([15]) Addison on Contracts ([16]).\nThe fact of the contract being in favour of the appellant, and pressing hard on the respondent, is no reason why its literal meaning should not govern. The Court cannot supervene to relieve a person from an improvident contract: Addison on Contracts, ([17]); Cheale v. Kennard ([18]).\nBy the evidence it appears that the appellant drew the contract as it is to avoid the probable want of storage that might occur, and that did occur. That it was owing to the respondent's acts that the appellants had not room to store the hay\u00bb for it appears first that the steamship York brought up 88 tons of damaged hay on the 21st May, 1874. After this appellant received on account of the contract, 147 tons of good hay, and on the 6th June, the respondent's agent brought to the appellant, and got him to store for him 191 tons on the open end of a wharf, by covering same with tarpaulins, requesting him at the same time to sell this 191 tons first, and this hay was not sold until October 1874.\nThe appellant therefore contends that if the evidence can be looked at to construe the contract, it shews that the intention of the parties was, that the hay should be received in such quantities as would enable the appellant to store it, and the respondent, by his own act, rendered it impossible to have the contract carried out according to the intention expressed when it was made.\nMR. DAVID for respondent :\nThe appellant contends, that the hay having to be delivered at such times and in such quantities as the said Or. A. Champan shall order, the execution of the contract was merely facultative on his part t so that, according to that pretention, it was in his power to hold continually and always the respondent bound by the contract without being so himself. The appellant at any day, at any time of the year, might order the respondent to deliver to him one ton or one hundred tons of hay and the respondent ought to be ready to deliver them. It might also please him to sleep upon his contract a year and the respondent should have remained under the obligation of keeping in a safe place, always ready to be delivered, the balance of the hay.\nThe contract was signed on the 7th day of May, eleven or twelve weeks before the crop of the new hay. At that time hay had gone up in Montreal to the extra ordinary price of $21 to $22 per ton; in Toronto it was selling at $31 and $40 person. The time was good for speculation. The appellant, who is a merchant, goes to Montreal, or names a representative there, and buys the hay in this case mentioned.\nIt is evident that both parties had the intention of executing the contract in a reasonable time \\ the respondent to get the price of sale, the appellant to realize a benefit the soonest possible, and with more certainty before the new hay.\nThe learned counsel referred to arts. 1013, 1014 and 1016, 1067, 1544, 1073, C. C. L C.\nMr. Kennedy in reply.\nRITCHIE, C J. :\u2014\nThe plaintiff complains in this case, that he sold to defendant 500 tons of hay under a contract, of which the following is a copy, signed by the plaintiff, (respondent) and affirmed and acted on by appellant, [His Lordship read the contract] That a few days after the date of that contract, plaintiff delivered to defendant 146 tons, for which defendant paid as per agreement; that since then defendant has neglected and refused to order any more, or to receive the balance of the 500 tons, although plaintiff' has offered and tendered to defendant, particularly on the 28th July, '74, the 354 tons; that defendant notified plaintiff that he would not receive the balance of the hay; that the hay having fallen in value plaintiff re-sold balance, and claims the difference in price and expenses.\nIf the contract had been to supply defendant with whatever hay he might from time to time order at so much per ton defendant would not be hound to give orders ([19]). But that is not this case. This was a contract for the sale of a specific quantity (500 tons) of hay, and though the delivery as to times and quantities was left to be fixed by the purchaser, this gave him no right to repudiate the contract in whole or in part, but he was bound to order delivery at reasonable times and in reasonable quantities, and if there was any well known usage of the trade in regard to the articles sold, in respect either to times for delivery or quantities to be delivered it would be a criterion by which the question of reasonable times or quantities might be decided; in other words, if not conclusive, cogent evidence of what would be reasonable times and quantities. If the vendee unreasonably withheld his orders, the vendor discharged his duty by a tender or offer of performance that is, of delivering at the place specified, at or after a reasonable time had elapsed, thereby giving the vendee an opportunity of accepting a complete performance. The buyer by this contract undertook to order the hay which he had purchased, and as no time was fixed at which he was to do this, the law implied he was to do it Within a reasonable time under the circumstances and the dictum of the court in Ford v. Cotesworth ([20]) bears directly on this case:\nWhenever a party to a contract undertakes to do some particular act, the performance of which depends entirely on himself, so that he J. may choose his own mode of fulfilling his undertaking, and the contract is silent as to time, the law implies a contract to do it within a reasonable time under the circumstances.\nLeake ([21]) says :\nWhere' there is no time fixed by the contract, the law in general implies that the performance must be at a reasonable time, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the performance ([22]).\nIn Ellis v. Thompson ([23]) Alderson, B., says that:\nThe correct mode of ascertaining what reasonable time is in such a case is by placing the Court and Jury in the same situation as the contracting parties themselves Were in at the time they made the contract; that is to say, by placing before the jury all those circum stances which were known to both parties at the time the contract was made and under which the contract took place. By so doing you enable the Court and Jury to form a safer conclusion as to what is the reasonable time which the law implies and within which the contract is to be performed.\nLeake on contracts ([24])\nUnder a written contract for the sale of goods appointing the time for payment, but silent as to the time for delivery j and, therefore, presumptively importing delivery within a reasonable time upon credit, evidence was held admissible of a usage in the trade, that the delivery should be made concurrently with the payment and could not be demanded before ([25]).\nAnd I can discover nothing in the law of the Province of Quebec at variance with these principles, which, after all, are only the principles of common law and common justice. In this case the evidence shows, I think, conclusively that a reasonable time for giving an order or orders had elapsed on the 28th of July, when the time was about arriving for the crop of new hay to come into the market and defendant having then refused to order or receive the balance of the 500 tons was in my opinion, guilty of a breach of his contract, and rendered himself label to pay to the plaintiff the difference between the then market value of the hay and the price agreed on. The measure of damage is the difference between the contract price and the market price or valup on the day fixed for the delivery, or in this case the day on which the hay was tendered to the vendee and should have been received by him that being the time when the contract was broken, thus leaving plaintiff in the same situation as if defendant had fulfilled his contract. The vendor is not bound to re-sell though he may, if he thinks proper so to do, and charge the vendee with the difference between the contract price and that realized at the sale, but it is requisite, in such a case, to show the property was sold for a fair price and within a reasonable time after the breach of the contract\nIn this case the plaintiff appears to have used all reasonable efforts to dispose of this hay to the best advantage, and we can easily understand the difficulties he must have experienced in the face of a falling market and the competition of the new hay crop; and I cannot say that the amount the court below has allowed him for expenses necessary and incident to the disposal of so large a quantity of an article so bulky is not justified by the evidence.\nSTRONG J. concurred.\nFOURNIER , J.:\u2014\nL'action de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait en dommages pour inex\u00e9cution de contrat et fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9crit cite duis haut\nApres avoir accept\u00e9 en ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat une certaine quantit\u00e9 de foin, l'appelant refusa d'en recevoir advantage, pr\u00e9tendant que par les termes de son con- trat il n'y a pas de temps fix\u00e9 pour la livraison, et de - plus quail avait la facult\u00e9 do n'en ordonner que ce qu'il lui plairait d'accepter. Cette pr\u00e9tention est formul\u00e9e en ces termes dans sa d\u00e9fense:\nAs to the first point, the Respondent contends that the contract, as contained in the memorandum already printed, was perfectly intelligible and clear in itself. No time was fixed by that contract, within which the Respondent was to be obliged to receive the hay. The memorandum states in express terms that the hay is to be delivered free on board propellers at Montreal, at such times and in such quantities as the said G. \u00c1. Chapman shall order.\nThere is not the slightest limitation of the discretion of the Respondent, as to when he shall order, and what he will receive; that is left entirely to him It is the Apelante who takes the risk of the orders being given at times and for quantities inconvenient to him. The Respondent had the right of making these times and quantities to suit his convenience, in entire disregard of the wishes of the Appellant. .\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a cconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 le contrat comme prouv\u00e9 et a condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur (appelant) \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intime une somme consistant dans la diff\u00e9rence du prix du foin, suivant le prix courant, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le defender i refuse de continuer l'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat avec l\u00e0 diff\u00e9rence du prix convenu par l'\u00e9crit ci-haut cite, plus une somme de $500, pour frais de transport, tonnage, pesage et vente du foin en question.\nCe jugement soumis \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant en r\u00e9vision, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cass\u00e9 pour deux raisons principales.\nLa premi\u00e8re quo l\u2019on trouve Enonc\u00e9e dans ce judgment, c'est quo dans le cas actuel, le demandeur (intime) avant de pouvoir revendre le foin qui faisait l'objet du contrat intervenu entre les parties aurait d notifier le d\u00e9fendeur (appelant)do son droit de demander la rescision du. Contrat. Cette proposition est Enonc\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re suivante '.\nPlaintiff does not even state in his declaration that he notified defendant of any claim of rescision of contract, before re-selling the hay referred to: and that in fact plaintiff did not notify defendant of any rescision of contract, or of any proposed re-sale of said hay.\nLa 2\u00eame. C'est que dans le cas particulier dont il s'agit, la loi ne permettait pas au demandeur de vendre le foin en question \u00e0 vente priv\u00e9e,\u2014mais qu'au con traire elle l'obilgeait a le faire vendre par encan public, dans une seule vente (at one time), apr\u00e8s avis an d\u00e9fendeur * la vente \u00e0 lencan \u00e9tant la seule mani\u00e8re l\u00e9grale de d\u00e9terminer le prix courant qui devait servir de base pour l'appr\u00e9ciation des dommages.\nCes deux propositions sont-elles fond\u00e9es en droit ? Le demandeur \u00e9tait-il bien oblige apr\u00e8s avoir mis le d\u00e9fendeur en demeure d'accepter le foin de demander la rescision du contrat avant de pouvoir r\u00e9clamer ses dommages ? Le contrat ne se trouvait-il pas plut\u00f4t nil de plein droit par suite du refus du d\u00e9fendeur d'en con tiquer l'ex\u00e9cution ?\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que la vente dont il s'agit est une vente au comptant, le prix convenu est stipul\u00e9 payable \u00e0 la livraison de chaque lot. Apres mise en demeure suffisante, (et celle prouv\u00e9e l'est certainement) le d\u00e9fend der \u00e9tait tenu d'enlever le foin qui lui \u00e9tait offert; sur son refus ou n\u00e9gligence de le faire et de payer le prix convenu la vente se trouvait r\u00e9solue de plein droit.\nDan la vente de choses mobili\u00e8res l'acheteur est tenu de les enlever au temps et au lieu ou. ils sont livrables. [Si le prix n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pav\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution de la vente a lieu de plein droit en faveur du vendeur, sans qu'il soit besoin d'une poursuite, \u00e2pres l'expiration du terme convenu pour l'enl\u00e8vement, et s'il n'y a pas de stipulation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, \u00e2pres que l'acheteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure en la mani\u00e8re port\u00e9e au titre des Obligations ; sans pr\u00e9judice au droit du vendeur de r\u00e9clamer les dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats ([26]).\nPour faire l'application de oct article an cas actuel il ne reste qu'\u00e0 savoir si la mise en demeure a ete suffisante et conforme \u00e0 l'art. 1067. Ind\u00e9pendamment des lettres et t\u00e9l\u00e9grammes concernant la livraison du foin, il y a le prot\u00eat formel en date du 28 juillet 1874 d\u00e9clarant que le demandeur est pr\u00eat \u00e0 livrer la quantit\u00e9 de foin n\u00e9cessaire pour parfaire le contrat, sommant le d\u00e9fendeur de l'accepter, avec de plus d\u00e9claration qu'il sera responsable do tous les dommages que son refus pourrait causer. Il est en preuve que le prot\u00eat est parvenu au d\u00e9fendeur. Le contrat en question \u00e9tant par \u00e9crit, ce prot\u00eat conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 10677 devait \u00eatre par \u00e9crit. Ainsi le demandeur a rempli les forma lit\u00e9s que la loi exigeait do lui pour mettre son adversaire en demeure. Le refus de celui-ci de se pr\u00e9senter pour accepter et payer le foin a eu l'effet, suivant l'article 1544, d'op\u00e9rer do plein droit la r\u00e9solution de la vente en question et do donner ouverture \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation pour dommages. Rien dans la loi n'obligeait le demandeur \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre son intention de faire r\u00e9silier une vente que la loi d\u00e9clarait r\u00e9solue de plein droit, sans formalit\u00e9 quelconque. Pour ces raisons le premier motif donn\u00e9 par la Cour de R\u00e9vision me parait tout-\u00e0-fait erron\u00e9.\nIl en est de m\u00eame du 2eme qui contient renonciation d'un principe que l'on no trouv\u00e9 nulle part. La loi n'a pas impose l'obligation de faire, dans un cas comme celui dont il s'agit une vente \u00e0 l'encan pour servir de base \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des dommages.

The decision of the Court of Review I consider founded on incorrect statement of law. It is properly stated to have been a commercial case, and as such, on refusal of the appellant he, if otherwise liable, is required by law to make good to the respondent such loss as may result from the non-acceptance of the hay- in question; and the rule by which such loss is measured is the difference at the place of delivery between its value when the acceptance was refused, and the contract price. That difference may be shown in a variety of ways. The most usual one is by means of a sale by public auction at the place of delivery, bit in the case of a perishable article, if not then in a place o safety, it might he removed for protection and a market to any convenient and reasonable distance. The sale was not by public auction, and it need not have been, but was conducted in a manner I think, more for the interests of the appellant. It is not even pretended that the most under the circumstances, was not realized for it, and for which the appellant has got the benefit. The difference in value sufficient to sustain the res pondent s case, at the canal, and where it was sold, has been satisfactorily shown. The respondent is entitled also to be reimbursed his outlay for the expenses of removal and sale, including storage and insurance for a reasonable time. There is no charge made for the latter, but for the other legitimate charges, for labour and cartage from the canal, storage, expenses of sale weighing and loss of Weight, the respondent is entitled to recover. He alleges his expenditure for those \"purposes amounted to $843.77 besides $120 for other carting* not explained. -The learned Judge who tried the cause allowed him $500 for those expenditures, which I think under the evidence, reasonable.\nThe appellant contends, however, that he was not bound to take the hay when offered and therefore not liable to damages for refusing it. The contract provides for the delivery \u201c at such times and in such quantities as the defendant (appellant) should require,\u201d but contains no provision between what dates the appellant shall exercise that right. The agreement is for a sale of five hundred tons of hay at the rate of twenty-one dollars per ton, and provides for the place and manner of delivery, to be paid for on delivery of each lot. The contention of the appelant is, that as no time was prescribed for the delivery of the whole, that he could ask for the delivery at any time or times, or that in fact it depended on his option to decline altogether any part of the number of tons sold. When the parties to a contract omit to limit their respective liabilities under it as to time, the law wisely provides that they shall end at the end of a reasonable time corresponding to the nature of the several liabilities. The law in such cases enjoins each party to perform his contract within a reasonable time. The appellant, therefore, had that reasonable time to provide the necessary means to accept, according to the con tract, the hay purchased. He was to provide propellers, on board of which at different times and various quantities, as he should order, he was to take delivery of the hay, and the respondent, getting reasonable notice, was bound to deliver the same at those different times and various quantities but with this proviso, that his requisitions to the respondent were made within a reasonable time. It would be indeed a strange law that under such a contract one party should be bound to have the hay on hand for months or years and should suffer natural deterioration and loss of weight, and perhaps after the expiration of a year be obliged possibly to supply wholly different hay, keep it on hand and then possibly be told the appellant was not even then ready to receive it, and if the law put no limit to the liability of the respondent, when would it end, unless his insolvency put him beyond the power of the appellant. But suppose the price of hay advanced greatly, and it became desirable for the appellant to obtain the delivery of the hay he must have made the necessary requisitions to the respondent for it, as the law puts it, within a reasonable time otherwise he could recover no damages for the non-delivery. Each must act within a reasonable time or no cause of action arises to him who is negligent because of his own laches. The true legal construction of the contract in question may be thus stated: The respondent bargains and sells to the appellant 500 tons of hay not immediately to be delivered, but the appellant virtually says to respondent: \" You keep possession of the hay until I, within a reasonable time, advertise to you my desire that at such times and in such quantities as I may engage propellors to take it on board, when you shall deliver it free on board for me.\" We would have to say, under the circumstances, what that reasonable time should be, if the appellant had raised such an issue, but I do not think he has. The respondent, in his declaration, alleges that, by legal construction, the agreement was to be performed within a reasonable time but the appellant does not, in his plea, take issue upon the question of reasonable time, or allege that at the time the respondent gave the notice of his readiness to deliver, which, however, under the contract he was not bound to do such reasonable time had not elapsed. His defence was not such, and therefore we need not have inquired into that question; and the mere readiness of the plaintiff to deliver and the question of damages, were all that regularly was in issue. If the respondent, in his declaration, had alleged generally his readiness to deliver within a reasonable time and the failure or refusal of the appellant to accept, it would have been sufficient, and if denied, it would then depend on the evidence; but the declaration states the time when the protest or notice of readiness to deliver was given\u2014on the 28th July, 1874. If necessary to decide the question of the reasonableness of the time I should say it was under the evidence sufficient; but, not with standing that notice, up to the time of the commencement of this suit, on the 11th November following, the appellant made no requisition for delivery, and surely no one would contend that, at the latter date reasonable time had not long before expired. The hay was sold on the 7th May and the delivery commenced, as by the bills of lading, on the 1st of June following; nine shipments in all, six in June and three in May up to the 29th when they stopped, and after which, no requisition for any more appears to have been made. From the nature of the article and from the correspondence and other evidence, the conclusion is irresistible, that both parties fully intended the whole delivery should take place before the new crop came in; and it is, I think, put beyond all doubt that the appellant clearly so understood it for in his letter of the 14th of May (seven days after the date of the contract) he says: \" I telegraphed you answer that I would write respecting your offer of three to four hundred tons of hay beyond the five hundred contracted for. But first before setting price I should wish to know the time of delivery of this second quantity, if purchased. If I bought, I should require to the end of June, to be shipped to my order, as I could make room for each cargo. It might not be till the end, but I should not wish to be crowded for the next two or three weeks to come till I get storage to receive it.\" The appellant, as that letter shows, contemplated taking the delivery of the additional 300 tons by or before the last of June, so that he fully understood and intended the 500 tons previously purchased to he delivered, at the latest before the 23rd of June. I think that by the law and evidence the respondent is entitled to recover the amount stated in the judgment, and that the appela should be dismissed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court of first instance confirmed.\nGWYNNE, J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Abbott, Tait, Wotherspoon & Abbott.\nSolicitors for respondent: Longpr\u00e9 & Dugas.\n[1] C.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1879: June 16; 1879: December 13.\nPresent: Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J.J.\nOF APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCorporation\u2014Shareholder in public company, actions against by creditors of Co.\u2014Registration of certificate\u2014Con. Stat. C., ch. 63; secs. 33, 35.\nIn an action brought by McK. under the provisions of Con. Stats. Can., ch. 63, against K. et al as stockholders of a joint stock company incorporated under said act, to recover the amount of an unpaid judgment they had obtained against the company, the defendants K. et al pleaded inter alia that they had paid up their full shares and thereafter and before suit had obtained and registered a certificate to that effect.\nHeld: affirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, that under sec. 33, 34 and 35, ch. 63[1], s soon as a shareholder has paid up his full shares and has registered, altho\u2019 not until after the 30 days mentioned in sec. 35, a certificate to that effect, his liability to pay any debts of the company then existing or thereafter contracted ceases, excepting always debts to employees, as specially mentioned in sec. 36.\n[Ritchie, C.J., and Fournier, J., dissenting.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2], affirming the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas[3], in favor of the respondents.\nThe action was originally brought in the Court of Common Pleas. The plaintiff, having obtained a judgment against the Strathroy Woollen Manufacturing Company, a joint stock company incorporated under Cons. Stats. C., ch. 63, for the sum of $12,744.21 and $66.75 costs, sought to recover that amount from the defendants under the provisions of said Cons, Stat. C., ch. 63, the defendants being shareholders in the said company.\nThe defence was, that the defendants had paid up in full their shares of the stock and had registered a certificate to that effect. It was not alleged that the certificates were registered within thirty days after the shares had been paid up.\nThe principal question which arose on this appeal was, whether a shareholder of a joint stock company incorporated under Cons. Stat. C., ch. 63, who had paid up his shares in full and registered a certificate to that effect, was freed from individual liability for the debts of the company, if the certificate was not registered within the thirty days mentioned in the 35th section?\nMr. C. Robinson, Q.C., and Mr. T. Robertson, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe defendants in this suit are and were stockholders in the said company at the time the debts set out in the declaration were contracted, and not having paid up their stock, or if having paid the same, not having registered a certificate of the payment, signed and sworn to as required by the 35th section of the Act, within thirty days after the payment of the last instalment, this action is brought to recover the amount of the said judgment against them under the provisions of the said Act.\nUnder the said Joint Stock Company\u2019s Act stockholders continue liable for all debts and contracts made by the company until the whole amount of the capital stock of the company, fixed and limited as by the said Act is provided, has been paid in; and to put an end to such liability, a certificate of such payment must, within thirty days after the payment, be made and drawn up; signed and sworn to by a majority of the trustees of the company, including the chairman or president, and registered, within the said thirty days, in the Registry Office of the district or county wherein the business of the company is carried on[4].\nIf the payment in full of his shares by any shareholder can exempt him from liability before the whole capital stock has been paid in, a certificate of such payment made, signed and sworn to as already mentioned, must be registered within thirty days after the payment[5].\nThe true construction of the said statute is, that such certificate must at all events be registered before the contracting by the company of the debt for which the shareholder is sought to be held liable; that, if registered within thirty days from the payment, such registration relates back to the time of such payment and exempts from liability from that time; but, if registered after the thirty days, it takes effect and forms an exemption only from the time of such registration. In this way, secs. 33 and 35 of the said statutes may be reconciled and given effect to; and this construction of the Act is in accordance with the opinion of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario in McKenzie v. Dewan et al.[6], in which the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas now appealed from, was followed pro forma, but dissented from.\nThe object of the statute in requiring registration was to give notice to those dealing with the company that the shareholders who had paid and registered their certificates were exempt, and thus to prevent credit being given on the faith of their liability, and this intention is defeated, and a door opened to fraud upon the creditors of the company, by exempting shareholders who have neglected to register their certificates of payment.\nIf a stockholder is desirous of putting an end to his liability, it is incumbent upon him to observe a strict compliance with the statute which enables him to limit his liability.\nActs of parliament which confer exemptions and privileges contrary to general common law rights, as a rule, should be strictly construed: Maxwell on statutes[7]; Kraemer v. Gless[8]; Mitchell v. Weir[9].\nMr. W.R. Meredith, Q.C., and Mr. Osler, Q.C., for respondents;\u2014\nBy the provisions of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, chapter 63, any stockholder in a company incorporated under that Act, notwithstanding that the whole capital stock of the company has not been paid in, may, within five years from the incorporation of the company, pay up in full his shares in the company, and upon a certificate of such payment being registered under the provisions of the said Act, he is by the effect of section 33 discharged from all liabilities of the company then existing or thereafter contracted.\nBy section 4 of the said act, upon compliance with the formalities mentioned in the three preceding sections, the person signing the declaration of incorporation and their successors are made a body corporate by the name mentioned therein.\nBy the provisions of the Interpretation Act, (Cons. Stats. of Can. ch. 5, sec. 6, sub-sec. 24), words making any number of persons a corporation or body politic and corporate exempt the individual members of the corporation from personal liability for its debts, obligations or acts. Sections 33 and 34 of chapter 63 are therefore not to be construed as modifying common law obligations in favor of the stockholders, but rather as imposing upon them in certain events certain additional obligations to those to which they were liable qua stockholders.\nSection 33 is to be read as if it were placed immediately after section 34; a reference to the acts consolidated and forming ch. 63 (13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, and 16 Vic., ch. 172) makes this clear, and any other interpretation would render the provisions of section 33 insensible. The original acts may be referred to in the construction of the Consolidated Statutes.\u2014Whelan v. The Queen[10].\nThe language used in sections 33 and 34 is as strong as possibly could be used to indicate the intention to discharge from existing liabilities. It is declared that the stockholders shall not be in any manner whatsoever liable for or charged with the payment of any debt or demand due by the company, and they point rather to a discharge from existing liabilities than an exemption from after contracted debts; probably because there was nothing in the act which imposed any personal obligation after either the stock was paid up in full and the certificate registered\u2014as to the whole body of stockholders\u2014or after payment of the shares of any stockholder and the registration of the certificate of such payment as to that particular stockholder. The language used in other sections of the act shows that, where it was intended to refer to any particular class of debts, plain and unmistakable languge was used. See sections 49, 50, 51 and 52.\nThe personal liability is, by the provisions of the act, to exist only until the shares are paid up and the certificate is registered, as prescribed in section 35, but the construction put upon section 34 by the Vice-Chancellors in the Court of Appeal, would require a meaning to be given to the word until which it does not properly bear, or the addition of another word, so that the section would in effect read unless and until.\nThe provisions as to the mode and time of registration are directory only. The effect of a different construction would be that in the case of a company, the whole of whose capital stock was paid in, the omission to register the certificate for one day beyond the thirty days would, under section 34, take away from the company for all time its character of a limited liability company, and render the company, in effect, an ordinary partnership. An opposite construction would make it necessary for every shareholder, at the peril of personal liability for all the debts, to ascertain when the last payment was made, and to see that the certificate was registered within thirty days thereafter.\nIt is said that to permit the certificate to be registered after the expiratin of thirty days, would be \u201cto turn the statute into an engine of fraud;\u201d but it is submitted that the opposite construction would afford greater facilities for fraud than that contended for by the respondents.\nAccording to respondents contention, a person proposing to deal with the company, though he searched in the Registry Office and found no certificate registered, would know that if the stock had been paid it would be open to the stockholder at any time to register his certificate and discharge himself from any liability to the company, and would then take the precaution\u2014not an unreasonable one in any case\u2014of searching the record which the company is bound by section 23, under the penalty of the forefeiture of its charter, to keep, and he would then know exactly how much of the capital remained unpaid and what, in addition the assets of the company, was available as uncalled for capital for payment of debts.\nIt is also submitted that the act affords no justification for giving any different effect to the registration of the certificate on existing and after contracted debts as was held in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in McKenzie v. Dewan[11]; Queen v. Ingall[12].\nSection 33 does not require a registration of the certificate within thirty days from the last payment of the shares, or within any stated period of time; the words \u201cmade and registered as prescribed\u201d relate to manner but not to the time of registration. Hampton v. Holman[13].\nThe true construction of the statute is, that the liability of the stockholders exists as to the body of them until the whole capital stock of the company is paid in and the certificate is registered, and as to a single stockholder until he pays up his shares and registers his certificate, and that upon this being done\u2014at whatever period it may be done\u2014the whole body of the stockholders in the one case are, and the particular stockholder in the other is, absolutely released and discharged from all liability to pay any debts of the company then existing or thereafter contracted, except those specially mentioned in section 36; that the duty imposed by section 35 is imposed, not upon the stockholders, but upon certain of the officers of the company, and that the omission by them to make and register the certificate within the time prescribed, while it renders them liable to make good any damage sustained by a person dealing with the company and damnified by the non-registration of the certificate, in no way interferes with the operation or effect of the certificate when registered. Queen v. Ingall[14].\nThis construction, while it preserves the leading feature of the act\u2014the creation of a company with a limited liability\u2014adequately protects persons dealing with the company from loss by reason of the omission to register the certificate.\nRITCHIE, C.J.:\u2014\nMr. Justice Patterson, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, says \u201cthe ground of appeal in this case reduces the question before us to much narrower limits than were occupied by the questions argued in the court below,\u201d and thus states the points in controversy in the court of appeal.\n\u201cThe questions presented to us are:\n\u201c1. Whether, by paying up his shares and registering a certificate within thirty days, the shareholder is freed from an individual liability for debts already contracted, or only for those contracted after the payment?\n\u201c2. If registration of the certificate frees from liability of existing debts, will that be so if the certificate is not registered until after the thirty days?\n\u201cThe Court of Common Pleas, in the decision now under review, has held that existing as well future debts are discharged by the registration of the certificate, even though not registered till after the thirty days. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench has followed that decision, but Mr. Justice Wilson, in delivering the judgment in court, intimated a different opinion as to the true construction of the statute[15].\u201d\nIn tracing the legislation on this subject we find the words in the 11th sec. of 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, are as follows: And be it enacted, that all the stockholders of any company that shall be incorporated under this act, shall be jointly and severally liable for all debts and contracts made by such company, until the whole amount of the capital stock of such company, fixed and limited in manner aforesaid, shall have been paid in and a certificate to that effect shall have been made and registered as prescribed in the next section of this act, after which no stockholder of such company shall be in any manner whatsoever liable for or charged with the payment of any debt or demand due by such company beyond the amount of his share or shares in the capital stock of such company so fixed and limited and paid in as aforesaid, save and except as hereinafter mentioned.\nThe words are \u201cshall have been made and registered as prescribed in the next section of this act.\u201d The directions as to making and registering in the next section are: as to the making \u201cthat within thirty days after the payment, &c., there shall be made and drawn up a certificate, &c.,\u201d which certificate shall be signed and sworn to, &c.;\u201d and as to the registering of the certificate, that it \u201cshall be registered within the said thirty days in the registry office,\u201d &c., and the registrar is authorized to administer the oath and enter and register the certificate in a book, &c.,\u201d \u201cafter which no shareholder shall be liable for or charged with the payment, &c.\u201d But what does \u201cafter which\u201d mean here? I think, unquestionably, after the certificate has been made and registered as prescribed or directed in the 12th section, that is, after all the directions given in the section have been followed. It seems to me that the time within which the certificate is to be made and registered is an element in the making and registering as much prescribed or directed in the next section as the drawing up, or signing, or swearing, or entering and registering. We have, I think, no right to eliminate from these directions the time within which the legislature has expressly enacted the certificate shall be made and registered. If the certificate can be made at any time and registered at any time, what force and effect is to be given to the words thirty days twice repeated in the section? I think we ought not to ignore the clear and explicit language of the legislature and reject a provision which it has thought expedient to enact, and which in its plain unambiguous phraseology involves no doubtful construction.\nThe 16 Vic., ch. 172, extended the exemption, and sec. 2 provided that, notwithstanding the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, it should be lawful for any shareholder, at any time from and after the said incorporation, and within the period of five years therefrom, to pay up his full shares, to the effect whereof a certificate should be made and registered in the manner provided by the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, and which as to such shareholder should have the same force and effect from the making thereof as the making and registering of the certificate of the payment of the whole amount of the capital from \u201cthe making and registering of the certificate.\u201d\nIt is to be observed here that the liability by the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, is to continue \u201cuntil\u201d the capital stock is paid in and the certificate shall have been made and registered, \u201cafter which\u201d no stockholder shall be liable; but by the 16 Vic., ch. 172 sec. 2, while the certificate is to be made and registered as by the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, is provided, when so made and registered it is to have force and effect from the making thereof.\nDoes not this give great force to the view that time was considered by the legislature of the essence of this matter, otherwise a stockholder might pay up his stock and not register for twelve months after, and so give to such registration a retroactive operation from the making of the certificate, for there is nothing whatever in this last act to show that the exemption is to take effect at any other time than the making of the certificate.\nThis being the state of the law at the time of the con- solidated statutes, by the consolidated statutes, ch. 63, sec. 33, a shareholder may within five years pay up his full shares \u201cand a certificate to that effect shall be made and registered as prescribed in the 35th sec., \u201cafter which\u201d such shareholder shall not be liable, &c. The 35th sec. is, as to the certificate and registering, a copy of the 12 sec. of the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28.\nThe 34th sec. is a copy of the 11th sec. of the 13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28, as to the liability of the stockholders until the whole amount of the capital stock is paid up and a certificate made and registered, &c., and this, it has been argued, is in conflict with and repugnant to the preceding 33rd section. But I think there is no substantial ground for any such contention.\nThis section (34) must be read as applying to those shareholders who have not availed themselves of the privileges granted under the preceding section 33, by paying up and obtaining a certificate to be made and registered as prescribed, &c. No doubt, the insertion of the clause as it stands, is very inartificial and presents at first sight an apparent contradiction, but the incongruity can properly be thus reconciled, which leaves the law as it was at the time of consolidation; and that it was the intention of the legislature that this should be the case, is evident from the 8th sec. of ch. 29 of the Cons. Stat., which enacts that the said consolidated laws shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation, and as declaratory of the laws as contained in the said acts and parts of acts so repealed, and for which the said consolidated statutes are substituted. The statute then expressly says that the stockholders shall be liable for all debts of the company until the whole amount of the capital stock has been paid in, and a certificate to that effect shall have been made and registered as prescribed, that is, I take it, as directed by section 12, reading the section mutatis mutandis, in other words, making the necessary changes and altering the terms to make the directions suit the circumstances; \u201cafter which no stockholder shall be liable,\u201d &c., that is to say, exemption from liability is granted to the stockholders, if they do a certain act, and if within thirty days after there shall be drawn up a certificate thereof, signed and attested in a certain way and registered within the said thirty days in a specified office. If these things are not done as prescribed, either in respect to the time, manner or place, how can a court be asked to say that doing similar acts, not within the time specified, or in another manner, or at a different place, shall have the same effect? The legislature had a perfect right arbitrarily to specify the terms and conditions on which such (exemptions from liability should take place, and to say, that until such terms and conditions have been complied with, the liability of the stockholders should continue, and I know of no principle by which this or any other court would be warranted in relieving the stockholders from lability on any terms other than those expressly sanctioned by the legislature, or to say that their liability should cease until what the legislature required to be done was done.\nWith reference to the consequences of such a construction we have nothing to do. The legislature has chosen in its wisdom to make the discharge of stockholders from liability dependent on a compliance with certain statutory directions, and has used words of a plain and definite character, and we are, I think, bound to give effect to all the words so used, by construing them in their ordinary grammatical signification according to their nature and import.\nMr. Dwarris[16], says: Wherever a statute imposes terms, and prescribes a thing to be done within a certain time, the lapse of even a day is fatal, even in a penal case, because no inferior court can admit of any terms, but such as directly and precisely satisfy the law[17].\nAnd in Regina v. Justices of Middlesex[18], where it was held an appeal was too late, as not being \u201cwithin six days after the cause of complaint,\u201d within the provisions of the 87th section of 4 Geo. 4, ch. 95, it was contended notice of appeal served on Monday was sufficient because the 6th day fell on a Sunday, and that the party had therefore the Monday on which to give his notice of appeal.\nWilliams, J., says:\nThe question which I have to determine arises upon the distinct language of the statute: and upon that language how can I say that this notice was given within six days? It was indeed conceded that it was not; but it was argued that Sunday ought not to be reckoned in the computation. No authority is cited in support of this argument, and in the absence of one, I think that the plain words of the act are not to be got rid of.\nSo in this case the defendant\u2019s right, to be relieved arises on the distinct language of the statute, and how can I say the certificate was made and drawn up within thirty days of the payment of the last instalment \u201cuntil which\u201d he was to continue liable, or registered within the said thirty days \u201cfrom which\u201d he was to be discharged. \u201cThe plain words of the act are not to be got rid of.\u201d\nThe liability of the stockholder is fixed by law, and the burthen is on him to get rid of that liability. If he seeks to do it through the instrumentality of this statute, he must, I think, bring himself within the terms of the statute, by shewing a full and complete compliance with its provisions; for it is that, and that alone, that relieves him from liability. If there is any defect which gives rise to a grievance, it was, as said by Lawrence, J., in Rex v. Justices of Staffordshire[19], \u201cin the statute itself,\u201d and in which case Lord Ellenborough, C.J., said:\nWhatever hardships the parties grieved may labour under in this case, we can only follow the directions of the statute, which has expressly limited the appeal to be made to \u201cthe next quarter sessions after such order made or proceeding had,\u201d &c. Now it is attempted to substitute the words \u201cafter notice of such order made,\u201d in lieu of the words in the statute \u201cafter such order made;\u201d but they are different things, and the legislature having made use of the latter words, we cannot say that the appeal may be made at the next quarter session after notice of the order. It is, however, a case of great grievance and hardship where the interests of the parties are thus invaded by an order made behind their backs; and may be a good ground to apply to parliament for a revision of the clause of appeal; but we cannot remedy the abuse.\nIt has been very strongly urged that a great hardship might arise, because the making out of the certificate and the signing and attesting is to be done, not by the stockholder, but by others who might neglect or refuse to act, though it is not alleged that any such difficulty existed in this case, nor indeed is any excuse alleged or suggested for not having procured and registered the certificate within the period provided. But with the question of hardship or no hardship we have nothing to do. If a party cannot bring himself within the statute, it may be his misfortune, or his fault, or it may be through the negligence or default of those who should draw up and attest the certificate and register the same; if they, or. any of them fail in their duty in this respect, he may or may not have a means of compelling them to do their duty; or whether the general rule, that a person damnified by the failure to perform a statutory duty, is entitled to maintain an action, applies in such a case as this; or whether a party aggrieved may or may not have a remedy against the officers of the company for any injury or damage he may sustain or be put to by reason of their misfeasance or nonfeasance, it is not necessary for us in this case to determine. Be this as it may, I do not think we are at liberty to say that in fixing thirty days after the payment as the period in which the certificate is to be made, and again expressly providing that the same shall be registered within the said thirty days, the legislature meant nothing, and did not intend that parties or courts should be bound thereby I think we are bound to assume they were inserted with an object, and whether the reason for their insertion is obvious or not, it is a plain provision which the legislature have deemed necessary for the protection of creditors and the public, and with which all we as a court of justice have to do, is to enforce the period fixed in the statute within which the certificate is to be made and registered, and is, to use the language of Lord Denman in the Queen v. Justices of Derbyshire[20], \u201ctoo distinct and express to admit of being varied by any gloss or construction.\u201d\nI express no opinion as to the liability of shareholders who have not registered within, but have after, the prescribed time, for new engagements incurred after such a registration, as that question does not arise in this case; all that I desire to say is that in my opinion, if registration be not made till after the thirty days, there is at any rate no exemption so as to discharge defendants from personal liabilty for debts contracted before such registration.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG, J., was opinion that the decision of the Court below was right and ought to be affirmed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLe Demandeur a obtenu, le 15 octobre 1873, devant la Cour de \u201cCommon Pleas\u201d d\u2019Ontario, jugement contre la Strathroy Woollen Manufacturing Company, incorpor\u00e9e en vertu du ch. 63, S.R.C., pour la somme de $12,744.21, montant de certains billets promissoires, et $66.75 ses frais.\nLe capital de cette compagnie \u00e9tait de $75,000, divis\u00e9 en sept cent cinquante parts ou actions de $100 chacune,\u2014payable en 20 mois apr\u00e8s le 1er octobre 1869, par versements de 10 p. c. tous les deux mois.\nAucun pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de deniers n\u2019ayant pu \u00eatre fait au moyen de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e9man\u00e9e en vertu du jugement ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, le demandeur a intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action contre les d\u00e9fendeurs (intim\u00e9s,) comme actionnaires dans cette compagnie pour se faire payer par eux du jugement obtenu contre la dite compagnie, all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il avait commenc\u00e9 son action et obtenu jugement contre elle dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la dette\u2014que les d\u00e9fendeurs et chacun d\u2019eux en \u00e9taient actionnaires avant que la dite dette e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e; que tout le capital n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9; qu\u2019aucun certificat \u00e0 cet effet n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et asserment\u00e9 par une majorit\u00e9 des directeurs\u2014et n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d\u2019enregistrement du comt\u00e9 o\u00f9 la compagnie faisait ses affaires. Que les d\u00e9fendeurs, (intim\u00e9s) n\u2019avaient pas pay\u00e9 le montant entier de leurs parts ni enregistr\u00e9 aucun certificat \u00e0 cet effet, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence le demandeur avait droit de r\u00e9clamer contre eux le montant du jugement obtenu contre la dite compagnie.\nLes d\u00e9fendeurs ont plaid\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande que chacun d\u2019eux avait pay\u00e9 le montant de ses actions et avait, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la sec. 35 du statut cit\u00e9 plus haut, enregistr\u00e9 un certificat de ce paiement. Quelquesuns de ces certificats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s dans le mois d\u2019octobre 1873, avant le commencement de la pr\u00e9sente action; d\u2019autres l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le mois de mars 1874, apr\u00e8s la poursuite commenc\u00e9e; mais les d\u00e9fendeurs n\u2019ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans leur d\u00e9fense que les enregistrements ont eu lieu dans les trente jours apr\u00e8s le paiement du dernier versement de leurs parts. Il para\u00eet par la d\u00e9claration du demandeur que la dette en question \u00e9tait due et exigible avant que les deux enregistrements aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits.\nLa d\u00e9fense est fond\u00e9e sur les sections 33 et 35 du ch. 63 S.R.C. qui, avec la 34e sont les seules qui puissent affecter la solution de la question soulev\u00e9e en cette cause. [L\u2019Honorable Juge fait lecture des sus-dites sections][21].\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si pour obtenir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la section 33, l\u2019actionnaire qui a pay\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement ses parts doit enregistrer un certificat dans les 30 jours du paiement du dernier versement tel que requis par la 35e sec. ci-dessus cit\u00e9e.\nEn r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la sec. 11 de la 13e et 14e Vict., ch. 28, ont voit qu\u2019il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les actionnaires sont responsables conjointement et solidairement de toutes dettes et contrats de la compagnie, jusqu\u2019au paiement entier du capital souscrit et \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement d\u2019un certificat \u00e0 cet effet tel qu\u2019exig\u00e9 par la sec. 12 du m\u00eame acte. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019accomplissement de cette formalit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9s de toute responsabilit\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 du montant de leurs parts.\nPar la section 12, un certificat dans la forme qu\u2019elle prescrit devait \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 dans les 30 jours apr\u00e8s le paiement du dernier versement du capital. En vertu de cet acte un actionnaire qui avait pay\u00e9 toutes ses parts ne pouvait encore \u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 deux conditions: la 1\u00e8re, que tous les autres actionnaires e\u00fbssent aussi compl\u00e8tement pay\u00e9 le montant de leurs parts; la 2me, qu\u2019un certificat de ce paiement f\u00fbt enregistr\u00e9, en la mani\u00e8re voulue, dans les 30 jours \u00e0 compter du paiement du dernier versement.\nCette derni\u00e8re condition qui rendait un actionnaire garant de la solvabilit\u00e9 de tous les autres ayant sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e trop on\u00e9reuse, et comme telle, nuisible \u00e0 la formation de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e, fut modifi\u00e9e par la 16e Vict., ch. 172, qui donna \u00e0 un actionnaire plus de facilit\u00e9 pour limiter sa responsabilit\u00e9 au montant par lui souscrit. La 2me sec. de cet acte d\u00e9clare:\nProvided always and be it enacted, that notwithstanding anything in the said first cited Act contained, it shall be lawful for any shareholder, at any time from or after the said incorporation, and within the period of five years therefrom to pay up in full his shares in the Company to the effect whereof a certificate shall be made and registered in the manner prescribed by the first cited Act (13 and 14 Vic., ch. 28), and which as to such shareholder and his liability, in virtue of the said Act, shall have the same force and effect from the making thereof, as the making and registering of the certificate of the payment of the whole amount of the capital stock of such company.\nL\u2019effet de cette section est de donner \u00e0 un seul actionnaire le droit de se lib\u00e9rer de toute responsabilit\u00e9 sans attendre l\u2019\u00e9poque du paiement du dernier versement compl\u00e9tant le paiement du capital entier. Ce privilege lui est accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la condition de se conformer, quant au certificat du paiement et \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement, aux formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par la sec. 12 de la 13e et 14e Vict., ch. 28.\nSous l\u2019op\u00e9ration de ces deux actes le mode de lib\u00e9ration par paiement et enregistrement qui ne pouvait, avant la 16e Vict., \u00eatre imploy\u00e9 que par la compagnie au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de tous les actionnaires, est rendu par ce dernier acte accessible \u00e0 un seul actionnaire en remplissant les formalit\u00e9s prescrites par le premier acte. Leur accomplissement dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas limite la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 compter de l\u2019enregistrement fait dans les 30 jours du paiement. A ne consid\u00e9rer que ces deux statuts, cette question n\u2019est gu\u00e8re susceptible de difficult\u00e9. Malheureusement dans leur consolidation il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quelques changements dans l\u2019ordre des sections et dans leur r\u00e9daction, dont l\u2019effet est de donner lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente difficult\u00e9. C\u2019est ainsi que la sec. 34 correspondant \u00e0 la 11e sec. du ch. 28, 13 et 14 Vict., concernant les formalit\u00e9s \u00e0 remplir pour faire obtenir \u00e0 tous les actionnaires le privil\u00e9ge de la responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e, vient apr\u00e8s la 33e reproduisant les dispositions de la 2e sec. de la 16e Vict., ch. 177, qui a pour la premi\u00e8re fois conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un seul actionnaire le privil\u00e9ge de limiter sa responsabilit\u00e9. Au point de vue de la logique comme dans l\u2019ordre chronologique, il est \u00e9vident que cette transposition est une erreur. On aurait d\u00fb conserver l\u2019ordre suivi dans les deux statuts originaires et ne faire venir la 33e sec. qu\u2019apr\u00e8s les 34e et 35e. Si au moins dans cet ordre (que je crois fautif) on e\u00fbt conserv\u00e9 dans la sec. 33e les expressions de la 2e sec. du ch. 172 d\u00e9clarant que \u201cle certificat obtenu par un seul actionnaire aurait la m\u00eame force et effet que la confection et I\u2019enregistrement du certificat du paiement du montant entier du capital de telle compagnie,\u201d\u2014mais au contraire la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la 35e, omet ces expressions qui, dans la 16e Vict., qualifiait la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence faite \u00e0 la sec. 12 de la 13e et 14e Vict., de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne laisser aucun doute sur la forme du certificat que devait faire enregistrer un actionnaire.\nMaintenant, dans le ch. 63, les secs. 33 et 34 r\u00e9f\u00e8rent purement et simplement, pour les formalit\u00e9s \u00e0 suivre, \u00e0 la 35e sec. qui est la 12e du ch. 28 de 13 et 14 Vict., \u00e9tablissant les formalit\u00e9s en question. On a \u00e9videmment oubli\u00e9 que cette section a \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement faite pour le cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait seulement de limiter la responsabilit\u00e9 de tous les actionnaires, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y \u00e9tait question que du certificat constatant le paiement du dernier versement du capital entier. Cette section ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9e telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans le premier acte, on pr\u00e9tend maintenant que la cons\u00e9quence qui en r\u00e9sulte est qu\u2019un actionnaire qui veut limiter sa responsabilit\u00e9 ne peut le faire qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019un certificat constatant le paiement du capital entire.\nIl est \u00e9vident que si l\u2019on exige de l\u2019actionnaire un semblable certificat, il se trouvera par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, n\u00e9cessairement priv\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la 33e sec, de se lib\u00e9rer seul sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019action des autres actionnaires. Cette interpr\u00e9tation a l\u2019effet de rendre cette section tout-\u00e0-fait inex\u00e9cutable.\nAvant d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 une telle conclusion je me demande s\u2019il y a vraiment incompatibilit\u00e9 et contradiction entre les sec. 33 et 35 et en quoi elle consiste, et s\u2019il n\u2019est pas possible de leur donner effet sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019y ajouter ou retrancher quelque chose.\nPour rendre le sens de ces deux sections tr\u00e8s clair et \u00e9viter toute difficult\u00e9, il e\u00fbt sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux d\u2019ajouter dans la 35e sec. quelques expressions ayant rapport au cas d\u2019un seul actionnaire qui veut se lib\u00e9rer. C\u2019est sans doute une omission mais elle est peu importante. Elle peut se suppl\u00e9er sans rien ajouter \u00e0 la disposition. En consultant l\u2019esprit de la loi, et en lisant ces deux sections, ainsi que l\u2019on doit le faire, comme n\u2019en faisant qu\u2019une seule, il est clair que l\u2019enregistrement dans les 30 jours du dernier versement du capital entier, doit dans le cas de la sec. 33, signifier le montant entier d\u00fb par l\u2019actionnaire. Autrement cette r\u00e9f\u00e9rence n\u2019aurait aucun sens.\nA quelles conditions d\u2019apr\u00e8s cette section l\u2019actionnaire peut-il obtenir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e? A deux seulement, 1o le paiement du montant entier de ses parts dans les cinq ans \u00e0 dater de l\u2019incorporation; 2o l\u2019enregistrement d\u2019un certificat \u00e0 cet effet, fait et enregistr\u00e9 tel que prescrit par la 35e sec. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re sec. n\u2019est que pour la forme du certificat et les formalit\u00e9s d\u00e9 l\u2019enregistrement et non pour imposer d\u2019autres conditions. Cette sec. 35, contient deux choses bien distinctes, la premi\u00e8re est la condition \u00e0 laquelle tous les actionnaires doivent se soumettre pour arriver \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e, savoir: celle du paiement du capital entier; la deuxi\u00e8me est la formalit\u00e9 du certificat constatant ce paiement et son enregistrement. La condition de paiement \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire par la 33e sec, la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la 35e sec. n\u2019avait donc pas pour but de lui en imposer une autre, (celle du paiement par tous les actionnaires) qui eut \u00e9t\u00e9 en contradiction manifeste avec la disposition de la sec. 33. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la sec. 35 ne venant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019imposition de la condition de paiement, il me para\u00eet clair qu\u2019il n\u2019y a que la partie de la 35e sec. concernant le certificat et son enregistrement qui doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme incorpor\u00e9e dans la sec. 33 et \u00eatre lue comme en faisant partie. De cette mani\u00e8re, toute contradiction dispara\u00eet et les deux sections ainsi concili\u00e9es peuvent recevoir une ex\u00e9cution compl\u00e8te.\nIl suit de l\u00e0, suivant moi, que pour un seul actionnaire comme pour la compagnie l\u2019obligation d\u2019enregistrer est imp\u00e9rative et doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e dans la forme et dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit par la sec. 35. Le but du l\u00e9gislateur en exigeant cet enregistrement \u00e9tait sans doute de donner \u00e0 ceux qui contractaient avec une compagnie incorpor\u00e9e le moyen de s\u2019assurer de sa solvabilit\u00e9 par les renseignements que l\u2019enregistrement pouvait fournir, et se comporter en cons\u00e9quence dans ses rapports d\u2019affaires avec la compagnie.

The plaintiff, after setting out the judgment in the declaration, avers that before the debts were contracted, not when the suit was commenced, the defendants were stockholders of the said company\u2014that the whole amount of the capital stock had not been paid in, nor had a certificate to that effect been signed, sworn to, or registered as required\u2014nor had the defendants paid up the full amount of their shares, nor made nor registered a certificate to that effect, as prescribed by the act referred to in the declaration. Some of the defendants, that is to say, Alfred H. Kitridge, J.S. Smith, John W. Robson, Arthur Robson and Thomas Moyle, pleaded in substance, that at the respective times when the debts were contracted, or any of them, or at any time afterwards up to the commencement of the suit they were not stockholders in the company, and the defendants Alfred H. Kitridge, John W. Robson, Arthur Robson and Thomas Moyle, pleaded in substance, that within the period of five years from the incorporation of the said company they paid up their full shares in the said company, and that thereafter, and before the commencement of this suit, to wit on the first day of October, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, a certificate to that effect was made and drawn up, signed and sworn to, and on the same day duly registered in manner prescribed by the statute in that behalf.\nThe plea of the other defendants is substantially the same as the last one in every respect, except that it alleges that the full payment of the several shares and the making and filing of the certificate took place after the commencement of the suit. To these pleas there were replications which were demurred to. The declaration was also demurred to. Notices were also given that objections would on the argument of the demurrers be made to the pleas as being bad in substance. The demurrers were argued and the Court of Common Pleas gave judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer to the declaration, and for the defendants on the demurrers to the pleas and replications.\nThe plaintiff subsequently obtained an order on this judgment, by which he was allowed to strike out the second and subsequent counts of the declaration, and all the issues of fact joined in the cause, in order that final judgment might be entered herein on the issues in law, so as to enable the plaintiff to appeal against the judgment without trying the issues in fact, with leave to the plaintiff to sign judgment on the demurrers for the defendants on the issues of fact being struck out; and notice of intention to enter such judgment to be given to the defendants attornies. Such notice was given and the judgment formally entered.\nFrom the judgment in demurrer to the pleas the plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeal being equally divided the former judgment prevailed, and it has come to this Court.\nThe plaintiff says there is error in the record and proceedings which the defendants deny.\nThe question for our decision is therefore wholly as to the sufficiency of the pleas.\nThe validity of the first plea does not seem to have been specially considered or adjudicated on by the Court of Appeal, but was by the Court of Common Pleas, and held good. We, therefore, in the interests of those pleading it have a right to consider it. In the peculiar position of the case, from the withdrawal of the issues in fact and the judgment for the defendants thereon, we must look at the question presented just as if no replications had been put in. If any one of the pleas is a good answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim the general result must be in favor of the defendants pleading it, notwithstanding the other issues in law should be found against them.\nKeeping in view the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depends on the allegations set out in his declaration, that the defendants, before the debts were contracted, and before and at the commencement of the suit, were stockholders in the company, let us see if the plea sufficiently raises in reference thereto an important and material issue. The defendants, who pleaded it, therein say that they were not, at the respective times when the debts were contracted, or at any time from thence until or at the commencement of the suit, stockholders in the said company. This, to my mind, is a complete answer, though in general terms, to the plaintiff\u2019s most important allegation, and upon which his right to recover was based. The demurrer admits the truth of the plea, and if the parties were not stockholders in the company when the debts were contracted, and did not become such up to the commencement of the action, and if the declaration shows nothing else (as is the fact) to make them liable, they cannot be adjudged so. If at any time before the debts were contracted, the defendants in question had been stockholders in the company, and had illegally or irregularly transferred their shares, that might have been shown on the trial of the issues in fact raised by the declaration and pleas; or if the facts had been specially alleged in the declaration, then the plea would possibly be wanting in substance if it failed to negative the allegation of them. No such issue is however tendered, or any other but those which I have already concluded to have been sufficiently answered by the plea. There is nothing in the whole record, after the general denial that they were at any time stockholders, to found a decision in favor of the general allegation that they were so. It is, therefore, a good answer to the declaration, and consequently a good defence for those who filed it. Our judgment, therefore, as far as those defendants are concerned should be for them.\nThe objection to the plea is, not that it leaves any allegation unanswered, but that it tenders an immaterial issue, to wit, \u201cwhether the defendants in question were stockholders in the company at the time of the commencement of this suit.\u201d In taking that objection the substance of the plea is misstated. If it alleged nothing more than that, the objection would be good. It, however, also negatives all the material allegations in the declaration upon which the plaintiffs right to recover is based, including the one that the defendants were stockholders before and at the several times when the debts were contracted; thus, as I think, taking away the foundation upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claim wholly rests. I think, therefore, that, independently of any other issue before us, the appeal, as to those five defendants, should be dismissed.\nThe objections to the second and other pleas are 1st. That they do not show that the stock was paid up within the time mentioned in the declaration of incorporation. On the argument of a demurrer to the pleas, we can only look at them and the declaration. Neither, in this case, refers to the declaration of incorporation, or sets it out, and we cannot say whether or not the stock was paid up according to it. That objection cannot therefore be sustained. 2nd. That it does not show that the certificate was filed within the time prescribed by law, which substantially means within thirty days as prescribed by section 35 of the act in question.\nThat objection necessitates two considerations: 1st. Admitting that that section requires a stockholder who has paid up his full shares to register his certificate within thirty days, is the plea in that case a good one? Does it in fact sufficiently allege that fact? It states in substance that the full amount of the several shares was paid up, within the prescribed five years, and the certificate duly made and sworn to before the commencement of the suit, to wit, on the first day of October, 1873, and on that day duly registered \u201cin manner prescribed by the statute in that behalf.\u201d Section 33 of the act in question is the \u201cstatute\u201d referred to in connection with section 35, and provides that the certificate shall be made and registered as prescribed in section 35.\nSection 35 provides that within thirty days after the payment of the last instalment of the capital stock of the company the certificate shall be made, drawn, sworn to and registered. The plea shows specially that the certificates in question were drawn up, signed and sworn to as section 35 prescribes, and generally that it was duly registered in the proper office in manner prescribed by the statute in that behalf. Is it, therefore, sufficient to allege such registry in that general way without the allegation that it was so registered within the thirty days? I think that on the trial of the issue raised on that point, the plaintiff might properly insist that the defence was not made out, if evidence showed the registry after the expiration of the thirty days. The plea referred to a public statute in general terms, but pointing explicitly to the requirements of section 35, not only as to the place but the manner of registry. Section 33 requires it to be registered \u201cas prescribed in section 35.\u201d That section (33) imposed the obligation in those words, and the affirmative allegation of the plea is identical with that section. In substance it alleges performance of the requirements of that section. Certainty as to a common intent is all that is necessary. No misapprehension could result as to the meaning of the allegation. In Beaver v. The Mayor, &c., of Manchester[23], the declaration complained of injuries to real estate to which there was a plea:\nThat the several acts, matters and things complained of were lawfully done by defendants under and by virtue of powers given to them by a certain Act of Parliament (setting out the year and title) Held that this general form of plea was good, and that it was not necessary to allege the particular acts upon which the defendants relied as bringing them within the statute.\nOn the authority of that case and the prevailing rules of pleading, I think the general allegation of compliance with the provisions of the statute sufficient, and that under an issue thereby tendered all necessary proof could have been required. It was, I think, just as necessary under that plea to prove the fact of registry within the prescribed thirty days, as if the fact of such registry had been specifically alleged.\nI might rest my judgment here, but as views of a contrary nature have been taken as to the obligation of a stockholder to allege specially that the certificate was filed within the prescribed thirty days I will proceed to give my views briefly on that point.\nIt will be observed that in reference to the sufficiency of the allegation in the plea, I have assumed that the defence required such a statement and proof of it. Had, however, the plea, in my opinion, not fully covered the ground, I should have had to consider, as I now intend to do, what the obligation upon a stockholder was under the terms of section 33, so as to arrive at the point where he would be free from the debts or liabilities of the company. On a comparison of the three statutes (for by the provision of the Consolidated Statutes and by long established custom of the courts, we are to look at the two preceding ones,) I can come to but one conclusion, and that is the only one that by any possibility will not render useless the legislation by the Act of 16 Vic., ch. 172, and re-enacted by the 33rd section of the Consolidated Act. No doubt was, or successfully could be, raised, that if the certificate were made and registered according to the 23rd section, and as prescribed in section 35 (whatever the latter may be,) it would bar all debts either present or future; for the provision on that point is quite clear.\nI think the true construction of all the Acts shows two ways by which stockholders would be clear of all liability. The one under the provisions of sections 34 and 35, and the other under sections 33 and 35. Whenever the language admits of two constructions, according to one of which the enactment would be unjust, absurd, or mischievous, and according to the other it would be reasonable and wholesome, it is obvious that the latter must be adopted as that which the legislature intended[24]. It is said that as the provision for the limiting of liability is a boon to stockholders and relieves them from personal liability, we should construe strictly against them any enactment as to the conditions required for exemption; such limitation being a relief to them from the common law obligations, that would otherwise press upon them as co-partners or joint and several contractors. I must confess I do not see much in that argument. The legislature for the benefit and advancement of public interests, by a general incorporation Act, holds out certain inducements to parties to engage jointly in business transactions and undertakings; one of the greatest of which is immunity from the consequences of a failing partner- ship business; and the limit of the liability is that which attaches according to the amount of stock subscribed for or purchased. The statutes on this point should be construed differently from a special charter granted on the petition of the parties, where they may be said to use their own language in asking exceptional powers or privileges, and when doubt arises as to the construction of that language, the maxim ordinarily applicable to the interpretation of statutes, that verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem, or that words are to be understood most strongly against him who uses them, is justly applied[25]. No common law liabilities are, therefore, in my opinion, incurred or intended to be by any one becoming a stockholder. No credit is given to the stockholders individually, but to the company. They, in no sense of the word, are debtors, but merely guarantors in a special way. They are only such guarantors or sureties to the extent from time to time of their unpaid stock. Angel & Ames in their treatise on corporations say[26]:\nThat one of the properties of a private aggregate corporation is the irresponsibility of its members for company debts, and that they are not liable beyond the amount invested in their subscription of stock.\nThat is the general principle. It has been well said, that the object of granting such charters is to shield its members from such personal responsibility; and it was, and is, deemed a matter of public policy so to grant them, to induce individuals to invest a portion of their means for the purposes of trade and public improvement who would abstain from so doing were not their liability thus limited. In joining one of those registered companies, then, no one assumes any common law obligations; and therefore I feel bound to construe the statutes in respect of them without that strict- ness which is right enough in cases of a different character and nature. Parties dealing with joint stock limited liability companies, while expecting profits therefrom, must take all the incident risks; they are presumed to judge of the solvency of their immediate debtors and the nature of the liability of their guarantors or sureties; and I know of no principle that calls upon me to put other than a reasonable and fair construction on the statutes through which parties seek to make shareholders pay for over again stock which they have paid for once, and the amount of which in many cases they have wholly lost. I feel bound, for these reasons, to construe the acts so as fairly and reasonably to give effect to the general intentions of the legislature.\nBy the Act 1G Vic., ch. 172, which amends the Act 13th and 14th Vic., ch. 28, five years are given for the payment in of the whole stock instead of two; and it provides that, notwithstanding anything in the last mentioned Act contained, it should be lawful for any shareholder, within five years, to pay up his full shares \u201cto the effect whereof a certificate shall be made and registered in the manner provided by the said first cited Act, and which, to said shareholder and his liability in virtue of the said Act, shall have the same force and effect from the making thereof as the making and registering of the certificate of the payment of the whole amount of the capital of such company.\u201d In that case the certificate operates, not from the registry, but from the making. It is required that it (the certificate) \u201cshall be made and registered in the manner provided by the first recited Act.\u201d Under this Act I think the \u201cmanner\u201d referred to was not intended to include or limit the \u201ctime\u201d for doing it. If so, the liability would cease whenever it was done at any time within the five years. If the requirement of the statute can be satisfied by the registry of the certificate in the manner specified, without regard to the limitation of thirty days, it seems the condition as to the time of registry is not necessarily included; and when to have made it plain it was only necessary (as is the usual course pursued in enactments) to have added the words \u201cand within the time limited, &c.,\u201d we are the more justified in concluding such was not the intention of the legislature.\nA difficulty, however, is said to arise in consequence of the difference in the language of the 33rd section of the consolidated statute. The words there used are that the certificate \u201cshall be made and registered as prescribed in the 35th sec. of this Act, after which (not upon which) such shareholders shall not * * *be in any manner liable for or charged with the payment of any debt or demand due by the company, &c.\u201d By the later Act the liability continues until the registration. The difference in one respect, that is as to the time when the party would be discharged, has, however, no effect in this case, for both the making and registration took place before action.\nCan the limitation of the \u201cthirty days\u201d in section 35 be applied to the registry of the certificate as mentioned in section 33? The words \u201cas prescribed\u201d in the thirty-third section, refer as well to the registry as to the making of the certificate, but the prescription of the \u201cthirty days\u201d in section 35 is \u201cafter the payment of the last instalment in the capital stock of any such company.\u201d That is the only prescription as to the time of the registry, and being wholly inapplicable to the circumstances arising under the provision of section 33, how am I to say the legislature in making section 33 intended that as regards section 33 it should mean thirty days from the payment by one shareholder of the last instalment of his individual stock. We are not to legislate, but to give effect to the provisions of the statute and cannot, as I think, supply what is clearly deficient. The position and commercial status of the company, from the fact of one shareholder having fully paid up his stock and registered his certificate, is essentially different from what it would be if the whole stock were paid up; and the necessity for a registry, and thereby a publication of the fact, being so much more necessary in the latter event than in the former.\nI cannot see my way clear to decide that the legislature intended the prescription of thirty days to apply to a case under section thirty-three. The last Act contains all the guards the legislature thought necessary for the protection of parties dealing with those companies, after the public had nine years acquaintance with the dealings under the previous joint stock companies Acts. It contains provisions for records of payments of stock, by which parties could inform themselves, before dealing as creditors with a company, as to the solvency of the company, and the amount of the guarantee by holders of unpaid stock; and their ability to pay up balances of unpaid stock to a more reliable extent than they could do, as a general rule, in regard to individual traders. If parties choose to deal with legal entities, without the proper inquiry open to them, it would be hardly right by a strict or strained construction of a statute to enforce payment from stockholders who have fully paid up all their stock. The principle that every one must be presumed to know the law in regard to the persons and matters they deal with is applicable to every one dealing with a chartered company, and so dealing are bound to see that they are reasonably safe. In this case the plaintiff must be held to have known before he gave the credit, that at any moment he was liable to lose the guarantee of any one or more stockholders by the payment in full of their shares and the registry of their certificates. A company composed of shareholders, some of whom are wealthy, and who are presumed to stand as sureties for the whole liabilities of the company, obtains a standing and credit it otherwise would not have, but outside parties should be held to know that the guarantee is but a contingent one, and that at any moment such sureties may by payment and registry cease to be such. Suppose the statute expressly prescribed the registry of the certificate within thirty days, as contended for in this case, outside parties are required to take notice that under the act a stockholder, even after the company had become hopelessly insolvent, might pay up the balance of his stock and by registering his certificate within thirty days afterwards, (all which might be done in a few hours,) get relieved from the payment of anything further. It cannot, therefore, be contended that the guarantee of the unpaid shares of any particular individual for anything beyond the amount due on them, is one of the main reliances of a party giving credit to a company. If, then, the whole of the individual stock be paid in the creditors get about all they could reasonably expect. It is claimed to be better in all such cases to rule against the stockholder on the ground that he has all the chances of gain, and should also bear the losses of the speculations of the company. To that, however, it is fairly answered that he became a guarantor merely, and that having paid up all he promised within the terms of his contract, no creditor should complain that he refuses to pay more. The only just way, then, is to ascertain the nature of the contract binding on all persons becoming parties to it, and by a reasonable construction of it give effect to what we must assume to have been under the law their intentions and reasonable expectations. By the terms of the constating documents, in the case of the great majority of joint stock companies in England and other countries, shareholders are only liable to be made contributories to the extent of the balances due on shares, and payment alone is sufficient to discharge them from all further liability. To that extent they are strictly held, but here, where a party who never owned possibly over two or three hundred dollars worth of shares, is claimed to be retained as a guarantor for several thousand dollars, equity and common honesty require that before he is so declared liable, the law plainly makes him so. If it do not, I feel myself powerless to decree it.\nThe provision in regard to the registry of the certificate under section 34 was called for to enable the public to know, within a reasonable time, that all guarantees were at an end and that the only reliance of a creditor was on the fund so provided, if any balance of it remained. If of any service as a notice, it was but a very uncertain one in practice, as a small balance might remain due up to any time within five years. One day the absence of any certificate from the registry might induce the belief that a large amount of stock was due, and credit might thereupon be given to the company; and before liabilities ripened, the small balances might be paid up and the certificate registered, and with it, recourse upon the stockholders at an end. I have, however, just stated a possible but not a probable case. It is, nevertheless, one which the provision of the statute could not prevent. If registry of the certificate of the payment in of the whole capital stock was intended as a notice, it might have some result as to parties from whom the company sought credit, but the registry of the certificate of one shareholder would change, in few cases, the commercial standing or position of the company or lessen its claims for credit. Taking, then, every view of the legislation and the interests of all the parties in their several relations to each other, I do not feel justified in enforcing the claims of the appellant. It is to be regretted that innocent creditors should suffer, but it should be equally regretted that innocent stockholders should lose what they never received value for or agreed or expected to pay.\nSome of the defendants set up a defence by alleging the payment in full of their shares within five years, and the registry of the certificates, not before, but after the commencement of the suit. If I am right as to the issues on the pleas generally then those in question are, in my opinion, good. By section 97, ch. 22, of the consolidated statutes of Upper Canada \u201cany defence arising alter the commencement of any action may be pleaded according to the fact without any formal commencement or conclusion, &c.[27]\u201d The defence here arose after the commencement of the action, and if the plaintiff was satisfied with the truth and legal effect of the matters therein alleged he could have so said, and he would have, in that case, been entitled to his costs up to that time; but the rule is, I think, \u201cif the plaintiff replies or demurs to the plea the defendant will be entitled to his costs if he succeeds\u201d\u2014excepting, however it may be, \u201cthe costs incurred prior to the plea.\u201d The objection that the plea is not \u201cto the further maintenance of the suit\u201d and is therefore bad, because it would be no defence as regards the costs incurred previous to right of defence arising from the registration, cannot be accepted as a valid one. The law makes it a good defence pleaded in that way; and I think the question of the previous costs depends on the action of the plaintiff subsequent to the plea. It cannot, in my judgment, affect the issues raised. On the whole case, after much reflection and research, I feel that my judgment should be for the respondents, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nFor the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in his judgment, and by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that the true construction of the acts which raise the question before us, is that put upon them by the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.\nI see nothing in the Acts which expresses the intention of the legislature to have been, that payment in full by a shareholder of all his stock should have effect, but of a greater or less degree, according as registration of the certificate of payment should take place within, or after, the expiration of, thirty days from the payment. If such had been the intention of the legislature, it should have been, and, no doubt, would have been so expressed; so that the question really is, as it is put by the demurrer, whether payment by a shareholder of his stock in full shall have any operation at all as a discharge of such shareholder from unlimited liability for all the debts of the company, unless he obtains and registers a certificate of such payment within 30 days from payment. We cannot, I think, put such a construction upon the statutes as that the obtaining and registering a certificate of payment in full by a shareholder upon the thirtieth day from payment, should discharge him from all liability beyond the amount so paid; and that the obtaining and registering such certificate upon the thirty-first day after such payment in full should have no operation whatever, but would leave him equally liable for all debts of the company as if he had not paid anything on his shares. The spirit of the statute is, in my opinion, as stated by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in whose judgment, and in that of Mr. Justice Patterson, I entirely concur. We give, I think, full effect to the letter also, by holding that, as to a shareholder paying in full, registration of the certificate of payment within thirty days does not constitute an essential element to give to payment in full the operation of a discharge from all liability, excepting always the excepted demands.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robertson & Robertson.\nSolicitor for all respondents except Rumsey: W.R.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE)\nProhibition to alienate in a purely onerous title void\u2014 Art 970 C. C L. C., 18 Vic., ch. 250.\nBy 18 Vic., ch. 250 W. F. and his brother were authorized to sell certain entailed property in consideration of a non-redeemable rent representing the value of the property. On the 7th September. 1860, W. F., the appellant, and E. F., assigned to their brother, A. F., a piece of land forming part of the above entailed property, in consideration of a rente fonci\u00e8re of six pounds, payable the first day of October of each year The deed was registered and contained the following stipulation: \"But it is agreed that the assignee cannot alienate in any manner whatsoever the said land, nor any part thereof, to any person without the express and written consent of the assignors under penalty of the nullity of the said deed.\" The property was subsequently seized by a judgment creditor of A. F., and appellant opposed the sale and asked that the seizure be declared null because the property seized could not be sold by reason of the above prohibition to alienate.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, affirming the judgment of the Court below, that the deed was made in accordance with the provisions of 18 Vic. ch. 250, and being a purely onerous title on its face, the prohibition to alienate contained in said deed was void Art. 970 C. C. L. C.\nQuery: Whether the substitutes may not when the substitution opens attack the deed for want of sufficient consideration.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side), rendered on the 8th March, 1878. The respondent, under a judgment obtained by him against Alexander Fraser, on the 9th February, 1856, seized an immovable property, lot No. 3, as belonging to the said Alexander Fraser, and which lot, forming part of the Seigniorial Domain of the Seigniory of Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, had been bequeathed by the late Alexander Fraser to the said appellant and his brother Edward Fraser, charged with a substitution in favor of their children. The appellant and his brother Edward Fraser fyled against this seizure an opposition, to prevent the sheriff from proceeding to the sale of the property. The grounds of this last proceeding were, that the immovable property seized had been granted \u00e0 titre de bail \u00e0 rente fonci\u00e8re, to the said Alexander Fraser, by the said William and Edward Fraser under the condition that the said grantee should not part with it, or with any part thereof, in favor of any person soever, without the express consent in writing of the said grantors, under penalty of the nullity of the said grant, and that therefore the said immovable property could not be seized and sold without the consent of the said grantors.\nThe sale, or bail \u00e0 rente fonci\u00e8re, was made for divers considerations, amongst others, for an annual rent of \u00a36 ' it was registered on the 12th of September, 1860, and it contains the following' stipulation: \"It is agreed that the grantee cannot alienate in any way the said lot or any part thereof to whomsoever, without the express and written consent of the grantors, under pain of nullity of the present deed.\"\nThe said respondent contested the said opposition and pretended that the said clause could not be enforced and was not legal. The Court of original jurisdiction to wit: the Superior Court sitting: in and for the district of Kamouraska dismissed the opposition. Appeal having been instituted from this judgment to the Provincial Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec the last Court confirmed the said judgment on division of three against two. Against this last judgment this appeal is now instituted.\nMr. Langlois, Q.C., for appellant:\u2014\nThe point to be decided in this case depends entirely upon the interpretation to be given to the statute, 18 Vic. ch. 250, which grants to the appellant and to his brother the power to sell and concede in lots the \"Domaine\" of the Seigniory of Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, notwithstanding the entail. The lot in question, worth six or seven thousand dollars, was sold by the appellant to his brother for an irredeemable ground rent of only \u00a36, and it is clear that the clause prohibiting the grantee from alienating the lot in question was part of the consideration. The contract was really more one in the nature of a donation than of a sale, and, as such, was contrary to the provisions of the statute. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench relied on Art. 970 C. C. and says: \"The prohibition to alienate things sold or conveyed by purely onerous title is void.\" But this article cannot apply to this case, because I submit we have clearly shown that the property in question was not conveyed by a purely onerous title.\n[FOURNIER, J.:\u2014Can we give to an authentic deed a different character than that which it purports to have?]\nThe deed does not express on its face the actual consideration, and therefore appellant can give extrinsic evidence which is consistent with the deed. The evidence clearly shows that the parties had an interest in stipulating such a clause, as well on account of the entail in favor of their children as to prevent their having as a neighbour, instead of their brother, a stranger with whom they might not agree.\nThe appellant had the right to insert the condition that the lessee should not alienate and this clause will not have its effect if the sale of the property under execution cannot be prevented.\nMoreover as our Civil Code came into force on the first of August 1866 and the date of the deed containing the stipulation giving rise to this case is the 7th Sept., 1860, Art. 970 can only be considered as the ruling of the codifiers upon a point of law. By referring to their remarks on this article, we are far from being satisfied that the article in question was, in their opinion, the existing law.\nThe learned counsel then cited Fafard v. B\u00e9langer ([1]), Bourassa v. B\u00e9dard ([2]).\nMr. Pouliot for respondent:\nThe statute 18 Vic, ch. 250, gave the right to the appellant and his brother to alienate, free from all substitution, any piece of land in their seigniorial domain at Rivi\u00e8re du Loup, but respondent contends that, independent of the statute, the sale made was a valid sale under Art. 949 C.C. Because, it might occur that the institute would eventually become the absolute owner of the property substituted, for instance, by the pre-decease of the substitute. The law affords ample protection to the substitute. See Art. 710, C. C. P. But, as I have said, the sale in this case, being un bail \u00e0 rente fonci\u00e8re perpetuelle et non rachetable, made tor divers considerations, amongst others for an annual rent of \u00a36 was expressly authorized by the statute, and to contend that it is a nullity is to contend that appellant was guilty of fraud. No fraud has been proven, and, if it existed, surely it is not the appellant who can claim any advantage therefrom, his children being the ones to complain when the substitution may open. For the present, the appellant must stand by his own act.\nNow, the appellant has endeavoured to change the nature of the deed by establishing a supposed verbal agreement; this evidence was objected to, and the court declared it illegal and inadmissible. See Art. 1234 C. C.\nIt is also urged that the prohibition to alienate is a part of the consideration for which the lot in question was granted. But such a condition is invalid when the deed is a purely onerous one, and all the judges agree in saying that there is no doubt that the title of Alexander Fraser is a purely onerous one. The case of Tourangeau v. Renaud ([3]) is in point.\nThis case was decided in the first instance by the Superior Court, and subsequently brought to the Privy Council in England; and a disposition made by a testator, by which he prohibited his children to alienate for the space of twenty years only, the bequeathed property, was declared null, being contrary to public order and made without consideration; and yet this case was much more favorable than the one now under consideration since the restriction was only for a limited time. From the appellant's mode of reasoning, it would seem that any one desirous of maintaining the prohibition inserted in the above mentioned testament could well say that it was made for laudable reasons of foresight and prudence, e. g. through fear that the legatees might abuse the right of property thus conferred upon them or to secure them means of existence for a certain period.\nMr. Langlois, Q. C., in reply.\nRITCHIE C. J.:\nMr. Langlois, who argued this case on the part of the appellant, stated frankly that the simple question is, whether the deed is an onerous or a gratutious deed, if onerous he admitted the appeal fails-to use his own expression. Now, it is clear, I think, beyond all dispute, that this deed on its face creates a purely onerous title with nothing whatever to indicate to the contrary, that the deed was in whole or in part, gratuitous, which deed, so on the face of it being onerous, I think, the appellants, the grantors, cannot gainsay in this proceeding in any way, and as to which the prohibition to alienate is null the of the grounds taken is that it has been alleged that the property was of a larger value than the monetary rent fixed in the deed would represent. As I understand the law in the province of Quebec, that evidence ought not to have been received at all be-cause in a proceeding of this kind it was not open to grantors to destroy the effect of this official instrument which they had made under this statute; but, if this transfer is, by reason of inadequacy of price or want of consideration, in derogation of the right to sell under the statute and in derogation of the rights of the substitutes, and thus the grantors have not acted in good faith as against them, then they, the grantors, cannot set up such their bad faith to defeat their own deed valid on its face against their own grantee. But the substitutes may possibly, when the substitution shall he opened contest the transaction. In the meantime, as against the appellants, I think the deed must stand and therefore the decision of the Superior Court, confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, was right, and both those judgments should be affirmed\nSTRONG, J., stated that he concurred in the judgment of Fournier, J.\nFOURNIER, J.:\nLa substitution cr\u00e9\u00e9e suivant les formes l\u00e9gales par le testament d'Alexandre Fraser, en date du 11 f\u00e9vrier 1833 a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte en faveur de Malcolm Fraser, son fils; puis apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9c\u00e8s sans enfants, elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur des Appelants qui, par le m\u00eame testament, \u00e9taient, dans ce cas, appel\u00e9s \u00e0 remettre les m\u00eames biens \u00e0 charge aussi de substitution en faveur de leurs enfants.\nLes Appelants, comme grev\u00e9s de substitution, ne pouvaient ali\u00e9ner les biens substitu\u00e9s que sons la condition r\u00e9solutoire inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 leur titre,\u2014mais pour des raisons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9ambule de l'acte 18 Vic. ch. 250 ils out obtenu la facult\u00e9 d'ali\u00e9ner le domaine de la seigneurie de la Riviere-du- Loup aux conditions suivantes:\nLa ler section valide les concessions qui avaient d\u00e9ja \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de partie du domaine. La 2e sec. autorise les Appelants William et Edouard Fraser \u00e0 vendre et ali\u00e9ner conjointement par lots et portions le domaine de la dite seigneurie,\u2014pourvu toujours que cette vente soit faite pour une rente fonci\u00e8re non. rachetable, on pour une rente constitu\u00e9e. La 3e sec. declare que les dits William et Edouard Fraser ne pourront recevoir et placer le capital des rentes constitu\u00e9es sans le consentement du tuteur \u00e0 la substitution.\nConform\u00e9ment aux pouvoirs qui leur \u00e9taient ainsi conf\u00e9r\u00e9s, les Appelants out, par acte en date du 7 septembre 1860, conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Alexandre Fraser, en consideration d'une rente annuelle de \u00a36 courant un terrain faisant partie du domaine en question, situ\u00e9 dans le village de Fraserville, paroisse de St. Patrice do la Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.\nCet acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 le 12 septembre 1860. Outre la rente annuelle cet acte contient les reserves et charges suivantes:\n\" lo Do toutes les b\u00e2tisses qui se trouvent pr\u00e9sentement sur le terrain sus-baill\u00e9, pour les enlever aussit\u00f4t que le preneur le requerra, si cc n'est celle occup\u00e9e par Honor\u00e9 Sirois que les bailleurs ne seront tenus d'enlever qu'\u00e0 l'expiration du bail consenti par le dit William Fraser a Ce dernier. 2o Droit de redresser la dite avenue, en prenant sur le terrain sus-baill\u00e9 l'\u00e9tendue de terrain n\u00e9cessaire, sans diminution du prix du pr\u00e9sent bail, et sans indemnit\u00e9 en faveur du premier, pour l'\u00e9tendue de terrain ainsi prise, de laquelle avenue ils jouiront en commun, et qu'ils entretiendront chacun pour moiti\u00e9. 30 De tout le terrain occup\u00e9 par l'\u00e9glise anglicane. 40 Du droit de communication sur le dit terrain pour l'exploitation de leur moulin \u00e0 farine et autres industries qu'ils pourront pratiquer sur la dite rivi\u00e8re.\n\" Ce bail fait \u00e0 charge par le preneur qui s'y oblige: lo de faire mesurer, chainer et borner le dit terrain, et d'en fournir un proc\u00e8s-verbal aux bailleurs \u00e0 ses frais, 20 De leur fournir copie des pr\u00e9sentes d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9es aussi \u00e0 ses frais. 30 D'enclore le terrain et le tenir clos et de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous devoirs de voisin auxquels il peut \u00eatre tenu, sans que les bailleurs y soient tenus comme voisin ordinaire. 40 De leur payer en leur bureau, au dit lieu de Ia Riviere-du-Loup, le premier octobre chaque ann\u00e9e, et dont le paiement se fera le premier octobre de l'ann\u00e9e prochaine, la somme de six louis courant de rente fonci\u00e8re pour ensuite continuer be dit paiement \u00e0 pareille \u00e9poque chaque ann\u00e9e, au paiement duquel prix de fermage le dit lot de terre sus-baill\u00e9 demeure sp\u00e9cialement hypothequ\u00e9 en faveur des bailleurs de fonds.\"\nCet acte contient de plus la stipulation suivante qui fait le sujet de la difficult\u00e9 en cette cause:\n\" Mais il est convenu que le preneur ne pourra ali\u00e9ner d'aucune mani\u00e8re le dit terrain, ni aucune partie d'icelui \u00e0 qui que ce soit, sans le consentement expres et par \u00e9crit des baillenrs, a peine de nullit\u00e9 du present acte.\"\nLa question que soulev\u00e9 cette clause est de savoir si dans l'acte de concession dont les conditions sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es plus haut, la prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner impos\u00e9e au concessionnaire Alexandre Fraser, est legale.\nLe Code Civil art. 970 contient \u00e0 ce sujet la disposition suivante: \"La prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner la chose v vendue ou c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 titre purement on\u00e9reux est nulle.\" Cet article est donn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant conforme \u00e0 l'ancien droit, d'apres lequel la validit\u00e9 de cette clause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e parce qu'elle est contenue dans un contrat ant\u00e9rieur au code.\nLe principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 aussi clairement qu'il l'est dans l'art, cite, n'\u00e9tant pas susceptible de doute, il ne reste donc pour en faire l'application \u00e0 cette cause qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re do l'acte de concession. Est-il \u00e0 titre purement on\u00e9reux? La simple lecture de l'acte suffit pour en convaincre. il ne contient que des reserves, des conditions et charges on\u00e9reuses. On n'y trouve pas une seule expression qui puisse d\u00e9noter de la part des Appelants la moindre intention de faire un acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 en faveur du concessionnaire. D ail-leur si telle cut \u00e9t\u00e9 leur intention ils n'auraient pu le faire, car les Appelants, comme grev\u00e9s de substitution, ne pouvaient pas disposer de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre gratuit directement ni indirectement. De plus, ils en \u00e9taient emp\u00each\u00e9s par le statut qui les autorise \u00e0 ne vendre ou conc\u00e9der qu'\u00e0 des conditions on\u00e9reuses afin do proteger les droits des appel\u00e9s \u00e0 recueillir plus tard les biens substitu\u00e9s Leur acte do concession est done \u00e0 sa face cc qu'il devait \u00e9tre d'apr\u00e8s le statut, un titre on\u00e9reux.\nMais pour lui enlever ce caract\u00e8re et le faire accepter comme fait \u00e0 titre gratuit pour une partie, afin de faire maintenir la prohibition d'aliener, los Appelants ont allegu\u00e9 que par convention verbale il avait et\u00e9 con-' venu eutre los parties que le preneur remettrait \u00e0 d demande le dit terrain aux bailleurs qui voulaient s'y \"b\u00e2tir chacun une maison et que sans cette convention \u201cles dits opposants n'auraient pas baill\u00e9 pour un prix si \"modique un terrain valant plusieurs milliers de piastres.\" Un t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu pour en faire la preuve mais la preuve testimoniale de toute convention tendant \u00e0 contredire un acte authentique est interdite, art 1234 C. C. Dans aucun cas la preuve testimoniale ne peut \"etre admise pour contredire ou changer les termes\" d'un \u00e9crit valablement fait.\" Cette preuve doit n\u00e9 cessairement \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et l'acte dolt subsister dans toute son int\u00e9grit\u00e9.\nLes Appelants ont aussi attaqu\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de leur acte en pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019ils n'avaient pas le droit de le faire \u00e0 raison de la substitution dont ils sont gr\u00e8ves Ils commettent en cola une double erreur d'abord par\u00e9e que le statut ci-dessus cite a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 leur demande pour les autoriser \u00e0 faire un acte de la nature de celui dont-il s'agit, et ensuite parce que sans ce statut un parelle acte serait valable pour au moins leur vie durante et ne serait dans tous les cas sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9vocation que par l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement de l'ouverture de la substitution en faveur des enfants des bailleurs. Us se plaignent aussi que la concession n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que pour un prix modique, tandis que le terrain est d'une valeur beaucoup plus consid\u00e9rable. Cela se peut, mais cc n'est pas une raison suffisante pour revenir contre leur propre acte. Le contrat ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement fait, il no peut pas \u00eatre an\u00e9anti par la volont\u00e9 d'une seule des parties,\u2014il ne pourrait l'\u00eatre quo du consentement de toutes les parties\u2014 ou sur une contestation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re entre elles pour quelques causes l\u00e9gales,\u2014et encore dans le cas ou son annulation n'interviendrait pas avec les droits acquis par les tiers.\nIl se peut que les int\u00e9r\u00eats des appel\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9s dans cette transaction mais comme leurs droits no sont encore qu'une esp\u00e9rance de recueillir les biens substitu\u00e9s si la condition arrive ils seront toujours a temps lors de l'ouverture de la substitution en leur faveur pour sr faire remettre dans IGS droits que leur assurent 13. Substitution et le statut en vertu duquel lacte gil question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9.\nPour ces motifs je suis d'opinion que la prohibition d'ali\u00e9ner contenue dans act est nulle et que le jugement de la Cour du Bane de la Reine doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens,\nHENRY, J.:\nI concur in the judgment which, has just been read. The statute was passed barring the rights of the substitutes, and to enable the parties to convey to purchasers clear and full title of the premises. They did not pursue the course pointed out by the statute, but made transfers, reserving certain rights to themselves. Under these circumstances I think the terms and the intention of the statute were not pursued, and that, having done so, and not having gone according to the statute, there is no person who could claim under the Act, or take any advantage of the reservations in the transfers except the substitutes themselves. I do not think it is in the mouth oi these parties to say they shall take advantage of a. provision, under the impression that they have made a gratuitous gift. A gratuitous gift and the principles applicable to it are not at all applicable where there is an onerous grant. In one case the party is supposed to have the right to annex conditions to what he freely gives away. In the other, where there is a consideration no matter how small it partakes of all the conditions of an onerous grant and therefore I do not think it comes within the rule which allows a party to take possession of the property again on some condition, such as that stated in this case. Therefore, I think the judgment of the court below should be con\u00b0 firmed and the appeal dismissed. GWYNNE, J.:\u2013\nI entirely concur in the judgments delivered by the learned judge of the Superior Court, and by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal. It is admitted, by the learned counsel for the appellant that if the article 970 of the Civil Code applies the case must fall to the ground.\nThe points urged in support of the appeal are: Firstly, that this case does not come within article 970 because as is contended, the property in question has not been conveyed by purely onerous title, but for a consideration partly pecuniary and partly gratuitous. The gratuitous consideration (which it is contended sufficiently appears upon the deed) consisting in a desire to benefit a brother: and the interest relied upon to shew that the prohibition to alienate was not without cause consisting in the entail in favor of the children of the Bailleurs under the will of Alexander Fraser, deceased and in the interest which the Bailleurs had to have their brother as a neigh bour instead of a stranger. Secondly, conceding the title of the grantee in the deed of concession to be a purely onerous title, still the deed having been executed before the Civil Code came into force) that this case is not to be governed by article 970, but by the old law, which (as is contended) was different, and which (as is also contended,) did not make a prohibition to alienate things conveyed by purely onerous title void, unless in addition thereto, the d\u00e9fense d'ali\u00e9ner was sans cause, and it is contended that hers it was not sans cause for the reasons suggested in the first objection.\nThis objection appears to amount simply to this, that article 970 announces new law, and that the old law did not avoid the agreement not to alienate in a case like the present, for the reasons suggested. In support of this contention, certain remarks of the codifiers in their report made under the act have been quoted for the purpose of establishing that their intention was to create new law by this article 970. And thirdly i that the article 970, though not given as new law, is to be regarded as no more than an affirmation of the previously received maxim that a d\u00e9fense d'ali\u00e9ner pure et simple et sans cause was without effect and so that this case is to be governed by the application of that maxim which as is contended, authorized the d\u00e9fense d'ali\u00e9ner in this particular case, for the reasons above suggested. This objection seems to be much the same as the previous one.\nNow, assuming the article as here suggested, an affirmation of the previously received maxim, that, as it seems to me, is equivalent to construing it as declaratory of what the old law was and this is the light in which the articles of the code which are not stated to be alterations or amendments of the old law are to be regarded. In this view, article 970 must be read as declaring that, by the old law, the prohibition to alienate things sold or conveyed by purely onerous title is void.\nIn this view the remarks of the codifiers relied upon could not alter the character of the article if which I do not think to be the case, the remarks, as quoted can fairly be said to afford evidence that the article was not intended by them to be declaratory of the existing law.\nThe case, however, as it appears to me, must be wholly regarded in the light of the statute 18 Vic, ch. 250, and so regarding it, cadit questio.\nThe grounds of opposition relied upon are, that the opposants had no right to convey the land to the defendant as they did, because that they were charged with a substitution in favor of their children by the will of Alexander Fraser, deceased, and further that it was never intended that the said deed of conveyance should be seriously what it purports to be, but that on the contrary it was agreed between the opposants and the defendant, that the defendant should give up the land to the opposites whenever they should desire it.\nThat the opposants had no right whatever to execute the deed of concession so as to bind the substitutes ' otherwise than in virtue of the statute is admitted indeed it is so declared in the Act of Parliament.\nThe deed upon its face purports to be in precise accordance with the provisions of the statute It is admitted upon all hands, that the opposants, by executing this deed which, but for the statute they had no power to execute, are estopped from asserting that it was executed in fraud of the statute, or that it was not intended to be real. Upon the same principle they are equally estopped from asserting that there was any secret agreement to avoid the deed; and as the statute only contemplates and authorizes the execution of a deed purely onerous, they are estopped from saying that this is not such a deed or that part of the consideration was gratuitous or that they had an interest reserved entitling them at their pleasure to avoid the deed and to demand a surrender of the land. They are estopped in fact from contending that the deed does not take effect in the plain sense in which it is expressed, or that it is not in every respect a good and valid deed having its force in virtue of the statute, and conclusively binding upon them, and from asserting any interest in the land in derogation of the plain terms of the deed which are that the defendant shall enjoy the land as perpetual proprietor at an irredeemable ground rent; the deed must therefore be held as conveying by force of the statute perfect title to the defendant indefeasible by the opposants. All the grounds, therefore, of the opposition urged are removed. It may be that the substitutes may when substitution opens assert their rights if the deed was executed under the circum-stances and for the consideration which the opposants now desire to contend but are stopped from contending; but in such case, their rights would not be affected by this forced judicial sale.\nIf these considerations were not sufficient to uphold the judgments appealed from, the 10th paragraph of the defendant's contestation, and the point there raised, would have, as it seems to me, to receive much consideration before judgment could be rendered in favor of the opposants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Langlois, Angers, Larue & Angers.\nSolicitors for respondent: Larue & Pouliot.\n[1] 4 L.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nAppeal.\u2014Final judgment Judicial proceeding.\u201442 Vic., c. 39, Secs. 3 and 9.\nIn an action instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec by the appellant against M. A. C. and nine other defendants, the respondents, three of the defendants, severally demurred to the appellant's action, except as regards two lots of land, in which they acknowledged the appellant had an undivided share. The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and, on appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirmed the judgment. The appellant thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court, and moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction.\nHeld,\u2014That as the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (the highest court of last resort having jurisdiction in the Province) finally determined and put an end to the appeal, which was a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sec. 9 of The Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879, such judgment was one from which an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada; and though an appeal cannot bet taken from a court of first instance directly to the Supreme Court until there is a final judgment, yet, whenever a Provincial Court of appeal has jurisdiction, this Court can entertain an appeal from its judgment finally disposing of the appeal, the case being in other respects a proper subject of appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (Appeal side), maintaining the judgment of the Superior Court of the said Province in an action instituted by the appellant against the respondents and others.\nBy his action, the appellant claimed an account of the tutelle, gestion and administration of the property of the late Marie Francoise Marguerite Cuvillier, and also demanded that a partage be made of all the real estate described in the declaration in which he claimed to be entitled to an undivided share. The respondents severally demurred to the appellant s action, except as regards two lots of land and in which they acknowledge the appellant has an undivided share.\nThe Superior Court maintained the demurrers and dismissed the appellant s action, quoad the respondents, except as to the two lots in question.\nThe appellant then appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, which affirmed the first judgment.\nFrom this judgment the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondents moved to quash the appeal, upon the ground that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction.\nMr. Monk for respondents:\nThe judgment appealed from is not a final judgment within the meaning of see. 3, c. 39, 42 Vic It only decides a part of the case, and would not certainly be appealable to the Privy Councilm. See Simard v. Townshend ([1]); and Lacroix v. Moreau ([2]). If the judgment of the court below is reversed, the parties will have to go before the Superior Court and when a final judgment is obtained on the merits of the case the whole case will come up again. The legislature did not contemplate that there should be two appeals in the same case.\nMr. Doutre, Q. C , for appellant:\nMy learned friend has failed to show that any remedy would be left to the appellant if this judgment is allowed to stand.\nThe same provisions as to the right of appeal are to be found in our code and I was allowed to go to the Court of Queen's Bench because this judgment was considered a final judgment. As the case now stands my action is dismissed as regards the greater amount I claim, and I am left a remedy for a small amount; suppose I succeed in the Superior Court for this small amount, how can I then appeal from the judgment dismissing my action for the greater, for I would not be supposed to appeal from a judgment in my favor. Under the 9th section of 42 Vic., c. 39, this is a final judgment in a judicial proceeding.\nMr. Monk, in reply.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by STRONG, J.:\nThis was a motion to quash an appeal upon the ground that this court has no jurisdiction. The original action was instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec against ten defendants, three of whom demurred to the declaration. The Superior Court sustained the demurrers. The Plaintiff (the appellant in this court) then appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, which affirmed the first judgment. From this judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, the present appeal is taken.\nThe objection to the appeal is that the judgment appealed against is not a final judgment within the meaning of sec. 9 of The Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879. In support of this contention it is argued that no appeal lies unless there has been a final disposition of the action by the court of first instance for which sec. 3 of the act first quoted is relied on. That section is in these words, \"An appeal shall lie from final judgments only, in actions, suits, causes, matters and other judicial proceedings originally instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec\" It must b\u00e9 remarked, that this section does not say that there shall be no appeal unless there has been a final judgment of the Superior Court. The argument of the Counsel for the respondent proceeded on that assumption however. There can be no appeal directly from the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, for sec. 5 of the act of 1879 expressly provides that no appeal shall lie to this Court except from the highest Court of last resort having jurisdiction in the Province. This as applied to the Province of Quebec, means, of course, the Court of Queen's Bench on its appellate side. Then, the appeal is not from the judgment of the Superior Court, but from that of the Court of Queen's Bench; and what we have to determine on this motion is whether the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench was a final judgment. The interpretation clause (sec. 9 already referred to) shews plainly that it was for it enacts that the words \"final judgment \" shall mean any judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding, is finally determined and put an end to. Then the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench finally determined and put an end to the appeal, and the appeal was a judicial proceeding within the meaning of this section. The result is, that though an appeal cannot be taken from a Court of first instance directly to this Court until there is a final judgment, yet where-ever a Provincial Court of Appeal has jurisdiction, this Court can entertain an appeal from its judgment finally disposing of the appeal, the case being in other respects a proper subject of appeal. Any other construction of the Act would take a large class of cases subject to appeal to the intermediate Courts out of the \"provisions of this Act. The present case affords an instance of this for if the appellant is bound to await the termination of the suit in the Superior Court, his right of appeal de plano from the judgment of the Queen's Bench will be gone and he will only be able to seek a revision of that judgment here by the order of a judge or of the court made by way of granting him an indulgence.\nI am of opinion that the motion should be refused.\nMotion Refused with costs\nSolicitors for appellant: Doutre, Branchaud &McCord.\nSolicitors for respondents: Barnard & Monk.\n[1] 6 L.

By the rule of reference the award was directed to be made on or before the 1st May, 1877, or such further or ulterior day as the arbitrators might endorse from time to time on the order. The time for making the award was extended by the arbitrators till the 1st of September, 1877. On the 31st August, 1877, the attorneys for plaintiff and defendants, by consent in writing endorsed on the rule of reference, extended the time for making the award till the 8th September. On the 7th September the arbitrators made their award in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $5,001.42, in full settlement of all matters in difference in the cause.\nHeld\u2014reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia\u2014that where the parties, through their respective attorneys in the action, consent to extend the time for making an award under a rule of reference, such consent does not operate as a new submission, but is an enlargement of the time under the rule and a continuation to the extended period of the authority of the arbitrators, and therefore an award made within the extended period is an award made under the rule of reference, and is valid and binding on the parties.\n2. That the fact of one of the parties being a municipal corporation makes no difference.\n3. That in Nova Scotia, where the rule nisi to set aside an award specifies certain grounds of objection, and no new grounds are added by way of amendment in the court below, no other ground of objection to the award can be raised on appeal. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia pronounced on the 31st day of March, A. D. 1879, setting aside an award made in favor of the appellant.\nThe suit was brought by the appellant against the respondents on a contract for the construction of certain sewers across the north common in the city of Halifax. After the cause was at issue, by a rule of the Supreme Court, the matters in difference were referred to two arbitrators named in the rule, with power to select a third arbitrator in case of a difference between them. The arbitrators named appointed a third.\nThe award was to have been made on or before the 1st day of May, 1877, or such further or ulterior day as the arbitrators, or any two of them, might endorse from time to time on the order. The arbitrators first extended the rule to 1st July, 1877, and then to 1st September, 1877. On the 31st August, 1877, by consent in writing endorsed on the rule of reference, the attorneys for plaintiff and attorney for the defendants, who is by statute the Recorder of the city, and as such is bound to act as counsel and attorney for the city in any suits within the Provincial Courts, to which the corporation is a party, extended the time to the 8th of September.\nOn the 7th of September, the following award was made:\n\"Halifax, SS. Supreme Court.\n\"Stephen D. Oakes, plaintiff, v. The city of Halifax, defendants.\n\"We have heard the parties and their witnesses and fully considered the matters referred to us under the annexed rule made in this cause on the 28th day of December, A.D., 1876, and the endorsements thereon, and we do award and order that the city of Halifax, defendants herein, do pay the plaintiff the sum of five thousand and one dollars and forty-two cents (#5,001.42), in full settlement of all matters in difference in this cause.\n\"In making this award we have disallowed an item of $1,727.00 in the defendants set off, alleged to have been paid J. B. Neilly & Co., as we considered that it was not a matter of set off against the plaintiff in this suit, or payment on the contract to a person authorized to receive it.\n\"Halifax, 7th September, 1877.\n\"Fees for 29 meetings, $400,00.\n\"(Signed) B. G. Gray,\n\"(Signed) J. N. Ritchie, Arbitrators.\"\n\"(Signed) Robert Sedgewick,\nA rule nisi was subsequently obtained by the respondents from a judge in chambers returnable before the court in banco to set aside the rule of reference and the award on a great number of grounds, the following grounds being chiefly relied upon, viz:\u2014\n\"17. Because the said award was not made until after the first day of September now last past, and the time for making said award expired on the first day of September.\n\"18. Because no extension of the time for making the award was made by said arbitrators, or any two of them extending beyond the first day of September, A.D. 1877, and said award was not made until after that day, to wit: on the seventh day of September aforesaid.\"\nAfter argument of the said rule nisi the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (Weatherbe, J., dissenting,) set aside the award.\nFrom the rule setting aside the award, the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the respondent there moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, because the rule appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act. This motion was rejected. Mr. Cockburn, Q. C., for appellant:\nThere are two grounds only on which this award was set aside, viz.: That there was not a valid enlargement of the time for the arbitrators to make their award, and that there was no valid waiver by defendants' counsel as to certain irregularities in the conduct of the arbitrators. It is true that the last enlargement was made by the attorneys in the cause, but this is sufficient. See ch. 109, sec. 19, of the Rev. Stat. N. S., 4th series. But independently of this statute, the enlargement was valid. Instead of being a nullity, it was a continuance of the former submission, an enlargement by a higher authority than that of the arbitrators\u2014the authority from which alone the arbitrators obtained their power\u2014the parties themselves, acting through their attorneys.\n[The CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014We will hear what Mr. Gormully says on this point.]\nMr. Gormully, for respondents:\nThe parties here are not, I think, to be governed by sec. 19, of ch. 109, of the Rev. Stat. of Nova Scotia, just cited, but by the 1st sec. of that Act. The reference in this case was by rule of court, and, being a delegated authority, it must be construed strictly. The enlargement could only be made by the two arbitrators in a particular manner. They properly made an enlargement until the 1st of September. They did not make their award, however, till the 7th September. It is true the parties, through their attorneys, enlarged the time to the 8th of September. This enlargement was not in pursuance of the rule of reference. If anything, it amounted to a new submission, and, if so, the attorney on the record, representing a municipal corporation, could not, as such attorney, and by virtue of his retainer only, bind such corporation by a new submission, not in a suit. Then there is another point, whether the award is valid on the face of it,\n[The CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Was this point raised in the Court below? if not, it cannot be raised on appeal.]\nNo, my lord, but that objection is open, because it appears on the face of the award. This fact was before the Court below, and this is merely a new argument on the fact.\nThe award in this case does not find specifically on each issue. By the law of Nova Scotia the costs of each issue are borne by the party against whom such issue is found. This award does not so dispose of the issues as to enable the Court to tax the costs.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., was not called upon to reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\nWe all think this appeal should be allowed. The last point suggested by counsel for the respondent I do not think is open. In the first place, I do not think, as at present advised, that the award is bad on the face of it. We should read this award, as it ought to be read, as the language of persons to whom this matter has been referred should be read, that is, reasonably, by principles and rules which ought to guide us in construing language in the ordinary transactions of life. They have directed the sum awarded to be paid in full settlement of all matters in difference. The reasonable inference is that they took into consideration all matters in difference. They could not have done that without considering all the issues in the cause, and in doing that and awarding as they did, they must have found for the plaintiff upon all those issues. They found nothing in favor of the defendant at all, and as to one issue\u2014the plea of set-off\u2014they explained that they had not allowed it, because they did not think it was a matter of set-off against the plaintiff. In such a case as this, where the rule was taken out on a certain number of points submitted for the consideration of the court and argued before the court below on those points, and where no application was made to that court to alter the rule, so as to allow other grounds to be put forward, as is necessary in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, I think it is too late now to raise an entirely new point here and make this court as it were a court of original jurisdiction.\nAs to the extension of time, it appears to me that this was a proper continuation of the original submission.\nI do not think any sufficient ground is shewn for setting aside the award, and I think, therefore the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nI have looked through the pleas, and I cannot find any of them that is not answered by the statement made in the award. It covers every single one of them, and I can see no difficulty at all in saying that the arbitrators found for the plaintiff on every issue that was raised in the trial. The rules in regard to corporations appearing by an attorney, I think, in a case like this, are the same as if the attorney appeared for an individual. I consider that the attorneys for the corporation had by law the full authority of the corporation to refer this matter to arbitration, in the first place without consulting them at all; and in the next place, the same power to extend the time; and, although there is a provision in the rule of reference giving the arbitrators power to extend it, it does not interfere with the inherent right of the attorneys to extend the time independently of it. In these rules of reference under the common law, it is not strictly speaking, the action of the court. In order to keep the cause in court and enable the court to have jurisdiction either to set aside the verdict, or confirm it and enter judgment upon it, it is necessary that it should have the sanction of the court; but it is virtually, to all intents and purposes, a mere agreement between the parties to refer the case to arbitration. I think, therefore, that the attorneys, having the original power, had the power afterwards to extend the time independently of what is stated in the rule. The other is an extra power given to the arbitrators to extend the time, whether both parties are willing or not, and to that extent, it takes away from either party the power to say the time for making the award shall not be extended. That is the object of the provision, and that is accomplished up to September 1st, whether the parties like it or not; but one or two days before that time arrives the attorneys, fully authorized, as I think they were, extended the time. I think that binds the principals of both parties, and the extension of time in question is no ground for setting aside this award. In regard to the rule nisi on the order of a judge out of court, I may say that I am not at all satisfied that any judge has the power to interfere in that way in a case of that kind. I know that in Nova Scotia the practice has been that the judges, in place of making any order in the matter of an award, or taking any affidavits, have refused them, and given instead an order to stay proceedings, until the parties could have an opportunity of applying to the full court to set it aside. This case appears to have been different. This plaintiff had not an opportunity of an argument before the full court before this rule nisi was granted by a single judge. I think neither the rule of reference appointing the arbitrators, nor their award, as I understand the practice in England, and the power of a judge in chambers there, can be controlled by a judge sitting at chambers; nor do I think that a judge in Nova Scotia can grant an order returnable before the whole court, except where he has power to decide the whole case itself. Entertaining these views, I certainly concur in saying that this appeal should be allowed, and that the plaintiff in this action should have judgment for the amount of his award.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nWe have no right, neither had the court below, to enter into this case upon the merits. We have nothing, therefore, to do with the facts, and I must say it seems strange to me that an award which the court setting it aside pronounced to be unimpeachable on the face of it, and made by a court of arbitrators, which the chairman of the Board of Works, the member of the corporation most conversant with the matter, admitted to be composed of gentlemen most eminently competent to decide the matters in difference, should be set aside upon a technical point, such as that of the power of the attornies to extend the time. I am of opinion that the parties represented by attornies had, by their attornies, power to extend the time for making the award, and that their doing so was only an extension of the time under the old submission, and not a new submission.\nIt would, I think, have been a matter much to be regretted, if the Court had come to the conclusion that this case had not been appealable. In a matter in which the court below should set aside an award for some cause which may be said to come within the exercise of their discretion, a right of appeal might be well questioned, but here the court has proceeded wholly upon what they pronounced to be a point of law, viz.; that an extension of the time by the attornies was null and void.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: J. S. D. Thompson.\nSolicitor for respondents: William Sutherland.\n"

That 40 Vic., ch. 21, establishing a court of maritime jurisdiction for the Province of Ontario, is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\nAppeal from a decree of the Maritime Court of Ontario, in a case of damage, instituted by the owners of the steamer Southern Belle against the steamer Picton, the owners intervening. The case on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Maritime Court was, that the Southern Belle was, on the 12th day of August, 1878, in the Port Dalhousie, lying at the wharf, waiting for a full cargo of passengers, on an excursion trip to Toronto; that the Picton was lying at the same wharf, with her bows in under the port quarters of the Southern Belle; that the Belle, having received her cargo, was heavily laden, and employed the tug H. Neelon to hitch on her prow and draw her head away from the wharf, so as to bring her into her course, heading towards Lake Ontario; and when the Southern Belle was about broadside on to the Picton, the Picton cast off her ropes and, putting on steam, ran stem on into the starboard side of the Southern Belle, amidships, and broke in her wheel-house, beside doing her other damage.\nThe contention of the defendant was, that the Southern Belle was negligently and improperly towed upon the bow of the Picton, thus hemming the latter boat in and hindering her freedom of motion; that when a collision was imminent the Southern Belle was being towed towards the prow of the Picton, and in fact ran into the Picton; that the Picton had not completed her \"winding,\" and though she had been moving in the course of her \"winding,\" and though at the moment of the collision the stern line was not actually fastened to the dock, the Picton had then no appreciable forward motion and was not further from the dock than she properly might be in the process of \"winding;\" that it was the duty of the Southern Belle to have waited till the Picton (as the boat nearest the lake) had gone out of the basin, or to have seen and considered the position of the Picton; and to have kept out of her way by moving nearer to the western pier in crossing the Picton's bow; and that the Southern Belle, by using her own engines, might have moved ahead and avoided a collision, while the Picton was helpless, being unable to move ahead without running into the Southern Belle, and unable to move astern without endangering her steering gear by backing against the dock.\nThe defendants also claimed the benefit of the Merchants' Shipping Act, and the statutes in force in the Province of Ontario, respecting the navigation of Canadian waters.\nThe case came on for hearing on the 5th and 6th of February, 1879, before his Honor the Judge of the Maritime Court and two assessors.\nAt the close of the plaintiff's case, the defendants submitted that the plaintiff had not proved\u2014\n1. That the Picton was to blame. 2. That the Belle was not to blame.\nThat the case came within Article fourteen of 31 Vic., ch. 58, and the Belle, not having got out of the way of the Picton, must be deemed to be in default, unless she showed circumstances justifying a departure from the rules, which the evidence did not disclose, and therefore that the plaintiff could not recover.\nThese objections were overruled.\nAt the close of the whole case, the assessors reported:\n1. That the stern of the Belle, being lapped over the bow of the Picton, it was proper that the Belle should leave first.\n2. That the Belle left the dock in the tow of the tug to wind her, and prudence required the Picton to remain until the Belle was in a position to proceed down the piers.\n3. That the apparent mismanagement on the part of the Belle in parting her towline on the stern, did not appear to them to be a direct cause of the disaster, and the Belle was not to blame.\n4. That they considered the direct cause of the disaster was the Picton hauling aboard her stern line, while proceeding in the direction of the Belle, and not taking due precaution to reverse her engine before the vessels came into collision, seeing that there was a space of from thirty to fifty feet between the stern of the Picton and the east pier.\nThe learned judge's views coincided with those of the assessors, and he gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, referring it to the Registrar to take an account of the damage and reserving further directions and costs.\nFrom this judgment the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Maclennan, Q.C., for appellant:\nThe first point I will raise is, whether the constitution of the Maritime Court was illegal and ultra vires of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada. This is a Dominion Court established to execute Dominion laws in the Province of Ontario. If the power exists under subjection 2 of section 91, which gives the Dominion Parliament power to legislate about trade and commerce, then it would be competent for the Dominion to create a court which would have exclusive jurisdiction over subject matters, which are now tried by our provincial courts. If it is a Dominion Court, its jurisdiction should not be limited to one province.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014If there is one subject-matter over which the Dominion parliament has legislative authority, it is this. There is nothing to prevent the parliament from limiting the territorial jurisdiction of a Dominion Court. You might as well contend that the Exchequer Court Act is ultra vires, because some parts are only applicable to one province. I do not think this is an arguable point.]\nThe learned counsel then argued on the facts, that the Maritime Court should have found that the Southern Belle was not free from blame, and that, at most, the damages should be divided.\nThe Southern Belle having violated Art. 14 of the Rules of Navigation, and the plaintiff having failed to show circumstances justifying a deviation from Art. 14, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any damages, even though the Picton should be also considered to blame in respect to the collision. See 31 V., c. 58, s. 6; The Palestine[1]; The Arabian and the Alma[2]; The Ada[3].\nMr. John E. Rose for respondent:\nThe issues are two: Was the Picton to blame? the burthen of proof on that issue being on the Southern Belle. Was the Southern Belle to blame? the burthen of proof on that issue being on the Picton. The Oceano[4].\nThe appellants are wrong in their contention that the plaintiff must prove that the Belle was not to blame.\nIt appeared at the trial that the assessors, in addition to their nautical knowledge, had the advantage of a personal practical knowledge of the port, and a decree founded on their opinion on credibility of witnesses will not be reversed by a court of appeal unassisted by nautical asssessors. The Sisters[5].\nRITCHIE, C. J.:\u2014\nI think the evidence fully justifies the conclusion at which the assessors and the learned judge of the court below arrived, and that there is no ground whatever for disturbing the decision of the court. I think the evidence satisfactorily establishes, in view of the relative positions of the Southern Belle and the Picton, and of the Southern Belle having been the first to leave the wharf, as the assessors found it was proper she should do, placed as she was with her stern overlapping the bow of the Picton, that the Picton should not have started so soon as she did, but should have waited a few minutes, the very trifling length of time necessary to have enabled the Southern Belle to get clear off, and also that the stern line of the Picton should not have been let go as it was by orders from the Picton, and that the engines should have been reversed before the collision took place, as the evidence shows might have been done in the space between the stern of the Picton and the piers.\nThe Picton, being to blame in these particulars, in my opinion, caused the collision, and I cannot discover from the evidence that the Southern Belle in any way, by any misconduct or negligence on her part, contributed to the accident, and consequently the Picton cannot escape the consequences of her misconduct.\nHad the evidence, in our opinion, raised doubt on all or any of these points, it would not have been proper under the authorities for this court to have interfered with the finding of the court.\nAs this is the first case of the kind that has been before us, it may be as well to cite some authorities as to the duty of an appellate court in dealing with cases of this description.\nIn Moore v. Clucas[6], on the counsel remarking: \"The case of Baboo Ulruck Sing v. Beny Persad[7], relied upon by the appellant, is a strong authority in our favor, as it shows this court will not reverse a finding of the court below upon a pure question of fact,\" Mr. Baron Parke says:\nThe appellant must show that the judgment is wrong. We never reverse unless we are satisfied that the judgment is clearly wrong. Khoorshed-jee Manik-jee v. Mehrwan-jee Khoorshed-jee[8]. In Bland v. Ross (the \"Julia\")[9], the Privy Council held that where a disputed fact, involving nautical questions, is raised by an appeal from the Admiralty Court, as in the case of a collision, the Privy Council would not reverse the decree appealed from, unless conclusively satisfied that the decree is wrong, though the Court may entertain doubts as to the finding of the Admiralty Court; and at pages 235, 236 and 237 the reasons for this rule are given at length, in order, as the court say,\nThat the vexation and expense of hopeless appeals may, as far as possible, be avoided, by parties being made aware of the difficulties which the appellants must have to encounter when the merits depend upon the differing opinions of nautical men.\nAnd in the case of the \"Araxes\" and the \"Black Prince\"[10], the principles laid down in the case of the \"Julia\" were confirmed in these words;\nIn order to reverse the judgment we must be satisfied it is founded on some mistake either on the law or the facts of the case. It is useless to repeat the observations which we made in the case of the \"Julia.\"\nIn Dean v. Mark, the \"Constitution\"[11], the Court says:\nWe laid down in the case of the \"Julia\"[12], in the year 1861, the rules by which we must be guided.\nAnd again in the case of the \"Alice\"[13], the law laid down in the case of the \"Julia\" is followed in these words:\nBut, in the opinion of their Lordships, the principal point upon which we should rest our decision is this, that following the doctrine laid down in the case of the \"Julia,\" we should be most unwilling to come to a conclusion different from that of the Judge of the Court below merely upon a balance of testimony.\nSee also Gray v. Turnbull[14] in which Lord Chelmsford says: If there is to be an appeal on questions of fact (and I regret that there should be such) I think that this principle should be firmly adhered to, namely, that we must call upon the party appealing to show us irresistibly that the opinion of the Judges on the question of fact was not only wrong, but entirely erroneous.\nIf this principle is so uniformly acted on in the Privy Council, where they have the benefit of the assistance which they receive from the able marine officers who are ordered to attend the Privy Council in cases of this description, how much more is it the duty of this court to be in like manner governed where we have no such assistance.\nAs to the constitutional question which has been suggested in reference to the court: the 40 Vic., ch. 21, which establishes a Court of Maritime Jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario, and gives to all persons the like rights and remedies in all matters (including cases of contract and tort, and proceedings in rem and in personam) arising out of or connected with navigation, shipping, trade or commerce on any river &c., of which the whole or part is in the Province of Ontario, as such persons would have in any existing British Vice-Admiralty Court, if the process of such court extended to the said Province, the British North America Act, sec. 91, gives to the Dominion parliament the exclusive legislative authority over these several subjects, and also power to establish courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada. I have not heard a word that in my opinion casts the slightest doubt on the validity of this act.\nSTRONG and FOURNIER, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.\nThe appeal in this case is from a decree of the Maritime Court of Ontario, in a case brought by the respondent to recover damages, alleged to have been caused by a collision of the steamer Southern Belle, of which he was owner, with the steamer Picton, by proceedings in rem against the last mentioned steamer, but in which the appellants intervened as owners.\nBy the decree the fact of the collision is found, and the damage to the Southern Belle ascertained. It is founded on the report of two assessors, according to which the Picton was found in fault and the Southern Belle not in fault, and that to the improper management of the Picton the collision and consequent damage to the Southern Belle was due. The learned judge confirmed the report and the court decreed \"that the appellants were liable to the respondent for all damages which he sustained by reason of the collision,\" with an order for reference to the registrar to inquire and state the amount of the damages. On the part of the appellants it is contended that \"the judge did not exercise his own judgment upon the law and the facts; but decided the case wholly upon the opinion of the assessors.\" I cannot agree with that contention. The evidence was before him, and we are, I think, bound to conclude that he fully considered it. When the report of the assessors was made it had to be disposed of\u2014in one of two ways\u2014either by adopting or rejecting it. To decide, he had to consider the evidence, and the decree is evidence that he concurred in the views of the assessors. It cannot, I think, be fairly contended that he did not exercise his own judgment. The objection, therefore, in that form cannot be successfully taken.\nThe real question is: does the evidence sufficiently sustain the report and decree? The former was made by two gentlemen who, from the fact of their selection alone, in the absence of anything to the contrary, we may conclude to have been competent to consider and decide upon the nautical questions involved, and to occupy such a position as to efficiency as would entitle their report to respect and consideration. I think that to reject their report, confirmed, as I view it, by the court, we must be fully convinced the weight of evidence was largely the other way, or that the proved facts laid no foundation in law for a claim to recover damages.\nI have read and considered the evidence and so far from being of the opinion that the report and decree are against the weight of evidence I think the opposite, and that it fully justifies both. That the Picton had any right to cast off, and, instead of following the course taken in turning by the Southern Belle, run straight for her when only a few yards distant, was justified in doing so, is a conclusion that, I think, few disinterested persons would arrive at. The principle of law in such cases is, that even when one party has got into a wrong position, and that another using ordinary care can avoid a collision, but does not use that ordinary care, he is answerable for damages consequent on his negligent conduct. I do not consider, however, that the Southern Belle was negligently or illegally in the position she occupied at the time of the collision. She had started on her voyage in a manner she had the legal right to do, and it was the duty of the Picton to have waited till she could do the same thing without the necessity (which is set up here as a defence) of running into the steamer ahead of her, or to have followed her course when turning.\nI have considered the objection to the jurisdiction, but have been unable to discover any reason to doubt that the act establishing the court was intra vires.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed and a judgment entered to sustain the decree with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe asssesors who sat in this case with the learned Judge of the Maritime Court have, in their finding, expressed their opinion upon the facts involved in this enquiry to be: That the Southern Belle having left her dock in tow of a tug to wind her out, the Picton should have remained at the dock where she was until the Belle was in a position to proceed down the piers, and that the direct cause of the disaster was, the Picton hauling aboard her stern line while proceeding in the direction of the Southern Belle, and not taking due precaution to reverse the engine before the vessels came into collision, seeing there was a space of from 30 to 50 feet from the stern of the Picton and the east pier.\nIn this finding the learned Judge of the Maritime Court has entirely concurred. Sitting as a Court of Appeal, we should be satisfied beyond all doubt of the incorrectness of this finding before we should reverse it. But, in view of the circumstances of the case, I can not say that I see anything in the evidence to justify a rational doubt as to the correctness of the finding. It can scarcely, I think, have been seriously expected that reasonable men should have adopted the view urged by the defendants, namely, that it was not the Picton which ran stem on to the midships of the Belle, but the Belle which had come down broadside on to the stem of the Picton; neither do the circumstances of the case warrant (as was contended for by the defendants) the application of the 14th article of sec. 2 of 31st Vic., c. 58. No one can, I think, read the evidence without perceiving that the object of the captain of the Picton was to get out of the harbor ahead of the Belle, although the latter had started first, and that to attain this object he swung round on the stern of the Picton at the dock where she was, instead of following, as he could without any danger, the course taken by the Belle; and the evidence leads, I think, fairly to the conclusion, that, failing to effect his object as he had designed, whether from the breaking of his swing rope, or for some other cause, he most recklessly and negligently gave the order to advance instead of to back, to which cause, I think, most justly the collision is to be attributed. It was contended also that if the Belle had gone ahead with her engines when she saw the Picton coming on to her she might have avoided the collision, and that by not doing so she was herself partly to blame; but the evidence fails to satisfy my mind that by going ahead at that critical moment she could have avoided the collision. Some of the evidence upon that point is to the effect, that if she had gone ahead (if she could have done so, being then in tow), the consequence would have been that the collision would have occurred in a manner which would have occasioned greater damage to her. However, the giving a wrong order, or the omission to give one by the execution of which the collision might have been avoided, by a person in the excitement of impending and imminent peril, cannot be imputed by the person who brings the other into such peril for the purpose of shifting a portion of the blame of the ensuing collision from the party who had brought the other into the peril and of attributing to the party so injured a portion of the blame attending the injury, and this has recently been decided in England in two cases\u2014the \"Bywell Castle\"[15] and the \"Khedive\"[16].\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mowat, Maclennan & Downey.\nSolicitors for respondent: Rose, McDonald, Merritt & Blackstock.\n[1] 13 W.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne. J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nThe appellants issued a marine policy of insurance at Toronto, dated the 28th November, 1875, insuring, in favor of the respondent, $3,000 upon a cargo of wood-goods laden on board of the barque Emigrant, on age from Quebec to Greenock. The policy contained the following :\"J. C., as well in his own name as for and in the name and names of all and every other person or persons to whom the same doth, may, or shall appertain, in part or in all, doth make insurance, and cause three thousand dollars to be insured lost or rot lost at and from. Quebec to Greenock, vessel to go out in tow.\" The vessel was towed from her loading berth in the harbour into the middle of the stream near Indian Gove which forms part of the harbour of Quebec, and was abandoned with cargo by reason of the ice four days after leaving the harbour and before reaching the Traverse. On an action upon the policy it was :\nHeld, (Fournier and Henry J. J., dissenting,) that the words \"from Quebec to Greenock, vessel to go out in tow,\" meant that she was to go out in tow from the limits of the harbour of Quebec on said voyage, and the towing from the loading berth to another part of the harbour was not a compliance with the warranty.\nPer Ritchie, C. J, : The question in this case was not. if the vessel had gone out in tow how far she should have been towed in order to comply with the warranty the determination of this latter question being dependent on several considerations such as the lateness of the season the direction and force of the wind, and the state of the weather, and possibly the usage and custom of the port of Quebec if any existed in relation thereto\nPer Gwynne, J. : The evidence established the existence of a usage to tow down the river as far as might be deemed necessary, having regard to the state of the wind and weather sometimes beyond the Traverse, but ordinarily, at the date of the departure of the plaintiff's vessel, at least as far as the Traverse.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, (appeal side), maintaining the respondent's action on a marine policy against the appellant.\nThe declaration of the respondent alleged :\nThat the appellants issued a marine policy of insurance at Toronto, dated the 28th November 1871 insuring, in favor of the respondent, $3,000 upon a cargo of wood-goods laden on board of the barque Emigrant, on a voyage from Quebec to Greenock; that the vessel while covered by the policy, was lost in the St. Lawrence, with her cargo; and that the respondent, who had fulfilled all the conditions of the policy had sustained loss over and above the amount insured.\nThe defendants pleaded that the policy contained a warranty that the vessel should \" go out in tow \" which meant, according to the usage at that season of the year, that the Emigrant was to proceed down the river with the aid of steam power at least as far as the foot of the Traverse; and that the vessel had not gone out in tow.\nThe plaintiff at the trial tendered evidence of a conversation between him and the defendants' local agent at Quebec, previously to the issuing of the policy, as to the meaning to be put on the words v vessel to go out in tow,'' but this was rejected by the Judge presiding at equate,\nThe Superior Court confirmed that ruling, and the plaintiff's action was dismissed upon the merits.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment of the Superior Court; three of the honorable Judges being in favor of the plaintiff, and two in favor of the defendants.\nThe loss of the plaintiff not being disputed, the question upon the whole case is whether or not the vessel did go out in tow, and whether a legal liability for the loss has attached to the defendants upon a proper construction of the words v vessel to \u00b0x) out in tow.\"\nThe evidence as to the usage is reviewed at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nMr. Irvine Q. C. for appellants :\nThe whole question in this case turns on the construction to be put on the words \"to go out in tow.\" The rule of law in matters of this kind is that words ambiguous in a contract may be interpreted by usage.\nIt can hardly be asserted that the engagement to tow, although expressed in short and somewhat vague terms did not present to the minds of both parties to the contract an act of a continuous nature, materially affecting the risk. The peculiar perils of the St. Law-renice at the end of the month of November and the absence of sea room between Quebec and the foot of the Traverse, were elements of danger against which no prudent insurer would fail to protect himself; and if the Court has before it in evidence the matters of fact which indicate the risk which the appellants were 1 unwilling to assume, the means are afforded, in accordance with well known rules of evidence, of affixing to the words used their true meaning. The introduction of parol evidence, to explain those terms, was not opposed and there is little or no contradiction as to the main facts which the parties have thought fit to present.\nMy contention is that the evidence is conclusive to prove that the custom was, at that season of the year, to tow all vessels to the foot of the Traverse. But the appellants do not rely upon the meaning given by particular witnesses to the words so much as upon the fact, well known to all persons connected with shipping at Quebec, that, as a general rule, all vessels leaving late in the fall are towed to the foot of the Traverse as the minimum distance. It is a matter of no consequence whether or not this amounted to a \"usage of trade, of universal notoriety; \"it is sufficient, if it was so general, as to serve as a basis of interpretation when the applicant for insurance stated that he intended \"l towing out.\"\nThe parties must have had an intention, and the question is, have they expressed themselves sufficiently unambiguously? The mere towing in to the stream would be of no avail and the fact that the vessel was towed from her loading berth into the stream within the harbor of Quebec had nothing whatever to do with the question of insurance; and I contend that, in view of the circumstances and the custom it is clear the intention of the parties was that the vessel was to be towed out of the harbor The learned counsel cited Greenleaf on evidence ([1]) Taylor on evidence ([2]) \u00c1rnould on Marine Insurance ([3]) Maude & Pollock on the law of Merchant Shipping ([4]).\nMr. Fitzpatrick for respondent :\nThe turning point in this case is this: Did. the vessel go out in tow?\nNow the phrase \"vessel to go out in tow \" is perfectly ambiguous and indefinite as to the distance of such towage, and being so in case of doubt should be interpreted against the insurers, who made use of it and omitted to express themselves in words the meaning of which would be clear.\nThey had no right to make a stipulation in their own favor in words of questionable import, when the matter could easily have been placed beyond a doubt by a mention of the point in the river to which it was intended the ship should be towed. The only expressed idea is that the ship was to go out in tow and that she did go out in tow, is beyond all doubt. But the appellants, however, negative this by saying that according to the usage of the port of Quebec, this phrase imports that the vessel should be towed at least as far as the 'Traverse.\n[The learned counsel then referred to the evidence and contended that in cases where a vessel is towed out there is no custom or universal understood usage amongst merchants whatever in the port to tow to any particular point, and none was proven to exist.]\nThe questions put to the witnesses only tend to elicit opinions and not the actual practice of trade which alone can establish a usage.\nThe words used are the insurers own words and they must be strictly construed against them. The vessel went out in tow from her loading berth and the condition of the policy lists been complied with. There is not a word in the policy fixing the distance, and in the absence of proof of a general usage, the respondent is entitled to succeed.\nMr. Irvine, Q. C., in. reply.\nRITCHIE, C. J. :\u2014\nThe case states that the declaration of the plaintiff below (respondent) alleged that the appellants issued a marine policy of insurance dated the 28th November, 1871 in his favor for $3,000 upon a cargo of wooden goods laden on board the barque Emigrant, on a voyage from Quebec to Greenock, and alleged that the vessel, while covered by the policy was lost in the St. Lawrence with her cargo, and that respondent had fulfiled all the conditions of the policy and had sustained loss over and above the amount insured. That the defendants pleaded that the policy contained a warranty that the vessel should ' go out in tow,' which meant according to the usage, at that season of the year, that the Emigrant was to proceed down the river with the aid of steam power as far as the foot of the Traverse; and that the vessel had not gone out in tow.\nThe circumstances of this case as will be seen I think, render it wholly unnecessary to determine the distance the assured would be bound to tow but simply whether the vessel did or did not \"go out in tow.\"\nThe judgment of the Superior Court was in favor of the defendants which judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench, three of the learned judges of that court being in favor of the plaintiff and two in favor of the defendants. The case states : \" The loss of the plaintiff not being disputed, the question upon the whole case is whether or not the vessel did 'go out in tow,' and whether the legal liability for the loss has attached to the defendantrs upon a proper construction of the words ' vessel to go out in The vessel did not go out of the harbour or port of Quebec in tow, and she was abandoned with cargo by reason of the ice four days after leaving the harbour and before reaching the Traverse.\nA good deal of evidence was given as to the custom of the port of Quebec in reference to the distance vessels were usually towed at the season of the year this vessel left; but under the circumstances, and in the view I take of this case, I think such evidence wholly unimportant, the only question being, as I have said, in the words of the case \"whether or not the vessel did go out in tow? \" and not if she had gone out in tow how far she should have been towed in order to comply with the warranty, the determination of this latter question being dependent, in my opinion, on several considerations such as the lateness of the season the direction and force of the wind and the state of the weather and possibly the usage and custom of the port of Qu\u00e9bec, if any existed in relation thereto.\nShould it become necessary on any future occasion to decide this question the very valuable and forcible observations of Mr. Justice Casault in his judgment on the point, and especially the reasons he assigns why a definite length of towage could not reasonably be fixed in a policy, will, in my opinion, be worthy of the greatest consideration by whomsoever the duty of discussing and determining the matter may be cast; as at present advised they commend themselves to my mind with great force.\nI think the warranty had reference to the voyage and not to the position of the vessel in the harbour that the primary meaning of the words \" to go out in tow\" is to go out from some limits and that the words of the policy \" from Quebec to Greenock, vessel to go out in tow,\" meant that she was to go out in tow from the limits of the port or harbour of Quebec on said voyage which she clearly did not do.\nThe captain in his protest says they got the pilot on board at 2 o'clock p.m (25th November), and proceeded in tow of a steamer from the loading berth to abreast of the town where they came to anchor, the wind being contrary, the people being employed clearing up the decks and filling the water casks. On the 26th, at 7 a. m., they hove short, but the wind being light and variable from south-east to eastward, they remained at anchor during the day. The 27th commenced with light variable winds and snow; the wind increasing at 9 o'clock a.m. they got under way, and set all possible sail and proceeded down the river under the pilot's directions; that she subsequently got into the ice and on the 30th November was abandoned.\nThe pilot who took the vessel down the river says :\u2014\nThe Emigrant was lying at Hall's booms when I went on board. She was taken out from the booms by a steam tug. She had the same crew that she came into port with. None of her crew left her She was moved out from the booms by one of the little harbour tugs that move ships out into the harbour. She was moved by the tug as far as Indian Cove which was an hour and a half or two hours' work. There was a light easterly wind, and we cast anchor. The tug went back again, because with that tug we could not go any further; it was no use. That same evening the master went ashore to see if he could get a good steamer.\nIt was shown on the trial and admitted on the argument that the place where the vessel anchored and remained till the 27th November was in the harbour of Quebec some four or five miles from its limit. It is, to my mind, very clear from this testimony that the vessel was towed from her loading berth to another part of the harbour where she came to anchor preparatory to proceeding on her voyage, and that she did not leave her loading berth with the intention then and there of commencing and continuing her voyage with-out further delay, but merely changed her position in the harbour with the intention of remaining in the port till everything was ready to enable her to go to sea, that is until her water casks were filled and the captain had obtained, what he evidently thought could begot, a suitable steamer to tow him out. The captain says after she came to anchor in the harbour the men were employed filling the water casks and it is clear without water the vessel could not have been in a seaworthy condition to proceed on her voyage, and the captain left the vessel and in the words of the pilot \" went ashore to see if he could get a good steamer,\" that is, to get just what, in my opinion, the warranty in the policy required him to have viz. : a steamer fit and competent to tow the vessel from the port and harbour of Quebec out on her voyage to Greenock, the harbour tug which had taken the vessel from her loading berth to another position in the harbour not being of sufficient capacity or ability to tow him out on his voyage, as the pilot says :\u2014\" the captain went back again, because with that tug we could not go any further, it was no use.\"\nThe unreasonableness of the construction contended for, that the towing out was only intended to be from the loading berth into the stream in the harbour because of the uselessness of such a warranty to the assurer, is so forcibly pointed out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Casault, and with which I entirely agree, that further observations are not required from me.\nAs therefore, in my opinion, the vessel had never got under way with the bona fide intention of prosecuting her voyage at once and without any further delay until the 27th Nov when she sailed out of the harbour and port of Quebec, with the then intent of commencing and prosecuting her said voyage, and as she did not then go out in tow there was a clear breach of the warranty, and the plaintiff cannot recover. In other words, the towing from the loading berth to another part of the harbour was not a compliance with either the letter or the spirit of the warranty. I think the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG, J., was of opinion that the judgment of the Court below should be reversed and read a written judgment stating his reasons for that conclusion:\nFOURNIER, J., was of opinion that the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.\nHENRY, J. :\u2014\nThis is an action on a policy of insurance, and the respondent's right to recover is only contested on one point. The policy makes insurance to the extent of $3,000 on wooden goods on board the barque Emigrant, which sailed from Quebec to Greenock on the 24th November 1871, \"the vessel to go out in tow.\" She took in her cargo and was towed out from her loading berth as far as Indian Gove. From that point she proceeded under sail but was met by easterly storms and drift ice which effectually barred her further passage down the river, and she was subsequently in a few days lost. The loss of the respondent is admitted, and the question upon the case presented arises upon the issue raised by the appellants' plea, that the vessel did not go out in tow within the terms of the contract as evidenced by the requirement of the policy in the words before stated. This defence does not arise upon any representation written or verbal of the respondent, nor need the words in question, although technically characterized as a warranty, be so construed We have no representation made by him, or any contract signed by him, and technical rules of construction of representations or warranties are not strictly applicable. In both they are in doubtful cases construed against the parties whose language is used. Their insertion in the policy operates simply, in my view, as a condition imposed by it the failure to perform which would render it voidable. Its embodiment in the policy is no evidence that the res-pondent previous to its issue made any representation, promise or warranty whatever; but his acceptance of the policy amounts to an agreement on his part, that-unless the condition be fulfilled the policy may be held void and that his right to recover shall be contingent on the performance of the prescribed condition. There are cases where a transfer of the possession of property takes place, and where a party otherwise derives a benefit or advantage from the contract, and a condition imposed by the agreement is held to be a warranty, but that feature is absent from the present case, for the party has no insurance or other benefit, except that arising from the policy with the condition annexed to it. Although I have thought it proper to distinguish as I have done, I am not the less ready to say that in the shape of a condition precedent it is binding upon the respondent to the extent it legally goes. Taking then, the words in question as a condition precedent in the way I have stated, we must first ascertain their extent and meaning, and, in doing so, consider how the parties to be affected by them must be concluded to have used and understood them if from their vagueness, that is possible. It is not sufficient to arrive at a conclusion only as to how the insurer used them, as, the condition forming as it does a substantial part of the contract we must also see that the insured understood them in the same way. It cannot be a contract without the express or implied agreement of both parties to it.\nThe expression \" to go out in tow\" is, per se, unintelligible, and, in this case, the onus of proving its meaning and application is upon the appellants. Failure on their part by legal evidence to establish an agreement, the breach of which is sufficient to avoid the contract must ensure to the success of the respondent.\nParol evidence is not admissible to vary, control, or contradict a written agreement; but is admitted, as in other cases of mercantile instruments, to explain the language of a policy according to the known usage of trade. Usages of trade are local as well as general, and are known, or presumed to be known, in any locality, to or by every one engaged in any particular trade or business to which they are applicable. So, particular terms, or provisions employed or made, have authoritative and prescribed application, and, when used in contracts, are as well understood as if specially recited or explained. That is why evidence of them is admitted. The well known and fully accepted technical meaning of such terms is properly assumed to have been in the minds of contracting parties when using them and their presence in a contract manifests their intentions as fully as if stated at length, embracing, as it does, the principle that that is certain which can legitimately be made certain. The appellants' plea is that \" ' the vessel to go out in tow ' meant, according to the usage in the port of Quebec, that the said vessel should be towed by a tug from Quebec to some point in the River St. Lawrence below the Traverse.\" Has he proved that? I have read and studied the evidence he adduced in the trial, and so far from proving any usage of trade, it has shown that no such usage existed. The great majority of his witnesses distinctly say there was no such usage of trade. it appears that late in the season it was usual for vessels, if a fair wind did not prevail, to use a tug, sometimes below the Traverse (about 60 miles), other times to the Brandy Pots (about 100 miles), and again sometimes to Bio (about 15) miles; but the witnesses of the appellants, as well as those of the respondent, say there was no usage of trade applicable, or, indeed, any at all, on the subject of towing. After so stating, they were, as I think, very improperly permitted to give each his own interpretation of the words used. Some of them said the term \" to tow out\" meant below the Traverse another \"as far as the Traverse Brandy Pots or Bic.\" The issue was not dependent on the ideas of those witnesses as to the application of the words, and the various views given even by the appellants' own witnesses\u2019 show how absurd it was to have admitted such evidence at all. The condition is not to be affected by the mere opinions of witnesses as to its legal effect. The evidence must be sufficient to enable us to draw a necessary and irresistible conclusion as to the certainty of what was meant by the condition, arriving at it without any mere speculations as to the understanding of the parties to the contract, but on proof of the existence of a custom or usage. Tayor in his work on evidence ([5]) referring to the subject of customs and usages of trade, says :\nBut in all these cases it is the fact of a general usage or practice prevailing in the particular trade or business, and not the mere judgment and opinion of the witnesses, which is admissible in evidence, and that is without doubt the rule and law.\nAnd at page 1024 says :\u2014\nBefore quitting this subject, it may be observed that much injustice is frequently occasioned by the daily habit of admitting evidence of usage, which though ostensibly received for the purpose of explaining a written contract or other instrument, has too often the effect of putting a construction upon it which was never contemplated by the parties themselves, and which is at variance with their real intentions. In this view some of the highest legal authorities, both in England and America, concur.\nIf then experience has shown injustice resulting from permitting evidence even of known custom and usage to prevail in the construction of written documents, how much greater injustice might be fairly expected to result in cases where no such custom or usage existed, but decisions were to follow, as in this case, the mere opinion of witnesses as to the meaning of the condition set up by the appellants.\nThe appellants have undertaken in their plea to give satisfactory evidence of a custom or usage, but they have signally failed to do so. Their defence does not rest upon the mere opinions of witnesses, but upon evidence of a generally adopted and well recognized usage of trade.\nThe doctrine said down by Tindal, C. J., in Lewis v. Marshall ([6]), as to the proof necessary in such cases entirely sustains the position I have taken :\nIn order therefore to vary the ordinary meaning of such plain words and to make them comprise passengers and passage money as well as goods we think the evidence ought to have been clear, cogent and irresistible. Whereas at the trial, although two witnesses spoke Of the usual course and practice of the trade, the third spoke of his own judgment only: no instance of such construction is stated by any of the witnesses within his own knowledge. The fair inference to be drawn from their testimony at the trial appears to us to be\u2014that it is customary, in calculating the earnings of a ship, or making up the account of the earnings, to include money paid for steerage passengers, but there is no general usage that in a contract of this description such meaning should prevail.\nIt will be observed that, although two witnesses s spoke of the usual course and practice of the trade,\" it was considered insufficient. In this case all the witnesses show there was no such usage at all.\nWe must in this case construe the word \" out \" from the position of the vessel at the time and from a consideration of the maritime features of the voyage she had to perform. If she were at anchor or at a wharf in a harbor within a few miles of the open sea, we would necessarily assume it to mean outside of that harbor because there would be but one \"out\" thet could have been intended, but \" out \" in reference to the passage of a vessel from her loading berth at Quebec from which vessels are usually towed to the main part of the St. Lawrence River, and thence down it, requires proof as to the meaning of the term, if anything more than towing out from the wharf into the stream is meant. One party using it might mean, as one of the appellants witnesses stated, only from the loading berth into the stream. \"He says; \" many times even in that season,\" referring to the last week in November, \" they only get towed out from their berth into the stream and if the wind is fair I do not see that they have any occasion to be towed further.\" What evidence have we then that either of the parties intended to prescribe for anything further? What evidence that even the insurer meant anything else? What twenty witnesses, or any number, might think the words meant cannot be used to, bring home to the minds of the contracting parties when the policy was issued a similar understanding and use of them. The respondent does not rest his defence of the charge of the breach of the condition as construed by those witnesses, but on their and other evidence to sustain the allegation that the policy should be voidable by satisfactory proof of the existence of the usage of trade at Quebec.\nOne of the appellants' witnesses, Alexander Frazer, in his direct evidence, when asked about a \" general usage as to the towing of vessels in the latter part of Nov-ember,\" says :\nI do not know that there is any special distance regulated by usage. It is entirely a matter of bargain between the parties The towage extends any distance you please.\nHere, then, is a witness of the appellants who says he has \"been doing business in Quebec as a marine insurance agent for upwards of twenty years, and covered a great many risks via the St. Lawrence,\" and he never heard of any such usage of trade, and I ask who could have been placed in a more favorable position to have heard of and known it, had any such existed Another witness (also an insurance agent for over 25 years) says: \"The terms are ambiguous, and the ambiguity consists in no distance being mentioned;\" and further as to policies : \" There is generally a point mentioned to \"which the vessel should be towed. In the absence of any distance being mentioned, I would understand that the vessel should be towed clear of the wharf. I should understand the vessel was to be hauled out from her loading berth by a tug.\" Is the testimony of those two witnesses to prevail, or that of others who think the words of the condition would necessitate a towing as far, at least, as the Traverse? Or, in the uncertainty, what can we say was intended by the parties to the policy? Does it not, with such evidence, amount to the wildest speculation to declare in favor of such a position as that contended for by the appellants? Or, even if we could speculate satisfactorily do not the rules of evidence and for the construction of written documents interpose wise and salutary bars against such a course? What is there in the whole evidence to show the insured intended to be bound to tow beyond the towing into the stream, or, if further, which of the other distances did the insurer mean? The latter desires by his plea to be governed by an alleged general usage of the port, which is proved not to exist. It is not the province of a court to make issues for parties, but to determine their rights under those submitted. Who can say, then, that the only issue tendered by defendant should not on the evidence, entirely fail? But the former is not to be deprived of his insurance for which he paid in the absence of clear proof that it is not in accordance with his agreement. The condition, in the bald state it appeals, and the evidence produced, launch us upon a broad sea of doubtful and difficult speculation through the want of the necessary proper direction and reference; and we are left to find safety from the fogs and mist which the evidence has created by recourse to the only legitimate means open to us, and that is, to steer by rules wisely adopted for such cases. The abnormal atmosphere should never have been permitted to encompass or perplex us, but, having done so, we must shake off all improper influences and seek an atmosphere where legal lights and provisions will enable us to proceed more securely and satisfactorily.\nIn what I have already said is included the declaration that the greater portion of the evidence herein, besides having been improperly received, is wholly immaterial, as inapplicable to the issue; but if even we were permitted to consider it, we would not be justified in concluding that the weight of it is with the appellants. Taking it, as given, for both parties, the weight of it is wholly with the respondent. The insurer may, for argument's sake, he assumed to have meant that the towing \" out \" should be at least as far as the \" Traverse; \" but to bind the insured we must have evidence that he so understood it, for he may have considered it but as a provision for towing into the stream for that would in the ordinary construction of the words be sufficient\u2014and upon that understanding paid the premium and accepted the policy. The onus is therefore on the appellant to prove that the respondent must have understood the condition as requiring a towage at least as far as the \"Traverse\" The plea is not that the words \" to go out\" in tow mean a reasonable distance. If it were, we should consider what was a reasonable distance all things considered, but, not being so, the question submitted does not permit us to consider that matter as the appellants have not asked us to consider it. We are asked what under such an issue would be legitimate hut not otherwise to consider the lateness of the season and the danger, not only of delay and the consequent impracticability of the voyage during the season but the additional risk to insurers. There is, however, nothing in the evidence to show the existence of any custom or usage of trade applicable at all, and therefore no more so in November than in June. It is urged in favor of the appellants' contention that higher premiums are demanded during the late season, but as far as the evidence enlightens us we are justified in the conclusion that in this case the higher rate applicable was paid. It was received by the appellants, and the policy having been issued upon the condition in question, we are not justified, in construing it, to consider the nature or extent of the risk otherwise covered by it or to give to words a construction they cannot otherwise bear. In the absence of any usage of trade specially applicable to the late season, as distinguished from the earlier and finer one the words in question cannot have any application in November, that they would not have in June or July. We are not only not bound but prohibited from entering into any consideration of what might or might not possibly have been in the mind of the appellants when issuing the policy, but must be guided solely by the terms they have employed in it, and if they meant \" out \" to be as far as the Traverse they were bound to say so in definite terms to the respondent, and not leave him trusting for his insurance in case of loss to a contingency to arise from the conflicting speculative opinions or views either of witnesses, jurors, or judges, as to the meaning of the condition he attaches.\nLord St. Leonards, in one of his judgments, says : A policy ought to be so framed that he who runs may read. It ought tobe framed with such deliberate care that no form of expression by which, on the one hand, the party assured can be caught, or by which, on the other, the company can be cheated, shall be found upon the face of it. Nothing ought to be wanting in it, the absence of which may lead to such results. When you consider that such contracts as this are entered into with men in humble conditions of life, who can but ill understand them, it is clear that they ought not to be framed in a manner to perplex the judgments of the first judges in the land and to lead to such serious differences of opinion amongst them.\nIn Fitton v. Accidental Death Insurance Co. ([7]) Willes, J., says :\nIt is extremely important, with reference to insurance, that there should be a tendency rather to hold for the assured than the company, where any ambiguity arises on the face of the policy.\nThe appellants in this case have inserted a condition in the most ambiguous terms. They, having put their own construction upon it in their plea, have estopped themselves from urging any other, but they have signally failed to sustain it by legal evidence.\nTo show under the evidence how ineffectual and uncertain the condition is it is not amiss to make a further reference or two to its terms. It has been stated by some of the witnesses that it is sometimes considered necessary that a \" tow out \" should extend, not only to the Traverse, but to the Brandy Pots, and even as far as Bic. With the wind ahead, independently of the terms of any insurance policy, it would, no doubt, to hasten the voyage and lessen the risk be often advisable to tow beyond the Traverse, or the Brandy Pots, or sometimes as far as Bic, or further, even; but the evidence clearly shows the course a straight one, and that with a leading wind no towing at all is absolutely necessary. There are no crooked channels to pass, and therefore in the ordinary state of things no absolute necessity for towing. Suppose this vessel went altogether under sail from her place in the stream, got safely and expeditiously to the ocean and was subsequently lost on her voyage, it would seem hard that the insurer should have no recourse under his policy; but if the appellants contention is right he would have to suffer the loss\u2014for the policy would be avoided in that case as in the present circumstances. Suppose, however, she had been towed so as to clear the Traverse, but the tug there left her and she, proceeding under sail, was lost before she reached the Brandy Pots, and to an action on the policy the insurer pleaded that she should according to general usage have been towed past the Brandy Pots, would not the evidence on this trial be wholly insufficient to sustain such a contention? Or why, if a good defence, as far as the \" Traverse,\" or the \" Brandy Pots,\" would it not in the absence of any controlling usage be as good as far as \" Bic,\" or why limit it even to the latter, for that is still the river St. Lawrence; and, in the case of adverse wind or weather, it might be advisable, to shorten the voyage and lessen the risk, that the towing should be extended much further? These are very proper considerations for owners and navigators of ships in balancing the advantages against the necessary additional risk incurred. The insurer, who takes, to the amount of a policy, the place of the owner in that respect, has, no doubt, the right to prescribe his own conditions, and in doing so directs the owner as the latter would his sailing master. The latter is answerable for disobedience of his owner's orders when explicitly given and if the master of this ship had received orders that the vessel should go out in tow merely without stating or limiting any point or distance, and that there existed no generally acknowledged usage of the port to fix the one or the other, the master might fairly assume the directions to be followed by a towing to the nearest usual point from his loading berth, here the voyage commenced. And, in case of loss or damage, if the owner sought legal redress, he would be very properly told that if he wished the towing to have extended further he should have given directions to that end m unmistakable and unambiguous language. For similar reasons a like ruling should appear in our decision in this case.\nThe language of such a condition should be in itself certain, or be governed and explained by some existing usage by reference to which it would become certain. How can we say that if terms such as pleaded had been distinctly stated, the respondent would have agreed to them or accepted the policy on them?\nAddison in his work on contracts says ([8]) :\nCustomary rights and incidents universally attaching to the subject-matter of the contract in the place and neighborhood where the contract was made, are impliedly annexed to the written language and terms of the contract, unless the custom is particularly and expressly excluded. And parol evidence thereof may consequently be brought in aid of the written instrument. The principle on which the evidence is admitted is. that the parties have set down in writing those only of the terms of the contract which were necessary to be determined in the particular case, leaving to implication and tacit understanding all those general and unvarying incidents, which a uniform usage would annex, and according to which they must be considered to contract, unless they expressly exclude them.\nAnd cites eight authorities to which it is unnecessary to refer.\nIn this doctrine is contained the rule of law by which we and parties interested are bound.\nThe appellants were bound under the plea to have shown those u unvarying incidents which a uniform usage would annex \" to the words of the condition and haying totally failed to do so, I think the appeal should be disallowed and the judgment of the Court below affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J. :\u2014\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be alloyed. The facts of the case have been fully gone into by the judgments of the other members of the court and I will not enter into useless repetitions. I fully concur in the opinion that the words v vessel to go out in tow \" in this policy constituted an engagement affecting the risk, Now it is not, and cannot be pretended, that the mere moving out of the vessel from her loading berth to any other place within the harbour was an act by which the risk was in any manner affected. I cannot bring my mind to believe that the insurance company inserted these words in the policy for the mere purpose of obliging Connolly to have the ship towed from her wharf into the stream and that Connolly can ever have been under the impression that he, by these words, merely warranted that the ship should be towed out a few hundred feet from her wharf or to any place within the harbour. I am of opinion to allow the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J. :\u2014\nI confess it appears to me that we have only to regard the nature and subject of the contract, and the season of the year when it was entered into to enable us to pronounce our judgment that it was not the intention of the \"parties to the contract that the condition contained in the policy, that the ship insured upon her intended voyage from Quebec to Greenock should \" go out in tow, \" should be satisfied by her being towed out from her berth at the quay or dock where she lay into the middle of the river. We can have no difficulty in saying that nothing short of her being towed out of the harbour of Quebec would be sufficient. If she had been towed out of the harbor, the question would have arisen whether towing her just out of the limits of the harbor and leaving her there would have satisfied the condition, but, as she was not towed even so far, there can be no doubt that the condition was \u2022 not fulfilled and that the defendants were entitled to judgment The defendants pleaded to the action on the policy that the words \" the vessel to go out in tow \" meant, and was a warranty that, according to the usage of trade in the port of Quebec the vessel should be towed by a tug from Quebec to some point on the river St. Lawrence below the Traverse and that the vessel did not go out in tow. The question involved in this issue was \u2014whether or not at the particular season of the year, namely the 25th Nov., the latest date at which risks are assumed at all there was a usage in the Port of Quebec that vessels going to sea should be towed out of the harbour and for some distanc\u00e9e down the river on their way? That question being answered in the affirmative, it is for the court to construe the contract, in the light of that usage, as one of the circumstances surrounding the contract The plaintiff in the court below, wholly, as it appears to me, misapprehended the issue. By the manner in which he interrogated his own, and cross-interrogated the defendants' witnesses it is apparent that his object was to establish that the words \" the vessel to go out in tow \" have acquired no special meaning in mercantile phraseology requiring a vessel to be towed to any particular point down the river; but whether they had or not was not the question; the sole and simple question was : at the particular season of the year when this policy was effected, was there any usage prevailing at Quebec that vessels going to sea should be towed down the river on their voyage? That there was such a usage was established, I must say, by what appears to me the most undoubted, and almost uncontradicted, evidence, and that the usage was to tow down as far as might be deemed necessary having regard to the state of the wind and weather, sometimes beyond the Traverse, but ordinarily at the date of the departure of the plaintiffs vessel at least as far as the Traverse\nI have no difficulty whatever upon the evidence in finding as a fact such to be the usage; and so finding, it follows, as a point of law that the condition subject to which the policy was granted was not fulfilled, and that the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the defendants should be affirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants\u2014Holt, Irvine & Pemberton.\nSolicitors for respondent\u2014Andrews, Caron & Andrews.\n[1] 1 Vol. S6C 277 & 282.\n[2] Sec. 1082, 1085.\n[3] 1 Vol. pp. 489, 493, 496, 502, 511.\n[4] 3 Ed. p. 397.\n[5] P. 1023.\n[6] 7 M. & G. 745.\n[7] 17C.B.N.

Stats. Ont\u201438 Vic. ch. 11, secs. 20, 22\u2014New trial.\nIn an action on a life policy tried before a judge and a jury, in accordance with the provisions of 37 Vic., ch. 7, sec. 32, Ont, the learned judge, in place of requiring the jury to render a general verdict, directed them to answer certain questions, and the jury having answered all the questions in favor of the plaintiff, the judge entered a verdict for the plaintiff. Upon a rule nisi to show cause why this verdict should not be set aside and a non\u2011suit or a verdict entered for defendants, pursuant to the Law Reform Act, or a new trial had between the parties, said verdict being contrary to law and evidence, and the finding virtually for the defendants, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench made the rule absolute to enter a verdict for the defendants. The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the court being equally divided, the appeal was dismissed.\nHeld 1. (Taschereau, J., dissenting), that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had no power to set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and direct a verdict to be entered for the defendants in direct opposition to the finding of the jury on a material issue.\n2. That the court below might have ordered a new trial upon the ground that the finding of the jury upon the questions submitted to them was against the weight of evidence, but they exercised their discretion in declining to act, or in not acting, on this ground; and therefore no appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada would he on such ground, under sec. 22, 38 Vic., ch. 11[1].\n3. That if an amendment to a plea was authorized by the court below, but such amendment was never actually made, the Supreme Court has no power to consider the case as if the amendment had in effect been made[2].\nPer Gwynne, J., That the plaintiff never could have been non-suited in virtue of 37 Vic., ch. 7, sec. 33 Ont., as it is only where it can be said that there is not any evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s case, that a non-suit can be entered; and that in this case, the proper verdict which the law required to be entered upon the answers of the jury was one in favor of the plaintiff[3]. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal to that court from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario.\nThe action, which was brought by one of the children of the late Charles Moore, on a life policy issued by the respondent company, was tried before Moss, C.J., and a jury at the Toronto Assizes, on the 23rd of April, 1877, when a verdict was entered for the plaintiff which, in the learned judge\u2019s opinion, the answers of the jury to the questions put to them, required to be entered. A rule nisi was afterwards obtained to set aside the verdict for plaintiff and to enter a non-suit or verdict for the defendants, pursuant to the Law Reform Act, or for a new trial, which was made absolute to get aside the verdict for plaintiff and enter a verdict for defendants.\nThe appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that Court being equally divided, the appeal was dismissed.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given[4].\nMr. James Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. Rose, with him, for appellant:\u2014\nThe warranty in the application and policy was merely \u201cthat the applicant\u2019s answers were fair and true.\u201d Whether these answers were fair and true was a question of fact for the jury.\nThe respondents did not object to the questions being put to the jury, and if the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench have done what they had no right to do, we are entitled to have our verdict restored. We contend that there was evidence to be left to the jury, and the Ontario stat., 37 Vic. c. 7, did not give the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench the power to substitute their verdict for that of the jury.\nThen all that respondents can now argue is that no questions should have been put to the jury. Now, if the questions were improperly put, the respondents should have objected to them. This was not done and they have no right to do so now. Appellants further contend that the questions were properly put to the jury, and that although it is for the court to construe a contractact was for the jury to say whether the injury received was such as to be material to the risk.\n[The learned counsel then argued that the statements in the application were not warranties but merely representations. That in any case the insured only warranted that the answers were \u201cfair and true,\u201d and the jury having found that he had given \u201cfair and true\u201d answers, it could not be said he had received any personal injury which he might fairly have been expected to communicate to the insurers.]\nMr. Robinson, Q.C., and Dr. McMichael, Q.C., for respondents:\n[The learned counsel, after having argued that the evidence showed beyond all doubt that the breaches of warranty alleged in the pleas were proved, therefore the plaintiff could not recover on the policy, continued:] The motion we made was to set aside the verdict, and to have a non-suit or verdict entered for the defendants, pursuant to the Law Reform Act, or a new trial had between the parties; also that we were entitled to a verdict under the answer of the jury to the seventh question. Now, when the judge proposes to leave certain questions to the jury, he does not necessarily leave the whole case, and the verdict which is entered is in the form of a general verdict.\nRespondents contend that in this case, the questions put were partly relevant and partly irrelevant, and the the answers given to the relevant part, viz., to the fact of the insured having received a blow on the head and the consequent injury to the skull, and whether he had been attended by other medical aid, were in our favor. Moreover, if, as a matter of fact, all questions answered were irrelevant, the answers so given would not exclude the operation of sec. 283, of ch. 50 of the Revised Statutes, which declares that every verdict shall be considered by the court on all motions affecting the same as if leave had been reserved at the trial to move in any manner respecting the verdict, and in like manner as if the assent of parties had been expressly given for that purpose.\nAt the trial also respondent\u2019s counsel submitted that there was no question for the jury, the warranty being that the statement is true.\nIt will not be denied that the judge in this case did not leave to the jury the fact that a personal injury had been received, and this fact being proved, it is a breach of a warranty, and on this finding the respondents are entitled to succeed. The qualifications put to these questions by the judge were not warranted by the contract.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThe state of the pleadings, the issue raised, the finding of the jury, and the action of the court below, in setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff and ordering a verdict to be entered for the defendants, prevents our dealing with the case in any other manner, in the view we take of the case, than by ordering the restoration of the original verdict. We have no power to amend, or right to interfere with the record in the court below, and we are precluded by the Supreme Court Act from granting a new trial on the ground of the verdict being against the weight of evidence.\nThe most important question in this case was, in my opinion, as to the answer given by the applicant to the eighth group of questions:\u2014\n\u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury? And if so of what nature? How long since? And what effect on general health?\u201d Answer: \u201cNo.\u201d\nHere are four distinct questions put, each requiring a separate and distinct answer, if the first is answered in the affirmative; the three last would seem most important to enable the medical officer of the company to advise, and the company to determine, how far such illness, disease or personal injury, as the case may be, ought to affect the proposed risk. With reference to the first it cannot be that the illness or disease referred to was intended to apply to any slight, trivial indisposition of a temporary character, which no one in the ordinary intercourse of life would treat or speak of as an illness in the sense that term is ordinarily used in the common parlance of life, and as distinguishable from indisposition, or that by personal injury was intended every trifling injury, such as a simple cut, or burn of a slight character, producing, perhaps, a little temporary pain, possibly a little inconvenience, but no serious consequences, nor effects of a character likely to cause the injury to be remembered; but injuries of a substantial character, such as impair the body, or health, or as would be considered serious at the time, or which in their immediate effect might possibly jeopardize life, or tend, in their ulterior consequences, to affect longevity, or leave the person injured more open to the effect of subsequent disease, though not proceeding necessarily, immediately, or directly, from the wound or injury itself; in other words, leaving what might be considered a weak spot in the system, which might be productive, in the future, of consequences detrimental to longevity, either proceeding from the injury itself, or in connection with disease or injury to which the person may become subject from other causes, all of which it would be the proper province of the medical adviser of the company to determine when he should know the nature of the personal injury, how long since it occurred, and what the subsequent effect had been on the general health. Though it is certainly not necessary that such injury should contribute to the death of the assured, it is sufficient if it is such an injury as he should have disclosed in his answer, so that the insurers should have been placed in a position to institute any necessary enquiries in reference thereto, and on the result accept or reject the risk, the object of these questions being to obtain such information as to any personal injuries of a substantial or serious character as will enable the insurers, not the assured, to judge of its effect on the proposed risk, and, as Mr. Justice Patterson says, it may not be easy to define the limits between mere hurts and ailments and injuries or diseases; but in this case the injury is of so decided a character, and so clearly, to my mind, a personal injury within the policy, that a critical definition is unnecessary to be attempted.\nIt is difficult for me to understand how this could have escaped the recollection of the assured, and so been overlooked by him, when it is clear from the evidence that the injury must have been present to his eye every time he looked in the glass, and he could not pass his hand over that part of his head without feeling the indentation. But whether it affected his general health, or was present to his mind at the time he answered the question, or was overlooked by him,. in my view, is wholly immaterial. A personal injury, such as a fracture or depression of the skull, with loss or exfoliation of a part of the bone of the skull, is, I think, a personal injury of the most severe and serious character, and was a personal injury within the meaning of the policy which the assured was bound to have communicated, whether resulting from accident or disease, and not having done so, and not having truly answered the question, there was a breach of his warranty, and, as a consequence, a forfeiture of the policy would be the necessary result, if defendants chose properly to raise the question by their pleadings. But for what has taken place on the trial, and the finding of the jury, I should not have supposed it possible that any ordinary reasonable man of common understanding could be found to say that an injury, which left comparatively exposed such a vital part as the brain, which nature has in a sound man so strongly and carefully guarded, was not a personal injury within the terms of the application. Can it be said that a person who had received such an injury as to fracture his skull and remove a piece of it, or that accident or disease had caused exfoliation, so as to produce an indentation and absence of a piece of the skull, whether it apparently affects his general health or not, has not received a very serious injury, or had such an illness as left him less sound and more liable to serious consequences in the event of receiving other injuries on, or affections of, his head than a person whose head had never been fractured or exfoliated, and was in a perfect state to fulfil its functions and protect the brain? I think the company stipulated for and were entitled to information with respect to the injury, to enable them to judge whether it might or might not affect the health, strength, or longevity of the assured, or whether, though of itself not affecting the general health, it might not, in connection with other diseases or injuries which might occur, possibly have an ulterior injurious effect, whether, in other words, it might not affect the risk. Was he not rendered by that injury practically unsound, in that his skull was broken or defective, and the rain was therefore not covered and protected as nature provided it should be?\nIn view of the purposes for which these questions are asked, to say he was not, and to treat this as a slight or trifling injury and class it in the category of simple bruises, sprains, cut fingers and such like, would be, in my opinion, a most unreasonable construction to put on the language of this question. In view, however, of the doubt raised by the evidence, which I cannot help saying I think very unsatisfactory, as to whether the injury resulted from disease or accident (for I cannot think there was any reasonable ground for supposing under the evidence it resulted from natural causes), if the question was a proper one to be submitted to the jury, then in view of the only issue raised, and the finding of the jury on that issue, a verdict should not have been entered for defendants, but a new trial ordered.\nHad the pleadings raised properly the question as to disease as well as to accident, I think the verdict must have been in favor of the defendants, inasmuch as the serious injuries on applicant\u2019s head, whether resulting from disease or accident, not having been communicated, would have invalidated the policy, but the jury having found on the issues as raised, in favor of the plaintiff, and having been matter proper to be submitted to them, and the question as to whether or not the verdict was against the weight of evidence not being open to us, we have no power to deal with the case otherwise than to say that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench should not have ordered a verdict for the plaintiff on the findings of the jury to be converted into a verdict for the defendants. If the pleadings did not properly raise the substantial points on which the case should turn the record should have been amended, or if the court below were dissatisfied with the finding of the jury on the issues as raised as being against the weight of evidence, a new trial should have been ordered.\nSTRONG, J., concurred in the judgment delivered by Gwynne, J.\nFOURNIER, J. concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Appeal Court in Ontario. It is an action on a life insurance policy which was tried before the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, and a verdict for the plaintiff entered by him for the present appellant on answers to certain questions submitted to the jury A rule nisi was granted to set aside the verdict and to enter a non-suit or verdict for the defendants, or to grant a new trial. On argument the rule nisi was made absolute to enter a verdict for the defendants.\nThe plaintiff appealed from that judgment and after argument before the Appeal Court it was ordered that the appeal should be dismissed without costs. From the latter judgment the plaintiff appealed to this court, and it was fully and ably argued in June last.\nThe policy is fully set out in the declaration, and to it the pleas raising the only issues necessary to be considered, are the second and fourth. It appears that on the trial an amendment of the fourth plea was conditionally allowed, but whether an amendment was really made appears to have been doubted by one or more of the judges of the Appeal Court, and I think there is no evidence that it was finally allowed. A difference of opinion, too, existed as to the power of either that court or the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, where the verdict was entered by the presiding judge, as in this case, upon special findings of a jury, to order a verdict to be entered for the defendants, or a non-suit, some of the judges holding, correctly as I think, that the court could only, in such a case, order a new trial. Entertaining the views I do, on the issues otherwise raised, it is not necessary, in my opinion, to consider either the matter of the amendment referred to or the power of the courts to order the entering of a verdict for the defendants; but if my judgment were to rest solely on one or both of the two points named I would decide them in favor of the appellant.\nThe second plea, to which I have referred, alleges that the negative answer to the question in the application; \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury, and, if so, what nature? How long since? And what effect on your general health?\u201d was untrue.\nThat the said Charles Moore had some twelve years before the time when he signed the said application and answered the said question in the negative, received a blow on the head which produced a fracture or depression of the skull, and which was followed by exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and which also caused some degree of inflammation of the brain. That the said blow was a personal injury within the meaning of the said question, and that the answer \u201cNo\u201d given to the said question was untrue and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application, and that by reason of such untrue answer and breach of warranty the said policy was forfeited.\nIn view of the law and the principles governing such cases, I feel no difficulty in asserting that if the plea had been sustained by sufficient evidence, and that the injury was of the description stated in it, the plaintiff\u2019s case would have been met, and the verdict should have been for the defendants. It would then have been, I think, such an injury as the applicant was bound to disclose in his answer. There is no doubt in my mind of the law, that the company had the right to propound the question, and to require thereto a truthful answer on pain of the forfeiture of the policy. The general proposition of law to warrant this decision is well established, and the authorities need not be cited in favor of it. A material misrepresentation avoids a policy as well as a warranty. In case of the former the materiality is generally essential, but in the latter it is not an element to be considered. We have not here the necessity of deciding as to the materiality of the subject-matter, as I have no doubt there was, in this case, a warranty of the truthfulness of the answers in question. The court is to judge of the sufficiency of the plea, but it is for the jury to decide upon the facts proved in support of it. The province and duty of the presiding judge is to expound the law to the jury, and it is for the jury in view of the law so expounded to find their verdict upon the facts. In the case of a general verdict it is final between the parties, if the rulings and charge are unexceptionable, unless the verdict is against the evidence or the weight of it. In the former case courts do not hesitate to set aside a verdict; but in the latter it is done only in cases where the preponderance is very great. Judges should not usurp the functions of a jury any more than a jury those of the court. In an argument for a new trial on the ground that it is against evidence or the weight of evidence, a judge is not to consider himself a juryman, or to inquire what his verdict, as a juryman, would have been. The law in such cases calls upon him to review the finding with a due appreciation of the prerogatives of the jury, but not to take their place. This distinction is sometimes forgotten, and I am inclined to the opinion that the present case is not an exception.\nWithout going into unnecessary prolix detail, I may say that after much reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that the charge to the jury in this case contained a full and correct view of the law bearing on the issues. The answers to the questions were held to be warranties and not mere representations, and the attention of the jury was properly directed to the nature of the issues and the law applicable to them. The only question open for discussion is therefore, in my opinion, as to the nature and extent of the finding of the jury upon the questions submitted to them. Objection has, however, been taken to the wording of some of the questions put to the jury. It may be that in one or two of them, taken separately, there were terms used which were not critically exact as defining legal propositions, but taken together with the other questions, and in view of the law expounded to the jury, they, in my judgment, fairly covered the necessary ground; and the answers, I think, were sufficient, as a whole, to amount to a general verdict for the plaintiff. The several questions were obviously put to the jury, so that the answers\u2014not to any one or more, but to them all\u2014might enable the judge to find his verdict. They contained no proposition of law by which the jury would be perplexed, or by which their finding on one question would be affected by their answers to others. Some of them were, to my mind, unnecessary; but in putting them, in the way adopted, no injury could have resulted to the defendants. The very first question was unnecessary, as other questions made the same inquiry, only in a different form; for it differed, in legal effect, from the others referred to, in no respect; and otherwise only as to the question of a false statement wilfully made. A negligent misrepresentation would be as fatal as a wilful one. The answer in the negative to that question was not, however, taken by the learned Chief Justice as sufficient; for the second question is propounded to further the inquiry in another aspect. He, therefore, in the second question, asked the jury \u201cHad he any serious or severe personal injury which, through forgetfulness or inadvertence, he did not communicate to the company?\u201d to which the jury replied in the negative. These two answers, then, find that no misrepresentation, either intentionally, or through forgetfulness, or inadvertence, was made. Instead of the two, one general question might have included both propositions, but there was nothing wrong in dividing the inquiry. They then substantially found that up to the time of the application the insured had received no serious or personal injury.\nLooking, too, at the third question put to the jury, with the law, as I hold, properly explained, what do we find? That third question asks, \u201cHad he any personal injury, which he might have been fairly expected to communicate for the information of the defendants?\u201d With the law before them the jury answer \u201cNo.\u201d\nIn the absence of any proof to the contrary, we must conclude the jury accepted the law so laid down for their government; and kept it in view when answering the questions. The answer to the fourth question being in the negative is unimportant, as the substance of it is otherwise found. It was, however, for the interest of the defendants that it was put, as, if the question had been affirmatively answered, it would have negatived some of the other findings. Lastly, as to the eighth question, which is the only other one which refers to the issue on the second plea, it is a general one, which again covers the whole ground. \u201cDid he give fair and true answers to the question \u2018Have you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury?\u2019 The jury answer \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d With the law before them, as I before stated, the answer to that question settles the whole issue; and, even if some of the other questions could be accepted to, the answers to them are not important, unless, from the putting of them, we felt the jury were misled as to the law, of which there is no evidence whatever.\nBefore referring to the evidence, I think it right to say that, in my opinion, the learned Chief Justice expounded the law properly on the trial. He very properly excluded the consideration of slight injuries and attacks of illness. Where questions are asked by companies as to specific diseases, they are likely to cause reflection and the exercise of memory on the part of the applicant; but when a man is asked generally whether he ever had a personal injury, no company can reasonably require (what in most cases would be impossible) that a man or woman of forty or fifty years of age should report every time they fell off of a horse, or were upset from a carriage, or in their younger days had been upset or tumbled down and were slightly hurt. The company no doubt had the right to ask the question in any form they thought proper; but having asked it in such general terms and to cover a whole lifetime it is not for them to construe it and the answers to it. That duty devolves on the courts who have, under the circumstances, to say what is reasonably included in and covered by the questions, and whether the answers were fairly and truly given. That every slight Injury or attack should fee notified is not only preposterous, but would in the great majority of cases be impossible. A line must, therefore, be drawn somewhere, but the crossing point has been found difficult to determine. In fact none has yet been drawn of general applicability, and I am of opinion that none such can be drawn. Each case must, to a large extent, be governed by the facts peculiar to it. It has been contended that the company should get every information that would enable it to judge of the probable effects of any sickness, disease, or accident that might subsequently by any possibility affect the life of the applicant. This is, however, in view of medical knowledge or want of knowledge, too sweeping a proposition. There is in many cases a difficulty of correctly ascertaining the exact connection between a previous illness or injury and the immediate cause of death. Because a person meets with accidents which at the time and up to the time of his application do little or no injury, that the mere possibility that, from some one or other of them, injurious effects might result in after life, should make it necessary that he should report them, is, to my mind, most unreasonable, and not such as any company expects or could reasonable expect. If, however, an applicant has received an injury calculated according to medical evidence to affect his general health or the length of his life, he, I think, who fails to report it does so at the risk of forfeiting his policy. The question then is has it been clearly proved that the applicant in this case had received, and failed to notify the company of, such an injury as set out in the plea. Did he, in the words of that plea, receive a blow \u201cwhich produced a fracture or depression of his skull, and which was followed by exfoliation of the bone of the skull,\u201d and which was of so aggravated an injury as to cause \u201csome degree of inflammation of the brain.\u201d The defendants substantially say to the plaintiff: \u201cThe applicant through whom you claim had sustained that specific injury which he did not report, and we will prove it and so avoid the policy.\u201d On reading that plea\u2014so specific as it is\u2014one would reasonably expect to receive positive evidence\u2014first of the blow, next the fracture, then the exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and, lastly, the inflammation of the brain.\nHaving given my view of the law, I must now consider the evidence in relation to the findings of the jury. The onus of proving the issue, it must not be forgotten, was on the defendants. I have read over the evidence carefully and fully considered it, and I must say it falls far short of what in my opinion was necessary.\nIn the first place, as to the fracture or depression caused, as alleged, by a blow, in the technical meaning of the word, no \u201cblow\u201d was proved; but it is alleged the applicant was once thrown off his horse when hunting, and on another occasion was thrown out of a sleigh. Here the direct evidence as to the injury ceases as far as the fracture is concerned. None is given of any fracture. It appears, from the evidence, that after one or other of those falls he spoke to a doctor, but the latter could find nothing wrong with him and did not prescribe for him. Would it not, therefore, be unwarrantable to conclude his skull was then fractured? Besides, we have the evidence of Dr. Nicholl, who says that when at the time of his last and fatal injury, having heard that he had had one or more falls, one of which had injured his head, he concluded from the appearance of the skull, after the trephining operation had been performed, that the missing bone had been removed by an operation. That no such operation had been performed is abundantly shown; for it is proved by more than one witness that the injury was so slight that he attended to his business as usual and never complained of any injury. What then does the absence of part of the bone prove? Simply that it was a defect from his birth, or from disease, and if from the latter what disease? Was it the result of an external injury or not? If it was it has not been traced or proved. To say, without further evidence, the disease was the result of an injury would be the wildest guessing. The doctors substantially admit that they could not account for the absence of part of the bone. They say there are many such cases known without any external injury; that such cases are often found to have existed from birth, and others as the result of disease producing necrosis, exfoliation or wasting of the bone. How then could a jury reasonably be expected, from the evidence, to jump at the unreasonable conclusion that the absence of the bone must have been from the fracture alleged. Had there been a fracture and exfoliation of the bone, the subject must necessarily have felt it for a long time, and the soreness and pain must have been severe, and known to his brother and those around him, and to the doctor, and to have necessitated medical treatment. A fracture of a man\u2019s finger would be known to his whole household, and that of a leg would likely be the subject of a newspaper paragraph, but the fracture of a man\u2019s skull, of the extent to result as before mentioned, is asked to be presumed, without any medical man of the place (one of whom was spoken to at the time it is alleged to have taken place) or any one else hearing or knowing of it, and in the face of his brothers and the doctor\u2019s testimony, that the fall did not injure him. The medical men all say, the absence of the bone may have been from malformation, or the result of disease, and is no sufficient proof of any fracture. Without information as to a previous injury they would, without doubt, have attributed it to malformation or disease; and even with the \u201crumors\u201d they had heard, with the addition of what one of them thinks the applicant told him, none of them ventured to decide whether it was from malformation, or was the result of disease, or of an external injury. None. of them said, that, from all he saw and heard, he was of opinion the loss of bone was caused by an external injury. The onus to prove the fact was on the defendants, and I maintain the evidence wholly failed to establish it. The medical men may have erred in their views, but they were the witnesses of the respondents, and if they failed to establish their defence they must bear the consequences. The verdict must be founded on evidence, and a jury cannot set up their crude ideas against scientific evidence. From the evidence of the medical men, I am justified in the conclusion that, had they, when considering the case, before them the evidence of Edward Moore and Doctor Valentine, they would have concluded the absence of the bone was from malformation or the result of disease. I have already referred to the testimony of the former, but will now quote what the latter says:\nAnd the injury to the head\u2014the contusion\u2014there was nothing done at all in that case. He was simply directed to call and keep himself under observation in case anything did occur. It was simply a contusion of the skin. He was kept under observation, and no cerebral symptoms arose. This was in 1865, I think; it was not earlier than 1864 or later than 1866.\nIn another place, he says no injury to the bone was discoverable.\nThat was, no doubt, the time referred to in the plea, and the very identical injury referred to in it. That taken with Moore\u2019s evidence, apart from the improbabilities from other known facts, establishes beyond all reasonable doubt, that there was, at that time (as positively above stated) no fracture of the bone, but \u201csimply a contusion of the skin,\u201d without any \u201ccerebral symptoms;\u201d and, I presume this was the contusion which left the marks of the cross-cuts spoken of by one of the witnesses. I cannot conceive how, with such evidence before them, any jury could be expected to presume that a fracture of the bone had taken place, or how any one could expect the court to set aside a verdict in accordance with that evidence, or, what would be worse, to order a verdict for the defendants. Juries are permitted, and sometimes required, to found their verdicts on presumptions of certain facts: and the law distinguishes as to the nature of them. Juries are not, however, permitted to act upon them in the face of reliable evidence that rebuts them. Such, I hold, is the case here; and I go the length of saying that had the verdict been otherwise it ought to be set aside.\nThe judgment delivered by the late learned and lamented Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench as to this issue, was founded wholly on the, I think, mistaken assumption that the plea was proved. While agreeing with his statement of the law, I differ with him entirely as to the evidence. If it had been necessary to submit the matter to the jury to presume a certain fact from the circumstantial evidence adduced, it was their province alone to do so or not; but if they do not we cannot control them. If they do, and the presumption was at all justified by the evidence, the court has, in my opinion, no right to interfere. I feel bound to say that the judgment was erroneous, for it is not only contrary to the evidence but an invasion of the prerogative of the jury.\nBefore concluding my observations on this part of the case, I consider it proper to remark upon one part of the evidence of Dr. Wright, the consulting physician of the company, upon which I think improper stress has been laid. Speaking of the insured at the time of the application, he says:\nAfter he had signed the paper he passed it back again, rose from his chair and was about leaving, when he spoke of a fall he had had upon his head; he said he was not injured by it. The question was repeated to him, and he again asserted that he had had a fall upon his head, and that it had not injured him.\nIt is possible I may be wrong, but, if so, I have been under an hallucination during all my professional life, if you can take against a man an admission made against his interest, and discard what he adds to qualify and control it. A man may admit that at one time he was indebted to another, but, at the same time, alleges that he had paid the debt. Such a statement would not be evidence of present indebtedness, and would not be received as such. A man could not be convicted of an attempt to commit murder who admits the administration of deadly poison to another, but adds that he did so with the intention of immediately giving a sufficient antidote\u2014that he did administer also the antidote, and no harm was done by the poison. The party might be blamed for unnecessarily tampering with human life, but the presumption of malice, from the admission of the administration of the poison, would be rebutted by taking the whole, and not a mere part, of his statement. So in this case; the addition of the words \u201cthat he was not injured by it\u201d (the \u201cfall\u201d) must be taken with the admission of having had a fall. Even if the fact of the fail were otherwise shown, the admission, as I take it, could not be received, even as corroborative evidence, except by taking the result of the whole statement. The admission in question was adopted by one of the judges of the Court of Appeal contrary to the principle I have stated, and I think his doing so was an error. Taking the whole statement there is no evidence whatever from it that the applicant was guilty of any misrepresentation or concealment which would legally avoid the contract.\nThe defence on the ground that the applicant had suffered from dyspepsia has been, I think, very properly found by all the judges as not proved.\nI will now give my opinion as to the remaining issue which is on the amended fourth plea, but which I think is not regularly a part of the record.\n\u201cThat the answer given to the question, \u2018How long since you were attended by a physician? Namely: \u2018about thirty years ago,\u2019 was untrue to the knowledge of the said Charles Moore. That the said Charles Moore, previous to the making of the said application and a much shorter period than thirty years had been attended by and had consulted and availed himself of the skill of other medical men, to wit, Dr. Lizars, Dr. Nichol, Dr. Barrick, Dr. Russell, and Dr. Valentine, and that he had concealed the said fact. That he had consulted the said medical men and gave no reference to the said medical men, and that the answer given to the said question was untrue, and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application.\u201d\nThis plea charges an untruthful answer to the knowledge of the applicant It therefore includes not only a false representation, but a fraudulent one. Had the plea founded a defence on a false representation not amounting to a warranty, the onus on the defendants would include proof of the knowledge that the answer, when given, was false. The evidence in that case would have been here wholly insufficient. This plea was put in on the trial and raised an issue wholly different from that in the original plea; and if the amendment was forced on the plaintiff without further time given to permit rebutting evidence and the ques- tion of that amendment were open, I would feel inclined to reject it. The defence on the original plea was what the plaintiff came prepared to meet, and we are, I think, at all events, permitted if necessary to consider the amended plea under the circumstances in which it was admitted. It does not, however, appear to me there is any necessity for doing so.\nI will commence the consideration of this part of the case by saying that as regards this issue I adopt the views of the learned Judges Burton and Galt, of the Court of Appeal. I concur with them in their ruling that the questions having been prepared by the company they must take the consequences of any ambiguity in them. Their questions should be plainly put, and the whole difficulty has arisen in this case from the absence of one of two words, \u201cfirst\u201d or \u201clast\u201d \u201cHow long since you were (first or last) attended by a physician?\u201d The company may very properly say we meant the applicant to read the question as if it contained the word \u201clast.\u201d Still it is open to the charge of ambiguity, calculated to mislead. The indefinite question might, not without some reason, be understood by many as intended to inquire as to the time the applicant first required medical treatment. In my opinion that inquiry would in many cases be quite as important as one in reference to the last preceding employment of a medical man. In his early days many a man has had injurious complaints and diseases which have so far passed away which a physician more recently employed might never have known about, but about which it would be desirable for the company to be informed. By a reference to his first doctor information might be obtained that a later one could not furnish. I mention this not to prove that such a construction would be the correct one; but to show how ambiguous the question was and how likely to mislead, and when we know that uneducated persons and others not accustomed to such inquiries, are called upon, very often without much time for reflection, we should not too readily decide that the answer, by mistaking the term, was necessarily untrue to the extent of avoiding the policy. A mistake as to the meaning of the question does not necessarily make the statement in answer untrue. If it be not untrue, there is no breach of warranty, and consequently no defence. To prove there was not any untruth, as ordinarily understood in the answer, let me suppose it had been \u201cHow long since you were first attended by a physician?\u201d The answer, \u201cabout 30 years ago,\u201d would have been strictly correct. That, it is patent, is the way the question was understood; but the defendants say he should have understood it to mean \u201clast,\u201d instead of \u201cfirst\u201d\u2014but that does not negative the truth of the answer he gave to what he supposed the question asked. The proper conclusion, I think, is that he answered a question he supposed to have been put; but did not answer at all the question as understood or intended by the company. The mere failure to answer the question as intended by the company, when done in good faith, and in the belief the answer he gave was what was asked for, would not, in my judgment, be a breach of the warranty under the circumstances.\nBesides, the other questions and answers were such as to notify the company of the construction put on the question by the applicant. After stating in his answers that his complaint was \u201clake fever\u201d and giving the name of Dr. Sampson, who attended him at Kingston, then dead, and being asked for the name and residence of his medical attendant, he replied, \u201cDr. Barick of Toronto, who attends my family\u2014he has known me for seven years.\u201d He thus pointed out Dr. Barick as his physician, with an intimation or sugges- tion from which it might reasonably be presumed he had been such for seven years previously. If, therefore, the company wished information as to how long since he was last attended by a physician, they got it fully in the answer to that question. They were told who his first physician was, and they were referred to Dr. Barick as the one then attending him. If Dr. Barick was then, at the time of the application, his medical attendant, was not the answer sufficient to start any necessary inquiry? The mistake, if any, as to the question to which \u201cabout 30 years ago\u201d was given as the answer, must have been patent to the company if they at all considered the answers, for that answer, as alleged to have been intended by them, was wholly inconsistent with that which notified the company that Dr. Barick was then his medical attendant. The discrepancy as to the first question was therefore fairly notified to the company before they issued the policy, and as the error, if any, was largely the result of their own ambiguous words, I don\u2019t think it lies with them now to seek shelter from their liability for that for which they have themselves to blame.\nThere is no ground for thinking that the question was framed intentionally ambiguous as a trap, but it certainly was one into which the uninitiated were not unlikely to fall, and was equally dangerous as if it had been. When it was so easy to have made the question plain to ordinary minds, such as generally had to answer it, there is no excuse for a company deliberately to frame and print such an ambiguous one, and one so much calculated to produce mistakes. According to the principles laid down by Lord St. Leonards, and quoted by Mr. Justice Burton in this case, and by Willes, J., as quoted by Mr. Justice Galt, I feel that the ambiguity which has caused the difficulty under the issue raised by the amended plea was the act of the de- fendants, and that in consideration of the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, it would be gross injustice to deprive the appellant of her rights under the policy.\nThe evidence, however, does not establish the fact that the applicant was attended by any of the physicians named in the plea or any other for any serious illness or injury. The same principles should be applicable to this plea as to the second, and when the question is asked: \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician?\u201d I think it was not intended to cover every unimportant ailment or injury, but something that, in the opinion of a medical man, might have some effect on general health, and I am helped to this construction by the concluding part of question eight, which, in case any other illness (besides those enumerated in question seven), local disease, or personal injury, is reported \u201cand what effect on general health?\u201d, which shows, to my mind, that the attendance of a physician inquired about was only in cases more serious than any which the doctors say they attended him for, and for one of which (occasional indigestion) one of the doctors recommended \u201caride on horseback.\u201d Another doctor on one occasion attended him for a slight attack of the liver and bowels, which he supposed was from the heat of the weather. He says: \u201cOf course it was nothing serious.\u201d Dr. Valentine stated that he had treated him for a local disease of a temporary character, of which he was cured in 1865, or the end of 1864, from which no permanent constitutional disturbances remained; and for slight derangements of the stomach. If then the answer had been that the last attendance upon him of a physician for anything more than trifling causes not at all affecting his general health, or probable longevity, it might not improperly be said when he replied, \u201cDr. Chapman, 30 years ago,\u201d was strictly true. The evidence shows him to have been particularly healthy and active, and it would, I think, be straining words from their true bearing and meaning to say that the attendances last referred to were such as were contemplated or required by the questions. Because differences of opinion have been expressed in the lower courts and here, I have considered it proper to be thus minute in dealing with the issues involved.\nFor the reasons given by Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Galt before referred to, and for those I have myself given, I think, that on the fourth issue also our judgment should be for the appellant. I have not failed to consider the effect of the statute under which the questions were propounded to the jury, and I think I am justified in saying, as I now take occasion to do, that in a case like the present the court could not enter a verdict for the defendant or a non\u2011suit, and that the power in such cases is limited to making an order for a new trial. As therefore the order was not justifiable all we can do in that respect is to reverse the judgment.\nI am of opinion that the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the Queen\u2019s Bench should be reversed, the appeal allowed and judgment entered for the plaintiff on the verdict, with costs up to and since the rendering of the verdict.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nUpon the fourth plea, I am of opinion that the question, \u201cHow long since were you attended by a physician?\u201d was not clear and may have been understood by Moore as meaning, \u201cHow long since you were first attended by a physician?\u201d\nWhy did not the company, if they meant to know who attended him last, ask him plainly, \u201cWhen were you last attended by a physician?\u201d I am inclined to think with the Court of Appeal, that the applicant misunderstood the question put to him, and that his answer is not then untrue, and I would be for the the plaintiff on this part of the case.\nI come now to the consideration of the questions raised on the second plea. This part of the case is not free from difficulty. This plea is as follows:\u2014\nAnd for a second plea the defendants say, that the answer given in the negative by the said Charles Moore, as in the declaration mentioned, to the question, \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury? and, if so, what nature? how long since? and what effect on general health?\u201d was untrue. That the said Charles Moore had some twelve years before the time when he signed the said application and answered the said question in the negative received a blow on the head which produced a fracture or depression of the skull, and which was followed by exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and which also caused to some degree inflammation of the brain. That the said blow was a personal injury within the meaning of the said question, and that the answer, \u201cNo,\u201d given to the said question was untrue and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application, and that by reason of such untrue answer and breach of warranty the said policy was forfeited.\nAt the trial, the learned judge presiding, instead of taking a general verdict, directed the jury to answer certain questions. It is, perhaps, better to give here those questions with the remarks and directions of the learned judge.\nThe first four questions that I shall put to you relate to the personal injury which it is alleged by these defendants that the applicant, Charles Moore, sustained, and the existence of which was not disclosed to them on his application. The defendants\u2019 contention is that they put to the applicant this question, \u2018Have you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury, and if so, of what nature, how long since, and what was the effect of it on your general health; \u2018 that he answered in the negative, as in fact he did; that that answer was untrue, and vitiated the policy, because he had received, many years before, a severe injury to his head, amounting to a fracture; and which they say in the plea\u2014although there is no evidence upon that point\u2014was succeeded by exfoliation. It is to that question and answer, and to the circumstances which actually existed, as far as you can make them out from the evidence in connection with this injury, that I direct your attention. (The learned judge here referred in detail to the evidence.)\nBearing that evidence in mind, I ask you to reply to the following questions:\u2014\n\u201c1. Had Mr. Moore any personal injury which must have been present to his own mind as something coming fairly within the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and which he did not communicate to the defendants?\u201d\nYou will perceive from the terms of this question the idea present to my mind in framing it. It appeared to me that it might possibly be held that any \u201cpersonal injury\u201d must be one that would be fairly present to the mind of a person making such an application as something that an ordinary man would understand as a personal injury that he ought to communicate to the Company; and if you think that, you will of course answer this question \u201cYes.\u201d In other words, if you think that this injury to his head, whatever its extent and origin, did fairly come within the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and was present to Mr. Moore\u2019s mind, then the answer should be \u201cYes.\u201d If you think it was so slight, and made so little impression upon himself and his own mind that he could not accept it as coming fairly within the term, then you will answer \u201cNo.\u201d\n2. \u201cHad he had any serious or severe personal injury which, through forgetfulness or inadvertence, he did not communicate to the Company?\u201d\nI have already pointed out to you that in my construction of these questions in this application the applicant must at his own peril answer the questions correctly, and that forgetfulness or inadvertence will not excuse him. If he makes a slip the Company can, if found consistent with fair dealing or necessary for the protection of its own interests, set it up; but I want to get your answer to this question.\n3. \u201cHad he any personal injury which he might have been fairly expected to communicate for the information of the defendants?\u201d\nThat is almost another form of one of the preceding questions, but raises a point slightly different.\n4. \u201cHad he any personal injury which had any effect on his general health?\u201d\nIt is contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that that is the fair meaning of the question put in the application with reference to any other personal injury, illness, or local disease. The words must have some limitation: and it may be that the propor limitation is that they should be confined to injuries that affect the general health. In considering this question you will bear in mind what all the witnesses said as to the state of health Mr. Moore had after the accident, and consider the medical evidence as to the effect which it might have. Although the medical men would be no doubt the first themselves to admit that, it is not comparable with evidence of the actual state of health which he did enjoy. That is the last question in relation to the personal injury.\nTo these four questions the jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d\nTo another question, as follows:\u2014\nDid he give fair and true answers to the questions, \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury? And if so, of what nature? How long since? And what effect on general health?\nthe jury answered \u201cYes.\u201d\nNow, as to the evidence on this part of the case, the following is a correct synopsis of it, as given by Mr. Vice-Chancellor Blake in the Court of Appeal.\nDr. Nicol says: When I was first called in to see him in his last illness, he was apparently suffering from a species of low fever with some head affection; then, I think on the night following the day he was attacked, he was attacked with paralysis of the left side, and then after that he became semi-comatose.\nQ. Did you find on examination any evidence of personal injury?\nA. Yes: just on the parietal bone on the right side of the head there was a depression that I could just put my little finger into.\nQ. What examination was made to enable you to judge of the injury to the skull?\nA. Trephining. There was a deficiency in the bone, perhaps the space of my little finger, perhaps a little more. It was not a very recent injury... The depression I mentioned was easily discoverable to any person who had reason to suspect its presence, or who searched the head carefully; the depth was slight, not more than a tenth or an eighth of an inch; you would hardly have noticed it... I think that one day I had some conversation with him in reference to this injury to the head... It was on one of these two occasions, 1869 or 1870\u2026 I do not remember what he said about it, except that it was from a fall from a horse, or from his horse falling on a furrow. I had not seen the injury to his head at that time. I have some idea that I put my finger in the place where he told me, but I could not say positively. I think there was something said about a piece of bone being lost, but whether he volunteered it, or whether it was in answer to a question from me, I cannot say. There was a loss of bone. I cannot say positively, but I think there was; when I put my finger in, as I think I did, I found the depression. He spoke of that as a fall from a horse.\nQ. Then he was under the impression that that kind of injury caused it? A. Yes; but if the bone perished and exfoliated, it would be equally from this injury as if he had the bone fractured, and the surgeon removed the bone at the time. I supposed at that time he had had the skull fractured, and that some surgeon or another had removed the piece of bone. If an examining physician had passed his fingers at all carefully over Mr. Moore\u2019s head he would have detected the depression in the skull; if he merely passed his hand over it he would not have discovered it.\nDr. Athens, in answer to the question, \u2018What was the condition of the skull before you commenced the operation? says: There was a depression there. Mr. C. Moore had for years past kept his hair very short, and, as far as I can remember, the depression could be seen, but there was no difficulty whatever in feeling it; the point of the little finger could be easily buried in the depression; perhaps the index finger, just the point of it. This was the first time I had attended Mr. Moore, but I was in the habit of seeing him often. If I had been aware of the depression before that evening I had forgotten it; there was a piece of bone absent then, there was a part of the skull gone; no matter what had happened to it, whether it never was there, or was the result of disease or injury, the piece was gone, and we planted the trephine so that the edge of the instrument just came over the edge of this deficiency. I would not expect to find an opening there, although I have seen children born with an opening in the bone where no opening ought to be, but I would come to the conclusion, from looking at his head, that he had lost a piece of bone, either from fracture or disease; of course some diseases would kill bone; I have seen men with no fracture who have lost a part of their skull. I could hardly suppose that the absence of the portion of skull was natural; it is only just possible.\nQ As a physician you formed an opinion?\u2014A. I perhaps was guided by the information that was given to me at the time, that he had some injury previously. My opinion at that time was that he had had a fracture of the skull, and lost part of the bone..... The bone had either been removed by the surgeon, if it had not been, knocked out by the cause of injury, or had necrosed, died. Exfoliation is throwing off in thin scales or leaves. I do not think there had been anything of that sort; it is not at all likely..... That is a sort of wasting away..... I received information then and there about a past injury. The skull has inner and outer densities, and a spongy structure between the two. It is my belief that the whole had disappeared, the entire thickness of bone had gone. In such a case the bone fills in a little from the edges, but leaves a little deficiency in the centre; then the centre will fill with dense tissue resembling sclerotic tissue covered with scalp; that was the case here.\nQ. Was he as well prepared to resist the effects of another blow over this spot?\u2014A. No, he was not.\nDr. Barrick says: I first saw him, I think, about ten days before his death; he was then complaining of a pain in his head, at some distance from the old depression; that was the burden of his com plaint. I was aware of the depression in the head before that time. I took notice of it before anything was said about it, because his hair was thin and cut short, but I could not tell how long that was before. He said that he had had several tumbles and accidents, and from some of them he led me to believe that this depression arose.\nQ. Did you speak to Mr. Moore at all about that injury before you called in the other doctors to consult?\u2014A. He mentioned that to me, I think, when he was attacked last time; he complained of pain in the head about an inch and a half from this old place; he then commenced and related to me again that he had received an injury and that his impression was that the depression had arisen from that injury. That is what he told me in his last illness. He told the other medical men that the object in taking in part of the old injury was to see the condition of the bone at that part. We were anxious to include part of the old depression to see what the nature of that part was.\nEdward Moore, the brother of the deceased, says: I felt his head after the last accident in the store, the hurt was about two inches from the old injury, on the same side of the head. I saw the old injury then. You could not help but see it. I had been aware of it before. It had been cut and healed up. I felt the new injury to see if the skull was broken.\nFrom the evidence of Drs. Nicol and Aikins, there can be no doubt that by some means a piece of the bone of the skull of the deceased had been removed. As to the manner in which this was lost, Dr. Nicol says: \u201cI supposed at that time that he had had the skull fractured, and that some surgeon or another had removed the piece of bone,\u201d and Dr. Aikins says: \u201cI would come to the conclusion, from looking at his head, that he had lost a piece of bone either from fracture or disease.\u201d\nThat the conclusion arrived at by these medical gentlemen is correct, is evident from the family physician of the deceased, Dr. Barrick, who says that\u2014\nHis patient informed him that he had had several tumbles and accidents, and that from some of them he led him to believe that this depression arose; and at another time he says: He then commenced and related to me again that he had received an injury, and that his impression was that that depression had arisen from that injury. That was what he told me in his last illness.\nIn my opinion this evidence establishes clearly that Moore had, some years before he made his application to the company, received an injury on the head. The plaintiff contends that this depression of the skull may have been caused by disease or may have been natural. Now, I can\u2019t see how we can attribute it to disease. 1st. Because if it was so the plaintiff could have easily proved it; 2nd. Because the doctors examined do not think it was caused by disease; 3rd. Because Moore himself, in his application to the company, stated that he never had any other disease than the lake fever. As to the possibility of this depression in the skull being natural, I can\u2019t see my way to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention in this respect 1st. Because the doctors examined say this was most unlikely. 2nd. Because the plaintiff would have been able to prove it, if it had been natural; 3rd. Because Moore himself said it was caused by a fall on the head; and all the witnesses, including Moore\u2019s brother, speak of it as \u201cthe old injury.\u201d It is impossible, in my opinion, after reading the evidence adduced, to doubt that Moore had, at some time or another, before he made the application to the company, received an injury by which he had lost a portion of his skull. It appears to me to be proved beyond a doubt, and, as said by the late Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, the question in its naked form as to this fact, was not submitted to the jury, for the reason that there was no dispute about it. The jury have not found that Moore had received no personal injury; but that he had received no personal injury which must have been present to his mind as something coming fairly within the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d; that he had no serious or severe personal injury, which through forgetfulness or inadvertence he did not communicate; that he had no personal injury which he might fairly be expected to communicate for the information of the defendants, and that he had not any personal injury which had any effect on his general health. They never found, and they could not find in face of the evidence, that he never received any personal injury whatever. By finding that he had not received any personal injury which had any effect on his general health, they have not found for the plaintiff. On the contrary, as the case was given to them, all parties at the trial, judge, jury and counsel (as said by Burton, J, and Patterson, J, in the Court of Appeal) assuming that there had been a personal injury, this answer of the jury seems to me to mean \u201cYes,\u201d he had received a personal injury, but it did not affect his general health. Now, his statement to the company was that he had never received a personal injury. This was, it seems to me, untrue. The jury also answered \u201cNo\u201d to the third question put to them, as follows: \u201cHad he any personal injury which he might have been fairly expected to communicate for the information of the defendants?\u201d But that is not finding that he never had any personal injury whatsoever. It seems to me, that it was for the court to decide whether any injury received should have been communicated to the defendants. The second question to them speaks of a serious or severe personal injury. Now, what he stated to the company was, not that he had never received any serious or severe injury, but that he had never received any personal injury. The answer of the jury to the first question put to them does not either say that Moore never received any personal injury whatsoever, so that, without disregarding the answers of the jury to the questions submitted to them, it seems to me, that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The basis of Moore\u2019s contract with the company was that each and every one of his answers to their questions was strictly true. It being established that one of them was not true, the company is freed from all obligations under this contract, whether this untrue answer was given to them fraudulently or not[5], and whether this untrue answer was on a material fact or not[6]. I fully admit this proposition that the words \u201cillness, local disease or personal injury,\u201d do not include such trifling ailments as influenza, or toothache, or a black eye, but I cannot avoid the conclusion that a fracture in the skull, by which that vital portion of the human frame, the brain, is not as well protected as it otherwise would have been, is a personal injury, and, in Moore\u2019s case, should, as such, have been communicated to the company.\nI am of opinion to dismiss this appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nThe position in which this case at present stands, is certainly not satisfactory. The learned judge before whom the case was tried, entered a verdict for the plaintiff, as the verdict which, in his judgment, the answers of the jury to the questions put to them required to be entered. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench reversed that verdict and has ordered one to be entered for the defendants upon the issues joined on the second and fourth pleas.\nIn rendering this judgment the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench seems to me to have arrived at the result which they did arrive at, by reading the evidence rather in connection with the questions and answers endorsed on the application for insurance than with regard to the issues joined between the parties which they went down to try, and this is the more unfortunate, as much of the evidence relied upon by the late learned Chief Justice of that court in his judgment was irrelevant to those issues, and consequently inadmissible. This is pointed out by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Court of Appeal, who, while concurring in the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench upon the second plea, was of opinion that the fourth plea was by no means so clearly proved as to warrant interference with the verdict entered thereon for the plaintiff, even if the plea had followed the language of the question on the application with respect to which it was framed, which, in his opinion, it did not. He therefore was not disposed to disturb the verdict for the plaintiff upon that issue. Two of the other learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment upon all the issues, and the fourth was of opinion that a new trial should be granted, but as the other members of the court did not consent to this, and thinking the plaintiff not entitled to succeed, he concurred with Mr. Justice Patterson, and the court being divided, no rule followed on the appeal, and so the case comes before this court.\nMuch of this difference of opinion has arisen, I think, from the want of sufficient attention to the issues joined. The declaration alleged that the policy of insurance declared upon was issued and accepted upon certain express conditions and agreements which are set out in the declaration, containing among others the following:\u2014\n1st. That the answers, statements, representations and declarations contained in or endorsed upon the application for this insurance, which application is hereby referred to and made part of this contract, are warranted by the assured to be true in all respects, and that if this policy has been obtained by or through any fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment, then this policy shall be abso- lutely null and void; and, further, that no answer, statement, representation or declaration made to any agent, solicitor, or any other person whatever, and not contained in said application, shall be taken or considered as having been made to, or brought to the notice or knowledge of this company, and this company shall be held and considered as having no notice or knowledge of such answer, statement, representation or declaration, and the said application, a copy of which is hereto annexed, shall be taken and held to be, and to contain the only answers, statements, representations or declarations made to this company on behalf of this insurance.\nThe application so referred to was for a policy of insurance for $25,000 upon the life of Charles Moore, aged 50. Upon this application, which was in one of the company\u2019s printed forms, were endorsed certain questions to be answered by the applicant, among which were the following, which are the only material ones to be set out, namely:\n7th. Have you ever had any of the following diseases? Answer, Yes or No, opposite each. Here follow thirty-six particular diseases enumerated, and among them dyspepsia, and the question concludes as follows: \u201cIf you have a rupture, state whether you habitually wear a truss?\u201d\n\u201cState the number of attacks, character and duration of all the diseases which you have had?\u201d\nTo this question the applicant answered by inserting \u201cNo\u201d after each particular disease mentioned in the question.\nThis question was immediately followed by the 8th, namely: \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury? and if so, of what nature? How long since? And what effect on general health?\u201d To which the applicant also answered \u201cNo.\u201d\n14th. \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician? For what diseases? Give name and residence of such physician?\u201d \u201cName and residence of usual medical attendant? Name and residence of an intimate friend.\u201d\nThis question the applicant answered as follows:\nTo 1st part. About 30 years ago, Lake fever. Dr. Sampson, of Kingston, who is now dead.\nTo 2nd. Dr. Barrick, of Toronto, who attends my family; has known me some years.\nTo 3rd. Mr. Dunbar; has known me some years.\nUpon this application and the answers to the questions thereon endorsed the policy sued upon was issued by the defendants upon the 27th March, 1875, and in August, 1876, after having paid two premiums, amounting together to $2,347.00. Moore, the insured, died from the effects of a blow then recently received upon his head.\nThe plaintiff, as one of the children of Moore for whose benefit, among others, the policy was effected, brings this action, to which the defendants plead in bar:\n1st. That they did not make that policy in the declaration mentioned.\n2nd. And for second plea the defendants say that the answer given in the negative by the said Charles Moore as in the declaration mentioned to the question \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury? and if so, of what nature? How long since? And what effect on general health?\u201d was untrue. That the said Charles Moore had, some twelve years before the time when he signed the said application and answered the said question in the negative, received a blow on the head which produced a fracture or depression of the skull, and which was followed by exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and which also caused to some degree inflammation of the brain. That the said blow was a personal injury within the meaning of the said question, and that the answer \u201cNo,\u201d given to the said question was untrue and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application, and that by reason of such untrue answer and breach of warranty the said policy was forfeited.\n3rd. And for the third plea to the said declaration the defendants say that the said Charles Moore had before the time when he made the said application been afflicted with \u201cdyspepsia,\u201d and that the answer \u201cNo\u201d given by the said Charles Moore to the question, \u201cHave you ever had any of the following diseases, among others dyspepsia?\u201d was untrue and a breach of the warranty contained in the said application, and was untrue to the knowledge of the said Charles Moore.\n4th. And for fourth plea the defendants say that the answer given to the question, \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician? namely, about 30 years ago\u201d was untrue to the knowledge of the said Charles Moore; that the said Charles Moore had, previous to the making of the said application, and at a much shorter period than 30 years, received a severe blow on the head, the effects of which remained until his death, and that while he was suffering under such injury he consulted and availed himself of the skill of a medical man, one Dr. Lizars, and that he concealed the said fact that he had so consulted the said medical man, and gave no reference to the said medical man, and that the answer given to the said question was untrue and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application.\nThe plaintiff joined issue upon these pleas.\nA motion was made by the defendants, and leave was given to them at the trial to amend this fourth plea, subject, however, to a special reservation to the court in which the action was pending to the question whether, under all the circumstances, the amendment should be allowed. If we were now considering the question whether the amendment in the terms proposed should be allowed, I confess that the propriety of allowing it seems to me to be more than doubtful. When we consider the extremely rigorous and partial terms in the interest of the defendants in which this policy is framed, terms which, if construed literally, would seem to be open to a construction that it would be impossible for the most honest insurer to comply with them; and which would leave it in the power of the defendants, upon the discovery after diligent enquiry, of some old forgotten disease or injury which the applicant had had and which had passed away years previously without leaving a trace behind, to avoid the policy when called upon to fulfil their undertaking, while retaining, nevertheless, the premiums which they may have been receiving punctually for many years; and when we consider that the effect of the amendment (although this was not the object at all in view when it was authorized) would be to enable the defendants to set up as a defence in avoidance of the policy the non-communication by the applicant of a private disease which he had had in a mild form (not being one of the thirty-six diseases particularly inquired after) and which had been cured more than eleven years previously, leaving no trace or effect whatever behind,\u2014I do not think that the indulgence of permitting the defendants to make an amendment which would open to them a road for avoiding the policy by proof of the existence of such a disease, the fact of the existence of which was otherwise inadmissible, should be granted. However, we are not called upon to consider that question, because as matter of fact it appears by the judgments of the learned judges in the court below that the amendment, although authorized, subject to the above reservation, was never actually made; and we must consider the case as it was considered and dealt with in the court below as it stood upon the original pleadings; indeed I must do the defendants the justice to say that in the argument before us, I did not understand them to urge at all or rely upon the fact of the existence of this disease as avoiding that policy, but that they rested upon what they insisted upon as a good and meritorious defence, namely, the injury to the applicant\u2019s head relied upon both in the second and fourth pleas. But however that may be, we must deal with the record upon the original pleas as without any amendment having been actually made.\nAt the trial the plaintiff produced the policy which, upon production, was admitted.\nUpon this record then, whatever opinion a judge trying the case might form of the sufficiency of the evidence offered by the defendants in support of their pleas, it seems to me to be very plain that the plaintiff never could have been nonsuited either in virtue of anything contained in the Ontario stat, 37 Vic., ch. 7, s. 33 or otherwise. That statute only authorizes the court to enter a nonsuit upon a motion after verdict without leave reserved under the circumstances and in a case where a nonsuit might properly have been entered under the old practice, upon leave reserved with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, and the rule as laid down in Campbell v. Hill[7], (referred to by the late learned C.J. of the Queen\u2019s Bench in his judgment) and in the cases upon which Campbell v. Hill proceeds, has only been applied to cases wherein the plaintiff fails to adduce such legal evidence in support of his case as entitles him to have his case given to the jury, or, which seems to me but another expression for the same thing, to cases in support of which the plaintiff has given no evidence sufficient to warrant a verdict in his favor, or which the defendant would not be entitled ex debito justiti\u0153 to set aside. It is only where it can be truly said that there is not any evidence in support of the plaintiffs case that a non-suit can be entered. When the question is as to the value or weight of the evidence it must be submitted to the jury. Here, as it seems to me, the question was wholly as to the value or weight of the evidence as bearing upon the issues joined, and was in fact, eminently one for the jury, but in a case like the present, or in any case where issues are joined upon pleas the onus of proving which lies on the defendants, I do not think it has ever been held or suggested that the court would be justified in withdrawing the issues joined from the jury and in entering a non-suit because, in their opinion, the defendant has proved his pleas beyond all rational controversy. The only way therefore in which the case can be constitutionally disposed of is by a verdict determining the issues joined upon the pleas, either in favor of the plaintiff or of the defendants.\nThe learned judge before whom these issues were tried availed himself, as it was competent for him to do, of the Ontario Act, 37 Vic., ch. 7, sec. 32, being sec. 264 of ch. 50 of the revised statutes, which enacts that\u2014\nUpon a trial by jury in any case, except an action for libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction, malicious arrest, malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, the judge, instead of directing the jury to give either a general or special verdict, may direct the jury to answer any questions of fact stated to them by the judge for that purpose; and in such case the jury shall answer the questions, and shall not give any verdict, and on the finding of the jury upon the questions which they answer, the judge shall enter the verdict, and the verdict so entered, unless moved against shall stand, and be effectual as if the same had been the verdict of the jury.\nNow, under this act, the judge is not invested with the character and responsibility of a juror to find facts himself in any respect. He has no power to do anything of the kind\u2014his plain and simple duty is as a judge to enter the verdict in the manner in which the law requires that it should be entered upon the answers of the jury and upon nothing else. The questions put to the jury ought therefore to be such as expressly, or by implication, to involve all the points necessary to be determined in order to enter a verdict upon all the issues joined upon the record. I say expressly or by implication to meet the case suggested by Mr. Justice Patterson, in his judgment, wherein he says:\nTake for an example an action on a deed in which the pleas are non est factum, and special pleas such as fraud or duress or release. The deed is produced at the trial, and its execution admitted or proved by the attesting witness and not denied. No judge would think it necessary under sec. 264 to go through the form of directing the jury to answer the question: Did the defendant make the deed?\nIn this case it is obvious that questions as to whether the deed was obtained to be executed by fraud, or under circumstances of duress, involve an admission of the existence in fact of the deed; so likewise a question as to whether a release was executed as pleaded involves an admission of the existence of the deed as good and valid in law unless the release was executed, so that it might perhaps be competent for a judge upon answers being given to questions relating to the circumstances attending its execution, or to the question as to its having been released after execution, to record the verdict upon the issue of non est factum as well as upon the other issues. But unless in such a case, and indeed in that case and in all cases, unless there be the consent of parties that the verdict be entered one way or the other upon issues as to which the evidence is admitted to be conclusive, the proper course to be pursued as it appears to me in submitting questions to the jury under this clause, in order to enable the court to dispose of all the issues by the verdict to be entered, is to submit to the jury all such questions that their answers thereto will cover all the issues, although, in order to arrive at the points really in contest, it may be necessary to put questions which upon the evidence, or by admission, can only be answered in one way. This is the course which I have always pursued when acting under this clause, and for the reason that it has always appeared to me to be very clear that in acting under this section a judge has no power whatever to do more than to enter the verdict in the manner in which, in his judgment, the law requires that it should be entered, upon the answers given by the jury and upon nothing else. The learned judge who tried this case appears to have taken this view, and in consequence to have submitted all such questions as appeared to him sufficient to elicit answers which alone would enable him to enter the verdict required by law. I omit for the present to enquire whether any of these questions were well or ill framed, or whether they were accompanied with proper directions to enable the jury to arrive at a just conclusion in answering them. My present purpose is merely to enquire whether the proper verdict which the law requires to be entered upon those answers as they stand, is one in favor of the defendants? as has been ordered by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, setting aside the verdict which, upon the same answers, the learned judge who tried the cause had entered for the plaintiff. If a verdict for the defendants is not that which the law requires to be entered upon those answers as they stand, treating them as undoubtedly true in every particular, for their truth cannot upon this enquiry be called in question, then it is plain the verdict as recorded by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench cannot stand.\nThe answers then of the jury upon the questions submitted to them are, that the applicant for insurance had had no \u201cpersonal injury\u201d which must have been present to his mind as something coming fairly within the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d which he did not communicate to the defendants; that he had had no serious or severe personal injury which, through forgetfulness or inadvertence he did not communicate; that, in fact, he had had no personal injury which he might have been fairly expected to communicate, or which had any effect upon his general health; that he had not been afflicted with any of the diseases enumerated in the seventh question endorsed upon the application, nor, in particular, with dyspepsia; that he had not been attended by any physician for any of the diseases detailed on the application, nor for any disease whatever by any physician whatever other than Dr. Sampson, nor for anything other than a trifling ailment not amounting to a disease, and that in fact he gave fair and true answers to all the questions involved in the issues joined.\nIt must be admitted that the declaration at the foot of the answers endorsed upon the application does, in the terms of the policy, constitute a warranty, and the warranty is stated expressly to be that the answers are fair and true answers to the questions put.\nThe only breaches of warranty alleged in the pleas (and it is only with these and the issues joined in respect of them, that the jury had to deal) are\u2014\n1st. That the applicant had committed a breach of warranty as to the truth of the answer that he had had no personal injury, for that he had had a blow on the head which produced a fracture or depression of the skull which was attended with exfoliation of a part of the bone of the skull, and which caused also, to some degree, inflammation of the brain; and that so he had had a personal injury within the meaning of the question in that behalf, and that the answer \u201cNo\u201d to that question was therefore untrue.\n2nd. That the applicant had had one of the diseases enumerated in the seventh question endorsed on the application, namely, \u201cdyspepsia,\u201d and that therefore the answer \u201cNo\u201d set after \u201cdyspepsia\u201d one of the diseases there enumerated, was untrue, and a breach of warranty; and\n3rd. That the applicant had committed a breach of warranty in his answer to the following question, namely: \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician? For what disease? Give name and residence of such physician.\u201d For that within a much shorter period than 30 years he had received a severe blow on the head, the effects of which remained until his death, and that while he was suffering under such injury he had consulted, and availed himself of the skill of a medical man (one Dr. Lizars), and had concealed such fact, and gave no reference to such medical man. This issue, it will be observed, is, in substance, the same as that joined upon the second plea, with this difference, that the same injury, for there is no warrant for regarding them as being different, is relied upon as constituting a breach of the warranty of the truth of the answers to both the eightth and the fourteenth questions endorsed on the application.\nNow, upon the question of breach of warranty, the sole enquiry before the jury was whether those pleas or any and which of them were proved to be true, for, if not, there was nothing else alleged, and therefore nothing else legally before the jury raising any question which could be enquired into by them, impeaching the fairness and truth of the answers.\nAs I have already said, it is of no importance upon the question I am now considering, whether the questions submitted to the jury were or were not proper questions to elicit answers upon which the court could give proper directions as to the entry of the verdict thereupon; nor whether the evidence supports the finding of the jury. The point to be determined simply is, whether upon the facts as found by the answers, assuming those answers for the present to be true, the verdict which the law requires to be entered is one in favor of the defendants? And to this question the only answer which can be given, as it appears to me, must plainly be: that upon those answers as they stand a verdict cannot be entered for the defendants without doing open violence to the facts found by the jury, which facts upon the present enquiry must be taken to be incontrovertibly true. Trial by jury, to use an expression of the late Lord Denman, would be a mockery, a delusion and a snare, if upon such finding of a jury upon the facts involved in the issues joined, it should be competent for a court to enter a verdict for the defendants.\nThe answers in the plainest language possible controvert the breaches of warranty alleged in the pleas, and these are all with which we have to deal. The warranty is that the answers were fair and true. The finding of the jury is expressly that they were so. The meaning of the jury, as plainly as that meaning can be expressed in words, is that in fact the answers were fair and true in every particular, in the judgment of the jury. No other meaning can be put upon their finding, they most distinctly say that the applicant had never received any personal injury whatever, whether of a serious or severe nature, or having any effect upon his general health, or which he might fairly have been expected to communicate; that he had never been afflicted with dyspepsia, or with any of the diseases enumerated in the seventh question, endorsed on the application; that he had never been attended by any physician for any disease other than by Dr. Sampson for lake fever, as stated in the answer endorsed on the application, although he may have been for a trifling ailment not amounting to a disease, and that in fact, in the words of his warranty, all his answers to the questions put were fair and true.\nI confess that I cannot understand how it can be contended for a moment that upon these answers a verdict should be entered for the defendants, which would involve the entering of a judgment upon record that the answers which the jury expressly find to have been fair and true, were untrue. It is said that the answer of the jury to the seventh question put to them\u2014namely, \u201cHad he been attended by any physician but Dr. Sampson for any disease whatever, or only for some trifling ailment not amounting to disease?\u201d requires a verdict for the defendants. So to hold would, in my opinion, be to strain and pervert the plain and manifestly expressed sense in which the jury have answered the questions put to them, and to do open violence to the language of the answers as a whole which wind up with an express finding which is incapable of this construction\u2014that the answers to all the questions answered on the application which were involved in the issue joined were, in the terms of the applicant\u2019s warranty, \u201cfair and true;\u201d but, further, the amendment, which was provisionally authorized to be made to the fourth plea, not having been actually made, there is no plea upon the record upon which a verdict in favor of the defendants could be entered upon the answer of the jury to this seventh question submitted to them, assuming that answer to be one clearly in favor of the defendants.\nThe question was most probably framed to meet the event of the court approving, in case it should approve, of the amendment authorized to be made to the fourth plea, but which turns out now not to have been actually made, and the contention urged by the defendants, upon the evidence given bearing upon the plea, assuming it to be amended. The object of that amendment was for the express purpose of the defendants getting in evidence of the attendance of different medical men upon the applicant at divers times. At that time the private disease to which I have alluded had not been heard of\u2014it came out quite accidentally and unexpectedly afterwards in the evidence of Dr. Valentine. After it did come out it does not appear to have been relied upon\u2014the learned judge never drew the attention of the jury to it when submitting the questions to them, nor did counsel make any complaint of his not having done so. While the defendants appear to have laid no stress upon this piece of evidence, they did rely strongly upon evidence which, in virtue of the provisionally authorized amendment, they offered for the purpose of establishing that the applicant had upon different occasions been prescribed medicine for trifling ailments to which no specific name was given, and which the learned judge designated in his question as trifling ailments not amounting to a disease; and the contention of the defendants appears to have been, as appears by the frame of the fourth plea, that the gist of the fourteenth question lay in its first paragraph, \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician?\u201d, insisting that it was wholly immaterial for what purpose the physician attended, if he attended at all, and that therefore, in proof of the breach of warranty contained in the answer to that question, they could rely upon these casual prescriptions. The learned judge who tried the cause does not seem to have concurred in this view, and therefore he submitted this seventh question, putting an interpretation upon the fourteenth question endorsed on the application which I confess appears to me the most correct and natural construction to put upon the question, although the applicant seems to have understood it as enquiring after his earliest and latest medical attendant, to which construction I understand, Mr. Justice Patterson to concur in thinking it may be open. The learned judge, however, who tried the case, plainly, and as I think correctly, drew a distinction between the case of a disease for which the applicant might have been attended by a physician and the case of casual advice occasionally given by his medical attendant when in attendance upon other members of his family, or otherwise, to take horse exercise, or some opening medicine, of which there was evidence given which was relied upon; and specially to meet this contention of the defendants, and to provide for the contingency of the amendment being approved by the court, the learned judge, as it appears to me, and for no other purpose, framed this seventh question thus: \u201cHad he been attended by any physician but Dr. Sampson for any disease whatever, or only for some trifling ailment not amounting to a disease?\u201d rightly, as I think, construing the fourteenth question on the application. The rule for interpreting these questions on the application is, that the language used by the company is to be construed in the sense in which it would be reasonably understood by the applicant, and that if there be any ambiguity, the language must be construed most strongly against the company who prepared the questions. The language also is to have a reasonable construction in view of the purpose for which the questions are asked, and these are fairly to be construed in the light of their immediate context. Now, the fourteenth question is complete in its parts, and all these parts must, as it appears to me, be regarded together in order to put such a construction upon the question as a whole as the person to whom it was addressed might reasonably have put upon it.\u2014\u201cHow long since you have been attended by a physician; for what disease; give the name and residence of such physician; name and residence of your usual medical attendant?\u201d This question, appearing in a long string of questions, pointing to every conceivable matter requiring medical or surgical skill (recognizing the distinction between the professions of physician and surgeon, as appears by question 4, paragraph E) almost immediately after question 12 enquiring specially after certain diseases that are termed hereditary, might well, I think, be understood to mean, \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician for any and what disease? Give the name and residence of such physician and of your usual medical attendant.\u201d The question seems more naturally to point to, and to draw the attention of the person to whom it was addressed to, some disease for which he was attended by a physician, rather than to the case of his having been occasionally and casually, as he appears to have been, advised by his usual medical attendant, to take horse exercise, or to his having been attended for an ingrowing nail, or to his having been occasionally prescribed a little opening medicine; the learned judge taking this view, distinguished, in the question submitted by him to the jury, between a disease for which Moore may have been attended by a physician and what might be called casual advice in relation to something which could not, in the opinion of the learned judge, be termed a \u201cdisease,\u201d and for which he could find no better term than \u201ca trifling ailment,\u201d not amounting to a disease; and when the jury in answer to a question so framed by the judge, expressly find that the applicant never was attended for any disease, nor for anything amounting to a disease, by any other phy- sician than Dr. Sampson, although he may have been for some trifling ailment not amounting to a disease, their clear intention by this answer is to convey their finding to be, as plainly and as emphatically as they do in answer to the next question, that the applicant gave a fair and true answer to the question. This is the true intent and meaning of their answer to the seventh question, whether that answer be taken alone or in connection with, as I think it must be, their answer to the eighth question, but the amendment to the fourth plea never having been actually made, there is in truth, as I have already said, no plea upon which a verdict for the defendants could be entered upon the answer of the jury to this seventh question, assuming such answer to be clearly in favor of the defendants.\nIt is said, however, that upon the authority of a passage in the judgment of Mellor, J., in Hollins v. Fowler[8], it was competent for the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to read the finding of the jury in connection with other matters which the court considered to be established facts, and upon these materials combined that the verdict should be entered for the defendants. Assuming for the present the duty of the court under sec. 264 of ch. 50 of the revised statutes to be identical with their duty under a reservation similar to that in Hollins v. Fowler, a proposition which I do not think it necessary at present to admit or to deny, still a careful perusal of Hollins v. Fowler has conveyed to my mind the conviction that there is nothing in that case analogous to the present one, nor is there anything in the observations of Mr. Justice Mellor therein which warrants a verdict in favor of the defendants in the case before us.\nHe says there distinctly that:\u2014\nThe answers of the jury embodying the inferences which they have drawn are to bind the parties as being the true inferences to be drawn from the facts involved in the questions and thus control the court in considering how the verdict should be ultimately entered.\nHere there is no ambiguity whatever, no doubt as to what the jury by their answers to the questions put to them intend to convey. There the question arose upon a doubt as to the proper construction to be put upon their answers\u2014a doubt as to what the jury by their answers were to be taken as having intended to convey\u2014and in order to arrive at their intention Mr. Justice Mellor was of opinion that undisputed facts not expressly stated in the answers, but which appeared in the case, might be looked at. In the case before us nothing can be more clear or explicit than the answers of the jury. They leave no doubt as to what they intended to convey; and no verdict can be entered for the defendants without laying them aside altogether, and acting upon a state of facts diametrically opposed to the finding.\nWhat was done in Hollins v. Fowler was merely to read the answers of the jury in the light of undisputed surrounding circumstances, with the view of arriving at what the jury intended to convey by doubtful answers. Here nothing of the kind is necessary for, as I think I have already shown, the answers of the jury negative in the most explicit terms all the matters alleged by the defendants in their pleas, and upon which alone were issues joined.\nWhether or not the questions were such as to elicit answers which would authorize a verdict to be entered in favor of the plaintiff upon the issues joined? or, whether the answers which have been given were or not justified by the evidence? are wholly different questions, and were the only questions which, in my judgment, were of sufficient weight upon which to raise a doubt; and these came up for consideration under that branch of the rule nisi in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench which asked that the verdict might be set aside and a new trial had between the parties, upon the ground that the verdict entered for the plaintiff was contrary to law and evidence, and for misdirection of the learned judge who tried the cause.\nWhether the finding of the jury upon the questions submitted to them was or not against the weight of evidence, is a question not open to us upon this appeal.\nThe statute constituting this court, in its twentieth section, provides that an appeal shall lie from the judgment upon any motion for a new trial upon the ground that the judge has not ruled according to law; and in its twenty-second section that when the application for a new trial is upon a matter of discretion only, as on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence, or otherwise, no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be allowed.\nNow the plain and literal meaning of these sections, as it appears to me, is that, whatever may be the action of the court below upon a motion for a new trial, in so far as the judgment of the court was rested upon the ground of the verdict being against the weight of evidence only, not involving any point of law, there can be no appeal to this court. If the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had granted a new trial solely upon that ground it is plain there could be no appeal; but they equally exercise their discretion in declining to act, or in not acting, upon that ground, and we are equally excluded from all jurisdiction to interfere with such exercise of their discretion; and the reason of the thing coincides, as it appears to me, with the literal construction of these clauses of the statute. The power and functions of juries as the constitutional tribunal for the determination of questions of fact are well settled in our system, so likewise are the functions of courts of law as judices juris; and those of courts of original jurisdic- diction differ from those of appellate tribunals, and it is contrary to all our well settled ideas of the functions of an appellate court that in cases of trial by jury it should assume to weigh (it might be sometimes in over-nice scales) the proper weight which the constitutional judices facti should attribute to the evidence laid before them. Not that I consider very nice scales would be necessary to weigh the evidence in this case, but it is much better, and more in conformity with our constitution and with our system of trial by jury, that juries should sometimes render verdicts against the weight of evidence as estimated by trained judicial minds, than that their verdicts should too readily be set aside by the judgment of judicial minds, who in matters of fact are subject to the same infirmity as jurors are and not less liable to differ among themselves; but that an appellate court constituted as this is should interfere with the verdict of a jury as against the weight of evidence upon a case decided in the court below upon another ground (upon that judgment coming up in appeal), where it could not entertain an appeal from the judgment of the inferior tribunal upon the point as to the weight of evidence, would, as it appears to me, amount to a usurpation of jurisdiction. Although it appears to me that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench would have done better if they had granted a new trial upon the ground that the findings of the jury were against the weight of evidence than to have ordered the verdict rendered for the plaintiff upon these findings to be entered for the defendants, which, I think, they had no right to do, still I must confess that the vague and uncertain manner in which the scientific testimony laid before them was given affords some cause for the jury finding the facts to be as they have found them.\nThat the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict upon the first and third pleas is not disputed; the only ques- tions arise in respect of the issues joined upon the second and fourth pleas.\nWhat then is the sense in which the applicant for insurance might reasonably have understood the eighth question on the application, the answer to which the second plea, for the reason therein stated, alleges to have been untrue?\nThe question coming after one which enumerates thirty-six diseases is: \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease or personal injury; if so of what nature; how long since and what effect on general health?\u201d\nWhat we have to deal with is only the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as here used. Now, it seems to me the that applicant might reasonably have understood this question as not intending to enquire, for example, as to an abrasion of the skin of the face, or an unseemly scar which might be disfiguring to the personal appearance, but not otherwise injurious; nor as to a black eye, a sprained wrist or ankle, a broken finger, or such like injuries, which might have been received years ago, but the ill-effects of which had long since passed away leaving no trace behind. He might not unreasonably think that, as the question was asked solely with reference to his application for insurance, all that was enquired after were such injuries only as from their nature or their continuing character might fairly be considered as affecting the health or strength of the applicant, or the insurable character of his life, or as affecting the rate of insurance to be demanded, so that in the language of Cockburn, C.J., in Fowkes v. Assurance Association[9], upon a question arising as to the truth of the answer, the materiality of the matter not communicated should fairly form the subject of enquiry by a jury. It was for the judge to construe the contract as meaning that whatever the person to whom the question was addressed should reasonably understand as coming within the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d was enquired after, but it is for the jury in each particular case to say whether or not the matter relied upon as a personal injury was such, having regard to its effects, that a reasonable man should have understood it to come within the term. In Broom\u2019s legal maxims[10], citing Startup v. Macdonald[11], and Burton v. Griffiths[12], it is said that all questions of reasonableness, reasonable cause, reasonable time and the like are, strictly speaking, matters of fact for a jury to determine. But in the case before us it is unnecessary to enquire what things the person to whom the question was addressed might reasonably understand to come within, and what not to come within, the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d in the sense in which that term is used in the question, for the defendants have undertaken to dispense with that enquiry, and to narrow the issue by averring that the injury which they rely upon as establishing the untruth of the answer was of a particular nature, and upon the matter so averred they stake their defence, in so far at least as that plea is concerned, and if it should appear that the applicant had received other injuries, however serious they might be, if different from that relied upon in the plea, evidence of such injuries would be inadmissible under this plea. They say that the personal injury which they rely upon as having been suffered by the applicant was a blow on the head; and not a blow on the head simply, without more, for even a blow on the head might be so insignificant as to be attended with no injury whatever, but a blow on the head attended with certain specific injurious consequences, namely: which produced a fracture or depression of the skull, and which was followed, that is as a consequence of the blow, by exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and also to some degree by inflammation of the brain. Now upon the trial of the issue joined on this plea, it must be admitted, I think, it would be the duty of a judge to say to a jury, that if the applicant for insurance had received a blow on the head which produced the consequences in the plea stated, they, as reasonable men, should find that he should reasonably have understood such a blow to come within the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the sense in which that term is used in the question, but that it would be for them to say whether or not it was proved to their satisfaction that the applicant had received a blow which was attended with the consequences alleged; and if the evidence left a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury as to the proof of the allegations in the plea, they would be justified in rendering a verdict for the plaintiff upon the issue, or rather they should not render a verdict for the defendants. It must be admitted also, I think, that from the evidence offered upon this issue the jury might properly have drawn the inference that Moore\u2019s skull had been fractured as alleged in the plea, and that the loss of the piece of the bone of the skull and the depression of the skull were attributable to the blow which there was evidence that the applicant acknowledged he had received by a fall some years before, and not to disease or natural causes; but I cannot say that the evidence upon this point was so clear and satisfactory that a jury might not have entertained conscientious doubts as to the sufficiency of the proof.\nAll the witnesses spoke of the insured as a vigorous, strong, healthy man, all agreed that the old injury, whatever caused it, or whatever its nature, had no connection whatever with the cause of death, nor had it any effect upon Moore\u2019s general health; under these circumstances, in connection with the very rigid terms in which the company prepare their policies, so as to place them apparently in a position, while pocketing the premiums from year to year, to contest the most perfectly honest insurance, it is not surprising that a jury should hold defendants to the strictest proof of the allegations in their plea, or that if there should be any defect in such proof, or if the jury should entertain any conscientious doubt as to its sufficiency, that they should decide in favor of the plaintiff.\nHowever, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench have not thought fit to grant a new trial upon the ground that the finding of the jury was against the weight of evidence. If they had we could not as a Court of Appeal have interfered with such exercise of their discretion. So having exercised their discretion in not ordering a new trial upon the ground that the finding of the jury was against the weight of evidence, we have no jurisdiction now to interfere upon that ground.\nBut misdirection upon the part of the learned judge who tried the issues is also made a ground of complaint. Now, the rule as to misdirection is that a party shall not be heard to complain upon that ground unless he made the point at the trial. Here no objection was made at the trial as for any misdirection. The learned counsel for the defendants did, it is true, contend that there was no case to go the jury, for the reason that, as he contended, he had shewn two breaches of the warranty, in the untruth of the answers to two of the questions on the application for insurance. This was the assertion of a right to have a non-suit entered, not an objection for misdirection, and with that point I have already dealt. Upon the learned judge refusing to non-suit and proceeding to submit questions to the jury, no objection whatever to the frame of those questions was made. It was, I think, the duty of the defendants then to have objected, if he had any objection to make to the frame of the questions, or to the directions of the learned judge to the jury accompanying them. None was made. Some or one of the questions should, perhaps, have been put in a slightly different shape, but on the whole, it must I think be admitted that substantially they were sufficient to elicit answers to enable the court to enter a verdict. All parties seem to have thought them sufficient for that purpose. The defendants probably expected them to be answered in a sense favorable to the defence; but having made no objection to their frame, or their sufficiency, I do not think they could now be heard to make any upon that ground, more especially when we find the answers to the questions to contain everything necessary to determine the issues joined; but, in truth, the point made is not one of objection to the sufficiency of the questions, nor is it one of misdirection. The real ground of complaint is that, as the defendants contend, the answers are not warranted by the evidence, and the precise objection taken by the rule is one of non-direction, not of misdirection\u2014it is simply a renewal of the assertion of a right to non-suit the plaintiff. It is that the learned judge did not direct the jury that upon the evidence of the untruth of the answers to the eighth and fourteenth questions endorsed on the application, they should find for the defendants. From what I have already said it will be seen that in my judgment if the learned judge had so directed the jury he would have laid himself fairly open to the charge, not only of having misdirected them, but of having wholly arrogated to himself their functions by pronouncing upon matters of fact it was the exclusive province of the jury to pronounce upon, namely: that the defendants had proved the matters alleged in their pleas. I can see no pretence for entertaining a motion for a new trial upon the ground of misdirection.\nThen, as to the fourth plea, I entirely concur with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Patterson, that there is no good reason for disturbing the verdict for the plaintiff upon that plea.\nThe single point, therefore, upon which our judgment must proceed being that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench erred when they ordered the verdict which was entered for the plaintiff upon the finding of the jury to be converted into a verdict for the defendants, the appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the rules of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench discharged with costs. The amount recovered by the plaintiff is but a small part of the whole amount of the policy\u2014little more than the premiums received by the company and interest thereon. The only course open to us, I think, is to let this verdict stand, and to leave the defendants to take the opinion of other juries upon their defence to the other actions which, as appears, have still to be brought for the residue of the amount of the policy. They had made no objection to the frame of the present action, if they could, as to which I express no opinion, the point not having been raised.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for appellants: Rose, McDonald, Merritt & Blackstock.\nAttorneys for respondents: McMichael, Hoskin & Ogden.\nThe Respondents, The Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, appealed from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada to the Privy Council, and the following judgment was delivered by the Lords of the Judicial Committee[13]:\nJudgment of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the Appeal of the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut, v.

COLLIER.\nSIR RICHARD COUCH.\nSIR ARTHUR HOBHOUSE.\nThis is a suit by one of the children of Mr. Charles Moore, deceased, against the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, upon a policy of insurance on the life of Charles Moore, the plaintiff claiming the share to which she is entitled under that policy. The declaration set out the policy, together with the questions and the answers that were made to them, and concluded with a general statement that all things had happened which were necessary to entitle the plaintiff to recover. The defendants pleaded several pleas, of which the most material are the second and the fourth. The second plea is in these terms:\nThe defendants say that the answer given in the negative by the said Charles Moore, as in the declaration mentioned, to the question \u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury; and if so, what nature, how long since, and what effect on general health?\u201d was untrue,\u2014that the said Charles Moore had, some 12 years before the time when he signed the said declaration and answered the said question in the negative, received a blow on the head which produced a fracture or depression of the skull, and which was followed by exfoliation of the bone of the skull, and which also caused, to some degree, inflammation of the brain,\u2014that the blow was a personal injury within the meaning of the said question,\u2014and that the answer \u201cNo,\u201d given to the said question, was untrue and was a breach of the warranty contained in the said application; and that by reason of such untrue answer and breach of warranty, the said policy was forfeited.\nThe third plea, which relates to dyspepsia, was disposed of in the court below, and need not be here referred to. The fourth plea was to this effect:\nThe defendants say that the answer given to the question \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician?\u201d namely, \u201cAbout 30 years ago,\u201d was untrue to the knowledge of the said Charles Moore,\u2014that the said Charles Moore had, previous to the making of the said application, and a much shorter period than 30 years, received a severe blow on the head, the effects of which remained until his death, and that whilst he was suffering under such injury, he consulted and availed himself of the skill of a medical man, one Dr. Lizars, and that he concealed the said fact that he had so consulted the said medical man.\nThis plea is said to have been amended at the trial, and there has been some controversy as to whether that amendment was actually made or only taken to have been made; but their lordships will assume it to have been made. It runs thus:\nThe defendants say that the answer given to the question \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician?\u201d namely, \u201cAbout 30 years ago,\u201d was untrue, to the knowledge of the said Charles Moore,\u2014that the said Charles Moore, previous to the making of the said application, and at a much shorter period than 30 years, had been attended by, and had consulted and availed himself of, the skill of other medical men,\nwhose names are mentioned. Those were the pleas.\nThe policy is very much in the usual form of such policies, the material part of it being this:\nThis policy is issued and accepted upon the following express conditions and agreements: First, that the answers, statements, representations, and declarations contained in or endorsed upon the application for this insurance, which application is hereby referred to and made a part of this contract, are warranted by the assured to be true in all respects. The form of application contains a number of questions relating to a variety of diseases, such as apoplexy, diphtheria, fistula\u2014and a number of others. The eighth question, which is material, is this:\u2014\u201cHave you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury? and if so, of what nature, how long since, and what effect upon general health,\u201d to which the answer was \u201cNo.\u201d Their lordships agree with the remarks which have been made by some of the Judges of the Courts in Canada that this is a question of a somewhat embarrassing character, and one which the company could hardly reasonably have expected to be answered with strict and literal truth. They could not reasonably expect a man of mature age to recollect and disclose every illness, however slight, or every personal injury, consisting of a contusion or a cut or a blow, which he might have suffered in the course of his life. It is manifest that this question must be read with some limitation and qualification to render it reasonable; and that personal injury must be interpreted as one of a somewhat serious or severe character. Their lordships may observe, in passing, that the next question but one, \u201cAre you, or have you ever been, addicted to the use\u201d (not to the abuse or excessive use) \u201cof alcoholic beverages, opium or other stimulants,\u201d could be answered in the negative with literal truth only by a person who was never in the habit of drinking wine, or beer, or tea, or coffee (tea and coffee being stimulants), that is to say, by very few persons in Canada.\nThe next material question is, \u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician; for what disease? Grive name and residence of such physician.\u201d The answer is, \u201cAbout 30 years ago; lake fever; Dr. Sampson, of Kingston, who is now dead.\u201d Then: \u201cName and residence of your usual medical attendant?\u201d \u201cDr. Barrick, of Toronto, who attends my family, has known me some years.\u201d These answers would seem to distinguish between attendance by a physician for a serious disease and an ordinary medical attendant for trifling ailments.\nSuch being the answers, it is now necessary to refer shortly to the evidence, in order to make the summing up of the learned judge, the questions which he put to the jury and their answers to them, intelligible. The task of analysing it completely has been ably performed by some of the judges of the courts below. It is enough for the present purpose to say that Mr. Moore died of an injury to the head caused by striking against an iron bolt. The blow did not produce fracture of the skull, but inflammation attended by suppuration and extravasation of blood; the suppurated matter and extravasated blood pressing on the brain caused paralysis, from which death resulted. The medical men in examining this injury, and trephining, discovered that in the immediate proximity of their operation a portion of the bone of the skull was missing, that the brain in that point was covered only by skin and membrane, and that there was a slight depression into which the tip of the finger could be introduced. The great contention on the part of the company was to prove that the absence of this piece of bone resulted from a blow which Mr. Moore had received some ten or twelve years before, on falling from his horse or being thrown from a carriage; that his skull had then been fractured; that an operation was performed by a medical man whereby the missing portion of the bone was removed.\nAlthough evidence was adduced which was well worthy of the consideration of the jury, and on which they might properly have found, if they had been so minded, that this case on the part of the defendants was proved, that evidence was by no means of a conclusive character. The medical man, Dr. Lizars, who is said to have attended Mr. Moore at the time of the accident, was dead. His assistant or partner was called, who spoke of a fall of Mr. Moore from his horse about 12 years before, when he said that Dr. Lizars attended him; but he also said that at that time Mr. Moore was only suffering from a contusion, and that no injury to the bone was discoverable. He spoke of no other accident to Mr. Moore. There was the evidence of other medical men to the effect that it was probable that the injury might have been caused in the manner suggested by the defendants, but that evidence fell far short of direct proof, and indeed some portion of it was not irreconcilable with the hypothesis that the loss of the piece of bone might have resulted from causes other than external violence\u2014indeed, from congenital malformation. On the other hand, there was the evidence of a brother of Mr. Moore that neither on the occasion in question, nor indeed on any other occasion, was he ever so seriously injured as not to be able to attend to his business as usual. If that evidence was believed by the jury, it would go far to disprove the possibility of any surgical operation paving been performed whereby a portion of the bone of his skull was removed.\nThe learned judge, in summing up, commenting on the questions put by the company, observes:\nThey have stipulated that his answers shall form part of the contract which he is about to enter into. They say to him in effect: \u201cYou must answer these questions correctly; if from forgetfulness or inadvertence you answer a question incorrectly, we hold the policy void.\u201d They have a right to make that stipulation; but it is, in my judgment, a stipulation that should be construed with great strictness. When they put a very general question under a stipulation of that kind, it is only reasonable and just to put on that general question a fair construction; for instance, take the question they put with reference to any other illness, local disease or personal injury; I think that question must be read in a fair and common-sense way. If the applicant had had a headache the very day be- fore, and had not stated it in his application, it could not be said that this policy was good for nothing simply because he had not stated that; and yet a doctor would tell you that a headache was an illness, and that it came, strictly speaking, within that term. Subject to that limitation, that the questions are to be read in a fair and common-sense way, having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the man, and all the information that the company may reasonably expect to receive, I tell you that, in my view, the company have required the applicant to give correct answers to the questions they put.\nAfter some further remarks, the learned judge put these questions to the jury:\n1st. Had Mr. Moore any personal injury which must have been present to his own mind as something coming fairly within the term \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and which he did not communicate to the defendants? 2ndly. \u201cHad he any serious or severe personal injury which, through forgetfulness or inadvertence, he did not communicate to the company?\u201d 3rdly. \u201cHad he any personal injury which he might been fairly have expected to have communicated for the information of the defendants?\u201d 4thly. \u201cHad he any personal injury which had any effect upon his general health?\u201d\nThen he refers to those questions which relate to attendance by medical men, with reference to which the evidence was but slight. There was some evidence that Dr. Lizars had attended Mr. Moore, but the partner of Dr. Lizars said that attendance was for a contusion and bruises; and there was evidence of other attendance, but not for serious illnesses. With reference to that evidence the learned judge observes:\nNow the term \u201cattended,\u201d in a policy of this kind must also be read in a reasonable manner. The mere circumstance that a man had gone to a physician for some trifling ailment, and had received some care or attention from him, would not, it appears to me, render him the attendant of the applicant in such a sense that it would be necessary to state that he had been his last medical man, or that he had last attended him. It appears to me that the attendance meant is an attendance for something that deserves consideration, and might be expected to be present to the mind of a man when he was making an application of this kind. The object of the question, I presume, is to enable the company to communicate with the last medical man of the applicant, so that if he pleases to give them information they may get it. At any rate they would know who he is, then, and have an opportunity of seeking him; but they would not require that, if the applicant had got from him a piece of sticking plaster for a cut finger, his name should be in the application. There are a number of diseases named in the application. I ask you, then, in the first place:\u2014Had Mr. Moore been attended by a physician for any of the diseases detailed in the application? They were all gone through by Dr. Valentine, and dyspepsia is the only one he named; this you have dealt with in the previous question. The next question is a more serious one:\u2014Had he been attended by any physician but Dr. Sampson for any disease whatever, or only for some trifling ailment not amounting to a disease?\nThe learned judge proceeds:\nThen I put to you, to cover the ground as far as possible, these two questions: \u201cDid he give fair and true answers to the questions:\u2014Have you had any other illness, local disease, or personal injury? and if so, of what nature, how long since, and what effect on general health?\u201d Did he give fair and true answers to the questions:\u2014\u201cHow long since you were attended by a physician; for what disease? Give name and residence of such physician.\u201d\nThe answers of the jury may be thus described:\u2014They answer every question in favour of the plaintiff. With respect to question 7,\u2014\u201cHad he been attended by any physician except Dr. Sampson for any disease whatever, or only for some trifling ailment not amounting to a disease,\u201d they say: \u201cNo; only for some trifling ailment,\u201d thereby negativing that he had been attended for a disease.\nSuch were the questions, and such the finding of the jury. Their lordships observe that the learned judge makes this remark:\u2014\u201cThere have been no other questions suggested to me.\u201d That certainly would indicate that the learned judge was open to any suggestion from either side as to any further question to be put; and neither side appears to have suggested any other question. The judge upon these findings directed a verdict for the plaintiff. It was indeed objected at the trial that he ought to have told the jury that they were bound to find for the defendant; but, assuming that the question was one proper to be left to the jury, no objection was made to the manner in which he left it.\nA rule was obtained in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to this effect:\nIt is ordered that the plaintiff, upon notice to be given to her attorney or agent, do show cause why the verdict obtained in this case should not be set aside, and a non-suit or verdict entered for the defendants pursuant to the Law Reform Act, or a new trial had between the parties, said verdict being contrary to law and evidence, and under the answer of the jury to the 7th question, that he had been attended by other physicians than the one he named, though only for trifling ailments, was virtually a finding for the defendants; and for misdirection of the learned judge in not directing the jury that, on the evidence of the untruth of the answers to the eighth and fourteenth questions, they should find for the defendants.\u201d\nThe only objection on the ground of misdirection is that the judge ought to have directed the jury to find for the defendants.\nUpon the case coming before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, that court set aside the verdict for the plaintiff and directed a verdict to be entered for the defendants. From that judgment there was an appeal to the Appeal Court of Ontario. That court was equally divided; therefore the appeal failed, and the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench stood. Thereupon there was a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court of Ontatio and of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and directed the original verdict for the plaintiff to stand, being of opinion that they had no power to direct a new trial on the ground of the verdict being against the weight of evidence.\nThe first question is whether or not the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench were right in setting aside the verdict for the plaintiff, and directing a verdict for the defen- dants. Their lordships have no doubt that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench were wrong. In the Law Reform Act of Canada there is a provision that a judge may direct the jury to make special findings, and himself enter the verdict; and section 33 directs that:\nEvery verdict shall be considered by the court in all motions affecting the same as if leave had been reserved at the trial to move in any manner respecting the verdict, and in like manner as if the assent of parties had been expressly given for that purpose.\nIt was under that power that the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench acted. Undoubtedly, that court had power to enter the verdict in accordance with what they deemed to be the true construction of the findings, coupled it may be with other facts which were taken as admitted or were so clearly proved that no controversy could arise about them. But it is not in the power of a court to enter a verdict in direct opposition to the finding of the jury upon a material issue; and that is what the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench have done. Putting aside for the moment the other questions, their lordships refer to one question only:\u2014\u201cHad he any serious or severe personal injury, which, through forgetfulness or inadvertence, he did not communicate to the company?\u201d The jury answer that question: \u201cNo;\u201d that is to say, they find that the assured had no serious or severe personal injury. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, in direct contradiction to the finding of the jury, in effect find that he had had a serious or severe personal injury. So again, with respect to the other issue; the jury find that he had not been attended by any physician other than Dr. Sampson, the person mentioned, for any disease, but only for trifling ailments as distinguished from diseases; and they further state that he answered the question relative to his attendance by medical men truly. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in effect say that he had been attended for disease, and that he did not answer the questions truly; again a finding in opposition to the finding of the jury. Their lordships are clearly of opinion that the Supreme Court of Canada was right in reversing the judgment.\nThe question of a new trial remains; and a new trial has been contended for upon two grounds\u2014misdirection, and the verdict being against the weight of evidence. With respect to misdirection, it has been already observed that the counsel for the defendants, although he did insist that the learned judge ought to have taken the case upon himself out of the hands of the jury, did not make any objection to the direction to the jury, assuming it to be a case for them; and it has been further observed that the rule does not point to any misdirection, except the not withdrawing the case from the jury. It seems to their lordships, therefore, somewhat late for this objection to be taken; but assuming it to be open to the defendants, their lordships, after carefully considering the summing up of the learned judge, and the questions which he put to the jury,\u2014although, no doubt, those questions may be open to some criticism, and some form of words may be suggested which might, on the whole, be more apt,\u2014are unable to see that the jury were in any way misdirected or misled. They are, therefore, of opinion that a new trial on that ground should not be granted.\nThe last question is, whether a new trial should be granted on the ground of the verdict being against the weight of evidence; and this is one of more difficulty. The Supreme Court of Canada were of opinion that they had no power to direct a new trial upon this ground, that power being taken away from them by section 22 of the act of the 8th April, 1875, being \u201cAn Act to establish a Supreme Court and a Court of Exchequer in the Dominion of Canada.\u201d That section is in these terms:\nWhen the application for a new trial is upon matter of discretion only, as on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence or otherwise, no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be allowed.\nIt is necessary to refer to two other sections. Section 17 runs thus:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from all final judgments of the highest court of final resort, whether such court be a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction.\nSection 38 is in these terms:\nThe Supreme Court shall have power to dismiss an appeal or to give the judgment, and to award the process or other proceedings which the court whose decision is appealed against ought to have awarded.\nIf the last two sections had stood alone, the Supreme Court of appeal in Canada undoubtedly would have been entitled to make any order or to give any judgment which the court below might or ought to have given, and among other things to order a new trial on the ground either of misdirection or the verdict being against the weight of evidence. Their lordships have to consider whether this power, conferred by those two sections, is taken away by the 22nd section, or, in other words, whether the 22nd section applies to a case of this kind. It is true that an application was made to the court below for a new trial, but not only for a new trial; it was also an application, and this was the main point of the application, to enter a verdict for the defendants. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench were of opinion that the defendants were entitled in point of law to have a verdict entered for them, and did not apply their minds to the question of the granting or withholding of a new trial, nor did they exercise their discretion upon that subject. No appeal is brought in this case against the exercise or non-exercise of the discretion of the inferior court. It seem to their lordships that section 22 applies only where an appeal is brought from a judgment of the court below in which they have exercised a discretion; and that as no such judgment was given, and no appeal on that subject has been brought in the present case, the power of the court was the same as if no application had originally been made for a new trial, and that the Supreme Court could have ordered a new trial on the ground of the verdict being against evidence, if the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench ought to have done so. However, this question ceases to be of any general importance, an act recently passed enabling the court to exercise this very power. Their lordships may observe that there is a section in the local act, not precisely in the same terms, but to the same effect, limiting the jurisdiction of the appellate court of Ontario, with respect to which they take the same view, in accordance, as they understand, with the view of the appellate court of Ontario. Be this as it may, it has not been disputed that their lordships have the right, if they think fit, to order a new trial on any ground. It has been a question requiring serious consideration whether or not that power should be exercised in this case. Undoubtedly the verdict is not altogether satisfactory. If the only question for their lordships were whether or not they take the same view of the evidence as the jury, they might be disposed to say that the evidence on the part of the defendants somewhat preponderates. But this is not enough to justify them in granting a new trial; to hold it to be enough would be, in fact, to substitute a court for the jury. In order to be justified in granting a new trial they must be satisfied that the evidence so strongly preponderates in favour of one party as to lead to the conclusion that the jury, in finding for the other party, have either wilfully disregarded the evidence or failed to understand and appreciate it. Their lordships are unable to say in this case that the evidence is so clear and strong in favour of the defendants as to lead them to this conclusion. Taking into consideration, moreover, that the company have all along contended, not for a new trial, for which they appear to have insisted almost for the first time here, but that they were entitled in point of law to have a verdict entered in their favour, their lordships do not deem it their duty to send the case to a new jury, and thus probably recommence a long litigation.\nUnder these circumstances, their lordships will humbly advise Her Majesty that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada be affirmed, and that this appeal be dismissed with costs.\n[1] When the application for a new trial is upon a matter of discretion only, as on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence, or otherwise, no appeal to the Supreme Court shall be allowed.\nAmended by Supreme and Exchequer Court Amendment Act, 1880, sec. 5:\nSection twenty-two of the Suprerme and Exchequer Court Act is hereby repealed, and the following section is substituted therefor:\n22. In all cases of appeal the court may, in its discretion, order anew trial, if the ends of justice may seem to require it, although such trial may be deemed necessary upon the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence.\n[2] Now by the Supreme and Exchequer Court Amendment Act, 1880, it is provided that:\nAt any time during the pending of any appeal before the Supreme Court, the court may, upon the application of any of the parties, or without any such application, make all such amendments as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the existing appeal, or the real question or controversy between the parties as disclosed by the pleadings, evidence or proceedings.\n[3] This case was appealed and the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed the first holding of the Supreme Court. As to the second holding it was held that the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, sec. 38, gives the Supreme Court power to give any judgment which the court below might or ought to have given, and amongst other things to order a new trial on the ground either of misdirection or the verdict being against the weight of evidence; and that power was not taken away by sec. 22 in this case in which the court below did not exercise any discretion as to the question of a new trial, and where the appeal from their judgment did not relate to that subject.\nSee Report of Case, 6 App. Cases, 644.
