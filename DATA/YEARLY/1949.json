At trial before a jury, the contention of the Crown was that (a) he had actually set the fire, or (b) he had formed a common intent with one Bryan to burn the school, or (c) he had aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to set the fire pursuant to section 69 of the Criminal Code. On the offence of aiding and abetting, there was evidence that they had a conversation respecting the burning of schools, that he drove with Bryan to the scene of the crime, that some gasoline was purchased and that accused made statements in a restaurant to the effect that they were out to burn schools. Although accused was there when the crime was committed, he alleged that he was unaware of the intention of Bryan to fire the building, took no active part and remained in the car. The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. Held, Kellock and Locke JJ. dissenting, that the trial judge's charge, as a whole, properly directed the jury that they must find some act of participation on the part of the accused before they can find him guilty of aiding and abetting.\nHeld also, that the trial judge has a duty to review the evidence in relation to the issues and he has the privilege of making such comments and suggestions as will be of assistance to the jury, provided that he does not seek to impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury of their responsibility to find the facts.\nPer Kellock and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The portion of the charge dealing with aiding and abetting tended to lead the jury to understand that mere presence at the scene of the crime, the failure of the accused to get out of the car earlier in the evening when his companion had made some general statements to the effect that he approved the burning of schools and his failure to telephone the police, constituted aiding and abetting and there should be a new trial.\nMohun's case (1693) Holt K.B. 479; Reg. v. Coney (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534 and Rex v. O'Donnell (1917) 12 Cr. App. R. 219 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before Manson J. and a jury, on a charge of having set fire to a school.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgments now reported.\nThomas F. Hurley for the appellant.\nGeorge R. McQuarrie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellant and Nick Bryan were charged jointly with having set fire to the Queen Elizabeth School House on Lulu Island in New Westminster, January 31, 1948, contrary to sec. 511 of the Criminal Code. At their trial before a jury, after a number of witnesses had been heard, the learned trial Judge directed that the case be continued against the appellant only and that of Bryan adjourned. The appellant was convicted and upon his appeal to the Court of Appeal in British Columbia the majority of the learned Judges in that Court affirmed the conviction. Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented and by virtue thereof the appellant appeals to this Court under sec. 1023 of the Criminal Code.\nThe evidence left no doubt but that either appellant or Bryan set fire to the Queen Elizabeth School. There was evidence upon which the jury might have found that the appellant actually set the fire. However, the main contention of the Crown was that appellant and Bryan had formed a common intention, either in Vancouver or prior to the setting of the fire, to burn one or more school houses; or alternatively, if that common intention did not exist and Bryan set the fire that the appellant had aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to set the fire and was, therefore, under the provisions of sec. 69 of the Criminal Code, a party to the offence.\nThe evidence established that the Queen Elizabeth School was set on fire about 11.30 Saturday night, January 31, 1948, by either the appellant or Nick Bryan. These two had been together from the time they met in Vancouver, at the office where Nick Bryan was employed, at about 4.40 that afternoon, until they were apprehended in Bryan's automobile a few minutes after the burning of the Queen Elizabeth School. The contention on behalf of the appellant was that he knew Bryan only as a real estate agent and that they had set out from Vancouver at about 8.45 that night in order that Bryan might show him some properties in or near New Westminster that the appellant might accept at least in part payment for a rooming house, which he deposed he owned in Vancouver and which he had listed for sale with Bryan; that he was not in any way a party to setting fire to the school house.\nAppellant in giving evidence on his own behalf stated that on the way to New Westminster they stopped at a filling station where Bryan purchased a can of gasoline. This can, when purchased at the filling station, was by the attendant. placed just behind the front seat in Bryan's two-door coach while the appellant was sitting in the front seat. He deposed that he did not see that can so placed nor the bottle of motor oil that the attendant said he saw either appellant or Bryan pass over the front seat. Eventually Bryan's car was parked opposite the Queen Elizabeth School, the can of gasoline purchased at the filling station taken therefrom and the fire set. Hamilton, driving a taxi with three passengers, came up in time to see the party who set the fire go from the school house, get into the automobile and drive away at an increasing speed. Hamilton pursued them and notified the police.\nThe issues were defined and the evidence reviewed in relation thereto by the learned trial Judge. The objections to his charge in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice O'Halloran are set out in six paragraphs of the formal judgment.\nFirst, that the charge confused in the minds of the jury the evidence relating to the appellant as the one who actually set the fire and that of one aiding and abetting, as the learned trial Judge treated the case against the appellant as if it were one of common intention from the outset and that it did not matter whether Bryan or the appellant set the fire. The evidence upon which the jury might have found the appellant guilty of having actually set the fire was very short and will be more fully discussed later. It was reviewed by the learned trial Judge but not in any way did he relate it to or discuss it in relation to the appellant as one who was acting pursuant to a common intent (although if he did set the fire it might have been in carrying out a common intent), or as one who aided and abetted. More than once the learned trial Judge made it plain that the appellant could be found guilty as one aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring only if they found that Bryan actually set the fire. It is possible in explaining and discussing aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring that the learned trial Judge interposed remarks relative to the main contention of the Crown, that the appellant and Bryan were acting pursuant to a common intent, with such emphasis that the jury may have concluded, in order to find the appellant did aid, abet, counsel or procure, they must find that he had a common intention with Bryan up to and at the time of the setting of the fire. Instructions to that effect would be in error. In order to find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring, it is only necessary to show that he understood what was taking place and by some act on his part encouraged or assisted in the attainment thereof. Re Bernard Albert Kupferberg [1]. In so far, however, as such confusion may have been created in this regard, it favoured rather than prejudiced the appellant.\nThe second ground is that the learned trial Judge did not put to the jury the weaknesses of the evidence of the Crown witnesses relative to the appellant starting the fire instead of Bryan. The only evidence indicating that the appellant had set the fire was that of the two ladies in the back seat of Hamilton's taxi. They said the man who ran from the school entered the automobile on the side opposite to that of the driver, or the side upon which appellant was seated. The learned trial Judge in referring to this evidence not only stated that it was suggested one of them had made a contrary statement at the preliminary hearing, although that was not proved, but pointed out that Hamilton's evidence was to the effect that the man had entered the driver's side, and commented favourably on his credibility. He also referred to the other man in the taxi who, while he had seen the man running, had not observed upon which side he entered the automobile. It would appear that the learned trial Judge not only indicated the possible weakness in the Crown's evidence, but rather emphasized Hamilton's contrary evidence.\nThe third ground of dissent is on the basis of the omission of the learned trial Judge to instruct the jury that mere passive presence is not aiding and abetting. In discussing the meaning of aiding and abetting the learned Judge plainly indicated that in order to find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring they must find that he took some active part. He emphasized this when dealing with the defence, which at one point he summarized as follows: \"I'm not guilty. I hadn't anything whatever to do with this. The other man was wholly responsible. I was just an unwilling passenger.\" Other statements to like effect in his charge are quoted in dealing with the fifth ground. In referring to a slightly different matter, but also important in this connection, the learned trial Judge pointed out that the Crown directed the attention of the jury to the active acts rather than to the mere acts of omission on appellant's part. Mere presence does not constitute aiding and abetting but presence under certain circumstances may itself be evidence thereof. Mohun's Case [2]; Reg. v. Young [3]; The Queen v. Coney [4]. In this case the appellant admitted and explained his presence. If the jury accepted his explanation as above summarized then the effect of the learned Judge's direction was that they should find the appellant not guilty. In determining whether they would accept his explanation the jury would properly take into account all the facts, including the conversations relative to burning schools, first at the office in Vancouver and later in the evening, the protests and threats which the appellant deposed he had made to Bryan, as well as his assuring Bryan a short time before the fire was set that if the latter did anything wrong he would tell the truth. Under the circumstances of this case the jury would take into account appellant's conduct in relation to the other events during the evening and it was the duty of the learned trial Judge in reviewing the evidence to place before the jury both the contentions of the appellant and of the Crown. If appellant's explanation was not believed by the jury there was evidence in addition to his mere presence upon which they might well conclude that he was guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring. In this regard the charge to the jury read as a whole was to the effect that before the jury could find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring they must be satisfied of some act of participation on his part. In relation to the evidence and the issues the charge in this regard is not subject to exception on the part of the appellant.\nThe fourth ground of dissent is based upon the contention that the learned trial Judge neglected to charge the jury that if they accepted the evidence of the appellant he was entitled to be acquitted. These precise words were not used but the charge as a whole, and particularly those portions contrasting the evidence of appellant with that of the Crown, would leave but one impression upon the minds of the jury that if they believed appellant's evidence to the effect that he was throughout concerned only with a real estate deal and was but a passenger who never realized what Bryan had in mind, then and in that event he was not guilty of the offence as charged. In this regard it is appropriate to quote the language of the Lord Chief Justice speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Stoddart [5]:\nEvery summing-up must be regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which have been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence respectively. This Court does not sit to consider whether this or that phrase was the best that might have been chosen, or whether a direction which has been attacked might have been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or whether such topics which might have been dealt with on other occasions should be introduced. This Court sits here to administer justice and to deal with valid objections to matters which may have led to a miscarriage of justice.\nThe charge upon this point left no doubt in the minds of the jury that they were to find the appellant not guilty unless they were satisfied that he either set the fire, acted throughout with a common intent or aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to commit the offence.\nCounsel for the appellant at the hearing of this appeal particularly stressed the fifth ground of dissent\u2014to the effect that the charge as a whole suggested the guilt of appellant, discounted his evidence, minimized his real defence and did not state his contention in a way that brought out the real force and effect of his defence. The learned trial Judge defined the issues and reviewed the evidence in relation thereto. He reviewed the appellant's evidence and concisely stated the contention of the defence. In reviewing the latter's evidence he pointed out that as a witness the appellant was an interested party and discussed his evidence in relation to what might be expected under all of the circumstances. The learned Judge was not apt in one of his comparisons, but he went on immediately to state: \"Just because this man has an interest, you must not for a moment say his story is untrue. It may be true, that is to say, apart from other circumstances, the fact that he tells it doesn't render it untrue.\" He reviewed the history of the appellant as he, himself, had stated it, which set forth a commendable record, including a reference to the fact that the appellant did not adhere to the Dukhobor faith and was not a member of the Sons of Freedom. The learned trial Judge concluded his review: \"Now, there is the summary of it. 'I had no common intent with Bryan to burn this school. I did not take any active part in setting a fire.' That is the defence.\" Then when giving further instructions, he again stated that the appellant says: \"I'm entirely innocent. True, I was there all the time and I made these statements in the restaurant and all that, but despite all that, I wasn't in it. I was just an unwilling spectator of what occurred.\" Appellant's evidence was directed to two main points (1) Bryan set the fire and (2) that appellant did not realize the possibility of Bryan setting a fire and was in no way a party thereto. The foregoing summary briefly, effectively and forcefully emphasizes the real defence. The learned trial Judge unfortunately did state that the Crown could not have called Bryan as a witness, but here again he went on to point out that they were not trying Bryan, that Preston alone was before the Court and made it plain that it was only the evidence before them that the jury could take cognizance of.\nCounsel for the appellant took exception to the fact that the learned trial Judge expressed the view that Bryan in making the statement at appellant's rooming house that \"the house is going to be sold tonight\" in the presence of Mrs. Dodderidge sounded like liquor and thereby depreciated that evidence to the prejudice of the appellant. The evidence disclosed that they had been drinking whiskey and beer and this comment on the part of the learned trial Judge was but an expression of his view, which the jury need not have accepted.\nIt is the duty of a trial Judge to review the evidence in relation to the issues and it is his privilege to make such comments and suggestions as will be of assistance to the jury in arriving at their verdict, always subject to this, that he must not seek to impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury of their responsibility to find the facts. Rex v. O'Donnell [6]. Throughout he impressed upon the jury that the facts were to be found by them and that in so doing they should not act upon any view he might express unless they agreed therewith, and further, that if he neglected to mention any portion of the evidence they should, nevertheless, take it into consideration in arriving at their verdict.\nThe sixth ground of dissent is to the effect that the learned trial Judge did not instruct the jury that the evidence against the appellant was inferential and entirely circumstantial, that his defence was consistent with truth and that of aiding and abetting pointed to a rational hypothesis of innocence. The learned trial Judge correctly pointed out that the evidence of aiding and abetting was not inferential and entirely circumstantial. Apart from any other item of evidence, the remarks in the restaurant constituted direct evidence against the appellant. Notwithstanding this, the learned trial Judge did instruct the jury with regard to circumstantial evidence and that if their verdict depended upon circumstantial evidence, he stated: \"Before you can find the prisoner 'guilty' on circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved are consistent with his having committed the act, but you must also be satisfied that the facts are such to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner is the guilty person.\" This language is almost identical with that in Hodge's Case [7] which has been repeatedly approved. McLean v. The King [8].\nThe foregoing objections cannot, with respect, be supported. The charge of the learned trial Judge read as a whole set forth the issues and reviewed the facts in relation thereto in a manner that placed the case for the defence fully and fairly before the jury.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nKELLOCK J. (dissenting):\u2014I desire to refer to two only of the grounds of the dissenting judgment of O'Halloran J.A. The third, with which I shall first deal, is as follows:\n3. The learned Judge did not instruct the jury upon the legal meaning of aiding and abetting directed to the evidence presented by the Crown and the defence; for example, he did not instruct the jury that passive presence is not aiding and abetting.\nThe jury, having deliberated some two hours after having been charged by the learned trial judge, returned to the court room, the foreman stating that they would like the court to explain to them the meaning of the word \"accessory\".\nThereupon the learned trial judge told them that an accessory before the fact was a person \"who does or omits an act for the purpose of aiding anyone to commit the offence; abets, that is assists or encourages any person in the commission of the offence; or who counsels or procures any person to commit the offence.\"\nIn elaboration of that he said that if they were satisfied that Preston and Bryan set out with a common intention of burning a school (subsequently he told them it was not necessary that the two had had the common intention from the outset) and that Preston \"assisted in any way either by active part or by omission\" he would be an accessory and as guilty as the man who actually lit the match. The learned judge then said that he did not recall that there was anything in the way of omission which had been suggested but that the Crown had directed attention to Preston's \"active acts\". Very shortly after so stating, however, he said:\nThen the Crown directs your attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about it despite the statements of this man (Bryan) out across the bridge beside a school, and that he didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the fire. They say, \"Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct of an innocent man?\"\nIn his original charge he had referred to this matter as follows:\nI perhaps missed one thing in presenting the Crown's case. The Crown laid stress on the point\u2014that point was well enough taken by Mr. McQuarrie\u2014The Crown says \"Well, why did this man not get out of the car and leave him, particularly when they came back to Westminster from across the Fraser River bridge?\" Why in the world didn't he say \"Bryan, I don't like the way you are behaving\". Or, why didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that point. You will have it in mind.\nWhile it was perfectly in order for the learned trial judge to direct the jury's attention to the appellant's conduct as a whole for the purpose of determining what weight they should give to his evidence, I think that when it came to an explanation of the meaning of abetting in relation to the evidence the jury may well have been misled into an understanding that they might find in the things the appellant did not do, and which were enumerated to them, evidence which in itself amounted to abetting. In this I think there was error.\nTo constitute a person a party to a criminal offence within the meaning of section 69 (1) (c) of the Criminal Code, it is necessary that there be \"participation\" in the crime and although a person is present while a crime is being committed, yet if he takes no part in it and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he is not a party merely because \"he does not endeavour to prevent the felony or apprehend the felon\"; per Cave J. in the Queen v. Coney [9]. That learned judge quoted from \"Foster's Crown Law\", where the author states that \"if A happeneth to be present at a murder, for instance, and taketh no part in it, nor endeavoureth to prevent it, nor apprehendeth the murderer, nor levyeth hue and cry after him, this strange behaviour of his, though highly criminal, will not of itself render him either principal or accessory\". I take it that the word \"criminal\" is here used in the sense of \"morally reprehensible\".\nHawkins J. in the same case (1) said at 557:\nIt is no criminal offence to stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime.\nThe omission of the appellant to do any of the things to which the learned trial judge referred on his charge, were not, in themselves, evidence of abetting. In my opinion the jury may well have understood the contrary from what was said and have been influenced by it. I do not find it possible in the circumstances of this case to apply the provisions of section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code.\nThe first ground of dissent is:\n1. The learned Judge's charge led naturally to confuse in the minds of the jury, the evidence relating to the appellant setting the fire with the evidence relating to his aiding and abetting, in that the learned Judge treated the case against the appellant as if it were one of common enterprise and common intention from the outset, and instructed the jury it did not matter whether Bryan or the appellant started the fire.\nWith respect to this what is said by A. T. Lawrence J. in giving the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Kupferberg [10], is relevant. That learned judge said:\nTo prove conspiracy against the appellant, it is necessary that an agreement, express or implied, should be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, but it is quite unnecessary to prove such agreement where the charge is one of aiding and abetting. In the latter case, it is only necessary to show that the appellant appreciated what was going on and did something to further it.\nI do not repeat all that was said by the learned trial judge in the case at bar with respect to \"common inten- tion\". I think that the distinction above described was not very clearly explained to the jury with relation to the facts as they might find them. Further, I think that subsection 2 of section 69 of the Code was irrelevant and the repeated references to it could only have tended to confuse. I would not however, having regard to the charge as a whole, have thought a new trial necessary on this ground alone.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant was charged that \"he did on the 31st day of January, 1948, with Nick Bryan, unlawfully and wilfully without legal justification or excuse and without colour of right, set fire to a certain building, to wit, the Queen Elizabeth School belonging to the Corporation of the City of New Westminster.\" The evidence enabled the prosecution to contend that (a) it was Preston who had actually fired the building, or (b) in advance of the commission of the offence he had conspired or agreed with Bryan to fire the school and that it was the latter who had actually set the blaze, or (c) he had, within the meaning of sec. 69 (c) of the Criminal Code, abetted Bryan in committing the offence or conceivably as a branch of this latter aspect of the case that he had done some act for the purpose of aiding Bryan to commit the offence, or counselled or procured him to do so within subss. (b) and (d) of sec. 69.\nIt is sufficient to say without reviewing the evidence that there was some evidence upon which the jury might have found under (a) that the appellant had actually fired the building. There was also evidence upon which they might have found that prior to the time when the offence was actually committed he had conspired or agreed with Bryan to commit the indictable offence of arson (an offence in itself under sec. 573 of the Code), and that Bryan had fired the building in pursuance of such conspiracy or agreement. As to (c) restricting it to subsec. (c) of sec. 69, the fact that the appellant had proceeded to the place where the offence was committed with Bryan and remained in the latter's automobile while he set fire to the school, if unexplained, was some evidence from which the jury might have drawn the inference that the appellant was abetting Bryan in committing the offence (The Queen v. Coney [11]). As Cave, J. there expresses it, \"where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury.\"\nFrom the fact that the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury pointed out and commented upon the evidence which might justify the jury in finding the accused guilty under either headings (a) or (b) above and also defined the term \"abet\", it is apparent that all three aspects of the matter were submitted to the jury and, in my opinion, the real matter to be determined in deciding the question raised by the first and third grounds of dissent expressed in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal is as to the sufficiency of the charge in instructing the jury as to the law applicable to the charge of abetting and its application to the evidence. I have come to the conclusion that the dissent of Mr. Justice O'Halloran upon this ground is well founded. The learned trial judge in explaining the meaning of the word \"abets\" said that it meant \"encourages, pushes them on, that is about as good a way I think as I can put it\u2014abets any person in the commission of the offence or counsels or procures any person to commit the offence. You must keep that section in mind here.\" After summarizing the evidence for the prosecution he then said:\u2014\nNow that is the Crown's case. The Crown asks you to take all these circumstances and the final fact that one or the other of them burnt the school or set it on fire, and the Crown says to you, \"Don't worry who started the fire, but come to the conclusion that they were engaged in a common enterprise and that regardless of who set the match or lit the match, the other is guilty.\" The particular one before us today is Preston and the Crown says upon that basis, \"We ask you to bring in a verdict of guilty against him.\"\nAs a summary this was not complete since it did not state fully the three contentions of the Crown as mentioned above and it is clear that the jury recognized this as after retiring and being out for some two hours they returned and the foreman said that they would like the court to explain to them the meaning of the word \"accessory\", which clearly related to the charge of abetting Bryan in committing the offence or of aiding, counselling or procuring him to do so. In reviewing the evidence for the defence the learned trial judge said that the evidence of the appellant was to the effect that he had no idea of burning a school or being a party to burning a school and that while he had been with Bryan in his car he did not grasp the seriousness of the situation, saying in part:\u2014\nThat is the defence. I cannot elaborate on it anymore. It is very fresh in your memory. His defence is this: \"While I was with this man I admit, throughout the hours preceding, I did not have anything whatever to do with the buying of the gasoline in preparation for the making of the fire, or the oil. I didn't know that he seriously intended to burn a school. I didn't have any hand in it and I didn't leave the car when the fire was set.\" Now that is the defence. He says: \"I had no common intent with this man to burn this school\". Now there is the summary of it. \"I had no common intent with Bryan to burn this school. I did not take any active part in setting a fire.\" That is the defence.\nImmediately following the above quoted statement he said that the Crown laid stress upon a point which he had theretofore failed to mention: that the Crown said: \"Well, why did not this man get out of the car and leave him and particularly when they came back from Westminster from across the Fraser River bridge? Why in the world didn't he say: 'Bryan, I don't like the way you're behaving.' Or why didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that point. You will have it in mind.\" When the jury returned for further instructions, after defining an accessory before the fact and saying: \"abets, that is, assists or encourages any person in the commission of the offence,\" and again summarizing the evidence for the defence he said:\u2014\nThen the Crown directs your attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about it despite the statements of this man out across the bridge beside a school, and that he didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the fire. They say, \"Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct of an innocent man?\"\nThe learned trial judge had thus pointedly directed the attention of the jury to the failure of the appellant to quit Bryan's company after the remarks made by the latter when they were out at the property upon the Pacific Highway, his failure to telephone the police and his failure to protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the fire. These circumstances were perhaps evidence from which the jury might infer that Preston had conspired or agreed with Bryan to fire the building, but I think it much more likely that the jury understood from the charge that it was suggested that these facts afforded evidence upon which they might act in finding the appellant guilty of abetting the commission of the offence. I think this was peculiarly a case where after explaining the nature of the defendant's evidence the trial judge should have explained to the jury the application of the law as to aiding or abetting to the facts as they might find them. It was not sufficient, in my opinion, to define the legal meaning of the term \"abet\", to state the nature of the evidence for the defence and to leave it to the jury to decide whether, assuming the evidence of the appellant was true, he was guilty of the offence. In the absence of a clear direction, the jury was left to decide for themselves whether these various acts or omissions amounted in law to abetting. As to the necessity of carefully explaining to the jury the application of the law as to abetting to the facts as the jury might find them, I agree with what was said by Robertson, C.J.O. in Rex v. Dick [12].\nIn Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 8th Ed. p. 17, the learned author, summarizing the authorities, says that mere presence on the occasion when a crime is committed does not make a person a principal in the second degree (that is, as abetting the commission of the offence) even if he neither makes any effort to prevent the offence or to cause the offender to be apprehended, though his presence may be evidence for the consideration of the jury of an active participation in the offence, and that when the existence of a particular intent forms part of the definition of an offence, a person charged with aiding or abetting its commission must be shown to have known of the existence of the intent on the part of the person so aided. The appellant's position was, assuming that his story was the truth, that he did not know that Bryan contemplated committing any offence. As expressed by Cave, J. The Queen v. Coney, supra, at 539:\nNow it is a general rule in the case of principals in the second degree that there must be participation in the act, and that, although a man is present whilst a felony is being committed, if he takes no part in it, and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he will not be a principal in the second degree merely because he does not endeavour to prevent the felony, or apprehend the felon. In the same case Hawkins, J. said (p. 557):\nIn my opinion, to constitute an aider and abettor some active steps must be taken by word, or action, with the intent to instigate the principal or principals. Encouragement does not of necessity amount to aiding and abetting, it may be intentional or unintentional, a man may unwittingly encourage another in fact by his presence, by misinterpreted words, or gestures, or by his silence, or non-interference, or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures, or actions intended to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets, in the former he does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by, a more passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the power so to do, or at least to express his dissent, might under some circumstances afford cogent evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully encouraged and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the jury whether he did so or not.\nThe onlookers at the prize-fight whose position was considered in Coney's case were present and did not protest against the prize-fight being held and stayed at the scene and did not inform the police but they were not guilty of any offence, and, in my view, the learned trial judge should have instructed the jury that these matters in themselves did not amount to abetting the commission of the offence in the present case. In 9 Hals. p. 30, the effect of the authorities is summarized as follows:\u2014\nAll who are present aiding and abetting, when a crime is committed, but who take no part in the actual perpetration of it, are principals in the second degree.\nTo constitute a principal in the second degree mere presence at the crime is not enough; there must be a common purpose, an intent to aid or encourage the persons who commit the crime and either an actual aiding or encouraging or a readiness to aid and encourage them, if required.\nThe evidence of the appellant was to the effect that he had left Vancouver that evening in company with Bryan, in the latter's automobile, to examine some property in the vicinity of New Westminster, and while the latter had made various wild remarks about burning schools and expressed his sympathy with the actions of a fanatical sect of the Doukhobors which engaged in such activities, that he (Preston) did not realize at the time they stopped in front of the Queen Elizabeth School, or at any time prior to the actual firing of the building by Bryan, that the latter intended to set fire to that or any other building and that he had taken no part in committing the offence or done anything that might be construed as abetting Bryan in its commission. If the jury accepted this as the truth and if they had been properly instructed as to the application of the law to these facts, I would assume they would have acquitted the appellant. Upon the record as it is, I consider that it is impossible to say whether the jury found the appellant guilty as having abetted the commission of the offence or as having fired the building himself or as having been a party to an agreement with Bryan to commit the offence, the latter being the one who actually set the blaze. As was said by Lord Reading in Isaac Schama and Jacob Abramovitch (1):\nWe must not be too critical in dealing with the summing up of a judge after a lengthy trial and speeches by counsel. Nevertheless, the Court must be satisfied that when the jury find the prisoner guilty they have applied the right principle of law to the facts before them.\nThe prisoner was entitled as a matter of right to have the jury instructed as to the application of the law to the facts as found by them and the failure to do this was a substantial wrong. I think, therefore, sec. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code does not apply.\nIn my opinion, this conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Thomas F.

At the close of the case for the Crown, the accused, before making his election to call or not to call evidence, moved to dismiss for lack of \u201csufficient evidence which could legally and properly support a conviction\u201d. The trial judge thereupon dismissed the charge because of reasonable doubt arising upon the evidence of the Crown. The majority in the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal.\nHeld: The trial judge having the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury and no more, could only have decided whether or not there was evidence upon which the jury might convict. The question of reasonable doubt did not arise at that stage.\nHeld: In the light of the evidence which the Crown submitted, the case could not have been withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted to the jury until it was known that the evidence had been completed.\nThe King v. Hopper (1915) 2 K.B. 431; The King v. Comba [1938] S.C.R. 396; Perry v. The King 82 Can. C.C. 240 and The King v. Olsen 4 C.R. (Can.) 65 referred to.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (Roach J.A. dissenting) the appeal of the Crown from the decision of Parker J. dismissing the charge against respondent for unlawful possession of a drug.\nN.L. Mathews K.C. for the appellant.\nN. Borins K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Roach1, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Roach[2] in his dissenting judgment in the court below. The correctness of that judgment is emphasized by the position taken in this court by counsel for the respondent who contended that, had he failed in the application made by him to the trial judge, he considered that he still had the right, should he so elect, to call evidence on behalf of the defence. His argument, as presented to this court therefore, involved the proposition that, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the trial judge had the right to try the case on the evidence adduced by the Crown, and if he came to the conclusion not that he could, but that he would convict, then there should be another trial upon that evidence together with any further evidence called on behalf of the accused. Needless to say, no authority was cited in support of this contention.\nIn Metropolitan Rly. Co. v. Jackson[3], Lord Cairns said:\nThe Judge has a certain duty to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The Judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts, submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct.\nThis statement of the law is, of course, not limited to civil actions. It is equally applicable to a criminal as to a civil proceeding; Regina v. Lloyd[4]; The King v. Hopper[5].\nThe learned trial judge did not, in my opinion, keep these functions distinct. The fact that he was sitting without a jury made no difference. He had the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury would have had; section 835. He had no additional power. By section 944(1) it is provided that if an accused person is defended by counsel, such counsel \u201cshall\u201d, at the end of the case for the prosecution, declare whether or not he intends to adduce evidence on behalf of the accused and if he does not thereupon announce such intention, counsel for the prosecution may make his address.\nThe learned trial judge, upon the conclusion of the case for the Crown asked counsel for the defence if he were calling any evidence. That question was not answered, but a motion to dismiss for lack of \u201csufficient evidence which could legally and properly support a conviction\u201d was made. It is clear, I think, that no other application could have been made at that stage in the absence of an election on the part of the defence to call or not to call evidence. Had a jury been present, the learned trial judge could have done no more, on the application of the defence, than have decided whether or not there was evidence upon which the jury might convict; The King v. Comba[6]. Had he ruled adversely to the Crown in the present case he would clearly, in my opinion, have been wrong in law in the light of the evidence which the Crown had submitted; Girvin v. The King[7]. He would have had no right, as he in fact did, to proceed to weigh the evidence until all the evidence was in. The decisions are uniform.\nIn Rex v. Perreault[8], counsel for the defence moved for a non-suit at the conclusion of the case for the Crown and before declaring that he had no witnesses, on the ground that a fact material to the Crown\u2019s case had not been proved. The Crown thereupon moved to reopen its case to supply this lack. Langlais J. in the Superior Court of Quebec said at p. 237:\nCounsel for the defence could have declared that he had no evidence to offer and then he would have raised this question of lack of an essential element in his pleading (argument),\u2026 and then I would have been obliged to declare to the jury that this element was lacking.\nIn Perry v. The King[9], in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, on appeal from a summary conviction, Campbell C.J. said at p. 242:\nOn the conclusion of the evidence for the respondent, counsel for the appellant has moved that the appeal be allowed, as no prima facie case of guilt had been proved against the appellant. No authorities were cited to indicate just what cogency of proof is required to establish a prima facie case at that stage, and I have not run across any case in which the point was settled. I presume, therefore, that, in order to put the accused on his defence, a Judge or Magistrate sitting alone need find only such evidence as would entitle the Crown, in a jury case, to have the facts left to the decision of the jury. In other words, the criterion would be whether the evidence is such as a jury might, in the absence of contradiction or explanation, reasonably and properly convict upon. This view is supported by the wording of the Code, s. 726, which provides that the Justice shall consider the whole matter after hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and evidence adduced. The Justice or Judge, therefore, apparently does not exercise the function of a jury until both sides have completed their case; and the question of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not arise at this stage. I do not think, in view of section 944, made applicable to the case at bar by section 839, that the lack of any inference to be drawn from section 726 affects the relevancy of the above decision.\nAgain in Rex v. Olsen[10], also an appeal from a summary conviction, a magistrate had dismissed the charge at the conclusion of the case for the Crown without calling upon the defence. The case, like that at bar, involved a charge under sec. 4(1) (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously set aside the acquittal. O\u2019Halloran J.A. said at p. 66:\nI am of opinion, with respect, that the Crown in the circumstances here made out a case warranting conviction in the absence of any defence which might have been disclosed if the defence had been called upon. But the learned magistrate dismissed the case without calling upon the defence. With respect the case ought not to have been dismissed as it was. I must conclude there was no proper trial in the true legal sense.\nTo borrow the language of Viscount Sankey, L.C., in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[11]:\n\u2026 it is not till the end of the evidence that a verdict can properly be found\u2026\nIn the words of section 944(2) it is only when all the evidence is concluded that counsel for the defence, or the accused himself, as the case may be, may sum up the evidence. The public has an interest in the proper trial of accused persons and I do not think that the fact that counsel for the Crown at the trial apparently failed to realize at the time that the learned trial judge was going beyond the application made to him should, in the circumstances, be allowed to influence the result, particularly in view of the fact that the position of the respondent in this court, as already mentioned, is that the stage had never been reached when he had elected whether he would or would not call evidence. Had the question put to him with respect to that matter been insisted upon, and evidence been called, the case could only have been disposed of on the whole of the evidence; The King v. Joseph Power[12]; Rex v. Lenton[13].\nThe case on the Crown\u2019s evidence could not have been withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted to the jury until it was known that the evidence had been completed. Counsel for the respondent tells us he does not yet know whether or not the evidence was complete. In my opinion there must be a new trial.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: N.L. Mathews.\nSolicitor for the respondent: N.

The train then started to move and while it was in motion, the boy still holding on, one of appellant's employee, from the caboose of the train, shouted to him to get off. The boy, jumped off, fell and was injured. It is undisputed that the boy was a trespasser. The jury found that the boy, immediately prior to the accident, was riding on the ladder of one of the cars and that the appellant's employee, one Tremblay, was in the cupola of the caboose when he shouted at the boy the last time. The verdict of the jury was that the accident was due to the fault, negligence and imprudence of both the boy because he had no 'business on the train and the appellant's employee for shouting. The jury assessed the contribution of each at fifty per cent. Appellant moved the Court to set aside the jury's verdict on the ground that the fault against the appellant, as determined by the jury, was not a fault in law in the circumstances of the case. The trial judge refused the motion as did the majority of the Court of King's Bench. Held: The Court should have declared that, in the circumstances, the shouting, as found by the jury, did not amount to a fault in law and should have dismissed the action. C.P.R. v. Anderson [1936] S.C.R. 200; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Burnett [1911] A.C. 361; Addie v. Dumbreck [1929] A.C. 358; Latham v. Johnston (1913) 1 K.B. 398 and Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Jackson (1877) 3 A.C. 193 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, confirming (McDougall J.A. dissenting) the decision of the trial judge, Tyndale J., refusing to reject the verdict of the jury that appellant was at fault and awarding damages to respondent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLionel Cot\u00e9 K.C. for the appellant.\nLouis Fitch K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014On the 5th of March, 1943, between eight and nine a.m., the respondent's minor son Angelo boarded a freight car at the corner of Murray and Wellington Streets, in Montreal, which car formed part of a then stationery freight train which started to move.\nWhilst the boy was holding on to the then moving freight car and waiting for the train to come to a stop, one of the appellant's employees stepped out of the caboose of the train and, seeing young Lancia, shouted to him to get off. Young Lancia states that he became frightened, jumped off the moving train and a freight car passed over one of his legs. The employee in question then got back into the caboose and stopped the train.\nIt is established, beyond any possible question of doubt, (as found by the learned trial judge) that Angelo Lancia (the boy) was at all relevant times a trespasser on the property of the appellants.\nThe matter came before a jury and the latter found in its verdict that the respondent's minor son, just before he fell under the train, was riding on the ladder of one of the cars and that the appellant's employee, one Tremblay, was in the cupola of the caboose when he shouted at the boy the last time. Another finding of the jury was that at the date of the accident the boy was capable of discerning right from wrong.\nThe jury was put the questions which are usually put in similar trials in the Province of Quebec. They found that the accident was not due solely to the fault, negligence and imprudence of the appellant or its employees, nor solely to the fault, negligence and imprudence of the respondent's minor son, adding to their answer in that respect a rider reading as follows:\u2014\nThe affirmative answer is based on the fact that the boy got on the train, got off and on again and persisted in doing so despite the trainman's shoutings.\nThe verdict was that the accident was due to the fault, negligence and imprudence of both the respondent's minor son and the appellant's employee, or its employees, and stated that the respective fault, negligence and imprudence consisted in:\nTremblay for shouting and the boy had no business on the train.\nThey assessed the damages as a result of the accident in the total amount of $17,800, but, as they arrived at the conclusion that there was common fault, they fixed the proportion in which the respondent's minor son and the appellant, or its employees, contributed to the accident at fifty per cent each, as a result of which the amount allowed the respondent, who was sueing in his quality as tutor of his son, was the sum of $8,900.\nAfter the verdict the appellant moved the Court to set aside the jury's verdict and dismiss the respondent's action on the ground that the fault against the appellant, as determined by the jury, was not a fault in law in the circumstances of the case that it did not constitute a fault, since what the appellant's employee, Tremblay, did was the only reasonable thing he could do in the circumstances and showed sound judgment on his part; that it was absolutely clear from all the evidence that no jury would be justified in finding any verdict other than one in favour of the appellant; that, at all events, the facts as found by the jury required a judgment in favour of the appellant, as the fault attributed to the latter at the most would constitute an error in judgment only, for which the appellant could not be held liable; that it was within the province or jurisdiction of the presiding judge to decide whether or not the fault or negligence found by the jury constituted a fault in law; that the jury's finding in that respect clearly indicated misunderstanding by the jury of the presiding judge's directions as to the duty or obligation of the appellant towards the respondent's minor son, a trespasser, or refusal on the part of the jury to follow the directions of the presiding judge as to such duty or obligation, and that the verdict was contrary to law and also to the evidence and ought to be set aside.\nIn his judgment the learned trial judge stated that he would have had no hesitation in answering the questions put to the jury as to whether just before he fell under the train the boy was running beside the train with his hand grasping a rung of the ladder or some other part of one of the cars; which answers, in the opinion of the learned judge, would have been in accordance with the weight the evidence and would obviously have required a decision in favour of the appellant, because it would then have been impossible to find any fault against Tremblay, the employee. The learned judge stated that it was only with \"very considerable hesitation\" that he accepted the answers of the jury.\nWith respect to the appellant's motion contending that, even accepting the majority answers to the four specific questions of fact, the fault found against Tremblay by the majority of the jury was not a fault in law, here again the learned judge stated that, acting as a judge alone, he would unhesitatingly have decided in favour of the appellant. He added:\u2014\nIn view of the admitted fact that Angelo Lancia was a trespasser, it seems clear that Tremblay committed no breach of the obligation or duty owed to him.\nHowever, the learned judge concluded that as nine out of twelve presumably reasonable men considered that Tremblay's shouting at the boy constituted a fault, he \"very reluctantly\" refused to reject the verdict.\nLikewise, when judgment was rendered in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 2, where the verdict and judgment of the trial Court was affirmed (E. McDougall, J.A. dissenting), St. Jacques J.A. in his reasons refers particularly to the statement of the trial judge that he very reluctantly refused to reject the finding of the jury to the effect that \"Tremblay's shouting at the boy constituted a fault\". St. Jacques J.A. added that since the jury found that such a fact was a fault and applying what he construed to be the meaning of a certain passage of the judgment of Mr. Justice Duff, as he then was, in the case of Napierville Junction Rly. Co. v. Dubois 3, he concluded his reasons by saying:\u2014\nComme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, je me crois li\u00e9 par le verdict ainsi motiv\u00e9 et, cons\u00e9quemment, je rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nMarchand, J.A. considered the answers of the jury as being pure questions of fact without any implication of law. After stating that he could not say that the verdict is clearly against the weight of evidence (C.C.P., Sec. 498, s.s. 4), he was of the opinion apparently that such a consideration concluded the duty of the judge, in view of Article 501 which states: \"A verdict is not considered against 'the weight of evidence unless it is one which the jury, viewing the whole of the evidence, could not reasonably find.\" However, the learned judge said that he could not make up his mind to come to that conclusion. He stated that he did not know how he himself would have dealt with the facts, but that, at all events, he would not have considered a contrary finding of fact altogether unreasonable. He referred to what Sir Lyman Duff, C.J.C., said in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway v. Anderson 4, with regard to the duty of the owner towards a trespasser, that the owner should not intentionally injure the trespasser, not do a wilful act in disregard of humanity towards him and not act \"with reckless disregard of his presence\".\nThen the learned judge pointed out that, with respect, he could not subscribe to the opinion of the trial judge that if a verdict of a jury finds fault which is not a fault in law, he (the trial judge) is bound to accept the verdict for the simple reason that it is the jury's finding. The learned judge very properly says that it seems impossible to accept such a principle, a principle that if the verdict of a jury finds a so-called fault which does not constitute a fault or a delict in law, nevertheless the trial judge must accede to the verdict and give judgment accordingly. In the view of Marchand J.A. that would be unjust, contrary\nto law, and it would be the duty of the presiding judge to refuse to admit and to sanction such a verdict. There is no doubt, he added, that the young boy was a trespasser and that he placed himself in the dangerous position in which he found himself, that he had exposed himself to the danger of a fall which might have been provoked by an abrupt movement of the car, or by the gradual ebbing of his strength. But, in the view of the learned judge, Tremblay's warning was an order to the boy to let go of the car and to jump to the ground\u2014an order which, according to the learned judge, was evidently and obviously dangerous, with the result that the boy, seized with fright, loosened his grip on the rung of the ladder and fell a victim to the danger that would necessarily result, and this should have been obvious to all and to Tremblay in particular. The learned judge stated that this was an imprudence towards the child which had a direct effect on the accident which took place subsequently. Accordingly, Marchand J.A. concluded that the appellant company had failed to demonstrate that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or contrary to law and on that ground he dismissed the appeal.\nIn his dissenting judgment McDougall J.A. expresses this view:\u2014\nIf, in law, such finding does not constitute fault within the purview of the law (C.C. 1053), the very basis upon which the action rests is demolished. It would be idle to speculate as to the effect of such finding. Without negligence, in. a case of this nature, there can be no liability. As to the respective functions of the Judge and Jury in such circumstances, I can do no better than cite the clear and direct remarks of St. Jacques J. in the case of Bouillon v. Poir\u00e9 5 :\u2014\nPour conclure que quelqu'un est en faute, il faut d'abord savoir ce qu'il a fait, ou ce qu'il a omis de faire.\nC'est l\u00e0 le r\u00f4le du jury. Il doit constater apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la preuve, si les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s. Il ne devrait pas aller plus loin. Quand il a fait cette constatation, le r\u00f4le du juge commence alors. C'est \u00e0 lui qu'il appartient de d\u00e9cider si les faits constat\u00e9s par le jury ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imput\u00e9s comme faute au d\u00e9fendeur et si, en droit, ces faits comportent en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une faute.\nTo reiterate the statement of St. Jacques J.A., just quoted, it is for the judge to decide whether the facts found by the jury ought to be imputed as a fault to the appellant and if, in law, those facts, as found, really constitute a fault. McDougall J.A. continued that it is, he considered, beyond question that upon the judge, not upon the jury, rests the responsibility of declaring whether or not the facts as found by the jury constitute a fault in law. He added that in dealing with mixed questions of fact and law, notwithstanding the jury's answer, the judge retains his decisive authority to pronounce upon the law. It is clear, he says, that in the present case the learned presiding judge did not consider that such facts constituted negligence because he (the trial judge) said it was with \"very considerable hesitation\" that he accepted the answers of the jury. Nevertheless, the learned trial judge gave effect to these answers, which amounted to saying that \"Tremblay's shouting\" constituted a fault for which the appellant company and its employees should be held responsible.\nNow, the finding of the jury did not mean anything more than that Tremblay shouted. It was for the learned presiding judge to decide whether, in the circumstances of the case, that fact constituted a fault in law.\nI agree with McDougall J.A. when he says:\u2014\nWhat is not a fault in law can scarcely become such by the mere erroneous or ill-considered finding of the jury to that effect. They go beyond their sphere of action and usurp the functions of the judge when they assume to trench the question of law by declaring an actionable fault an act which is not such.\nMcDougall J.A. goes on to say:\u2014\nWith the greatest deference I cannot find that the shout of the brakeman, in the circumstances, constitutes actionable fault. His acts do not constitute a breach of the principle of law stated by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury when indicating the duty owed by the appellant's employee to the victim of the accident \u2026 Tremblay was exercising his best judgment in a difficult situation, not of his choosing, but cast upon him by the actions of the victim of the accident, and the very most that can be said is that in the imminence of the danger he apprehended, Tremblay may have committed an error of judgment in the course which he pursued.\nIn my opinion he did what any reasonable person placed in the same circumstances would have done. To have done nothing would have exposed him to even greater criticism.\nFrom a slightly different angle, I find it difficult to say that the shout of the brakeman was the direct and foreseeable cause of the accident (again a question of law). The element of a sure and certain relation between cause and effect is distinctly doubtful. The act of the brakeman may possibly be an \"incuria\", but not an \"incuria dans locum injuriae\". (See Davey v. L. & S. W. Ry. Co. 6 ) McDougall J.A. then referred to the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice of the Province in Collard v. Farrar 7, which seems very much in point in the present case, and also to the judgment of this Court in Grand Trunk Railway v. Labr\u00e8che 8.\nGagn\u00e9 J.A., agreeing with the majority of the Court appealed from, recited the answer of the jury to the effect that the fault, negligence and imprudence of the appellant's employee, Tremblay, \"for shouting\", was the only fault found against Tremblay and that this shouting consisted of the word \"Get off, get off\". On that point he added that the verdict of the jury must be accepted, because there was certain evidence to support it, even though it was weak. Tremblay did shout, he said, since he admitted it himself, but Tremblay did so because he thought that that was the best means of protecting the boy. Shouting alone cannot constitute a fault, the learned judge stated, but he believed that it must be interpreted broadly when taking into account all the other circumstances and more particularly the allegations of the declaration that one must conclude that this answer of the jury blames Tremblay for having shouted to the boy to get away, or to climb down from the train (it was evident to the jury that the boy was on the train) at a time when the train was moving and that Tremblay was aware of the danger that might result. In the opinion of Gagn\u00e9 J.A. that is the fault which the verdict attributes to Tremblay.\nThe learned trial judge very clearly stated what the doctrine was with respect to the obligations of an owner towards a trespasser. After such direction, the jury found the employee of the appellant company guilty of a fault. It is argued that the jury did not limit itself to the question of passing upon the facts alone, but that it has passed upon the law as well and that, therefore, this Court must intervene. In the opinion of Gagn\u00e9 J.A. that is the question to be decided in this case and he remarked that to him it did not appear to have been a simple question, because the answer of the jury raises a mixed question of fact and law. He very properly said that it was for the jury to determine the facts which gave rise to the accident; but he went on to say that in that regard the presiding judge, as well as the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), 9 cannot intervene unless the answers are manifestly and clearly against the \"weight of evidence. On the other hand, the jury should not be called upon to decide a question of law.\nGagn\u00e9 J.A. continued by saying that the jury must necessarily declare whether there was fault or not; that that is how the jury characterizes the facts which it finds to have been proven. The learned judge asked himself if that were within the province of the jury and answered by saying: \"I believe it, in view of the Canadian, as well as the English, jurisprudence.\" Basing his decision on that alleged jurisprudence and on what he describes as the \"doctrine\", he states that he finds himself bound (whatever might be his opinion as to the responsibility of the respondent with regard to the accident) to decide that the Court cannot intervene, the jury having determined the facts upon the evidence, evidence which the Court may consider insufficient but which, nevertheless, is on record, and also having passed upon the question of responsibility after having been correctly directed on the law governing the parties.\nIn the opinion of MacKinnon J. (ad hoc) there was manifest inaccuracy in the evidence which led to the jury's answers as to whether the boy ran along the train or was standing on the ladder of the car until he slipped and fell from the train. He pointed out that he could not possibly have got on the third car from the caboose, which was a considerable distance east of where the boy said he got on the train. He added:\u2014\nIt is clear from the judgment that the learned judge was greatly embarrassed in having to arrive at the decision he did and that can be readily understood. I am entirely in agreement with him when he says that he would have no hesitation in answering question 2-A in the affirmative and question 2-B in the negative, as being in accordance with the weight of the evidence. However, there is sufficient evidence to make it impossible to say that the verdict was one that, taking the evidence as a whole, the jury could not reasonably find.\nThe learned judge continued:\u2014\nThe learned judge also had difficulty in dealing with the finding of the majority of the jury that Tremblay had committed a fault in shouting. Although it seemed clear to him that Tremblay had committed no breach of any obligation or duty owed by him to a trespasser, he was of the opinion that as his charge to the jury was as clear as he could make it, and as nine out of twelve jurors considered Tremblay's shouting constituted a fault, me was reluctantly obliged to accept this finding. I find myself in the same position \u2026\nIt is evident that the jury must have considered that Tremblay when he shouted acted either with the intention of injuring Angelo or did a wilful act with disregard of humanity towards him or acted with reckless disregard of his presence.\nThe jury was instructed that if they found that what Tremblay did was an error of judgment, then there was no fault. Accordingly the finding of fault on the part of Tremblay means that the jury considered that there was no question of any error in judgment. My opinion that there was an error in judgment cannot be substituted for the opinion of the jury. I consider that Tremblay was faced with a situation in which he had to act quickly and what he did should be considered an error of judgment. Angelo was on a moving train picking up speed and had got on with the intention of getting off at or near Bridge Street. His position was rapidly getting more dangerous as the train proceeded. Shouting to the boy to hang on might have frightened him more than telling him to get off. Tremblay says the only means of stopping the train was by the emergency air-brake in the caboose, which would probably have jolted Angelo off the train had he applied it.\nMacKinnon J. concludes:\u2014\nI am reluctantly forced to accept the verdict of the jury as confirmed by the judgment a quo and to dismiss the appeal, with costs.\nThe law of Quebec on this point is (C.C.P., article 475):\nThe jury finds the facts, but must be guided by the directions of the judge as regards the law.\nIt is quite clear from this Article of the Code that the Quebec law is exactly the same as under the common law, that is to say, that the jury's province is exclusively limited to the finding of facts and that the law is exclusively the province of the presiding judge. It may be, as suggested by Mr. Justice Rivard, formerly of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), at p. 75 of his book entitled \"Manuel de la Cour d'Appel\", that the wording of the questions in the present case (it has invariably been the same in all jury trials in the Province of Quebec) is the source of difficulties which can be avoided by limiting the questions put to the jury to the facts purely and simply. However, no criticism can be made of the questions as they were put in the present case, since they followed the invariable practice in the Province.\nIt is clear, however, as the learned judges both in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 10 have said, that when the jury was asked to decide the fault that caused the accident that was putting. a question of mixed law and fact. Notwithstanding the form of the question, it cannot detract from the principle laid down in Article 475 of the Code of Civil Procedure, nor from the well-established principle that the jury's verdict must be limited to the finding of facts and that the law is exclusively the domain of the courts.\nWith respect, it was, therefore, the duty of the presiding judge and of the learned judges forming the majority in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 11 to accept the verdict of the jury in the present case as a finding of fact that Tremblay had shouted and perhaps also that such shouting was one of the causes of the accident, the other cause being, as found by the jury, that \"the boy had no business on the train\". The result of the jury finding was that the boy was a trespasser and, in its opinion, the shouting at the boy was a contributory cause of the accident.\nIt remained, however, for the Courts to decide whether, in the circumstances, the mere shouting, as found by the jury, amounted to a fault in law, or, in the language of the Civil Code (Article 1053) amounted to a fault or \"offence\" within the four corners of that section of the law.\nIt can be seen, from the review I have made of all the judgments of the learned judges both in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) (1), that not only was the shouting of Tremblay not an offence or fault in the circumstances, but, moreover, it was not a contributory cause of the accident of which the boy, Lancia, was a victim.\nTo arrive at that conclusion it is only necessary to proceed as did MacKinnon, J. (although he did not press his analysis of the facts to its normal result) and to follow the reasoning of the dissenting judge, McDougall J.A.\nOne can only ask what Tremblay could have done in the situation of imminent danger in which the boy had placed himself\u2014a situation, for the making of which, the boy was exclusively responsible.\nAt the hearing before this Court, Counsel for the respondent was asked several times what he could suggest that Tremblay might have done instead of shouting. He could not claim that it would have been better to have stopped the train immediately, because Tremblay himself explained that would have created a greater danger as a freight train of some forty cars suddenly coming to a stop would have jolted more sharply and caused the fall of the ' boy from the car. On the other hand, if he had done nothing, there is every likelihood that the jury would have found that his remaining inactive was truly negligence, for which he himself and his company should be held liable.\nNow, of these three alternatives\u2014stopping the train suddenly, doing nothing, or shouting to the boy to get off\u2014 one may properly ask which was the correct decision to arrive at, quite apart from the fact that Tremblay had to act on the spur of the moment and without the slightest hesitation, because the predicament of the boy was becoming increasingly dangerous as the train gathered momentum. In my opinion what Tremblay did was not even an error of judgment. I verily think that he chose the best way of protecting the boy and coming to his rescue, that what he did could never be apprehended as a fault or an offence; and that the course he took to try and protect the boy was, in the circumstances, the best means at his disposal. It really comes to this\u2014that the sole fault committed by any one in this accident was caused by the boy's own reckless act in getting on the freight car and remaining there while the car was moving. Such being the case, it is impossible to say that the finding of the jury (shouting) could ever be declared a fault under the law of Quebec. As it was not a fault, it was the duty undoubtedly of the judges to so declare it, and, therefore, to dismiss the action on the verdict rendered. That is what should have been done by the trial judge (C.C.P., article 491), or by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) (C.C.P., article 508). Canadian Pacific Rly. v. Anderson 12 is conclusive on the point of trespass in this Court.\nFor the reasons stated I think that the appeal should be allowed and the action of the respondent dismissed, with costs throughout.\nKerwin J.:\u2014There was no evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that the shouting of Tremblay, said by them to be the latter's fault, was negligence contributing to the accident. The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, all with costs if demanded.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 13, for the Province of Quebec, affirming a judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent. The action was brought to recover damages in respect of personal injuries sustained by the minor son of the respondent when injured by being run over by one of the appellant's trains. The boy, who was nine and one-half years old, had climbed on to the side of a car and the injuries were sustained when he attempted to get off the moving train in circumstances1 to be mentioned.\nIn his declaration the respondent alleged that his son boarded the freight car while the train was stationary; that the train suddenly started; that while it was in motion an employee of the appellant shouted to the boy from the steps of the caboose to get off; and that when the boy did not do so the employee pretended to pick up something from the side of the rail to throw at him, whereupon the boy became frightened and in attempting to jump fell under the moving train.\nThe evidence for the respondent was to the effect that the boy was on the ladder on the side of the car firmly grasping the rungs and did not get off at any time until the appellant's employee shouted and made the gesture referred to in the declaration from the latter's position on the steps of the van. The evidence of the appellant's employee, Tremblay, however, is that he was not on the steps of the caboose at any time but in the cupola on the top; that he saw two boys on the train, one on the front of the second car from the caboose and one on the rear of the third car, and that there were several other boys on the ground further away; that he called to the two boys to get off and that they did so. He says that the respondent's son, when first seen by him, was holding on to one of the cars and running beside it and that when he shouted the boy released his hold and let a couple of the cars pass but then grabbed another and ran about fifty feet. When Tremblay shouted again he says the boy fell under the car. At this time the train was proceeding at about seven or eight miles an hour. Tremblay immediately applied the brakes and brought the train to a stop in about 200 feet. On being asked why he had not put on the brakes and stopped the train before the boy fell he said that in his opinion it would have caused a jerk which might have thrown the boy from the train and that in doing what he did he had acted in accordance with his best judgment under the circumstances.\nIn answer to specific questions the jury found that the boy, just before he fell, was not running beside the train with one hand grasping the ladder or some other part of the car but was riding on the ladder itself. They also found that Tremblay was not standing on the steps of the caboose when he shouted but was in the cupola. They also found that the accident was due to the joint negligence of the boy and Tremblay, this negligence consisting on the part of \"Tremblay for shouting\" and on the part of the boy in that he \"had no business on the train.\" All other allegations of negligence were therefore negatived. The jury found the boy and Tremblay guilty of fault in equal degrees.\nThe learned trial judge refused a motion by the appellant to dismiss the action on the answers of the jury, being of opinion that although the boy was a trespasser, as was admitted, and although it seemed clear to him that Tremblay had committed no breach of duty, nevertheless he could not interfere with the verdict.\nIn the Court of Appeal 14, MacKinnon J. took the same view. He pointed out that the jury had been instructed that if they found that what Tremblay did was an error of judgment, there was no fault and that, accordingly, the finding of fault on the part of Tremblay excluded such error. The learned judge was of opinion that his own view that Tremblay's action amounted merely to error of judgment could not be substituted for the opinion of the jury.\nAs he expresses so clearly and concisely the situation which Tremblay faced at the time, I quote from the notes of the learned judge:\nI consider that Tremblay was faced with a situation in which he had to act quickly and what he did should be considered an error of judgment. Angelo was on a moving train picking up speed and had got on with, the intention of getting off at or near Bridge Street. His position was rapidly getting more dangerous as the train proceeded. Shouting to the boy to bang on might have frightened him more than telling him to get off. Tremblay says the only means of stopping the train was by the emergency air-brake in the caboose which would probably have jolted Angelo off the train had he applied it.\nMcDougall J. dissented from the majority. Accepting the findings of fact made by the jury, he was of opinion that the answer of the jury with respect to Tremblay did not constitute fault in law within the meaning of Article 1053 of the Civil Code and that the act of Tremblay in shouting, while it may have been causa sine qua non, was not causa causans.\nWith respect to the duty owing to the infant trespasser, the learned trial judge charged the jury in accordance with the law laid down in Anderson v. C.P.R. 15. In that case however, the presence of the trespasser upon the train was not known to the railway company. It was known however, in Canadian Northern Railway Co. v. Diplock 16, but in that case, as in Anderson's case, both of which followed the decision of the Privy Council in Grand Trunk Railway v. Barnett 17, it was held that it is not sufficient to enable one who is a trespasser to recover, merely to show negligence on the part of the servants of the railway. In the case where the presence of the trespasser is known to the servants of the railway, the respondent contends that these authorities are not applicable in the Province of Quebec. The judgment of Lord Wright at least, in Glasgow v. Muir 18, indicates that with respect to positive acts of an occupier of premises, the duty owed to a trespasser may not differ from that owed to other classes of persons who are known to be thereon. In the case at bar I am content to deal with the case on the basis, although without deciding the point, that the duty owed to the minor in the case at bar was of this higher nature. But, in my opinion, the answer made by the jury with respect to Tremblay does not amount to a finding of fault in law. It is of course clear that while it is for the jury to find the facts it is the function of the court to determine whether or not there is any evidence to support the findings and also to decide whether any particular answer is in law a finding of fault or negligence; Verdun v. Yeoman 19; McKay v. Grand Trunk Railway 20; Bouillon v. Poire 21, per St.-Jacques J.\nIn the case at bar it is plain that the act of negligence pleaded as against the appellant was not established in evidence. The jury have negatived anything of a threatening nature in the gesture made by Tremblay or that he was in the position the respondent alleged he was. The situation confronting Tremblay is as I have said, clearly expressed by MacKinnon J. and I think there was no element of negligence in the choice which he made. Upon the facts as found by the jury, any finding that Tremblay fell short of the conduct of a reasonably careful man must be regarded as perverse. That situation had been created by the wrongful act of the boy and forced upon him the necessity of making a choice. As to stopping the train, he did not do so because he thought the shock might throw the boy off. Had he done nothing, the train was gathering speed and the boy might well have been placed in a more dangerous situation later if he were allowed to remain. He did not know that the boy himself intended to jump off at Bridge Street, a comparatively short distance further on. There is no allegation and no finding that the speed of the train at the time the boy attempted to get off was such that Tremblay should not have ordered him off at that time. Tremblay says the speed was from seven to eight miles an hour and the respondent himself in his factum describes this speed as slow. Tremblay had observed the other boys jump off very shortly before. While the act of leaving any moving train no doubt involves some danger, I do not think that Tremblay's act in ordering the boy off amounts to any breach of duty toward him in the circumstances. It could not be more than an error of judgment, even if it could be said to be an error, and it was not open to the jury, in my opinion, to bring it to the level of fault.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs here and below if demanded.\nLocke J.:\u2014In the plaintiff's declaration it is alleged that the infant plaintiff boarded a freight car of the defendant company which was part of a train then stationary at the corner of Murray and Wellington Streets in Montreal, that the train suddenly started to move and that while it was in motion an employee of the defendant company stepped out of the caboose of the train and \"on seeing the said boy imprudently shouted to him to get off.\" There were further allegations that when the boy did not get off the train an employee of the defendant threatened violence to him and pretended to pick up something from the side of the rail to throw at him, whereupon the boy being frightened had jumped and fallen under the wheels of the moving train. Various other charges of negligence were made but all of these, including the allegation that an employee of the defendant had frightened the boy by threatening him with violence or pretending to pick up a missile, were negatived by the answer made by the jury that the negligence attributable to the defendant was that of its employee Tremblay \"for shouting\"; Andreas v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. 22.\nThe undisputed fact is that the infant plaintiff was a trespasser upon the property of the defendant. Upon conflicting evidence the jury found that immediately prior to the accident he was riding on the ladder at the side of one of the freight cars of the moving train, and not running beside the train with his hand grasping a rung of the ladder as stated by Tremblay, an air brakeman employed by the defendant and who was riding at the time in the cupola of the caboose at the rear of the train. The boy admittedly got on to the train without permission, with the intention of riding on it a short distance to the west to the vicinity where he lived and, when observed by Tremblay, the train was travelling some seven or eight miles an hour and it must be taken that he jumped from the ladder at the side of the freight car after the brakeman had shouted to him to \"get out of there.\"\nThe defendant company was operating the train in question upon its right-of-way in the exercise of its statutory powers. Of necessity, the operation of freight and other trains involves danger to those who trespass upon the right-of-way in the path of these trains, or who attempt to ride upon the freight cars without permission. For damages caused by the operation of such trains in pursuance of its powers the defendant is not, in the absence of negligence, liable. Here the infant plaintiff, in defiance of the provisions of sec. 443 of the Railway Act, cap. 170, R.S.C. 1927, trespassed upon the freight car in question and the contention to be made on his behalf must be put upon the ground that while he had of his own motion unlawfully-placed himself in a position of danger, the defendant or its servants had failed in some duty owed to him to protect him from the consequences of his own rash act. In the situation in which Tremblay was placed when he saw the boy he might perhaps have shouted to him to hang on tightly to the ladder or conceivably have brought the train to a halt by using the emergency air brake or have followed the course which he did pursue in shouting to the boy to get off the train. There was risk to the boy in continuing to ride on the ladder at the side of the car, since the train was picking up speed. There was danger if the air brakes were applied suddenly since, as stated by Tremblay, the jolting stop might shake the boy off the ladder. There was also obviously some risk to the boy if he jumped from the train though, in view of the slow speed at which it was travelling, this would appear to be slight. In these circumstances Tremblay ordered the boy to get off the train and it is this act which the jury found to be negligent and to have contributed to the accident.\nIn Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Barnett 23 where the plaintiff was a trespasser on the railway company's property and on a train which to his knowledge was not at the time in use as a passenger train and on which he had taken up a precarious position on the platform and steps of the carriage, Lord Robson said that the railway company were undoubtedly under a duty not wilfully to injure him, nor were they entitled, unnecessarily and knowingly, to increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way, and that though he was a trespasser a question might arise as to whether or not the injury was due to some wilful act of the owner of the land involving something worse than the absence of reasonable care. It was this statement of the law which was adopted by Duff, C.J. in Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Anderson 24, and while it does not appear that in either of these cases the presence of the trespasser was known to the employees of the railway company, the manner in which the principle is stated makes it quite clear that its application is not limited to such cases. In Addie's case 25 Viscount Dunedin quoted with approval what was said by Hamilton, L.J. in Latham v. Johnson 26, that \"the owner of the property is under a duty not to injure the trespasser wilfully; 'not to do a wilful act in reckless disregard of ordinary humanity toward him'; but otherwise a man trespasses at his own risk,\" and said further that as to trespassers there is no duty, save only that of not inflicting malicious injury. As to the decision in Excelsior Wire Rope v. Callan 27, I agree with what was said by Humphreys, J. in Walder v. the Mayor, Alderman, etc. of Hammersmith 28, that that case was decided on the fact that it did not matter whether the child who had been injured was a trespasser or not, since there was such carelessness amounting to recklessness on the part of the owners of the property, the persons responsible for the land, as would have given a good cause of action even to a trespasser. Applying the law as thus stated to the present case the judgment cannot, in my opinion, be supported. The plaintiffs had pleaded various acts of negligence, including the alleged act of Tremblay in frightening the boy by a threatening gesture as if he was going to throw a stone so that, as matters stood at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, I think the learned trial judge would not have considered withdrawing the case from the jury. If, however, the plaintiff's case as proven had been as found by the jury, that the only act complained of was that Tremblay shouted at the boy to get off, a motion for non-suit should have succeeded on the ground that no facts had been established in evidence from which negligence might be reasonably inferred. (Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson 29 ).\nIn the judgment of the learned trial judge on the motion made by the defendant after the jury's verdict the following passage appears:\u2014\nThe next important point in Defendant's Motion is the contention that, even accepting the majority answers to the four specific questions of fact, the fault found against Tremblay by the majority of the Jury is not a fault in law. Here again the undersigned, acting as a Judge alone, would unhesitatingly have decided in favour of Defendant. In view of the admitted fact that Angelo Lancia was a trespasser, it seems clear that Tremblay committed no breach of the obligation or duty owed to him.\nI take from this that he considered that negligence could not be inferred from the mere fact that Tremblay had shouted to the boy to get off the train under the circumstances then existing. The position of the plaintiff cannot possibly be improved by the fact that, rejecting the evidence as to the threat by Tremblay that he would throw the stone and the various other charges of negligence, the jury found that shouting alone was actionable. If Tremblay, instead of shouting to the boy to get off the slowly moving train, had told him to remain where he was and the boy had thereafter fallen, or had he stopped the train with the emergency air brake and the jolt had thrown the boy under the wheels, it could scarcely be contended that there was a right of action for the resulting injuries. It seems to me that the present claim is equally without foundation. It was the boy who was in danger through his own actions and if Tremblay erred in the course he took for the boy's protection (and I think he did not), there is no actionable negligence in the circumstances of this case. The reckless driver of an automobile who, by his negligence, places the driver of another vehicle in a position of danger cannot complain if in the situation thus created the other person makes an error in judgment and a collision results. A trespasser cannot, in my opinion, create a situation of danger to himself and complain of an error of judgment in the steps taken to extricate him. There was here no evidence upon which to find that there had been any wilful act in disregard of humanity towards the boy, nor any act done with reckless disregard of his presence, nor any wilful act involving something more than the absence of reasonable care nor, in the language of Viscount Dunedin in Addie's case 30, any \"malicious injury.\"\nIn my opinion, the finding made that the act of Tremblay in shouting under the circumstances of this case amounted to fault or negligence cannot be supported. The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. If costs are asked they should follow the event.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cot\u00e9 & Perrault.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Allan A.

G. Ahem K.C. for the motion.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nThe action came on for hearing before Tyndale C.J. and a jury on the 23rd and 24th days of February, 1948. At the close of the plaintiff's case the defendant moved that the action be dismissed on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence for the jury to find a verdict in the plaintiff's favour. The motion was dismissed by the presiding judge. As the defendant indicated its intention to appeal from that judgment, Tyndale C.J. told the jury that they might separate and that they would be called back to continue the hearing of the case if and when such appeal was disposed of.\nThe defendant then applied to one of the judges of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) for leave to appeal to that Court from the decision of Tyndale C.J. (C.C.P., 1211).\nThe motion came on for hearing before St-Jacques J., who granted it; but the plaintiffs then moved the full Court to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction, notwithstanding the permission granted by St-Jacques J.\nThe full Court granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the appeal to it on the ground that the judgment appealed from was interlocutory and that' it did not fall within the provisions of Sec. 46, C.C.P., and that jurisdiction to deal with it could not be conferred upon the Court by a judge of that Court granting leave to appeal.\nThe defendant then appealed to this Court from this last mentioned judgment and the plaintiffs now move to quash for want of jurisdiction in this Court upon the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment, that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal does not exceed the sum of $2,000 (Sec. 39(a), Supreme Court Act), and that no special leave has been obtained from the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec, or from this Court.\nThe only point decided by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) is that the Court was without jurisdiction to hear the motion for non-suit made by the defendant at the trial, that the judgment of the presiding judge dismissing that motion was interlocutory, and that it did not fall under any of the conditions required by Sec. 46, C.C.P., to make it susceptible of appeal, as it did not (1) decide in part the issues, (2) order the doing of anything which cannot be remedied by the final judgment, or (3) unnecessarily delay the trial of the suit.\nThe Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) did not, therefore, pass on the merits of the motion for non-suit which was dismissed by Tyndale C.J. In our view, this judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) comes within the definition of a final judgment in Sec. 2 (b) of the Supreme Court Act. The right of appeal asserted by the defendant, and which was allowed by St-Jacques J., is a substantive right in controversy between the parties in a judicial proceeding (Sec. 2 (e), Supreme Court Act).\nThe question raised by the defendant (appellant) concerns! the jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) to pass upon its motion for non-suit; and, by the judgment appealed from, that Court has finally deprived the defendant (appellant) of its substantive right to have that matter determined. (Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur 1 by Fitzpatrick C.J. at 153 to 157; Bulger v. The Home Insurance Co. 2 The Cosgrave Export Brewery Co. v. The King 3 Montreal Tramways Co. v. Brillant 4 and Ballantyne v. Edwards 5 ).\nIn The Grand Council of the Canadian Order of Chosen Friends v. The Local Government Board and the Town of Humboldt 6, the matter in controversy was an order of the Local Government Board made under the provisions of the Local Government Board (Special Powers) Act. Embury J. had given leave to appeal against the order to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The latter court held that there was no right of appeal from the order of the Local Government Board in the premises. The situation was the same as in the present case, since the Grand Council had obtained leave to appeal from Embury J. and the Court of Appeal denied its jurisdiction, notwithstanding that leave had been given. In this Court jurisdiction was held to exist to decide whether the Court of Appeal was right in so holding and the case was heard on the point determined by the Court of Appeal.\nIn The Provincial Secretary of the Province of Prince Edward Island v. Egan and The Attorney General of Prince Edward Island 7, the Provincial Secretary had refused to issue a license to operate a motor vehicle to Egan who had been convicted of driving his motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The Prince Edward Island Act was to the effect that in such a case the license was automatically suspended for twelve months with such conviction, and that \"the Provincial Secretary shall not issue a license to any person during the period for which the license has been cancelled or suspended under this section.\"\nFrom the refusal of the Provincial Secretary Egan appealed to a County Court judge, who allowed the appeal and ordered the issuance of a license. The Provincial Secretary appealed to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc, which dismissed the appeal, holding that the County Court judge had jurisdiction to make the order and that there was no appeal therefrom. In this Court the appeal was allowed and the order of the County Court judge set aside. It was held that there was no right of appeal to the County Court judge from the refusal of the Provincial Secretary in the circumstances, that there was no provision authorizing such an appeal, that the order of the County Court judge was made without jurisdiction and that the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc should have so held and set aside the order.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that in the Egan case this Court entertained jurisdiction on the matter of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island en banc, even although, as happened there, it was held that the County Court judge himself had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the refusal of the Provincial Secretary.\nReference might also be made to Lord v. The Queen 8, where the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) was reversed and the case was remitted to that Court to be there heard on the merits.\nWe might also refer to our recent decision in Hartin et al v. May et al 9.\nGatineau Power Co. v. Cross 10, a case cited by Counsel for respondent, was an expropriation matter. The Quebec Public Service Commission refused to give authority to the Gatineau Power Co. to expropriate Cross' property. This power was a matter of discretion for the Commission and the Court of Appeal merely decided that it could not interfere. Tremblay v. Duke-Price Power Co. (1), another case referred to by Counsel for the respondent, really turned merely on a matter of practice and procedure. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), having decided under Sec. 1213 of the C.C.P. that the inscription in appeal had been abandoned, for that reason rejected the appeal. No question of the jurisdiction of that Court was involved.\nFrom the reasons delivered in the present instance by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) it follows that that Court only decided that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal which had been allowed by St-Jacques J., and it went no further.\nWe are of opinion that an appeal lies to this Court in such circumstances and that the amount or value in controversy is truly the amount or value of the original claim, i.e., the sum of $250,000.\nFor these reasons the respondent's motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n1 (1908) 40 S.C.R. 139.\n2 [1927] S.C.R. 451.\n3 [1928] S.C.R. 405.\n4 [1929] S.C.R. 598.\n5 [1938] S.C.R. 392.\n6 [1924] S.C.R. 654.\n7 [1941] S.C.R. 396.\n8 31 S.C.R. 165.\n9 [1944] S.C.R. 278.\n10 [1929] S.C.R. 35.\n",

Bowman for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This appeal should be dismissed on the ground that the respondent is entitled to succeed on his alternative claim under section 3 of The Gaming Act, chapter 297 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937:\u2014\n3. Any person who, at any time or sitting, by playing at cards, dice, tables, or other game, or by betting on the sides or hands of the players, loses to any person so playing or betting, in the whole, the sum or value of $40 or upwards, and pays or delivers the same or any part thereof, shall be at liberty, within three months thereafter, to sue for and recover the money or thing so lost and paid or delivered.\nIt is unnecessary and therefore inadvisable to express any opinion upon the constitutionality of those parts of sections 1 and 2 of the Act dealing with notes and bills although those sections must be referred to in considering the history of section 3.\nThe respondent sued the appellant for the principal sum of $5,479 and interest at five per centum per annum thereon from May 28, 1945. Judgment was given for the principal sum and interest from the issue of the writ, and that judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2]. May 28, 1945, was the date of a cheque drawn and signed by the respondent on a bank for the principal sum, on which date the appellant presented the cheque to the bank and received the money therefor. It was alleged by the respondent in his statement of claim that this cheque was so drawn, executed and delivered for an illegal consideration, in that the principal sum was the amount claimed by the appellant as owing to him by the respondent on account of gaming at horse racing during the week of May 21 to May 26, 1945, and the respondent pleaded sections 1 and 2 of the Act. In the alternative the respondent said that the sum was money lost by playing at a game, viz., horse racing, and the respondent pleaded section 3. Because of the question of onus raised by the appellant, it is important to notice that in answer to the alternative claim the appellant in his defence repeated certain allegations to the effect that the $5,479 was paid to him as agent for the respondent to be paid by the appellant to the person with whom the appellant claimed such wagers for the appellant had been placed, and denied that the said sum was at any time lost by playing at a game within the meaning of section 3. The only other defence to the claim under that section was that the money was not lost to the appellant and that the appellant was not playing or betting in such game.\nThe trial proceeded upon the basis of the pleadings and the only divergence in the evidence was on the point whether the appellant made any bets with the respondent or merely acted throughout as the latter\u2019s agent in placing bets with others. That issue was found against the appellant and confirmed by the Court of Appeal[3], and the appellant accepts that finding as the basis upon which this appeal must be determined. However, he contends that the respondent has not shown that he lost to the appellant $40 or more \u201cat any time or sitting\u201d within the meaning of section 3. The evidence disclosed that bets were placed each day on horse races during the week in question and that settlement was made by the cheque of May 28th. In view of the pleadings and the course of the trial, the appellant cannot now be heard to advance the present contention and, in any event, it is a fair inference from all the evidence that the respondent did lose to the appellant $40 or more at any sitting, i.e., on any one day during that week.\nThe trial judge held that section 2 of the Act applied but stated that, if he were wrong in that conclusion, he was also of opinion that section 3 likewise applied. In the Court of Appeal3, after the first argument, reasons were delivered in which Mr. Justice Laidlaw, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice Aylesworth, while dealing at some length with the other questions argued, expressed, in one s sentence, the view that the respondent had a substantive right under section 3 to sue for and recover the money lost by him and paid to the appellant. While agreeing with the reasons of Mr. Justice Laidlaw, the third member of the Court, Mr. Justice Hogg, stated:\u2014\nThis result, however, with respect to the question as to whether horse racing is embraced by the language of the Statute, was reached by me only after considerable deliberation because of the amendment made in 1912, by which the word \u201cwhatsoever\u201d was omitted from s. 3 of the Statute, which is now known as \u201cThe Gaming Act\u201d.\nIt was only after the reasons for judgment had been delivered, following the first argument, and before the formal order was issued, that the appellant obtained leave to raise the constitutional question. That question was subsequently determined adversely to the appellant but, for the reasons already stated, I express no view upon the matter.\nThe first legislation in Ontario dealing with the matters under review is found in chapter 1, \u201cThe Statute Law Revision Act, 1902\u201d, of the Statutes of 1902. Section 2 provides in effect that the Imperial Statutes described in the Schedule to that Act are repealed so far as the same are in force and within the legislative authority of the province. In the Schedule appears \u201c16 Car II, c. 7\u2014An Act against Disorderly and Excessive Gaming.\u201d Section 8 of the 1902 Act provides that the statute passed in the ninth year of Queen Anne intitled \u201cAn Act for the better preventing of excessive and deceitful gaming\u201d (1710) is amended so far as the same has been incorporated into the laws of the province by striking out the first section thereof and by substituting the following:\u2014\nAll notes, bills, bonds, judgments, mortgages, or other securities, or conveyances whatsoever given, granted, drawn, or entered into, or executed, by any person, where the whole, or any part of, the consideration of such conveyances or securities snail be for any money, or other valuable thing whatsoever, won by gaming, or playing at cards, dice, tables, tennis, bowls, or other game or games whatsoever, or by betting on the sides or hands of such as do game at any of the games aforesaid, or for the reimbursing or repaying any money knowingly lent or advanced for such gaming, or betting, as aforesaid, or lent, or advanced, at the time and place of such play, to any person so gaming, or betting, as aforesaid, or that shall, during such play, so play, or bet, shall be deemed to have been made, drawn, accepted, given, or executed, for an illegal consideration.\nSection 9 follows the Imperial Statute of 5-6 William IV (1835) chapter 41, section 2, by providing that money paid to the holder of such securities shall be deemed to be paid on account of the person to whom the same was originally given and to be a debt due and owing from the latter and recoverable by action.\nChapter 13 of the Ontario Statutes of 1902 provides for what is known as Volume 3 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897, in which volume appears chapter 329, \u201cAn Act for the better preventing of excessive and deceitful gambling\u201d. Section 1 of that Act is the same as that part of section 8 of chapter 1 of the 1902 Statutes copied above. Section 2 is, with irrelevant verbal changes, the same as section 9 of chapter 1 of the 1902 Statutes. Section 3 enacts in part:\u2014\nAny person who shall, at any time or sitting, by playing at cards, dice, tables, or other game or games whatsoever, or by betting on the sides or hands of such as do play at any of the games aforesaid, lose to any person so playing, or betting, in the whole the sum or value of forty dollars, and shall pay or deliver the same or any part thereof, the person so losing and paying or delivering the same shall be at liberty, within three months then next, to sue for, and recover, the money or goods so lost, and paid, or delivered, or any part thereof, from the respective winner thereof, with costs of suit, by action, founded on this Act, to be prosecuted in any of His Majesty\u2019s courts of record, in which actions no privilege of Parliament shall be allowed, and in which actions it shall be sufficient for the plaintiff to allege that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff, or received to the plaintiff\u2019s use, the monies so lost and paid, or converted the goods won of the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s use, whereby the plaintiff\u2019s action accrued to him according to the form of this statute, without setting forth the special matter.\nProvision is then made for suit by any person in case the loser does not bring action. The only other section may be disregarded.\nR.S.O. 1897, chapter 329, was repealed by The Gaming Act, chapter 56 of the Statutes of 1912, to which Mr. Justice Hogg[4] referred. Sections 2, 3 and 4 correspond to sections 1, 2 and 3 of the previous Act, with an alteration upon which the appellant relies. That alteration is that the words \u201cor games whatsoever\u201d in old section 1 after the words \u201cbowls, or there game\u201d disappear, and that the words \u201cor games whatsoever\u201d in old section 3, after the words \u201ctables or other game\u201d, disappear. Deferring consideration of this argument for the moment, I turn to the contention that horse racing is not included in section 3 of the present Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 297. As Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton stated in Hyams v. Stuart[5], a long series of cases in England had settled that horse racing was within the statutes of Anne and William IV. It is objected that while that may be so in England because of references in the statute of Anne to the earlier statute of Charles II, which specifically mentioned horse racing, that consideration should not apply in Ontario. The argument fails because the statutes of Charles II and Anne were undoubtedly part of the law of Ontario by virtue of the first chapter, passed at the first sitting of the Upper Canada Legislature in 1792, and the subsequent statutes that have taken its place: Bank of Toronto v. McDougall[6]. The statute of Charles II was repealed and the statute of Anne, with the modifications already made in England by the statute of William IV, was enacted as previously explained by section 8 of chapter 1 of the Ontario Statutes of 1902 and became chapter 329 of R.S.O. 1897. The same meaning should be ascribed to the Ontario legislation, and horse racing was therefore an \u201cother game\u201d within section 3 of R.S.O. 1897, chapter 329.\nTurning now to the argument based upon the omission of the words \u201cor games whatsoever\u201d in sections 2 and 4 of chapter 56 of the 1912 statutes, it should be noticed that in section 1 of the original statute of Anne there were five \u201cwhatsoevers\u201d, relating to (1) securities or conveyances, (2) persons, (3) valuable thing, (4) games, and (5) \u201call intents and purposes.\u201d In section 1 of R.S.O. 1897, chapter 329, this number is reduced to three, and in the 1912 statute is omitted entirely. The dropping of the words \u201cor games whatsoever\u201d was merely for the purpose of shortening the enactment and as expressed in the recital to chapter 13 of the 1902 Ontario Statutes, to remove language that had become antiquated.\nThe decision of the House of Lords in Sutters v. Briggs[7], is an authority merely for the proposition that the word \u201cholder\u201d, in section 2 of the English Gaming Act of 1835, includes the original payee and a banker who receives the note or bill for collection, but certain expressions in the speeches of Viscount Birkenhead and Lord Sumner might, on a casual reading, be taken as supporting or negativing the conclusion I have reached. A careful perusal of those speeches, however, has convinced me that it would be dangerous to look there for any guidance in determining the precise point before us as it really had no relevancy to the matters decided by their Lordships and in my opinion neither of them desired to state, or expressed, any view upon the subject. The mere fact that in the present case a cheque was given does not take the matter out of the operation of section 3 of The Gaming Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 297; Smith v. Bond[8].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs but there should be no costs to or against either Attorney General.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014In his statement of claim, the plaintiff-respondent alleges that on the 28th of May, 1945, he signed a cheque payable to \u201ccash\u201d, drawn on his bank, the Bank of Montreal, at Peterborough, for $5,479, which cheque was delivered to the defendant and cashed by him. He claims that this cheque represented the total amount which he had lost to the defendant by betting with him on horse races, and that, the consideration being illegal, he is therefore entitled to the reimbursement of that amount.\nThe defendant, now appellant before this Court, pleaded that he never at any time made any bets with the plaintiff, but merely acted throughout as agent for the plaintiff from time to time in placing with other persons in the City of Toronto, wagers for the plaintiff on the result of horse races without any consideration from the plaintiff, and solely on the ground of friendship.\nThe trial judge found as a fact that the defendant was a principal making bets with the plaintiff. He also found that the plaintiff under the law was entitled to recover the amount claimed and gave judgment in his favour. The appellant before this Court does not quarrel with this finding of fact, which was confirmed by the Court of Appeal[9], and assumed for the purpose of his appeal, that the cheque referred to, was given by the plaintiff to the defendant in payment of bets made between themselves. Before the Court of Appeal9, after the case had been fully argued, a motion was made on behalf of the defendant to present further argument and, by order of the Court dated the 21st of April, 1947, leave was given to the defendant to amend his statement of defence and notice of appeal, so as to raise the following question:\u2014\n3A. The Defendant submits that the Gaming Act, being Chapter 297 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, is ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario and particularly that Sections 1 and 2 of the said Act are ultra vires being legislation in regard to bills of exchange and promissory notes a class of subjects assigned exclusively \u2018to the Parliament of Canada by the British North America Act and particularly Section 91 (18) thereof.\nThe amendments were made accordingly and the matter was further argued before the Court of Appeal9. Notice of the hearing of this argument was duly served on the Attorney General for Canada and the Attorney General for Ontario, pursuant to section 32 of the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, chap. 100. On the 18th of June, 1947, the Court of Appeal9 gave further reasons for judgment, and held that sections 1 and 2 were intra vires of the Ontario Legislature, and the defendant\u2019s appeal was dismissed with costs.\nThe Act which is challenged is the Gaming Act, chap. 297 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937. Section 1 provides that every agreement, note, bill, bond, confession of judgment, cognovit actionem, warrant of attorney to confess judgment, mortgage, or other security, or conveyance, for which, or any part of it, is money or other valuable thing won by gaming, or playing at cards, dice, tables, tennis, bowls, or other game, shall be deemed to have been made, drawn, accepted, given, or executed for an illegal consideration.\nSection 2 says that if any person makes, draws, gives, or executes, any note, bill, or mortgage, for any consideration which is hereinbefore declared to be illegal, and actually pays to any indorsee, holder, or assignee of such note, bill, or mortgage, the amount of the money thereby secured or any part thereof, such money shall be deemed to have been paid for and on account of the person to whom such note, bill, or mortgage was originally given, and to be a debt due and owing from such last named person to the person who paid such money, and shall accordingly be recoverable by action.\nThe last relevant section is section 3 which is to the effect that any person who, at any time or sitting, by playing at cards, dice, tables, or other game, loses to any person so playing or betting, in the whole, the sum or value of $40 or upwards, and pays or delivers the same or any part thereof, shall be at liberty, within three months thereafter, to sue for and recover the money or thing so lost and paid or delivered.\nThe defendant-appellant before this Court submits that the court below wrongly held, that bets made on horse races came within the words \u201cor any game\u201d of sections 1 and 2 of the Gaming Act. He also submits that the court erred in holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the moneys in question by reason of the provisions of section 3 of the Gaming Act, because a bet on a horse race would not come within the words of that section, and that there was no evidence that any one bet of those that made up the total of the cheque, was in excess of $40. Finally, it is the contention of the appellant before this Court that sections 1 and 2 of the Gaming Act are ultra vires of the Province of Ontario, being legislation in regard to bills of exchange and promissory notes.\nThe origin of this Ontario legislation which is challenged, may be found in the Imperial Statute 9 Anne, Chap. 14, 1711, and entitled \u201cAn Act for the better preventing of excessive and deceitful gaming.\u201d This Act stipulated that after the 1st of May, 1711, all notes, mortgages, etc. where the consideration was for money won by gaming, or the repayment of money lent at such gaming were void. Section 2 of the same Act was to the effect that the loser could sue for the repayment of the money within three months.\nLater, in England, in 1835, (5 & 6 William IV, Chap. 41) another act was enacted entitled \u201cAn Act to amend the law relating to securities given for considerations arising out of gaming, usurious, and certain other illegal transactions\u201d. In this Act, it was stipulated that any notes, bills, or mortgages which up to then, were under the Statute of Anne absolutely void, should in the future be deemed and\n32968\u20141 taken to have been made, drawn, accepted, or executed for an illegal consideration. Section 2 was also enacted, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. AND be it further enacted, that in case any person shall, after the passing of this Act, make, draw, give, or execute any note, bill, or mortgage for any consideration on account of which the same is by the herein-before recited Acts of . . . the ninth and eleventh years of the reign of her said late Majesty Queen Anne, or by any one or more of such Acts, declared to be void, and such person shall actually pay to any indorsee, holder, or assignee of such note, bill, or mortgage the amount of the money thereby secured, or any part thereof, such money so paid shall be deemed and taken to have been paid for and on account of the person to whom such note, bill, or mortgage was originally given upon such illegal consideration as aforesaid, and shall be deemed and taken to be a debt due and owing from such last-named person to the person who shall so have paid such money, and shall accordingly be recoverable by action at law in any of His Majesty\u2019s courts of record.\nSeveral amendments to the original Statute were adopted by the legislature of Ontario, and we now find the Gaming Act, as it now stands in chapter 297 of the R.S.O. 1937. It practically embodies the Statute of Anne and the amending Imperial Statute of 1835.\nDealing first with the contention that the words \u201cother game\u201d found in the Statute do not include horse racing, it is sufficient to refer to the previous judgments on this point, to reach the conclusion that they do.\nIn Goodburn v. Marley[10], it was held that horse races was within the Act against the Statute of Anne, and this judgment was later confirmed in Blaxton v. Pye[11]. In Hyams v. Stuart King[12], Fletcher Moulton L.J., said:\u2014\nHorse racing is not expressly referred to either in the statute of Anne or in the Gaming Act, 1835; but by a series of decisions, culminating in the decision of this Court in Woolf v. Hamilton[13], it has been settled that horse racing is within these statutes, and that a cheque given for a bet upon a horse race is therefore to be deemed to have been given for an illegal consideration.\nMore recently in Sutters v. Briggs[14], Lord Sumner said at page 19:\u2014\nThey accepted that, as Fletcher Moulton L.J. observes in Hyams v. Stuart King (1908, 2 K.B. 696, 715), a long series of cases has settled that horse racing is within the statutes of Anne and William IV.\nIf any further authority is needed on this point, vide the following American cases: (Tatman v. Strader[15]); (Ellis v. Beale,[16]); (Swaggard v. Hancock,[17]); (Daintree v. Hutchison[18]); (Swigart v. People of the State of Illinois[19]); (Boynton v. Curle[20]).\nAs to the contention that there was no evidence that any one bet was in excess of $40, so as to bring the case within section 3 of the statute, I do not think that the appellant, who has never raised that point in the lower courts, may now be allowed to do so here. The case has never been fought on that basis, and I therefore assume that each bet was for over $40.\nTurning now to the constitutional aspect that has been raised, I do not think it necessary to deal with sections 1 and 2 of the Act, because whether they are or not within the powers of the Legislature of Ontario, the respondent is entitled to succeed, even if he relies merely on section 3. Moreover, the case contemplated in section 2, deals with the rights of the loser when third parties are involved. But we are not confronted here with this eventuality. The legal relationship in the present case is between the winner and the loser of the bet, and in my opinion, section 3 is sufficient to justify the judgment given in favour of the respondent.\nI have no doubt that this section is severable from the rest of the Act, and that the Legislature would have enacted it without the other provisions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. But there should be no costs to or against the Attorneys General.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The first point made on behalf of the appellant with which it is necessary to deal is that section 3 of the Gaming Act, R.S.O., 1937, cap. 297, does not apply to money lost in betting on horse racing.\nThis section derives from section 2 of 9 Anne, cap. 14. So far as relevant that section read as follows:\n. . . any person or persons whatsoever who at any time or sitting, by playing at cards, dice, tables or other game or games whatsoever, or by betting on the sides or hands of such as do play at any of the games aforesaid, lose to any one or more person or persons so playing or betting in the whole the sum or value of ten pounds, and shall pay or deliver the same for any part thereof, the person or persons, so losing and paying or delivering the same, shall be at liberty within three months then next, to sue for and recover the money or goods so lost and paid or delivered or any part thereof, from the respective winner and winners thereof, with costs of suit, by action of debt founded on this Act . . .\nIt has been uniformly held in England under the Statute of Anne that although horse racing is not specifically mentioned in the statute, as was the case with earlier legislation, nevertheless it applied equally to money lost by betting on horse races, the words \u201cother game or games\u201d being held sufficient for that purpose; Sutters v. Briggs[21], per Lord Sumner at 19; Woolf v. Hamilton[22]; Blaxton v. Pye[23]; Goodburn v. Marley[24]; Applegarth v. Colley[25]. As stated by Lawrence, L.J., in Ellesmere v. Wallace[26]:\nIt is settled that horse racing is a game within the meaning of the Gaming Acts;\nand he cites Applegarth v. Colley, supra. The same construction has been put upon section 2 as upon section 1, notwithstanding that the enumeration of the games in section 2 is not the same as in section 1; Thorpe v. Coleman[27].\nThe Statute of Anne became part of the law of Ontario by the provisions of the Constitution Act, 1792, 32 Geo. II, cap. 1 (U.C.)\nPrior to 1902 the amendments to the Gaming laws of 5 and 6 Wm. IV, cap. 41, sections 1 and 2, were not in force in Ontario; In re Summerfeldt v. Worts[28]. In that year however, these sections were enacted by 2 Edward VII, cap. 1, sections 8 and 9. By section 8 section 1 of the Statute of Anne was amended to provide that the instruments mentioned in the section should be deemed to have been given for an illegal consideration instead of being rendered void as was the case under the original statute. Section 2 of 9 Anne was not affected by the amending Act. By section 9 the provisions of section 2 of the Act of William were enacted; now embodied in section 2 of the existing statute. By cap. 13 of 2 Edward VII, \u201cAn Act respecting the Imperial Statutes relating to property and civil rights incorporated into the Statute Law of Ontario\u201d, the Statute of Anne, as thus amended, was revised and consolidated as part of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1897. By section 2 of cap. 13 provision was made for the repeal of the Imperial Acts to take effect from the day upon which the revision of 1897 should take effect, provision being made for the latter by section 4. By section 9 it was provided that the Revised Statutes should not be held to operate as new laws but should be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the repealed statutes for which the Revised Statutes were substituted. Section 10 provided that if upon any point the provisions of the Revised Statutes were not in effect the same as those of the repealed Acts then as to all matters subsequent the Revised Statutes should prevail.\nCap. 329 contained the revision of the Statute of Anne as amended by 2 Edward VII, cap. 1, sections 8 and 9. Section 3 perpetuates the provisions of section 2 of the Statute of Anne. Verbal changes were made in this section, such as omitting the words \u201cor persons whatsoever\u201d after the words \u201cany person\u201d at the beginning of section 2 of the Statute of Anne and there were similar changes. The phrase \u201cor other game or games whatsoever\u201d remained in the section.\nIn 1912 by cap. 56 the Act was again revised, section 3 of the earlier statute becoming section 4. Among the changes made the words \u201cor other game or games whatsoever\u201d in the Act of 1902 became \u201cor other game\u201d. The phrase \u201cthe sides or hands of such as do play at any of the games aforesaid\u201d was also shortened to \u201cthe sides or hands of the players\u201d. I see no reason however, for thinking that the legislature intended to make the statute inapplicable to the subject matters of the preceding Act and I think the Act of 1912, which is reproduced in the Revised Statutes of 1937, is to be given the same construction so far as betting on horse racing is concerned as the original Statute of Anne.\nIt is however, further contended that by reason of the tax imposed on betting at horse races by the Race Tracks Tax Act of 1939, cap. 39, section 3, the Gaming Act should not be construed as including horse racing. Assuming the subject matter of the Act of 1939 is the same as that of the Gaming Act, section 3 of the Gaming Act remains on the statute books and, in my opinion, it is not to be considered as thus indirectly amended without more express language than that contained in the Statute of 1939. There is no contradiction in taxing the winner in respect of his gains even although he may, though not necessarily must, be called upon to repay.\nThe next point which arises is as to whether or not section 3 of the present statute applies where the plaintiff has given a cheque to the winner in payment of the bets lost or whether the section is, as appellant contends, limited to cash payments. That the section has always been limited to the recovery of payments directly made by the loser to the winner is clear, I think, from the authorities. It is sufficient to refer in this connection to Sutters v. Briggs, ubi cit. It is however, also established that a payment made by cheque is within the section where the cheque has been collected directly by the winner; Smith v. Bond[29]. Under section 1 of the Statute of Anne all bills were void and payment thereof could not be recovered in any case not within section 2. Section 2 of the Statute of William was enacted to permit recovery where payment had been made by bill of exchange which had found its way into the hands of third parties; Sutters v. Briggs, ubi cit. The present case appears to come clearly within the provisions of section 3 as the appellant received payment directly from the bank upon which the cheque here in question was drawn payable to \u201ccash\u201d.\nWhile argument was addressed to us on the basis that sections 1 and 2 of the statute, or at least those portions of the sections which relate to bills of exchange, are ultra vires on the ground that they constitute legislation within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, no similar argument was addressed to us, nor I take it from the judgments below, to the Court of Appeal[30] with respect to section 3. The matter need not therefore be considered.\nIt is next argued that it was not proved on behalf of the respondent that the amount sued for was made up exclusively of amounts lost \u201cat any time or sitting\u201d of \u201cthe sum or value of $40 or upwards.\u201d The Statement of Claim includes in the alternative a claim within section 3 to which the Statement of Defence raised two defences, namely, (1) that the section does not include money lost by betting on horse races; and (2) that the respondent was, in any event, an agent and not a principal. The present objection was not raised before the trial judge and the course of the trial in my opinion brings the case within the principle of the decision in The Century Indemnity Co. v. Rogers[31]. I would dismiss the appeal with costs, save that there shall be no costs to either of the Attorneys-General.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; no costs to or against either Attorney-General.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer and Cartwright.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.J.A.

The respondent, as provided by s. 57(3), appealed to the court of revision and from that court to the county court judge, who upheld the appeal. The municipality then appealed under s. 84 and the Ontario Municipal Board allowed its appeal. The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that court held the decision of the county court judge was final.\nHeld: That the appeal should be dismissed.\nHeld: Also that as to the by-law passed in 1943 under s. 123, the appellant was not, in view of subsection 12, entitled to assess and tax the 1942 income.\nPer: Taschereau, Kellock and Locke JJ., as to the income for the years 1940 and 1941, which the appellant purported to tax under s. 57:\n(1) The right of appeal given by s. 57(3) is a special and limited right of appeal from taxation exhausted when the county court judge is reached. Scottish Widows\u2019 Fund Life Assurance Society v. Blennerhassett, [1912] A.C. 281 at 286; Furtado v. London Brewery Co., [1914] 1 K.B. 709 at 712.\n(2) The right of appeal given by s. 84 is with respect only to entries in the current assessment roll which have been made the subject of formal complaint to the court of revision and not with respect to taxes already imposed. Re Blackburn v. City of Ottawa, (1924) 55 O.L.R. 494 at 501.\nPer: Kerwin and Estey JJ., that as to the 1940 and 1941 income, the income assessments and tax rolls prepared by the appellant in 1941 and 1942 do not fall within the meaning of \u201cthe assessment roll from which such assessment has been omitted\u201d as prescribed by s. 57(2), and the actions of the appellant\u2019s officers failed to bring the respondents within the terms of s. 57.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ., (dissenting in part):\n(1) The effect of deleting the words \u201cand no appeal shall lie from the decision of the county court judge on any such appeal\u201d from s. 123(8) by 1939, c. 3, s. 8, must have the effect of permitting further appeals, if the necessary conditions are met, to the Ontario Municipal Board and the Court of Appeal under s. 84. When the person assessed exercises the right of appeal to the court of revision under s. 57(3), the matter is brought into the general stream so as to permit either the party or the municipality to pursue the matter to the end.\n(2) In view of subsequent changes in legislation, the decision in the Blackburn case is no longer applicable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,[1] setting aside a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board allowing an appeal from a decision of the county court judge.\nS. Springsteen K.C. and L.R. Cumming for the appellant.\nC.F.H. Carson K.C. and P. Kidd for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin and Estey, JJ., dissenting in part, was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal of the respondent companies from a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board, which had allowed the appeals of the present appellant, the Corporation of the City of Windsor, from a judgment of the senior County Judge of the County of Essex. All these appeals were assessment appeals under the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 272, as amended, as they arose from assessments made against the respondents in 1943 in respect of the income received by them in the years 1940, 1941 and 1942. The Court of Appeal decided that the decision of the county judge was final with respect to the income for any of these years and as agreement with that conclusion would be sufficient to dispose of the matter, that point should first be considered.\nThe assessments for 1942 income were made in pursuance of By-law 425 of the City of Windsor, passed July 20, 1943, under the authority of section 123 of the Act. The names of the respondents were entered in a special roll of taxable income and payment of the taxes due was demanded by the tax collector. Thereupon, in the words of subsection 8 of section 123, the respondents had \u201cin respect thereto the right of appeal provided in this Act in the case of assessments.\u201d If, in reading subsection 8, one omits for the moment the following words that appear between commas, \u201cupon receipt from the collector of demand for payment of the said rate upon the amount for which he is taxable according to said roll\u201d, the first part of the subsection would then provide:\u2014\u201dA person whose name is entered in the special roll of taxable income shall not be entitled to notice of such entry but shall have in respect thereto the right of appeal provided in this Act in the case of assessments.\u201d That, I think, is the correct way of reading the subsection, and the words between commas merely indicate the time when the right of appeal arises. Upon that construction the word \u201cthereto\u201d would refer to the entry in the special roll and the appeal would be an assessment appeal. However, even if \u201cthereto\u201d be taken to refer to the demand for payment, that demand is based upon a prior assessment, and upon the respondents\u2019 appeals the amounts of the assessments were put in issue.\nThe respondent failed before the Court of Revision and unless there is something else in the Act, conferring a further right to appeal to the county judge, the Court of Revision\u2019s decision would be final. Subsection 10 envisages an appeal to the county judge so that it is permissible to call in aid the previous sections of the Act dealing with what might be termed the general scheme of assessment appeals. That view is confirmed when one considers the history of subsection 8. It was first enacted by section 8 of chapter 1 of the 1934 statutes as part of what was then section 120A when the following words appeared at the end \u201cand no appeal shall lie from the decision of the county court judge on any such appeal.\u201d These words presuppose an appeal from the Court of Revision to the county judge. They were continued in subsection 8 of section 123 of the Revised Statutes of 1937 but in 1939, by chapter 3, section 8, they were deleted. This deletion must have the effect of permitting further appeals, if the necessary conditions are met, to the Ontario Municipal Board and the Court of Appeal under section 84. I am unable to agree with the contention that only the person assessed has all or any of these rights of appeal and that the municipality has none. While no right of appeal to the Court of Revision is given the municipality under subsection 8 of section 123, neither is such right given under the earlier sections dealing with the general scheme of assessment appeals. When the person assessed exercises the right of appeal to the Court of Revision the matter is brought into the general stream so as to permit either the party or the municipality to pursue the matter to the end.\nThe question of the right of appeal from the county judge in connection with the income received in 1940 and 1941 sends us to subsections 2 and 3 of section 57. Acting under subsection 2, the Assessment Commissioner in 1943 reported to the city clerk that income assessments against the respondents for 1940 and 1941 had been omitted. The assessments were accordingly added to assessment rolls, to be described hereafter, and to the collector\u2019s roll for 1943, prepared under By-law 425 and section 123 of the Act. In accordance with subsection 3 of section 57, notices of the amounts of the assessments and of the taxes were sent to the respondents. The words \u201cso taxed\u201d in this subsection are merely descriptive of the person to whom notice is to be sent as he is notified as well of the assessments as of the taxes. The subsection provides not only that such person may appeal to the Court of Revision but also that \u201can appeal may also be had to the county judge by such person or by the municipality from any decision of the Court of Revision.\u201d This makes the matter quite clear up to and including appeals to the county judge and, once an appeal under the subsection is brought, the matter falls into the general scheme of assessment appeals so as to make applicable section 84, conferring a right of appeal from the county judge, not only upon the person assessed and taxed, but also upon the municipal corporation. If this be the correct conclusion upon the language of the subsection itself, it is no argument to the contrary that as a result of a municipality\u2019s appeal the person assessed and taxed may incur penalties for non-payment at the time demanded since the same result would follow in the ordinary course.\nReliance is placed upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Re Blackburn and City of Ottawa[2]. At that time the section under which the Assessment Commissioner for Ottawa purported to report to the city clerk that income assessment had been omitted, contained the words \u201cand the parties so assessed and taxed shall have the right of appeal as provided in section 118.\u201d Section 118 was the one conferring upon the Court of Revision power to order a remission of taxes, and the Court of Appeal considered that the right to petition for the exercise of such power and the right of appeal from an assessment had always been entirely separate and distinct things so that the decision of the county judge was final after an alleged omission had been entered on the rolls. In 1929, however, what is now subsection 3 of section 57 was first enacted, at which time subsection 2 was amended by striking out the following words at the end thereof:\u2014\u201cand the parties so assessed and taxed shall have the right of appeal as provided in section 121.\u201d Section 121 there mentioned is for all relevant purposes the same as section 118 referred to in the Blackburn Case. In view of the changes in the legislation, that decision is no longer applicable.\nThe appeal as to the assessability of 1942 income may be quickly disposed of. Although it was argued that subsection 12 of section 123 was superfluous, some meaning must be ascribed to it, and reading it in conjunction with all the other subsections, I agree that the earliest the provisions of section 123 could take effect under By-law 425 was the year 1944 with respect to income for 1943. The income for the year 1942, therefore, is not caught.\nIn order to decide as to the 1940 and 1941 income, it is necessary to describe the assessment rolls to which were added the assessments of income for those years. It has already been pointed out that By-law 425, by virtue of which section 123 of the Assessment Act took effect, was passed July 20, 1943. Up to that time, By-law 22, passed October 30, 1935, was in force. This latter by-law was passed in pursuance of what is now section 60 by which a city, instead of proceeding as set forth in section 59, may by by-law provide for making the assessment at any time prior to September 30th and for fixing prior and separate dates for the return of the roll of each ward. By subsection 2 of section 9, the income to be assessed shall be the income received during the year ending December 31st then last past. Without detailing the other provisions of the Assessment Act and the relevant sections of the Municipal Act, the result should have been that the income for 1940, for instance, would be entered on the assessment roll prepared in 1941 and that the taxes in respect thereof would be payable in 1942 and not before. Instead of following this normal procedure, the City officials, commencing in 1936, proceeded as if By-law 425 had been enacted and section 123 brought into effect. In 1941, they prepared a \u201cCorporation Income Tax Roll, 1941, from returns for the year 1940 Assessment and Tax Roll 1941\u201d, the title of which is self-explanatory and in 1942 they prepared a similar roll, which, however, is headed \u201cIncome Assessment and Tax Roll 1942.\u201d On each of these appeared the names of certain corporations, the amounts of income for which they were assessed, and the taxes figured at the proper rate, which it might be noted was the same in each of the years 1940, 1941 and 1942. So far as the respondents are concerned, neither of these rolls falls within the meaning of \u201cthe assessment roll from which such assessment has been omitted\u201d as prescribed by subsection 2 of section 57. None of the cases cited assists the appellant to overcome the fact that the actions of its officers have failed to bring the respondents within the terms of section 57.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014Dealing first with the income of the respondent companies for the years 1940 and 1941, which the appellant purported to tax under the provisions of section 57 of the Assessment Act, the first question which arises is as to whether or not section 84 applies so that the appellant was entitled to appeal from the county judge to the Ontario Municipal Board.\nBy subsection 1 of section 84 an appeal lies \u201cwhere a person is assessed\u201d in excess of amounts mentioned in the subsection. The respondents\u2019 contention is that the appeal provided for by this section does not apply to cases coming within either section 57 or, with reference to the income of 1942, with which I shall deal later, section 123, i.e., that section 84 applies where assessment only is involved and not to cases where the matter has gone beyond that stage and taxation has been imposed.\nTurning to the statute, section 23 provides that every assessor in preparing the assessment roll, which takes place annually, shall set down therein certain particulars, including the names of all persons who are liable to assessment in the municipality, with the amounts assessable against each in respect of land, buildings, business and income, as well as the total assessment. Before completing his roll section 52 requires the assessor to send to every person named in the roll a notice of the assessment. While under section 54 he may correct any error in his assessment and alter the roll accordingly, he may do so only within the time fixed for the return of the roll and he must give an amended notice of assessment to the person affected. Form 4 of the statute speaks of the assessment as made when the notice has been sent out, but however that may be, the taxation stage is not reached until appeals against assessments have been disposed of and the roll has been revised by the court of revision and county judge and a levying by-law has been passed by the council under section 315 of the Municipal Act, the levy being arrived at under section 316 upon the basis of the estimated expenditure in relation to the total assessment as disclosed by the assessment roll. After these steps have been taken the collector\u2019s roll is then made up pursuant to section 104 of the Assessment Act and this roll is then delivered to the collector who is required by section 108 to proceed to collect.\nSubject to sections 59 to 63 of the Act, the assessor is required by section 53 to begin to make his roll in each year not later than the 15th of February and to complete the same by the 30th of April, by which last mentioned date he must deliver the roll, completed and added up, with the requisite affidavits, to the clerk of the municipality. Where this section applies the time for appealing against an assessment to the court of revision is, as provided by section 73, subsection 2, within fourteen days after the day upon which the roll is required to be returned or within fourteen days after its return, if it has not been returned within the time fixed by law. It is provided by subsection 21 that all the duties of the court of revision shall be completed and the roll finally revised before the 1st of July. Section 76 authorizes an appeal from the court of revision to the county judge, notice of appeal being required to be given by subsection 2 within five days after the date limited for the closing of the court of revision, or in case the court sits to hear appeals after that date, then within five days after its actual closing. By subsection 7 it is required that all appeals shall be determined before the 1st of August.\nIn certain municipalities where it is not desired to follow the procedure provided for by section 53 it is provided by section 59 that by-laws may be passed for taking the assessment between the 1st of April and the 30th of September, the rolls being returnable on the 1st of October. In such case the time for closing the court of revision is the 15th of November and the final return by the county judge is to be on the 15th of December, although subsection 2 recognizes that there may be delay in the final return beyond the last mentioned date.\nBy section 60 cities, instead of proceeding under section 59, may by by-law provide for making the assessment at any time prior to the 30th of September and for fixing prior and separate dates for the return of the assessment roll of each ward or subdivision of a ward. The by-law must provide for the holding of a court of revision for the hearing of appeals from the assessment in each ward or subdivision upon the return of the assessment roll of such ward or subdivision and the time for appeal to the court of revision is to be within ten days after the last day fixed for the return of the roll and for appeal to the county judge within ten days after the decision of the court of revision or after receipt of written notice of such decision. By subsection 4 the county judge is required to complete his revision of the last of the assessment rolls for the city by the 20th of October in each year, although again subsection 5 recognizes that there may be delay.\nUnder the combined provisions of section 1(j) and section 74, the roll as revised by the county judge is deemed to be finally revised and binds all parties concerned, notwithstanding any error mentioned in section 74.\nIn cases falling within section 53 therefore, the time for appealing an assessment would, in the normal course, expire on the 15th of May in each year as provided by section 73, subsection 2. In cases within section 59 the time for such appeals would normally expire on the 15th of October and in cases within section 60 on the 10th of October. Section 76 provides for appeals to the county judge and in cases where the assessment is sufficient in amount there may be a further appeal to the Municipal Board under section 84. On questions of law there is an appeal also from the Board to the Court of Appeal under section 85, but as already mentioned, the assessment roll is considered as finally revised once the county judge has finished his revision and notwithstanding that there may be appeals outstanding to the Municipal Board or the Court of Appeal, the clerk of the municipality is required by section 104 to make up the collector\u2019s roll and insert therein the several amounts of taxes.\nThe above outline of these statutory provisions is sufficient, in my opinion, to indicate the subject matter dealt with by section 84. The right of appeal thereby given is with respect only to entries in the current assessment roll which have been made the subject of formal complaint to the court of revision within the time prescribed as above mentioned. Entries in the assessment and collector\u2019s rolls under section 57 may be made \u201cat any time\u201d and hence long after, and as much as two years after the time prescribed for appeals in the ordinary assessment procedure.\nSubsection 6 of section 73 prohibits any exercise of jurisdiction with respect to making any change in an assessment except in cases which have originated by a formal complaint to the court of revision as provided by that section. The appeal with which section 84 is concerned is therefore an appeal with respect to assessments and not an appeal with respect to taxes already imposed.\nIt is convenient at this point to refer to section 123. By subsection 1 the council, instead of making \u201can assessment of income as hereinbefore in this Act provided\u201d, may pass by-laws requiring every person liable to assessment in respect of income to furnish, within the time fixed by the by-law, a return of income received during the year ending on the 31st of December then last past and providing for the entry of the names of all such persons, whether or not they have complied with the demand, with the amount of the taxable income of each in a \u201cspecial roll of taxable income\u201d and also for levying upon the taxable income according to such roll at the appropriate rate. Subsection 2 provides for the rate and for recovery thereof in the same way as other rates. By subsection 8 a person entered on this roll is not entitled to notice of the entry but upon receipt of the tax demand from the collector he is given \u201cin respect thereto\u201d, that is the demand for payment of taxes, \u201cthe right of appeal provided in this Act in the case of assessments\u201d. In my view the language last quoted recognizes that the \u201ccase of assessments\u201d is not the same thing as that with which section 123 is concerned, namely, the immediate imposition of taxation. The person upon whom the tax is imposed is, however, given the right of appeal applicable in the case of assessment.\nIn Teck v. Hayward[3], Henderson J.A., in speaking of the predecessor of section 73, subsection 1, and the other sections dealing with assessment appeals to the county judge, said at p. 133:\nIt is clear, in my opinion, that the appeal provided for by these sections is an appeal only from an assessment, and does not confer any right of appeal from the rate of taxation imposed by the municipality.\nOn the following page with respect to subsection 8 of the then section 120a, now section 123, he said:\nMy construction of this subsection is that the appeal is in respect of the demand for payment of the rate and that the words \u201cthe right of appeal provided in this Act in the case of assessments\u201d describes the tribunals to which the appeal lies.\nWith respect to section 84, then section 80, Middleton J.A., in Re Blackburn v. City of Ottawa[4] said at page 501:\nBut, reading the section in its context, it appears to me clearly to indicate that it was intended to apply only to appeals from actual assessments made in the ordinary way, and not to the attempt on the part of the municipality to collect taxes upon land or income which had inadvertently escaped assessment.\nIn his consideration of section 80 as it stood at that time, Middleton J.A., had in his mind, it is true, the ancestor of the present section 57, which was then in different form. I shall deal with that aspect of the matter in connection with consideration of the provisions of section 57. In my view, however, any change in the form of section 57 since the above judgment does not affect the appropriateness of the excerpt from the judgment just quoted to the present section 84.\nWhen one comes to section 57 the situation is, in my opinion, analogous to that arising under section 123 in that section 57 does not deal merely with matters of assessment but with the imposition of taxation. While under subsection 2, in the case of income which has been omitted from the assessment roll, the assessor is directed to enter the same on the appropriate assessment roll or rolls, he is also directed to enter the rates on the collector\u2019s roll for the current year. On so doing the clerk is then required by subsection 3 to deliver or send by registered a letter post to the person \u201cso taxed\u201d a notice which contains not only the amount of the assessment but also the taxes, and such person is given the right of appeal provided for by the subsection.\nAs already stated, in my opinion, the language of section 123, subsection 8, namely, \u201cthe right of appeal provided in this Act in the case of assessments\u201d indicates that an assessment appeal and the appeal from the imposition of taxation provided for in section 123, subsection 8, are separate and distinct. The appeal provided for in section 57, subsection 3, is of the latter class. In the last mentioned subsection this differentiation is emphasized. The subsection makes no reference to the appeal given in the case of assessments but sets out specifically the persons entitled to appeal and the tribunals to which resort may be had. It provides, in my opinion, a special and limited right of appeal and is its own code. There is no room under section 57(3), for instance, for any reference to section 73 so as to permit the persons mentioned in subsection 3 of that section to appeal. With respect to the appeal to the court of revision it is the \u201cperson so taxed\u201d only who may appeal. Again, section 57(3) permits only that person and the municipal corporation to appeal to the county judge. There is no room therefore for the application of section 76(1), which permits other persons to make the appeal thereby provided for. Section 73(22) emphasizes that that section is dealing only with \u201can appeal * * * against an assessment\u201d which is the subject of \u201ca complaint formally made according to the above provisions\u201d, (subsection 6) notice having been given within fourteen days after the return of the assessment roll (subsection 2). The appeal to the county judge provided for by section 76 is an appeal from a decision of the court of revision made pursuant to section 73. The same is, in my opinion, true of section 84, which operates by way of exception to the prohibition contained in section 83, both sections, however, dealing only with appeals with respect to assessments made in pursuance of sections 53, 59 or 60, and made the subject of formal complaint to the court of revision within the prescribed time after the assessment.\nWhen one looks at the way in which section 57 has evolved to its present form the conclusion set out above is very much strengthened. It is not necessary to go back beyond the Revised Statutes of 1927, cap. 238. At that time the right of appeal in the case of income omitted from assessment at the proper time being subsequently inserted in the assessment and collector\u2019s rolls is to be found in section 57, subsection 2, which gave to \u201cthe party so assessed and taxed * * * the right of appeal as provided in section 121\u201d, (formerly 118). Subsection 1 of the last mentioned section, as it then stood, provided that the court of revision should receive and decide upon an application from any person assessed for a tenement which had remained vacant during more than three months in the year or from any person who declared himself from sickness or extreme poverty unable to pay taxes or who by reason of any gross or manifest error in the roll had been overcharged or who had been assessed in respect of land, income or business assessment under section 57, or who had been assessed for business but had not carried on business for the whole year and the court was authorized to remit or reduce the taxes or reject the application. By subsection 3 of section 121 an appeal was authorized to the county judge by either the applicant or the municipality from any decision of the court of revision.\nIn 1924, by 14 Geo. V, cap. 59, section 7, \u201capplication\u201d was substituted for \u201cpetition\u201d in the section. In 1929 by 19 Geo. V, cap. 63 sec. 7(3), section 121 was recast so as to permit of an appeal from the court of revision in the case only of an application for the cancellation or reduction of taxes by a person assessed for business who had not carried on such business for the whole year. At the same time by section 4 of the same statute, section 57 was amended, eliminating the provision as to appeal by reference to section 121 and providing expressly for an appeal to the court of revision and to the county Judge, the same tribunals mentioned in the last mentioned section.\nWhile the legislation was in the form in which it appeared in 1927, apart from the amendment of 1924, to which I have referred, it was decided by the Appellate Division in Re Blackburn and City of Ottawa supra that section 84, in the language of Middleton J.A., cited above, applied \u201conly to appeals from actual assessments made in the ordinary way and not to the attempt on the part of the municipality to collect taxes upon land or income omitted from assessment\u201d. The whole argument of the appellant on the present appeal is that the effect of the amendments of 1929 was to make applicable the provisions of section 84 to the cases covered by section 57. If that be the result it has been brought about in my opinion by accident rather than by any design on the part of the legislature. The subject matter of section 57 is not \u201cassessments made in the ordinary way\u201d but the imposition of taxation. In my opinion the change in 1929, from the right of appeal defined by reference to section 121 in the 1927 legislation, to a right of appeal to the same tribunals named in section 57 itself, did not constitute the appeal an \u201cassessment\u201d appeal. In my view the right of appeal given by section 57(3) remained a special and limited right of appeal exhausted when the county judge is reached just as it was when the right of appeal was defined by reference to section 121. The fact that both tribunals are expressly mentioned in sections 57 and 125 (formerly 121) as well as the persons entitled to appeal, emphasizes to my mind that that procedure exhausts the right of appeal in the case of each section.\nIt is useful at this point to contrast the language of subsection 4 of section 57a where the legislature enacts that \u201cthe same rights in respect of appeal shall apply as if such building or land had been assessed in the usual way\u201d. The appellant\u2019s contention really is that the effect of the language used in section 57(3) is the same as that used in section 57a, but I am unable to take that view.\nIn the Blackburn case there was of course involved in the decision of the court that there was no room for the application of section 84 to the subject matter of section 118, now section 125, a section dealing not with assessment but with remission of taxes. The amendments which that section has undergone since that decision, to some of which I have already referred, did not change the applicability of that decision to cases within that section. It remains a section giving a special and limited right of appeal, exhausted when the county court judge is reached and I do not think there is any more reason for thinking that the legislature, by reason of any amendments to section 57 since the Blackburn decision, have made applicable to the subject matter of that section the provisions of section 84 than in the case of section 125. Neither did the 1935 amendment to section 84, 25 Geo. V, cap. 3, section 3, in my opinion, do more than give the municipal corporation a right of appeal in assessment cases, properly speaking, as to which doubt had been raised by the view expressed by Ferguson J.A., in the Blackburn case as to the distinction made throughout the statute between \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d rendering inapplicable, in his view, the provisions of the Interpretation Act. The appeal with which that section concerns itself is still, in my opinion, an appeal with respect to an assessment duly made pursuant to sections 53, 59 or 60, which has been passed upon by the court of revision and county judge pursuant to sections 73 and 76.\nIn the case of section 142 also, as with sections 57, 123 and 125, the subject matter is taxes, in this case taxes already imposed. An appeal from the decision of the assessment commissioner to the court of revision and to the county judge is provided and not only are the tribunals to which appeal may be had, but the persons entitled to appeal, are prescribed in the section itself. In my opinion all these sections stand outside the sections dealing with appeals from assessments and the provisions of section 84 do not apply to them. There being no other provision for an appeal subsequent to the appeal to the county judge provided for by subsection 3 of section 57 applicable to the cases within that section, there was, in my opinion, no right of appeal by the appellants in the present case to the Municipal Board.\nIn Scottish Widows\u2019 Fund Life Assurance Society v. Blennerhassett[5] the Earl of Halsbury said at page 286:\nI content myself with saying that if there is an appeal it must be shewn. It is a principle of law that you cannot have an appeal unless there is either a pre-existing right of appeal at law or a right of appeal conferred by statute. In Furtado v. London Brewery Company[6], Swinfen Eady L.J., put the matter thus at page 712:\nThe rule of law is that although a certiorari lies unless expressly taken away, yet an appeal does not lie unless expressly given by statute.\nComing to the income of 1942, which the appellant purported to tax by entry in the special roll of taxable income in 1943, the first question to be considered is the right, if any, on the part of the appellant municipality to appeal from the county judge to the Municipal Board. The question is governed by section 123, subsection 8, already mentioned. It is the contention on behalf of the appellant that the effect of the subsection is to make applicable to the subject matter of section 123 the provisions of sections 73 and 76 and hence also the provisions of section 84, although counsel appeared to be pressed with some difficulty as to the applicability of subsection 3 of section 73, which entitles any person whose name appears on the ordinary assessment roll in respect of some assessment for real property, business or income, to appeal to the court of revision if he thinks that any other person has been assessed too high or too low or who has been wrongly inserted in or omitted from the assessment roll.\nIn my opinion it is impossible to say that subsection 3 of section 73 is applicable to a case arising under section 123. I think any such construction is excluded by the express mention in section 123, subsection 8, of the person whose name has been entered on the special roll as entitled to appeal and if that be so I think there is no room for the application of section 76, subsection 1 either, which permits an appeal to the county judge at the instance of other persons and particularly at the instance of \u201cany person assessed\u201d. If that person is precluded from an appeal to the court of revision, as I think he is, it would be strange if the legislature had provided for an appeal by that person from the court of revision to the county judge and subsequently to the Ontario Municipal Board. In my opinion no one is given any right of appeal under section 123, subsection 8, except the person, therein described and I think there is no question but that the right of appeal given by the section is not limited to an appeal to the court of revision but includes an appeal therefrom to the higher tribunals mentioned in the statute. If there were any doubt as to the proper construction of subsection 8 on this point I think it would be removed by a reference to the form of the subsection in which it was originally enacted in 1934 by 24 Geo. V, cap. 1, section 8. At that time the subsection had a provision that no appeal should lie from the decision of the county court judge. This provision has since been eliminated by 3 Geo. VI, cap. 3, section 8, but this amendment does not affect the construction of the subsection on this point. The truth is that the subject matter of section 123 as in the case of sections 57, 125 and 142, is outside the appeal procedure laid down by the statute in the case of assessments. There is no general language such as that employed in section 57a (4) and I am unable to apply to the Assessment Act any different canon of construction than that which applies in the case of other statutes; Cartwright v. City of Toronto[7], Further, in every case outside of the ordinary appeal procedure provided for the case of assessments (and there are no others that I know of except the sections just mentioned, namely, 57, 123, 125 and 142) not only are the tribunals to which an appeal lies either specifically mentioned or as in the case of section 123, subsection 8, defined by reference, but the persons intended to have the right of appeal are also expressly mentioned.\nI agree also with Robertson C.J.O., in the view that the mere striking out of the words in subsection 8 limiting the right of appeal given to the county judge did not have the effect of conferring any right of appeal on the municipality. In my opinion, therefore, there was no right on the part of the appellant municipality to appeal to the Municipal Board. The argument for the appellant as to the applicability of section 76, subsection 1, is that, read literally, it provides for an appeal to the county judge against \u201ca decision\u201d of the court of revision and similarly, that section 84, subsection 1, provides for an appeal from \u201cthe decision\u2019\u2019 of the judge and it is said that once a person affected by an entry under section 123 appeals to the court of revision and that court deals with the appeal, there is then \u201ca decision\u201d of that court from which an appeal lies under the sections just mentioned. That argument would be equally applicable in the case of a decision of the county judge under either section 125 or section 142, but in my opinion \u201cthe decision\u201d referred to in sections 76 and 84 is a decision on appeals with respect to assessments and not with respect to matters dealt with by sections 57, 123, 125 or 142.\nWith respect to the 1942 income I should in any event be of opinion that the appellant was not entitled to assess and tax that income in 1943. On the 16th of March, 1943, the council passed by-law 403, levying upon the whole assessment according to the last revised assessment roll. On the 20th of July, 1943, by-law 425 was passed under section 123, providing for a special roll of taxable income and for collecting the taxes not later than the first day of October of the same year.\nOn the same day, July 20th, by-law 426 was passed, referring to by-law 403 and stating that the last mentioned by-law had, through an error, described the revised assessment roll as including income assessments, whereas it did not in fact include such assessments and it amended by-law 403 by striking out all reference to income and providing for a levy upon the special roll of taxable income at the same rates as were set forth in by-law 403. It also by paragraph 5 repealed all by-laws or parts of by-laws inconsistent or repugnant to it.\nPrior to by-laws 425 and 426, the city had been proceeding under the provisions of by-law 22 passed in conformity with section 60 and by-law 403 in purporting to levy on the last revised assessment roll was levying upon the assessment, so far as income was concerned, made in 1942 of 1941 income.\nSo far as subsection 1 of section 123, had it stood alone, is concerned, this procedure would appear to have been regular but it is provided by subsection 12 that \u201cincome received in the year in which a by-law is passed under subsection 1 for the purpose of bringing the provisions of this section into effect shall be subject to the provisions of this section and of such by-law, notwithstanding that such income or any part thereof may have been received before the provisions of this section take effect\u201d.\nMr. Cumming argues that this subsection, to use his language, is to be given \u201cno legal effect\u201d and that therefore the procedure adopted by the appellant was authorized. Mr. Springsteen submitted that the effect of the subsection was to remove any doubt there might be as to the liability to taxation of that portion of income received in the year the by-law was passed between the first of January and the date of the passing of the by-law. In my opinion the purpose of the subsection was to make it clear that while, in the contemplation of the legislature, a by-law passed under the provisions of the section would, apart from subsection 2, have no operation on income received in fact before the date of its passing, such by-law, by reason of the subsection would operate with respect to income received during the whole of that year but should have no further retroactive effect. It would be difficult to attribute to the legislature the view that while apart from subsection 12 the section applied to income received during the whole of the year preceding the year in which the by-law was passed, it would not but for the subsection apply to income received in the latter year between the first of January and the date of the passing. Accordingly, in my opinion, the view of the Court of Appeal on this point was right and, with respect, I agree with it.\nA number of other points were discussed on which, in view of the conclusions to which I have come, it is not necessary to express any opinion, including the question as to whether the income for any of the years here in question was received from the business in respect of which the respondents were liable to business assessment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lorne R.

Simpsons, Limited, [1949] S.C.R. 234\nDate: 1949-01-07\nThe Corporation of the City of Toronto (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nSimpsons, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1948: May 31; 1948: June 1, 2; 1949: January 7\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Business Assessment\u2014Assessment of Income not derived from business assessed\u2014Whether appeal lies from decision of county judge under s. 57(3)\u2014the Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 272, ss. 8, 9, 57, 84 and 123.\nThe respondent was incorporated with powers inter alia to purchase, hold, sell or exchange or otherwise dispose of shares of the capital stock of any other company. It owns all the shares, excepting qualifying shares, of The Robert Simpson Co. Ltd. It also owns all the property occupied by the latter company in Toronto, which it leases to it. In 1936 the subsidiary surrendered a portion of its leased property on Mutual street to the respondent to be occupied by it as its principal office. The respondent\u2019s income consisted practically entirely of the dividends it received from its subsidiary.\nThe appellant under the Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 272, s. 8 assessed the respondent for business assessment in respect of the premises used for its business in each of the years 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1942 and the respondent paid the taxes thereon in each of the succeeding years. The appellant pursuant to s. 9(1) (b), in each of the years 1940 to 1943 inclusive, also assessed the respondent in respect of income which it contended was not derived from the business in respect of which it had been assessed under s. 8. In assessing such income it did so pursuant to a by-law passed under s. 123 (formerly s. 120a of 1934, c.1, s.8) which enables income to be taxed in the year immediately following the year in which income is received.\nHeld: per Taschereau, Kellock and Locke JJ., (Kerwin and Estey JJ., dissenting), that the facts in the case bring it within s. 123 of the Assessment Act and for the reasons given in Walker\u2019s case, ([1949] S.C.R, p. 215, there was no right of appeal from the decision of the county court judge to the Municipal Board, and the appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ., (dissenting), that for the reasons given by them in Walker\u2019s case, supra, an appeal lay to the Municipal Board, and the question now to be decided was whether the appeal from the Board\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeal was upon a question of law, as prescribed by s. 84(6), and that it should be held, that even if the purposes for which the respondent was occupying and using the premises in question could be said to be the carrying on of a business, and that therefore the respondent was liable to business assessment under s. 8; the question whether the income for which the respondent was assessed was derived from the business in respect of which it was so assessable for business, is one of fact, and hence no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, setting aside a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board. The decision of the Ontario Municipal Board had allowed an appeal from a decision of His Honour Judge Parker, senior judge of the County of York, which held that since the respondent was liable to business assessment under s. 8 of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 272, it was not liable to assessment under s. 9 of the Act. The result of the judgment of the Court of Appeal was that the decision of the county judge was restored.\nF.A. Campbell K.C. and J.P. Kent K.C. for the appellant.\nC.F.H. Carson K.C. and Allan Van Every K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the Corporation of the City of Toronto from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the appeal of the respondent, Simpsons, Limited, from an order of the Ontario Municipal Board which had allowed the appeal of the City from a decision of a county judge. All those appeals were assessment appeals under the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 272, as amended, as they arose from the following assessments for income made against the respondent:\u2014\nIn 1940 in respect of 1939 income of $ 920,163.\nIn 1941 in respect of 1940 income of 1,039,859.\nIn 1942 in respect of 1941 income of 556,897.\nIn 1943 in respect of 1942 income of 175,015.\nThese assessments were made under section 123 of the Act, which, as section 120a of the Assessment Act of 1934 had been brought into effect as of January 1, 1935, by a by-law of the City, passed June 25, 1934. Accordingly, in each of the years 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1943, the City assessed and taxed the income for the previous year. In the City of Windsor appeals[1], I have stated my reasons for differing from the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that no appeal lay to the Board, and the same result follows in the present case on the question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\nAppeals to the court of revision from such assessments for income were dismissed but the county judge allowed the appeals of the present respondent from the decision of the court of revision and set aside the assessments. On a transcript of the evidence given before the judge, the Board allowed an appeal by the City from the former\u2019s decision. The first question to be determined is whether the appeal from the Board\u2019s decision to the Court of Appeal was upon a question of law, as prescribed by subsection 6 of section 84 of the Act:\u2014\n(6) An appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to the Court of Appeal upon all questions of law or the construction of a statute, a municipal by-law, any agreement in writing to which the municipality is concerned is a party, or any order of the Board. The provisions of subsection 1 of section 9 of the Act might here be noted:\u2014\n9. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 4 and 8\u2014\n(a) every corporation not liable to business assessment under section 8 shall be assessed in respect of income;\n(b) every corporation although liable to business assessment under section 8 shall also be assessed in respect of any income not derived from the business in respect of which it is assessable under that section.\nAs a matter of fact the respondent was assessed for business assessment in each of the years 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1942, in the sum of $750 and the respondent paid the taxes thereon in each of the succeeding years. While an explanation appears in the record as to this being done as a result of an earlier appeal to the county judge, who declared that the respondent carried on business at 108 Mutual Street, Toronto, it is unnecessary in the view I take to deal with the argument on behalf of the City that, notwithstanding such actual assessment, the respondent was not properly \u201cliable\u201d to business assessment under section 8.\nThe income in question consists practically entirely of the dividends received by the respondent from the Robert Simpson Company, Limited. The conclusion of the county judge is stated as follows:\u2014\nI find that the premises occupied by Simpsons Limited at 108 Mutual Street is occupied and used for the purpose of carrying on its business as an investment, financing and holding company, and that such business is within the contemplation of the Assessment Act and liable for business assessment; and I further find that the dividends on shares held by Simpsons Limited in the Robert Simpson Company, Limited, is income derived from the business of which it (Simpsons, Limited) is liable for business assessment.\nOn the other hand, the Board found on the same evidence that\neven if the purpose for which the respondent was occupying and using the premises at 108 Mutual Street could be said to be the carrying on of a business the dividends received by it from The Robert Simpson Company, Limited, and assessed to it by the appellant are not income received by it from that business.\nThe difficulty of determining whether there is a question of law involved has been pointed out in Rogers-Majestic Corporation v. City of Toronto[2] . The appeal in that case originated with a stated case under section 85 of the Assessment Act and the judgment of this court was based upon the ground that there was no evidence upon which the decision of the county judge could be supported. The appeal culminating in the decision of this court in Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. v. Corporation of the City of Toronto[3], also originated upon a stated case under section 85. As to appeals under section 84, the Court of Appeal has taken such a finding as that of the Board in the present case as one of fact; The City of Toronto v. Famous Players Canadian Corporation Ltd.;[4] Re International Metal Industries Ltd. and City of Toronto,[5]; Re Russell Industries Ltd. v. The City of Toronto,[6]. The judgment of this Court in the first mentioned case, [1936] S.C.R. 141, was carefully expressed so as not to decide the point.\nIn the chapter on \u201cFact or Law in Cases Stated under the Income Tax Acts\u201d, in Dr. Farnworth\u2019s book \u201cIncome Tax Case Law\u201d, the author discusses practically all the cases in the House of Lords and Court of Appeal in England dealing with the question under the Taxing Acts. He points out that no guidance can be obtained from other branches of the law in which the distinction between fact and law is important. The decision of the House of Lords in National Anti-Vivisection Society v. L.R.C.[7], on the particular question of fact there involved may appear to some to be revolutionary but it is in conformity with the course of decision in the Court of Appeal for Ontario under the Assessment Act. There is much to be said for the contrary view but in my opinion, it should be held that, even if the purposes for which the respondent was occupying and using the premises at 108 Mutual Street could be said to be the carrying on of a business and that therefore the respondent was liable to business assessment under section 8 of the Act, the question whether the income for which the respondent was assessed was derived from the business in respect of which it was so assessable for business is one of fact and hence no appeal lay to the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order of the Board restored. The appellant is entitled to its costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The facts in this case bring it within section 123 of the Assessment Act and for the reasons given in Walker\u2019s case I am of the opinion that there was no right of appeal on the part of the appellant from the decision of the county judge to the Municipal Board. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W.G. Angus.\nSolicitors for respondent: J.S.D.

D. Harvey K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dismissing his appeal from a judgment of Macfarlane, J. by which, after findings made by a jury, the action was dismissed. In the Court of Appeal Sydney Smith, J.A. dissented and would have directed a new trial.\nThe defendants, with the exception of the defendant Weeks, are the executive officers of the Victoria Branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Weeks is employed by the Victoria Branch of the Society as an inspector and on February 19, 1947, laid an information charging the plaintiff and his employee, one Longdon, with having wantonly neglected to provide proper care to a sheep, thereby causing unnecessary suffering. The charge was laid under sec. 542 of the Criminal Code and the magistrate issued a summons. On March 6, 1947, the appellant appeared, represented by counsel, and counsel instructed by the Victoria Branch of the Society appeared for the prosecution and obtained leave from the magistrate to withdraw this charge and to substitute the following charge against the appellant alone:\u2014\nThat Sydney Pickles, between the 27th day of January, 1947, and the 4th day of February, 1947, in the Municipality of the District of Saanich, in the County of Victoria, being the owner of four sheep, namely, one sheep destroyed on or about the 3rd day of February, 1947, at Sunstead Farm by Inspector Weeks of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and three others found dead there by the said Weeks on the same day, did unlawfully cause unnecessary suffering by unreasonably omitting to care for such animals contrary to the Criminal Code.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution this charge was dismissed. The evidence taken at this hearing was made part of the record in the action and it is quite clear that no other disposition of the matter could properly have been made.\nAs, in my opinion, there should be a new trial, it is inadvisable that there should be any extended comment on the evidence adduced at the hearing. Briefly stated, the facts were that following an anonymous report received on February 3, 1947, by the defendant Florence G. Barr, the corresponding secretary of the Victoria Branch, that the sheep on the farm of the appellant in the Municipality of Saanich were in bad shape, Weeks in company with an assistant inspector named Hamer was sent to the farm to investigate. They found, according to their evidence, a flock of about a hundred sheep of which, according to Hamer, all but ten or twelve were in good shape. In addition, they found two dead sheep and a dead lamb in or near the barn and in the field nearby a sheep lying on its side struggling and evidently in an extremity. The appellant who lived in Victoria was not present but, with Longdon's consent, the inspectors shot the sheep and a postmortem performed by a veterinary surgeon on the following day disclosed that the animal was suffering from an infestation of worms in its stomach and small intestines and fatty degeneration of the liver. Certain further inquiries were made by the inspectors and written reports submitted to a meeting of the members of the Executive on February 4, on which date a resolution was passed instructing that the opinion of one McIntyre, described in the resolution as a sheep expert, and that of Mr. C. L. Harrison, the city prosecutor for Victoria, be obtained. A further report of the veterinary surgeon made to the appellant on the day following the visit of the inspectors to the farm, and a copy of which was made available to them, recommended that the worming of the flock was necessary but, because of the inclement weather, it would not be advisable to do so at the time and in the meantime advised giving the animals free access to phenotiazine mixed with salt. On February 12, following a further report from the defendant Weeks, the minutes disclose that \"it was decided to lay a charge against Mr. Pickles in regard to one sheep found in a suffering and dying condition.\" It was not, however, until the 17th of February that the defendant Weeks and Florence G. Barr laid the matter before Mr. Harrison who gave evidence that, after considering the facts and particularly noting that there was nothing to indicate that the appellant knew anything about the sheep being ill which had been found lying in the field and had been destroyed and that the veterinarian had said it would not be apparent to the farmer that the sheep was sick until it laid down to die, he advised them not to lay a charge without consulting their solicitor and getting advice on it and told them that he (Harrison) would not lay the charge or recommend that it be laid. On the day following, however, Weeks saw Harrison and showed him an information which had been prepared charging the appellant with wantonly neglecting to provide proper care to a sheep, thereby causing unnecessary suffering. On being asked by Mr. Harrison whether he had got the advice of their lawyer Weeks replied in the negative and was then advised not to swear the information. The charge was, however, laid by Weeks on February 20 and the matter thereafter dealt with as above stated.\nIt should be said that there was a conflict as to what had actually transpired between Mr. Harrison and these two defendants on February 17th and in his discussion with Weeks on the day following. According to Mrs. Barr, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and prosecute and to have Mr. Harvey, K.C. handle the prosecution. According to the defendant Weeks, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and that when he had shown the latter the information which had been drafted he had approved of it. Upon this evidence the jury found that Mr. Harrison's evidence was true and that the statements which the defendant Weeks and Florence G. Barr claimed to have been made to them by him were not made. To these findings, however, a rider was added to which further reference will be made.\nIn charging the jury the learned trial judge informed them that he proposed to ask them to make certain findings of fact and that, dependent upon the nature of their findings, he would decide the question as to whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause. After reviewing the evidence the learned judge said in part:\u2014\nI think those, gentlemen, are the things to which I will direct your attention when you come to consider the questions I will put to you, and upon which I will direct you as to my finding, as to reasonable and probable cause. If you find that Mr. Harrison warned him not to take this prosecution without getting the advice of Counsel, and that he did so without getting it, that evidence goes to show that they had not reasonable cause.\nOn the other hand, you have the evidence of Mr. McIntyre. Did Mr. McIntyre advise him that there was evidence of neglect, or just what was the nature of his comments in connection with that? Were they conditional only, or were they such as a reasonable person would act upon in coming to the decision that the charge should be laid? Was it evidence of neglect, the evidence of the existence of a state of circumstances which would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man placed in the position of Weeks, to come to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime accused?\nThat is the extent of the obligation, and I am asking you questions so I can find out whether or not that is true. I am going to ask you a question with regard to Dr. Bruce, as to what he told them, and with regard to Colonel Evans. When I have put before you those questions and you have answered them, if you answer that Dr. Bruce's evidence is the evidence to be accepted, that Mr. Harrison's evidence is the evidence to be accepted, that Colonel Evans' is the evidence to be accepted then I would instruct you that my verdict would be that the plaintiff has established that there was want of reasonable and probable cause.\nIf, on the other hand, you think that Mr. Weeks' evidence where it is contradicted by those other men, is the evidence to be accepted, and that Mrs. Barr's evidence is the evidence to be accepted; and that Mr. McIntyre gave them a firm opinion that there was neglect under the circumstances, and in your opinion the circumstances were properly described to him, then I would advise you that the plaintiff has not satisfied the onus that was on him.\nUpon the jury retiring a discussion ensued between the learned trial judge and counsel as to certain aspects of the charge and the jury was recalled. In the further charge then delivered the following passage appears:\u2014\nNow I mentioned malice in my charge this morning. There is a provision in law that you may infer malice from want of reasonable and probable cause, but you are by no means bound to do so. In determining the question of malice, the jury may, but are not bound to, find malice in the absence of reasonable and probable cause. You are not obliged to find malice, although both must be found in order that the plaintiff may succeed; unless he proves both lack of reasonable and probable cause and malice, he fails in the action. You may infer malice from some lack of reasonable and probable cause, but there is evidence here directed to the question of malice, which I have referred to in my charge, and I do not think that question needs to arise here. If you find malice at all, you will find it, not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause in this case, but because of the fact that the prosecution was undertaken from motives other than those I have described as proper.\nand it was with this final instruction that the jury retired and arrived at their verdict.\nThe questions asked and the answers made were as follows:\nQuestion 1: \"Were the statements which Mr. Harrison says he made to Inspector Weeks and Mrs Barr in fact made to them?\" Answer: \"Yes.\"\nQuestion 2: \"Were the statements which Inspector Weeks and Mrs. Barr say that Mr. Harrison made to them in fact made to them?\" Answer: \"No.\" Rider: \"We feel that there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of Mr. Harrison's instructions.\"\nQuestion 3: \"Did Mr. Bruce make the statements which Weeks attributed to him on February 7th?\" Answer: \"Yes.\" Question 4: \"Were the statements attributed to Colonel Evans by Mrs. Barr and Inspector Weeks made to them respectively by him?\" Answer: \"Yes.\"\nQuestion 5: \"Did Mr. McIntyre give his opinion that there was neglect as a final opinion on the facts stated by Weeks?\" Answer: \"No.\"\nQuestion 6: \"Did Mr. McIntyre express the opinion subject to confirmation after he had seen the sheep?\" Answer: \"Yes.\"\nQuestion 7: \"Was the evidence on which Weeks acted reasonably apparent to him to be unreliable or incomplete?\" Answer: \"No.\"\nQuestion 8: \"Did Weeks honestly believe, taking into consideration all the statements as you find them made on the evidence in this case, that Pickles was probably guilty of the offence charged?\" Answer: \"Yes.\"\nQuestion 9: \"Did Weeks lay the Information or either of them maliciously, that is, from any motive other than an honest desire to bring a person (that is the plaintiff) whom he believed to be a guilty person to justice?\" Answer: \"No.\"\nQuestion 10: \"Did any of the remaining defendants authorize the prosecution of the plaintiff maliciously?\" Answer: \"No.\"\nQuestion 11: \"If so, which defendant?\" No answer.\nQuestion 12: \"Regardless to your answers to the above questions, give total damages suffered by the plaintiff: (a) 'for Special damages.' \" Answer: \"$403.94.\" (b) \"for General damages.\" Answer: \"Nil.\"\nAs to the rider attached to the answer to the second question it must, in my opinion, be rejected. It had not been suggested either by the defendant Florence G. Barr or by the defendant Weeks that they had misunderstood the advice given to them by Mr. Harrison on February 17th; rather had they both attributed to him statements which the jury found as a fact had not been made. There was in truth no possibility of misunderstanding the advice given by Mr. Harrison to these two defendants or that given by him to Weeks on the following day. The suggestion made in the rider that there was a misunderstanding contradicts the jury's findings in Question 1, that the statements which Mr. Harrison said he had made were in truth made, since those statements were incapable of misinterpretation. The jury had also found that the statements of Weeks and Mrs. Barr that Mr. Harrison had told them \"to go ahead\" were untrue. As these findings were made in response to direct questions, the rider which is inconsistent with the answers should be rejected.\nAs to Questions 3 to 6 inclusive, the learned trial judge had informed the jury that if they accepted the evidence of Doctor Bruce, Colonel Evans and Mr. Harrison he would instruct them that he would decide that the plaintiff had established that there was want of reasonable and probable cause. He had said further that if they believed the evidence of Weeks and Mrs. Barr in preference to that of Bruce, Evans and Harrison, and if they found that McIntyre gave them a firm opinion that there was neglect under the circumstances, he would advise them that the plaintiff had not proven a want of reasonable and probable cause. The jury, however, as has been pointed out, accepted the evidence of Mr. Harrison and found that McIntyre had only expressed his opinion subject to confirmation after he had seen the sheep, while accepting the evidence of Weeks and Mrs. Barr where it contradicted that of Evans and Bruce. This contingency was not provided for in the charge so that if in fact the jury interpreted the concluding portion of the judge's charge as a direction that they were to consider whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause in answering Questions 9 and 10 which were directed to malice, they were without any instructions as to whether a want of reasonable and probable cause had been shown. That question was one for the trial judge to determine and in the situation created by the answers made to Questions 1 and 6 inclusive the jury acted without instructions. In Brown v. Hawkes [3], Cave, J. said in part:\u2014\nThere may be such plain want of reasonable and probable cause that the jury may come to the conclusion that the prosecutor could not honestly have believed in the charge he made and in that case want of reasonable and probable cause is evidence of malice.\nIt is impossible in the present case to know whether this aspect of the matter was even considered by the jury or, if it was, upon what basis they proceeded. This, I think, is a fatal objection to the verdict and the judgment entered.\nIf it is wrong to assume that the jury understood from the concluding portion of the charge that a want of reasonable and probable cause was a circumstance from which they might infer malice and accepted the concluding part of the direction that, if malice was to be found at all, it was not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause, there was misdirection. The plaintiff had, it is true, adduced some other evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the prosecution had been initiated maliciously but, in addition to this, there was evidence upon which the plaintiff might properly contend that there was a plain want of reasonable and probable cause.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and a new trial directed. No objection was made to that portion of the judge's charge which, in my view, was misdirection, though counsel for the plaintiff had in the earlier discussion made it clear that he contended that from a want of reasonable and probable cause malice could be inferred.

For the first statement, the usual warning was not given before accused bad completed his verbal answers, but it was given before the written statement was signed. This statement contained an account of the movements of the appellant for some days before and after the day of the commission of the crime, which indicated that he could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained admissions of his intimate relations with the wife of the murdered man. The second statement before which a warning was given, reiterated the substance of the first, but added a complete confession of the commission of the crime by appellant. The trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in evidence and the majority in the Court of Appeal agreed with him.\nHeld: Estey J. dissenting, that both statements were voluntarily made and that the appeal should be dismissed.\nHeld also, that the first statement was incriminating and not exculpatory (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. contra).\nHeld further, that the dictum in Gach v. The King [1943] S.C.R. '254 that \"when a person has been arrested, all confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are inadmissible in evidence, unless proper caution has been given\" was obiter: Ibrahim v. The King [1914] A.C. 599 and Prosko v. The King 63 S.C.R. 226 followed. (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. expressing the opinion that the Gach case had no application to the present case as, in their view, the first statement was exculpatory).\nPer Estey J. (dissenting): The first statement was incriminating and the trial judge misdirected himself to the effect that the statement was exculpatory and not evidence against the accused. That though a warning was given prior to the second statement, it was immediately followed by questions and incidents which were not sufficiently disclosed by the evidence to justify a conclusion that the statement was voluntarily made.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing (Bissonnette J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before Cot\u00e9 J. and a jury, on a charge of murder.\nHon. Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.\nN\u00f6el Dorion K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014The appellant Gaston Boudreau was charged with the murder of Joseph Laplante, and on the 26th of September, 1947, he was found guilty and condemned to be hanged. This conviction was upheld by the Court of King's Bench, Province of Quebec 2, Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissenting, on the ground that certain confessions made by the appellant were illegally admitted in evidence.\nThe main facts leading to these alleged confessions which are impugned, may be briefly stated as follows:\nOn the morning of May the 29, 1947, the body of Laplante was found on the highway, leading to Lake Castagnier, a small municipality near Amos, Abitibi, P.Q, The police authorities started immediately to investigate, and the Coroner's inquest, originally fixed for the 29th of May, was adjourned sine die by Coroner Brousseau until further evidence could be obtained. It was resumed on the 6th of June, 1947.\nAt first, Constable Lefebvre, Sergeant Dupont, Sergeant Massue, Detective Oggier and Dr. Roussel, legal medico expert for the Provincial Government, who had come from Amos and Montreal to try and solve the mystery of Laplante's death, which was obviously a brutal murder, had but very scant clues leading to the discovery of the author of this crime.\nOn Sunday, the 1st of June, Lefebvre, Oggier and Dr. Roussel went at Laplante's house where the body was exposed. There, they saw amongst others, Mrs. Laplante and Gaston Boudreau, the appellant in the present case. As Boudreau looked nervous, he was asked by Oggier to follow him, and was brought the same evening to Amos at the police headquarters. He was there put under the supervision of the jailer, in the Constable's room, and Sergeant Massue telephoned the Coroner to obtain the necessary authorization to detain him as an important witness. This authorization was given verbally on Sunday 'night, and the next morning, Massue received by mail a written authorization to detain Boudreau.\nOn that morning, Massue summoned Boudreau in his office and told him that he was held as an important witness. In view of the fact that Boudreau's friendship with Mrs. Laplante was publicly known, it was decided to ask him a few questions, and on Tuesday evening, at about eight thirty, Massue questioned him on his movements during the week of the murder. Without being warned, Boudreau said that he had left the previous Tuesday to go hunting at a place called Canton Vassal, and that he had taken with him a shot gun. He explained his run in the bush where he had sprung his traps, his return on foot the following Saturday to one Therrien's house, and then to his home in a taxi with one Carpentier. He also gave some information concerning his fire-arms, his cartridges and the result of his hunt. Massue then pursued further his investigation, and asked him about his relations with Mrs. Laplante. Boudreau freely told the circumstances in which he had met her, and the fact unknown to the police, that she was his mistress.\nBoudreau was then asked if he was willing to repeat his statement so that it could be taken in writing, and he agreed without hesitation. Mr. Z. Bacon, secretary at the police headquarters, took down word for word Boudreau's statement. As the sheet of paper on which the answers were to be typewritten bore the regular warning, it was read to the accused before anything was committed to writing. Upon completion, the whole document including the warning, was read to the appellant who signed it after having been sworn by a Justice of the Peace.\nOggier continued his investigation. It was discovered that the pellets found in Laplante's skull were BB Gauge, shot very likely from a 12 gauge shot gun, the same calibre as the one found in Aubuchon's house and belonging to Boudreau. The cartridges he had in his house were also BB. This new evidence strengthened the detective's suspicions which at first were very slight, but were, nevertheless still quite insufficient to charge Boudreau with murder. There was no direct evidence to link him with the commission of the crime.\nOn the 5th of June, when Oggier returned from Lake Castagnier with Massue, it was decided to call Boudreau back to obtain from him additional information. Massue told him that he was held as an important witness concerning Laplante's death, and warned him that he was not obliged to talk, but that if he wished to say anything, it could be used as evidence before the Court. Boudreau then volunteered to give further information. He gave additional details concerning his intimacy with Mrs. Laplante, and while he was talking, Massue left the office to get a glass of water, and the accused spontaneously admitted to Oggier, without any question being put to him: \"I may as well tell you, I killed him.\" Oggier called Massue back, and in the presence of Oggier and Massue Boudreau told the whole story of how he killed Laplante. This statement was typewritten by an employee of the police, and sworn to by Boudreau.\nThe learned trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in evidence, and the majority of the Court of Appeal 3 agreed with him.\nThe law concerning the admissibility of statements made to persons in authority, finds its application only when these statements are 'of an incriminating nature. The first statement made by the appellant on the 2nd of June to. Massue, was not in my opinion of that 'character, and nothing can be found in it, which directly or indirectly tends to connect the appellant with Laplante's murder. In fact, Boudreau denied all participation in the offence, by telling all that he had done in the course of his hunting trip. His statement was exculpatory. The admission of his intimacy with Mrs. Laplante may at the most constitute a possible motive, but cannot in itself be considered as evidence of guilt. It does not show in the remotest way that the appellant was involved in Laplante's death.\nCounsel for the appellant has cited the case of Gach v. The King 4. I do not think that the present case can be governed by that case, where the accused had made confessions of an incriminating nature. The Court 5 held that in view of the circumstances revealed by the evidence, the accused was entitled to the same protection, before being questioned by a person in authority, as if he had been in custody.\nAs to the second statement made on June the 5th, it is said in the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Bissonnette, that it was a logical sequence of the first one, and therefore became illegal, notwithstanding the warning by the police officers. With due respect, I do not agree with this contention. I fail to see anything in the first statement that could in any way influence the second one, and be an inducement for Boudreau to make it to the police. Boudreau spoke freely after having been warned, and I have no doubt that it is without fear and without a hope of advantage from the detectives, that he made the minutely detailed recital of this premeditated crime. The spontaneity of that part of the confession, dealing with the actual killing, establishes clearly its voluntary character, and this, with all the other circumstances shown at the trial, leaves no doubt in my mind, that the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge on the \"voir-dire\", were right.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nKerwin J.:\u2014The first statement has been treated by the majority of the judges in the Courts 6 below as exculpatory and I understand that that is also the view in this Court of my lord the Chief Justice and my brother Taschereau. There is no doubt, however, that the statement affords a possible motive for the murder, and in my opinion that would be sufficient to warrant applying the rule, if it exists, that once a person is under arrest any statement given by him in answer to questions by those in authority is inadmissible unless preceded by a proper warning. It was argued that such a rule was laid down by this Court in Gach v. The King 7. Mr. Justice Taschereau, who spoke for the majority in that case, is of opinion that the decision does not apply but that is because, in his view, the first statement given by Boudreau was exculpatory. For the reason given, I am, with respect, unable to concur and it therefore becomes necessary to consider the Gach decision. I believe it is agreed that it was sufficient for the disposition of that appeal 8 to decide that the statement there in issue was given as a result of a threat and that the following statement, at page 254, was therefore unnecessary for the actual decision:\u2014\nThere is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage which an accused may expect from a person in authority.\nThis statement is couched in very broad terms and, if read in its widest sense, would prevent, for instance, the placing in evidence of any incriminating answers to questions put by a police officer to a person arrested at the scene of a crime immediately after its commission. It has been construed to change the law as it was considered to be prior to Gach,\u2014by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 9, and by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal 10 in the present case and is really the basis of the appeal to this Court.\nAgain with great respect, I think it advisable that it should now be stated clearly what this Court considers the law to be. My view is that it has not been changed from that set out in Ibrahim v. Rex 11 and Rex v. Prosko 12. The fundamental question is whether a confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary. The mere fact that a warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility but, on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind the hands of the Court so as to compel it to rule out a statement. All the surrounding circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their review the Court is not satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the statement will be rejected. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning will be a factor and, in many cases, an important one.\nIn the present case the accused gave a second statement in which is repeated the admissions of his intimacy with the deceased's wife contained in the first statement but, in addition, contained an admission of the slaying. The second statement was made after a proper warning. The trial judge admitted both in evidence and notwithstanding that he admitted the first because of his view that it was exculpatory, I am not prepared to disagree with his conclusion as to either. The police were not compelled to tell the accused specifically that notwithstanding his first statement he was not obliged to make another, and the first contains nothing that is not incorporated in the latter.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nRand, J.:\u2014The appellant Boudreau was 'Convicted of murder and the point of dissent on which he comes to this Court is the improper reception of two written statements, the first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife of the murdered man and the second, in addition to a repetition and an elaboration of the first admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At the time of making them he was being held under a coroner's warrant as a material witness. There was no more than a suspicion against him when in the first conversation with police officers in which questions were asked him he purported to detail his movements on the two or three days before the death and admitted the intimacy. Having consented to make the statement in writing, a justice of the peace was summoned and the statement made out, signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing, the justice read out the words of the usual warning which happened to be printed across the top of the paper. Two days later, after a formal warning, a further discussion took place with two officers and while one of them was momentarily out of the room and after a reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau suddenly burst out with the words \"j'aime autant vous le dire: c'est moi qui l'a tu\u00e9.\" This was followed by details. He then, as in the first case, consented to have the statement put in writing, and a like course was followed as before.\nThe objection is that the first oral admission, without warning, of what, in my opinion, was, in the circumstances, an incriminating fact, nullified both statements: that, having committed himself so far, what followed was its compulsive sequence, unless, which was not the case, the warning on the second occasion had so specifically dealt with the previous statement as to efface any effect that might then have remained on his mind. In support of this position, Rex v. Gach 13, is cited. Mr. Gendron argued that what was formerly a rule of practice under which the trial judge could and almost invariably did but was not bound to rule out confessions resulting from questions put to a person under arrest by one in authority without a warning has, by that decision, been converted into an inflexible rule of law; and it is pointed out that that view of it has been taken by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 14. The particular language from which this conclusion is drawn is that of Taschereau J. in the following paragraph:\u2014\nThere is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage which an accused may expect from a person in authority.\nAs the reasons of both Kerwin, J. and Taschereau, J. show, there was in the case clear evidence of a threat on the part of the officer, and the facts which might have called for such an examination of the rule as is suggested were not present. At the most, then, it could be only a dictum: but I am bound to say that I cannot take the language as intended to do more than to state the existing rule. It is, therefore, I think, a misinterpretation of this decision to treat it as having effected a significant change in the character of the rule, and the point 'as put to us by Mr. Gendron fails.\nThe cases of Ibrahim v. Rex 15, Rex v. Voisin 16 and Rex v. Prosko 17 lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case. The underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made? Here the trial judge found that it was. It would be a serious error to place the ordinary modes of investigation of crime in a strait jacket of artificial rules; and the true protection against improper interrogation or any kind of pressure or inducement is to leave the broad question to the court. Rigid formulas1 can be both meaningless to the weakling and absurd to the sophisticated or hardened criminal; and to introduce a new rite as an inflexible preliminary condition would serve no genuine interest of the accused and but add an unreal formalism to that vital branch of the administration of justice.\nI do not mean to imply any right on the part of officers to interrogate or to give countenance or approval to the practice; I leave it as it is, a circumstance frequently presented to courts which is balanced between a virtually inevitable tendency and the danger of abuse.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKellock, J.:\u2014This appeal comes to this court upon the basis of the dissenting judgment of Bissonnette J. in the court below 18, which affirmed the conviction of the appellant by the Superior Court on a charge of murder. The questions raised involve the admissibility of two statements made by the appellant to police officers during the course of questions put to him by them on two different occasions. On the first occasion the usual warning was not given until the appellant had completed his verbal answers but it was given before his statement was committed to writing and signed by him. This statement contained a circumstantial account of the movements of the appellant for some days before and after the day upon which the crime was committed, which indicated that he could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained admissions however, with respect to relations existing between the appellant and the wife of the murdered man.\nThe second statement reiterated the substance of the first, but added a complete and circumstantial account of the commission of the crime by the appellant. Mr. Justice Bissonnette treated the first statement as having been made without a warning and he considered it inadmissible on the ground that it had been laid down by this court in the case of Rex v. Gach 19, that lack of warning in any case rendered a statement inadmissible as a matter of law. He was also of the 'opinion that the inadmissibility of the first statement rendered the second inadmissible, as in his view, the appellant ought to have been pointedly warned that notwithstanding he had made the first statement he need not say anything. The question is therefore raised as to whether or not, assuming the warning with respect to the first statement to have been insufficient, either statement was thereby rendered inadmissible as a matter of law, even although the learned trial judge, upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, was of opinion that in each instance the appellant had spoken voluntarily.\nThe governing principle is stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King 20 as follows:\nIt has long been established as a postive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear or prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been decided by high authority in recent times in Regina v. Thompson 21 \u2026\nAt page 613 Viscount Sumner refers to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 22, and quotes from the judgment of Channell J. at page 713, where the latter said with respect to answers to questions put by a constable after arresting:\nWhen he has taken anyone into custody \u2026 he ought not to question the prisoner \u2026 I am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that if such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his discretion refuse to allow the answers to be given in evidence \u2026\nOn the same page Viscount Sumner refers to an excerpt from the judgment of Channell J. in Rex v. Boot and Jones 23, where the latter said at p. 179:\nthe moment you have decided to charge him and praotically got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is no actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a question it is inadmissible; what happens is that the judge says it is not advisable to press the matter.\nViscount Sumner concludes:\nAnd of this Darling J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal observes the \"principle was put very clearly by Channell J.\"\nLord Sumner at p. 614 refers to this view of the law as \"a probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the better opinion\", although their Lordships say that the final declaration as to the law on the subject should be left to the \"revising functions of a general Court of Criminal Appeal.\"\nIn Rex v. Colpus 24, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England, in delivering the judgment of that court Viscount Reading C.J., said at 579:\nWe do not propose to say more in this case than that the principle laid down in Reg. v. Thompson 25 and approved in Ibrahim v. Rex 26 is the principle which is to be applied in the present case.\nThe case before that court involved statements made by the appellants before a military court of inquiry. These were admitted although there had been no warning, the court being of opinion that on all the evidence they were voluntary statements.\nIn the following year in The King v. Voisin 27, again a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant, in response to a request by the police, went to a police station where he made a statement which was taken down in writing. He was then asked whether he had any objection to writing down certain words, and upon his stating he had no objection, he wrote them. He was not cautioned at any time. It was contended at the trial that the words which he had written were inadmissible on the ground that the writing was obtained by the police without having first cautioned the appellant and while he was in custody. The writing was, however, admitted. The court followed the judgment of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case 28. At page 558 A. T. Lawrence J. said:\nThe question as to whether a person has been duly cautioned before the statement was made is one of the circumstances that must be taken into consideration, but this is a circumstance upon which the judge should exercise his discretion. It cannot be said as a matter of law that the absence of a caution makes the statement inadmissible.\nI do not think it possible to regard this case as other than a case of a statement obtained from a person in custody as the result of questioning by the police and it was so dealt with by the court. There is, in my opinion, no room for distinction whether there be one or more than one question asked.\nIn 1922 the question came before this court in Prosko v. The King 29. In that case the appellant was in the custody of two American detectives for the purpose of being brought before the American Immigration authorities. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of murder had been issued in this country.\nThe appellant was told by the immigration officers that they were going to take up his case with the United States Immigration officials and have him deported to Canada, whereupon he said, \"I am as good as dead if you send me there.\" Upon the officers asking \"why\", he gave the statement which was in question. No warning had been given to him. The Chief Justice, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur, JJ., followed and applied the principle laid down in Ibrahim v. The King 30, The King v. Colpus 31 and The King v. Voisin 32. In this case but a single question was asked. The case was treated by all the members of the court as one of answers made to questions by persons in authority without a warning having been given. It was held that the evidence was admissible. The court considered that the basic question to be answered was as to whether or not the statement had been voluntarily made. At page 237 Anglin J. said:\nThe two detectives were persons in authority; the accused was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in extradition proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning whatever' was given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to exclude the admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay '33, they are undoubtedly circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.\nIn Gach v. The King 34, the appellant was charged with having unlawfully received certain ration' books, knowing them to have been stolen. Certain police officers called upon the appellant and told him that one Nagurski had stated that he had sold ration books to the appellant, that he could be prosecuted, and that in any event it would be better for him to hand them over. At the end of the conversation they told him that he was to accompany them to the police barracks to talk to an inspector. The inspector there told the appellant that he would, in all probability, be charged. He was then asked certain questions and made certain answers. No warning was given. The admissibility of these answers was challenged.\nKerwin J., who delivered the judgment of himself and Duff C.J., referred to Ibrahim v. The King 35 and Sankey v. The King 36, and held the evidence inadmissible as having been made after appellant had been told by the police that it would be better if he made a statement.\nThe judgment of Taschereau J., with whom Rinfret J., as he then was, and Hudson J. agreed, reached the same result. The judgment of the majority is based upon the judgments in The Queen v. Thompson 37, Rex v. Knight and Thayre 38, Lewis v. Harris 39, and Rex v. Crowe and Myerscough 40.\nAs already mentioned, the first two of the above four authorities are referred to by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim's 41 case. In The Queen v. Thompson 42 there is no suggestion that any warning had been given. The statement, however, was not rejected on that ground but on the ground that the Grown had not satisfied the burden resting on it of establishing that the statement had been made voluntarily. That is all that the case is cited for by Taschereau J. Had the mere lack of warning been regarded as rendering the statement inadmissible, the strong court which decided The Queen v. Thompson 43, would undoubtedly have said so. They did not.\nAgain in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 44, the statement which the Crown tendered had in fact been preceded by a warning. It is not therefore in itself a decision as to admissibility or inadmissibilty where no warning is given. Taschereau J. quotes from the reasons for judgment of Channell J. at p. 713, including:\nWhen he has taken anyone into custody, and also before doing so when he has already decided to make the charge, he ought not to question the prisoner. A magistrate or judge cannot do it, and a police officer certainly has no more right to do so.\nChannell J. immediately adds, however, what is included in that which is quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 45 case:\nI am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that if such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his discretion refuse to allow the answer to be given in evidence and in my opinion that is the right course to pursue.\nThat is not to say that the rule is that all such answers are inadmissible, but that as a matter of discretion the judge may refuse to admit. That this is the correct view of what the learned judge says is shown by that part of his direction in Rex v. Booth and Jones 46, quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case at p. 613:\n\u2026 the (moment you have decided to charge him and practically got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is no actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a question, it is inadmissible\u2014what happens is that the judge says it is not admissible to press the matter.\nIn Rex v. Booth and Jones 47, as in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 48, the statement tendered had in fact been preceded by a warning.\nIn Lewis v. Harris 49, the headnote to which is quoted by Taschereau J., a constable had observed a child coming out of a store on a Sunday, and finding out from her that she had made a purchase of candy, he went back into the store with her and asked the proprietor certain questions, the admissibility of which was in question on the appeal. In that case the fact was that the appellant was not in custody and the constable had not made up his mind to lay a charge. The case is therefore not in pari materia with the case at bar. In the course of his judgment Darling J. said at p. 71:\nA constable ought not, if he has made up his mind that whatever the answer may be he will arrest the person to whom he is speaking, to ask that person an incriminating question. The law does not say that the answer must be excluded and that it is not evidence, but it has been frequently held that if that rule is infringed then the judge in his discretion may reject the evidence, and it is tolerably certain that if there is any sign that the evidence was unfairly obtained he would reject it. The true rule is that nothing must be done to hold out an inducement to a person, and no threat must be used to induce a person, to make an incriminating statement \u2026\nThe last case to which Taschereau J. refers is Rex v. Crowe and Myerscough 50, a decision of Sankey J., as he then was. The question involved was as to the admissibility of a statement in answer to questions put by the police made by the appellant Myerscough before arrest and before the police had determined to arrest her. After she had made the answers orally, the appellant signed a written statement in which she said that \"This statement has been read over to me. It is made quite voluntarily and is true\". Sankey J. admitted the statement on the grounds, (1) that it had been made when she was not under arrest; (2) before it had been decided to arrest her; and (3) that she herself had said it had been made voluntarily. In the course of his judgment Sankey J. said what is quoted by Taschereau J., viz:\nIf a police officer has determined to effect an arrest, or if the person is in custody, then be should ask no questions which will in any way tend to prove the guilt of such person from this own mouth.\nIt is to be noted that Sankey J. does not say that if this rule is disobeyed and a statement is made, it is inadmissible as a matter of law.\nIt is clear therefore that in none of the cases referred to in the judgment of the majority in Gach's 51 case, is it laid down that a statement made by a person in custody in answer to questions but by a person in authority, is, as a matter of law inadmissible. On the contrary, the question is in all cases as to whether the Crown, as stated in Rev. Thompson, supra, has satisfied the onus that the statement has in fact been made voluntarily. While there may be expressions in the judgment of the majority in Gach's case, taken apart from the context, which might appear to extend the decisions, as pointed out by Atkinson J. in Lorentzen v. Lydden & Co. 52: Again and again judges have been told by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords that words used in previous oases must be interpreted with reference to the facts before the court and the issues with which it was dealing.\nIn Gach's case it is plain from the judgment of the majority that the statement sought to be used in evidence had been made by the appellant after the officers had said to him \"that it would be better for him to hand them over.\" In these circumstances all the members of the court were of opinion that it could not be said that the statement was voluntary.\nI do not consider therefore that it can be said that anything said in Gach's 53 case can be taken as inconsistent with the previous decision in Prosko's 54 case by which the court was bound, even though it could be said that the court was not also bound to follow what was termed by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 55 case as a \"probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the better opinion.\"\nIn the case at bar the second statement, which included the substance of the first, was held by the trial judge to have been voluntarily made. I think therefore that the appeal must be dismissed.\nEstey, J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant's conviction for the murder of Joseph Laplante was affirmed by a majority in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) in Quebec 56. Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissented on the bases as set out in the formal judgment:\n1. L'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans l'obtention et la production de la premi\u00e8re confession;\n2. L'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans l'obtention et la production de la deuxi\u00e8me confession, particuli\u00e8rement en raison de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re;\n3. L'inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve des aveux ou confessions.\nMr. Justice Bissonnette was of the opinion that the first statement or confession was not exculpatory as the learned trial judge has construed it, and because no warning had been given it was in his opinion improperly admitted. He summarized his conclusions relative to the second statement under three headings, as follows:\nLe premier, c'est que j'estime que la mise en garde sur la deuxi\u00e8me confession, m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, ne constituait pas, sous les circonstances de cette cause, un avertissement suffisant, car ce jeune homme ne pouvait alors ignorer qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait certains aveux et que tout ce qu'on lui demandait ce soir-l\u00e0, c'\u00e9tait de circonstancier ce qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit. II s'attache donc une pr\u00e9somption tr\u00e8s forte que l'appelant pouvait se croire tenu, oblig\u00e9, contraint de parler.\nLe deuxi\u00e8me motif c'est que les deux confessions sont si intimement li\u00e9es, que l'exclusion de l'une entra\u00eene celle de l'autre, car le jury ne pouvait certes pas se d\u00e9tacher compl\u00e8tement de l'impression que la lecture de la premi\u00e8re pouvait avoir dans son esprit, dans la consid\u00e9ration du mobile du crime.\nComme troisi\u00e8me motif, je dirai, \u00e0 la suite de M. le juge Anglin dans l'affaire Sankey, que si l'interrogatoire que l'on fait subir \u00e0 un pr\u00e9venu n'est pas, per se, ill\u00e9gal, il faut, d'autre part, bien s'assurer que la Couronne s'est acquitt\u00e9e de son 'obligation de prouver que les aveux sont libres, nullement entach\u00e9s d'une contrainte physique ou morale quelconque. Et cette preuve, (ajoutait le juge en chef Anglin, ne peut qu'exceptionnellement ressortir du seul fait du serment des officiers de police que l'inculp\u00e9 a parl\u00e9 librement.\nThe murder occurred Thursday, May 29, 1947, at Lac Castagnier about twenty-four miles from Amos in the Province of Quebec.\nDetective Oggier arrived at Amos on Saturday, May 31st. He acquainted himself with the information already gathered by the Provincial Police and on Sunday he and Constable Lefebvre proceeded to Lac Castagnier. At Mrs. Laplante's they found a number of people, including Boudreau. Detective Oggier desired to question Boudreau \"sur ses all\u00e9es et venues,\" and \"parce que j'avais des soup\u00e7ons,\" and requested him to accompany them to Amos. At Amos the coroner was communicated with and Boudreau detained at the jail. On Monday morning, June 2nd, Detective-Sergeant Massue had Boudreau brought into his office and there informed him 'that he was held as a material witness. Boudreau said nothing when so informed and was taken back into custody. In fact no questions were asked and no statement made by Boudreau until Tuesday night, the reason for which is explained by Detective Oggier in the course of his evidence:\nQ. Vous avez pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de lui parler de ses all\u00e9es et venues?\nR. Non, mon enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te.\nQ. Pourquoi pas commencer \u00e0 le questionner?\nR. J'avais pas assez d'informations sur la cause et j'ai cru bon de continuer mon enqu\u00eate.\nDetective Oggier continued his inquiries at Lac Castagnier and returned to Amos on Tuesday, June 3rd. That evening at about 8.30 Boudreau was brought into the office of Detective-Sergeant Massue where Massue and Oggier questioned him. No warning was given and the conversation lasted about an hour. The statements made by Boudreau were in reply to questions, for the most part by Detective-Sergeant Massue. Boudreau there admitted ownership of a 12 gun as well as a revolver and told the police that he had left his home about midday on Tuesday, May 27th, to go into the woods to check over his traps, and returned on Saturday, when he heard of the murder of Laplante. He also stated that he had visited and worked at Laplante's place. When questioned he admitted intimate relations with Mrs. Laplante but when pressed with regard thereto \"il paraissait un peu g\u00ean\u00e9.\"\nThe officers acknowledged that his information relative to his relations with Mrs. Laplante, apart from some details, but corroborated that which they had already received. In fact as regards the entire interview Oggier deposed that they had received no new information of consequence but their suspicions were strengthened. As yet, however, they concluded that they did not have sufficient to justify the laying of an information and complaint.\nBoudreau, after making these verbal statements to the officers, consented to make a statement in writing. Bacon, the secretary of the provincial police, was called to take down the statement and when completed Tessier, Deputy Prothonotary, was called. He ascertained that Boudreau could read, handed to him a copy of the statement which he followed as Tessier read it aloud. Boudreau thereafter signed it and pledged his oath thereto before Tessier.\nDetective Oggier returned on Wednesday and Thursday to Lac Castagnier where he continued his investigation and returned again to Amos Thursday evening about 8.00 or 8.30. He and Detective-Sergeant Massue had further conversation and decided to again question Boudreau. Oggier's own explanation is as follows:\nR. On a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 tous les deux ensemble. J'ai rencontr\u00e9 le sergent Massue \u00e0 son bureau et je lui ai fait part de mon enqu\u00eate additionnelle au Lac Castagnier et on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le faire venir, de le mettre sur ses gardes et de voir s'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous donner d'autres informations.\nD. Vous croyiez avoir une preuve contre lui et vous vouliez avoir une d\u00e9claration de lui?\nR. Lui, parce que je voyais que sa premi\u00e9re d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te.\nBoudreau was brought into Massue's office at about 11.00 o'clock that night and there remained until about 1.00 o'clock in the morning. On this occasion prior to any questions being asked Massue warned Boudreau. As to why the warning was given Massue deposed: \"Parce que nous \u00e9tions plus convaincus que le mardi soir.\" Immediately he had given the warning Massue asked the appellant \"s'il avait des informations nouvelles \u00e0 nous donner.\" Oggier deposed: \"Il s'est assis et il a pens\u00e9 et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 conter la m\u00eame histoire que la fois d'avant.\" He also deposed: \"Le sergent Massue a pos\u00e9 plusieurs questions concernant les armes \u00e0 feu et madame Laplante.\" The appellant's gun used in committing the murder, his revolver and some cartridges were shown to him during this interview. The sack and the box found near the scene of the murder may or may not have been shown to him. It was at this interview that Boudreau stated: \"Messieurs, vous le savez pas combien que j'aime cette femme-l\u00e0.\" At some time during the interview the appellant became and remained very nervous. After about half an hour Massue left his office to obtain a glass of water. As to what happened in his absence Oggier deposed:\nJe lui ai dit que j'avais vu son p\u00e9re et sa m\u00e8re et l\u00e0 il a dit: \"J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a tu\u00e9.\" J'ai l\u00e2ch\u00e9 un cri et j'ai dit: \"Viens t'en de suite.\"\nIn reply to their further questions Boudreau gave them the details of the murder and consented to give a written statement. Then, as on Tuesday evening, Bacon was called, later Tessier, before whom the statement was signed and appellant pledged his oath thereto.\nThe learned trial judge admitted the first statement in evidence because, in his opinion, it did not implicate the appellant but was rather exculpatory in character. It did contain an alibi and an admission that appellant owned a \u00b7 12 gun. The greater part, however, described his relations with Mrs. Laplante, from which the jury might well find the motive that prompted the murder. In this aspect the statement implicated the appellant in the commission of the offence.\nIf you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the fact as well. Ped Duff, C.J. in The King v. Barbour 57.\nSee also Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Ball 58. Then when both statements are read together the alibi is but a contradiction of his subsequent confession and to that extent is evidence that would be prejudicial to the appellant should any question of credibility arise in the mind of the jury. The learned trial judge, with respect, misdirected himself as to the significance of this statement as evidence against the appellant.\nOn Thursday evening Massue and Oggier again had the appellant, who was still under arrest, brought into the former's office, \"\u2026 de voir s'il \u00e9tait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous donner d'autres informations \u2026 parce que je voyais que sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te.\"\nThe important issue the learned trial judge had to determine was whether the confession \"J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a tu\u00e9,\" made to Oggier was free and voluntary within the meaning of the authorities. These words are not in the written statement that followed. It is, however, what led up to the making of this confession that is vital in determining the issue, was it freely and voluntarily made. If in determining whether a confession is freely and voluntarily made the trial judge does not misdirect himself in law his finding should be accepted by an Appellate Court. It appears that in this case the learned trial judge, apart from his misdirection with regard to the first statement already dealt with, has misdirected himself in not considering the warning as given in relation to all the circumstances leading up to the making of this confession, including those before as well as those after the warning was given, and particularly as to whether, under all the circumstances, the effect of the warning as given had not been destroyed. It is the sufficiency of the warning under all the circumstances, the association of or connection between the two statements and the effect of the questions asked that are raised in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Bissonnette.\nThe oft-quoted statement of the law by Lord Sumner in Ibraham v. Rex 59, reads as follows:\nIt has long been established as a positive rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale. In the Ibrahim case the accused was in custody when Major Barrett came up to him and without any thought of a prosecution asked, \"Why have you done such a senseless act?\" to which the accused replied, \"some three or four days he has been abusing me; without a doubt I killed him.\" Nothing more was said and no warning or caution had been given. This confession was held to have been freely and voluntarily made and therefore 'admissible. In this connection it is important to observe the remarks of Lord Sumner relative to the question as asked:\nIn truth, except that Major Barrett's words were formally a question they appear to have been indistinguishable from an exclamation of dismay on the part of a humane officer, alike concerned for the position of the accused, the fate of the deceased, and the credit of the regiment and the service.\nIn Rex v. Voisin 60, no warning was given and yet the evidence was admissible. There the murdered party had not been identified. The police had a parcel containing a portion of the remains on which appeared the words \"Bladie Belgiam\". Several persons, including the accused, were held for questioning. At the request of the police the accused wrote the words \"Bladie Belgiam\" in handwriting that resembled and spelling identical with that on the parcel. Lawrence, J. at p. 94 stated:\nIn this case the appellant wrote these words quite voluntarily. The mere facts that they were police officers, or that the words were written at their request, or that he was being detained at Bow Street do not make the writing inadmissible in evidence \u2026 if the writing had turned out other than it did and other circumstances had not subsequently happened it is certain that he, like others who were similarly detained, would have been discharged.\nIn Prosko v. The King 61, the accused was held in custody by the United States immigration officials who explained to the accused that they were taking proceedings for his deportation to Canada. The accused then said, \"I am as good as dead if you send me over there.\" A constable asked why and the accused in the course of his explanation included the confession tendered and admitted at his trial. No warning was given and yet the statement was held to be freely and voluntarily made and admissible in evidence.\nThese cases are illustrative of the principle that the statement must in every case be voluntary. The mere fact that the confession was made by one in custody in response to a question by one in authority without a warning given does not make it inadmissible.\nThen there are the cases such as Rex v. Knight & Thayre 62, where a detective after warning the accused questioned him for nearly three hours. Throughout the first two hours the accused denied any knowledge of the fraud but during the last hour made the confession tendered as evidence. Channell, J. stated, at p. 714:\nThe questioning was continued for a very long period, the man's denials were not accepted, and the impression conveyed by Shinner to the prisoner's mind may well have been this: \"You will have to tell me that you did this thing, because I shall not let you go till you do so.\" This certainly cannot be said to be making a statement voluntarily. It may well be that an admission made immediately after a caution had been given by the person in authority would be admissible, but it does not follow that a suspended person can be cross-examined until the person putting the questions is satisfied.\nThese cases emphasize that whether the warning has or has not been given it must be determined under all the circumstances of each case if in fact the statement has been freely and voluntarily made.\nThere has developed a rule of practice that when the police or others1 in authority have either arrested the accused or made up their minds that he is the party whom they will prosecute then before being questioned he should be cautioned or warned in a manner that will explain his position much as a justice of the peace or magistrate does to an accused at the conclusion of the Crown's evidence at a preliminary inquiry under sec. 684(2). In Gach v. The King 63, it was the view of the majority of this Court that the warning under the circumstances of that case should have been given. The general language used has been construed to effect a change in the law. Rex v. Scory 64. The general language construed as effecting a change in the law was unnecessary to that decision. Moreover, that case does not purport to overrule Prosko v. The King, supra, nor any of the cases in which a statement has been received as voluntary although no warning had been given, nor does it purport to hold that a statement should be held to be voluntary where the warning has been given. In each case the confession must be affirmatively proven by the Crown to have been freely and voluntarily made before it can be received in evidence. The fact a warning has been given as well as its content is an important circumstance to be considered. The Queen v. Thompson 65.\nThe circumstances from the outset pointed to Boudreau and, as the police stated, caused them to be suspicious that he had committed the murder. He was taken into custody on Sunday but not questioned until Tuesday evening, when in reply to their questions he explained that at the time of the murder he was in the woods caring for his traps and did not hear of Laplante's death until he returned Saturday morning. He admitted ownership of a .12 gun and his relations with Mrs. Laplante. The following Thursday evening the appellant was again brought into Massue's office to see if he had decided to give them further information and because, as Oggier stated, he did not think his first statement was complete.\nThe events of Thursday evening in these circumstances cannot be segregated from those of Tuesday evening. The questions asked on Tuesday evening, his alibi, his admission to ownership of a .12 gun and his relations with Mrs. Laplante, the reasons why he was again questioned on Thursday evening, as well as the questions asked, and all the incidents of that evening are important factors. At the outset Thursday evening appellant was warned and immediately asked by Massue the question already stated, \"s'il avait des informations nouvelles \u00e0 nous donner,\" which directed the appellant's mind at once to what he had said Tuesday evening. Then what is of the greatest importance in this issue\u2014apart from this first question, the showing of the equipment used in the commission of the murder to the appellant, the reference to his parents, the fact that other questions relative to the gun and his relations with Mrs. Laplante were asked, and the nervous condition of the appellant\u2014is the evidence does not disclose what further questions were asked or what transpired in that office immediately prior to the appellant's confession. The events prior to and of that evening, including the actual words of the confession, \"J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a tu\u00e9,\" were important factors in the circumstances. The passage already quoted by Lord Sumner in the Ibrahim case is an indication of the importance of the nature and character of the actual questions asked. The three authorities, Ibrahim, Voisin and Prosko, supra, as well as Sankey v. The King 66, all emphasize the importance of considering the details leading up to a confession.\nI do not subscribe to the view pressed by counsel for the appellant that the warning necessarily should have included such words as would have informed the appellant that, notwithstanding that he had already made one statement, no matter what it contained he need not now make another or any statement. Had such words been included they, of course, would have been a factor. It is not, however, desirable that separate and distinct requirements should be specified designed to cover specific situations; rather the issue to be determined should remain in all cases, was the confession freely and voluntarily made. The existence of a previous statement and the circumstances under which it had been made may well be important in determining the issue in a particular case. It was important here because the same officers were present on each occasion. Immediately the warning was given the question asked directed the appellant's attention to his previous statement and appellant himself began by repeating the same history he had related on Tuesday evening. It was from this beginning on Thursday evening that events led up to the confession. A warning under such circumstances, when already he had given information in reply to questions and when immediately after the warning he is further questioned by the same parties in a manner that directed his mind to the information already given, is quite different in its effect from a warning given before any questions are asked.\nThe events of the two evenings upon all the facts of this case were intimately associated by the officers themselves as well as by the appellant and cannot be separated in considering the admissibility of the statements made on these respective occasions. The courts have under such circumstances always insisted that such confessions be received with care and caution. The statement of Chief Justice Anglin in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441, is appropriate:\nIt should always be borne in mind that while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from, the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Grown. The King v. Bellos 67; Prosko v. The King 68. That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.\nThe learned trial judge's misdirection relative to the first statement caused him to eliminate and not to consider what transpired prior to the warning on Thursday evening. That which took place after the warning should have been placed before the learned trial judge in greater detail. As Chief Justice Anglin stated in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441:\nWe think (that the police officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the occasions when he \"interviewed\" the prisoner \u2026\nThe learned trial judge in proceeding to find 'that the Crown had discharged the onus of proof and established that the statement was freely and voluntarily made without these further details, in particular the questions asked, the incidents surrounding the showing of the equipment used in the commission of the murder, as well as all the other incidents of that half hour, constituted a failure to direct himself as to that caution and care with which evidence in such cases should be scrutinized.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gendron and Gauthier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: No\u00ebl Dorion.\n1 93 C.C.C. 55.\n2 93 C.C.C. 55.\n3 93 C.C.C. 55.\n4 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n5 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n6 93 C.C.C. 55.\n7 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n8 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n9 83 C.C.C. 306.\n10 93 C.C.C. 55.\n11 [1914] A.C. 599.\n12 63 S.C.R. 226.\n13 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n14 83 C.C.C. 306.\n15 [1914] A.C. 599.\n16 (1918) 1 K.B. 631.\n17 63 S.C.R. 226.\n18 93 C.C.C. 55.\n19 [1943] S.C.R. 250.\n20 [1914] A.C. 599 at 609.\n21 (1893) 2 Q.B. 12.\n22 (1905) 20 Cox C.C. 711.\n23 (1910) 5 Cr.

(Judgment of the Court of Appeal (1948) 1 W.W.R. 929 maintained).\nPublic Works Commissioners v. Hills [1906] A.C. 368; Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. New Garage [1915] A.C. 79 and Mayson v. Clouet [1924] A.C. 980 referred to.\nPer Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.:\u2014The clause in the agreement providing that the logging was to be carried on \"except in periods when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss\" operated only when market conditions were such that logging operations on the Pacific Coast could not be carried on without loss. Per Taschereau and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The purchaser of the timber was not entitled to recover the moneys paid by it into the special trust account which were in the nature of a deposit and in the terms of the agreement intended as a guarantee of the complete logging of the said lands. The evidence disclosed that the lands had not been completely logged and that the purchaser had repudiated its obligations under the contract before the expiration of the time fixed for performance. (Wallis v. Smith (1882) 21 Ch. Div. 243; Howe v. Smith (1884) 27 Ch. Div. 89 and Sprague v. Booth 1909 A.C. 576 referred to).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1] allowing the appeal from the decision of Wilson J.\nW. S. Owen, K.C. and D. J. Lawson for the appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014Notwithstanding the form of the pleadings, there is no doubt as to the issues upon which the parties went to trial. I am willing to assume that the respondent company is in error in its construction of paragraph 6 (g) of the contract and to treat it as a party in default, asking for the return of its own money which comprises the special fund. On this basis, the appellant Waugh was entitled to claim damages from the company for its breach. For what, upon the record, are obvious reasons, he did not do this but claimed the money as liquidated damages. This claim is untenable as by the contract the money would be forfeited upon the slightest breach of any of its provisions and it is, therefore, a penalty: Public Works Commissioners v. Hills [2]; Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. New Garage [3].\nAt the trial and throughout the appeals, the appellant took the position that there was but one fund in question, and the case has been fought on that basis. The appellant has not sought to change his ground but, in view of the discussion in the reasons of my brothers Rand and Estey, I have examined the agreements of November 1, 1926, and May 4, 1940. Upon consideration I have concluded that they in nowise change the result as the moneys were never a genuine pre-estimate of damages but only a penalty. Such cases as Howe v. Smith[4] and Sprague v. Booth[5] are in my opinion inapplicable. Waugh had only a right to cut and remove timber from Crown lands, which right, under the contract, passed to the respondent company's predecessor and, by subsequent agreement, to the company itself. Even if in one aspect these cases would be at all relevant, the decision of the Privy Council in Mayson v. Clouet [6] points the distinction between a deposit and instalments of purchase price of land. Here, the money in the special fund, while not part of the purchase price of the timber, was certainly not a deposit. If the contention put forward on the basis of the cases first mentioned were sound, the Hills case [7] could not have been decided as it was.\nI agree with my brothers Rand and Estey as to the item $600.94. The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with a variation as to this item and the respondents are entitled to four-fifths of their costs in this Court.\nRAND J.:\u2014Mr. Robinette's chief ground was that the trust account of $14,000 made up of the moneys now in the bank and the balance deemed to be held by the appellant, less the twenty-two hundred odd dollars admittedly to be credited to the appellant, is a penalty and not liquidated damages within the principle of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. New Garage [8], and on that ground I think he succeeds. Viewing the purpose of the fund as of the date of the agreement, it clearly provides for the forfeiture of the amount accumulated to any time for any breach of the provisions of the contract thereafter. This would include failure (a) to pay taxes, (b) to sell any number of logs for the best price, (c) to keep all equipment on the land until the logging was completed, (d) to log continuously subject to the conditions mentioned, and (e) to cut and remove all of the timber from the lands. If a default continued for ten days after notice, the agreement could at once be terminated, the moneys forfeited and other action taken as provided; but the forfeiture would relate to the default and not to the consequence of termination. There is the accumulating amount on the one hand and both fluctuating and static damages on the other. The range of the latter would include an insignificant amount for taxes and a minimum of unlogged timber, say a quarter of a million feet. There is no item for which the ascertainment of damages would be difficult or uncertain; for uncompleted logging it would be only a matter of obtaining an offer of stumpage, with damages limited to the rate or amount originally stipulated. There could be such variation both in specific and estimative amounts as makes it impossible for me to find the fund a genuine pre-estimate of damages.\nThis result does not mean, however, that a party in default is allowed in effect to demand a restitution of partial performance; setting up the fund is a collateral arrangement by which the vendor secures himself against a failure in performance by the purchaser; and finding its loss to be a penalty is, ipso facto, to declare it to be a security from which damages will be recouped, with the vendor a mortgagee, and the mortgagor entitled to ask that, subject to the deduction of damages, his property be returned to him: Public Works Com. v. Hills [9].\nAgainst this it is said that the money was a \"deposit\" which cannot be recovered by a defaulting party. The nature of a deposit was discussed in Howe v. Smith [10] in which Fry, L.J. examined the matter historically. It is a term employed almost exclusively in the simple case of the sale of property. Whether in such a transaction a sum so called could ever be held to be a penalty it is unnecessary to decide because this is not merely a sale; the essential obligation is that the purchaser shall cut and remove the timber. But the mere employment of the term could not conclude the question. If that were so, the elaborate discussion in Wallis v. Smith[11] would appear to have been unnecessary. In the ordinary sale of property, the obligation of the purchaser is the single act of paying the price, and the deposit serves the additional purpose of part payment; it could be only in an unusual case where there would be an equitable ground for its return. In Wallis, supra, the purchaser was indeed to carry on a large scale land development scheme, but the deposit, so described, was to apply on the purchase price and was to be forfeited only on a substantial breach, the damages for which would be difficult of assessment; it was not a case where penalty could be found. Those circumstances sufficiently distinguish it from the contract here. In the Hills case, supra, there was no suggestion that the fund could be treated as a deposit: and in both that and the agreement here the term employed is \"guarantee\".\nI have so far assumed that the $14,000 maintained its identity as a fund subject to the provisions of the contract and particularly clauses 4 and 7 (b), which stipulated for forfeiture. But there were two amendments, one dated November 12, 1936 and the other May 4, 1940. Under the former, the money amounting to about $6,000 then in the special trust account was paid out to the vendor and thereafter the 40c deduction was to be paid to him up to the total amount of the fund. When 15,000,000 feet remained to be logged, from the basic stumpage of $2.50 the trustee was to deduct the sum of $1.00 and pay it into a new special trust account until the fund was fully reconstituted, and thereupon the new account was to be subject to the original provisions. By the latter amendment, modifying the former, made when the new account had reached approximately $7,000, the $1.00 deduction was to be paid to the purchasers until they had received sufficient to make up with what was in the bank the total of $14,000.\nI would have construed these amending agreements as having made inapplicable to the money while in the hands of the vendor and until the fund had been so reconstituted, the forfeiture provisions of the contract; but the consideration of this feature seems to be precluded by the footing on which the case was tried and carried to appeal. The case shows the trial judge as stating to Mr. Clyne, representing the vendor:\u2014\nThere is no argument as to how it was created. It is just as if the original $14,000 was there in the bank and I have to dispose of it. It isn't all in the bank, but the possession isn't essential because the defendant is obligated. If Mr. Clyne I would find against your client throughout, for instance, he would be compelled to bring that fund up to $14,000. Suppose I found against him throughout in addition to the $7,000 in the bank he paid out to Mr. Jackson's clients, would your client be compelled to bring up the fund to $14,000. Mr. Clyne: Yes, but not more. This understanding was accepted before us on the argument. The effect of the amendments is not, therefore, to be taken into account.\nThere remains the item of $600.94 arising from the sale of logs at the booming ground rather than at a mill point. Under the contract, the purchasers were to obtain the \"best possible price\". From that price which was to be dealt with by the respondents Tait and Marchant, there was first to be deducted the sum of $10.50 out of which were to be paid:\n(a) Royalty and scaling fees to British Columbia;\n(b) Two dollars and fifty cents for certain logs and $3.00 for other logs, to the vendor as a portion of the sale price;\n(c) The sum of 60c for booming charges to a named company;\n(d) The sum of 40c per 1,000 feet for the trust fund mentioned; and\n(e) The balance to the purchasers \"in respect of their work of logging, booming and towing of the said logs.\"\nThe difference between the price and $10.50 was to be shared equally by the vendor and the purchasers. Nothing is expressly said as to any place of sale, but for the first five years the rafts were towed by the purchasers to a mill at Victoria, and it was the price obtained upon the delivery of the logs there that was handed over to Tait and Marchant.\nAs the vendor was obviously interested in the excess of the sale price over $10.50 and as the latter sum was to include expenses of the purchasers in towing the logs\u2014which could only mean from the booming ground to delivery at a mill\u2014the price contemplated would be the best offered at a milling point. The language is wide enough to include the entire area of milling markets for Vancouver Island logs. But it is not necessary to attempt to define the range of delivery points to which the \"best possible price\" might be applicable. The judgment at trial allows damages to the vendor only on logs sold to Victoria mills but delivered at the booming ground and towed by the purchaser. In effect the towage charges were thus transferred from the loggers to the excess of the selling price over $10.50. The range of price places was by the conduct of the parties for five years declared to include at least Victoria; and as that is the only destination with which we are concerned, the objection to the indefiniteness is removed. On this point, therefore, I agree with the trial judgment. But the respondent, Pioneer Company alone is bound by the provision. Neither Tait nor Marchant as individuals had anything to do with selling the logs; their duty was limited to distributing what was actually received in the manner provided. Nothing done by them as shareholders in the Pioneer Company can, in the circumstances, draw upon them personal liability.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed as to the item for towage damages at $600.94 (the amount agreed upon) against the Pioneer Company and deducted from the moneys payable to that company. Beyond that, the appeal must be dismissed. The respondents appearing throughout by the same counsel should be allowed four-fifths of their costs in this court.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The respondent asks a declaration that having completed on its part the terms and conditions of a logging contract, it is now entitled to the proceeds of a trust fund created under the contract as a guarantee for its due performance. At the trial respondent's claim to the proceeds of this trust fund was dismissed and the amount thereof awarded as liquidated damages to the appellant under his counter-claim. The Appellate Court[12] varied this judgment holding the fund to be a penalty and as no damages were awarded directed the amount thereof, less certain deductions, to be paid to respondent.\nAs a matter of convenience, the Pioneer Logging Company Limited will be hereinafter referred to as \"respondent\" and Messrs. Tait & Marchant, the other respondent, as \"trustees.\"\nThe contract made between the appellant Waugh, as vendor, and Joseph and Louis Pedneault, as purchasers, is dated April 24, 1934. Under date of December 18, 1935, the Pedneaults assigned their entire interest to the respondent Pioneer Logging Company. This assignment was approved of by the appellant and no question arises with regard thereto. The original contract comprised three parcels: Lot 78 and Timber Licences 3733 and 3734 in the Renfrew District on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The logging was completed on Lot 78 and the issues in this appeal are concerned only with the Timber Licences 3733 and 3734.\nThe contract provided:\nThe Vendor gives and grants unto the purchasers the sole right, \u2026until the 31st day of December, 1940, \u2026 to out, remove, and carry away therefrom all of the timber\u2026\nThis date of December 31, 1940, was by a supplementary agreement extended to December 31, 1941.\nIt also provided that the proceeds from the sale of the logs as received would be paid to Messrs. Tait & Marchant to be disbursed as in the agreement provided, including para. 2(A) (4) which directed payments \"into a special trust account\u2026 the sum of forty (40c) cents per thousand feet to guarantee the due and proper logging by the purchasers of the said lands\u2026\" It is not questioned but that this 40c was paid into the trust fund from the respondent's share of the sale price and the ultimate disposition thereof is provided for in para. 4:\n\u2026when the said lands shall have been completely logged and the sale price above provided paid to the Vendor, then the purchasers shall be entitled to all of the moneys in the said special trust account; but should the purchasers fail to complete the logging of the said lands in accordance with this agreement, and (or) the Vendor shall lawfully cancel this agreement by reason of the Purchasers' default in carrying out and performing the covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be observed and performed, then and in such case all moneys in the said special trust account shall be forfeited to and shall belong absolutely to the vendor as liquidated damages for the non-performance or breach of this agreement.\nThe learned trial judge found that on December 31, 1941, the respondent was in default under the contract in that it had not logged \"some 8 million feet of merchantable timber.\" The respondent does not contest the fact that it had not logged the 8 million feet but submits that its failure to do so did not constitute a default on its part because it could not have logged this timber except at a loss and by virtue of the provisions of para. 6 (g) it was in that circumstance excused from logging. Para. 6 (g) reads as follows:\n6. (g) To carry on the logging of the said lands continuously with all of the logging equipment of the purchasers until the whole of the said lands shall be logged, save and except in weather which makes logging, booming or towing unsafe, or in times of extreme fire hazard, or in periods when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss.\nIt was suggested that this paragraph had no relation to any question of ultimate default such as here in question. Even on the assumption, however, that it does apply its provisions do not under the circumstances excuse the respondent. In order for the respondent to succeed under this paragraph it must be so construed that the words \"when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss\" is a provision personal to its own conduct under this contract. In this connection it is important to observe that in para. 1 the respondent was granted the right to log, and in para. 5 it covenanted to \"cut and remove all of the timber.\" In para. 6 (f) to conduct its \"logging operations in a proper and workmanlike manner according to the most approved method of logging used by competent loggers of Vancouver Island \u2026\" Then in para. 6 (g) to log continuously except in three events, weather, fire and market. In this context the parties in 6 (g) were contracting with regard to contingencies beyond their control. When, therefore, they stipulated that \"when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss,\" they were providing against operating under adverse market conditions, which, as the learned trial judge has found, did not exist in the period with which we are here concerned. The evidence amply supports his finding in this regard. In fact Bestwick, a witness on behalf of the respondent, who operated the premises under a contract with the respondent, said there were 6 or 7 million feet that could be cut and removed at a profit.\nOn March 26, 1941, the respondent by letter notified appellant that because logging upon the premises could no longer be carried on except at a loss it would be \"impossible to open up the camp and proceed with the logging this year.\" Thereafter throughout 1941 correspondence and conversations followed relative to the possibility of commencing logging operations and other matters under the contract but no agreement was arrived at. Even after December 31st the parties continued the negotiations until early in March the respondent concluded that the appellant intended to keep the trust fund. Respondent then took the position that there was no timber upon the premises that could be logged at a profit and therefore it had completed its obligations under the contract and demanded payment of the proceeds in the trust fund. When as a consequence of this formal demand the proceeds were not made available respondent on April 2, 1942, commenced these proceedings. The appellant by its defence and counter-claim treated the contract as at an end and claimed, under para. 4 supra, the special trust account by virtue of the respondent's default. Neither party asked for specific performance.\nThe appellant cites Sprague v. Booth [13] in support of his contention that because of respondent's default he is entitled to claim the trust fund by virtue of the forfeiture clause in the agreement. In the Sprague case [14] the purchaser had made default and the Privy Council held that the deposit was the property of the vendor under the terms of the contract and in the course of the judgment Lord Dunedin stated:\nThe nature and incidents of such a deposit are accurately discussed in the case of Howe v. Smith [15].\nIn Howe v. Smith [16], the court emphasized that in the event of the default the disposition of the deposit depends upon the terms of the contract and both Lord Justices Cotton and Fry quoted the statement of Baron Pollock in Collins v. Stimson [17]:\nAccording to the law of vendor and purchaser the inference is that such a deposit is paid as a guarantee for the performance of the contract, and where the contract goes off by default of the purchaser, the vendor is entitled to retain the deposit.\nThe word \"deposit,\" as explained by Lord Justice Fry in Howe v. Smith, supra, \"is not merely a part payment, but \u2026 also an earnest to bind the bargain so entered into.\" Its use as such has developed from that period when parties concluded their contract by giving a sum of money, a ring or other object. It has now become a very common and well understood word between vendors and purchasers, and in their contracts the amount thereof is usually in relation to the total purchase price a relatively small sum. The courts in construing a document in which the parties have used the word \"deposit\" have accepted it as an expression of their intention to the extent that in the language of Baron Pollock, supra, \"the inference is \u2026where the contract goes off by default of the purchaser, the vendor is entitled to retain the deposit.\" That it is only an inference is indicated by the remarks of the Privy Council in Brickles v. Snell [18] and Boericke v. Sinclair [19]. In Mayson v. Clouet [20], the distinction between a deposit and other instalments is emphasized.\nThe parties to this action have neither used the word \"deposit\" nor treated the fund as such. It was not as a deposit paid to and received by the appellant as his own money to be retained by him in any event, either as part of the purchase price or as an amount forfeited in the event of default. The parties have described it as a \"special trust account\" in the name of two trustees and defined its purpose \"to guarantee the due and proper logging by the purchaser\" (para. 2(A) (4)), and again, it \"is intended as a guarantee of the complete logging of the said lands\u2026\" If the matter had ended there the issue would have turned largely upon the meaning of the word \"guarantee.\" A guarantee is ordinarily a collateral or secondary contract under which the guarantor becomes answerable for the debt or default of another's primary debt or obligation. The word \"guarantee' in this case is not used in precisely that sense, but having regard to its ordinary meaning it would appear rather that the parties intended the respondent would gradually out of its income from its operations under this contract build up a fund as a guarantee or as security for its completion of the contract. So construed the trust fund would be liable only for such damages as were suffered by the appellant.\nThe agreement, however, goes on and provides that \"when the said lands shall have been completely logged and the sale price above provided paid to the vendor\" then the purchaser shall receive all of the moneys in the said special trust account \"but should the purchasers fail to complete the logging of the said lands in accordance with this agreement, and (or) the vendor shall lawfully cancel this agreement\u2026 then and in such case all moneys in the said special trust account shall be forfeited to and shall belong absolutely to the vendor as liquidated dam- ages for the non-performance or breach of this agreement.\"\nThe main issue, therefore, in this appeal, and that particularly stressed by counsel at the hearing, is whether the special trust account constituted a genuine pre-estimate of damages or a penalty. It is the terms of the contract that determine this issue. This trust fund increased as the work progressed and therefore the further the purchaser proceeded in the performance of its obligations under the contract the larger the amount. It must be obvious that at the commencement of the work and for some time thereafter the amount in the special trust account would be entirely inadequate if any substantial damages were suffered; while on the other hand, if the default occurred near the completion of the contract the amount might well be much larger than any damages that might be incurred.\nMoreover, while the appellant never did cancel the agreement, he had the right to do so in the event of a number of possible defaults, and whether the parties genuinely pre-estimated damages or fixed a penalty depends upon the agreement as drawn and not upon subsequent events. In para. 5 the purchasers covenanted to \"cut and remove all of the timber\u2026in the manner and at the times above described.\" Then para. 6 contains a list of fourteen matters with regard to which the purchasers covenanted. These include: Covenant to obtain a registered timber mark for all logs; to have all logs scaled at the expense of the purchasers in the manner specified; to sell each and every raft or boom of logs at the best possible price; not to mix any of the logs; to take all fire precautions; not to remove its logging equipment. These are sufficient to illustrate the general character of the paragraph. Then in para. 7 (b) it is provided that \"if the purchasers shall at any time make default in observing or performing any of the covenants\u2026the vendor shall be at liberty to give to the purchasers notice in writing of intention to determine this agreement\u2026 whereupon the purchasers shall be deemed to have abandoned this agreement and the vendor shall retain all sums of money . . . and all logs, timber\u2026\"\nIt will therefore be observed that in these paras. 5, 6 and 7 appellant as vendor had a right to cancel this agreement for default in any one of a number of covenants, the damages in respect of each of which would vary and might in some cases be relatively small. It is in every case the language of the contract as a whole that must determine the intent and purpose of the parties and while the particular words used are important, the mere use of the words \"liquidated damages\" or \"penalty\" is not conclusive. In this case the language used is not particularly helpful as both the words \"forfeited\" and \"liquidated damages\" appear in the text. Lord Dunedin, in referring to similar language in Commissioner of Public Works v. Hills [21], stated:\nIndeed, the form of expression here, \"forfeited as and for liquidated damages,\" if literally taken, may be said to be self-contradictory, the word \"forfeited\" being peculiarly appropriate to penalty, and not to liquidated damages.\nIf for the moment the fund here in question be accepted as sufficiently definite, under the forfeiture clause it would become the property of the appellant upon the breach of any of a number of covenants in which consequent damages would in regard to some be relatively small and others substantial. The case therefore comes within the oft-quoted language of Lord Justice Mellish in In re Dagenham (Thames) Dock Co. [22]:\nI have always understood that where there is a stipulation that if, on a certain day, an agreement remains either wholly or in any part unperformed\u2014in which case the real damage may be either very large or very trifling\u2014there is to be a certain forfeiture incurred, that stipulation is to be treated as in the nature of a penalty.\nThis same principle is embodied in the test suggested by Lord Dunedin in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [23]:\nThere is a presumption (but no more) that it is penalty when \"a single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which may occasion serious and others but trifling damage\" (Lord Watson in Lord Elphinstone v. Monkland Iron & Coal Co. [24]).\nThere are no circumstances in this case to rebut the foregoing presumption.\nMoreover, until the sum of $14,000 was paid into the fund, which would be near the completion of the respondent's obligations, it was not a definite amount or one that could be determined with accuracy prior thereto. This and other features make this case somewhat similar to Commissioner of Public Works v. Hills, supra. In that case the plaintiff undertook to build three railways and lodged as security the sum of \u00a350,000 with a third party and in addition thereto certain percentages of the contract price were withheld as further security. The plaintiff, as contractor, in that case had made default and sued for the work done and the return of the \u00a350,000 and the percentages retained. In the reasons for judgment the Privy Council commented upon the indefiniteness of the total amount, held that these funds were penalties and directed the return to the plaintiff of the sum of \u00a350,000 and the percentages, less any damages the defendant proved.\nThe parties have presented their respective contentions upon the basis that at all times there was but one fund and the provisions of the original agreement with respect thereto obtained throughout. However, an examination of the agreements made subsequent to April 24, 1934, and filed as exhibits, so far as they relate to this fund do not support the view that in fixing the sum of $14,000 the parties were pre-estimating damages. Whether under these agreements the fund, as it passed to the appellant, by him in part repaid and finally a portion ($2,230.35) paid to the respondent to assist it in financing, remained subject to the forfeiture clause or was but a fund to guarantee any damages that might be suffered need not be determined as the result of this litigation is the same whichever of these alternatives might be adopted.\nIt would therefore appear that this special trust account must be construed as a penalty and consequent relief against forfeiture granted. As no amount of damages have been proved it should be regarded as belonging to the respondent.\nThe claim against the trustees Tait & Marchant is based upon the fact that they did not notify the appellant of a change effected by the respondent in the sale of the logs at the boom rather than at the mill, which, under the particular provisions of this contract effected a loss of 30 cents per thousand feet to the appellant and a gain of the same amount to the respondent. This new contract for the sale of the logs was negotiated in September or October 1939 by Garrison as manager of the respondent with the Songhees Timber Co. Ltd. The contract of April 24, 1934, between the parties hereto contained no specific directions as to whether the logs should be sold at the mill or the boom but because of the practice followed to date it did raise a question between the appellant and respondent but which did not involve the trustees.\nThis claim against the trustees is not based upon the breach of any express duty imposed upon them by the contract but rather that this duty to inform appellant was imposed upon them because at the time Garrison negotiated this contract for the sale of the logs they were substantial creditors of the respondent and benefited by this 30 cents per thousand feet. That they had some time before guaranteed the bank account (which they had not been called upon to implement), had in fact a relatively small block of capital stock and Tait himself was secretary of the respondent, was not denied. Apart from a reference to the payment of towage by the purchasers the contract of April 24, 1934, makes no mention thereof. This absence of any provision as to the place from and the distance of towage was mentioned between the trustees and the appellant as early as 1934 when the trustees stated it would demand consideration sooner or later. Now when the matter came up the trustees took the same position, as they had taken earlier with respect to towing charges and other matters arising out of the contract upon which there was some disagreement, that it was a question to be settled between the parties to that contract. It was no part of the trustees' duty to interpret or settle questions arising under the contract. They had acted in a professional capacity for both parties but had advised them long before this that in matters arising under this contract of April 24, 1934, they could not act for either party. This is not denied; in fact the appellant had employed other solicitors to act for him in such matters. Appellant deposes as to only one interview with Tait with regard to this matter and said he expected Mr. Tait to do something. He did not indicate why or upon what basis and nothing more was done as regard to these towing charges until this action was brought. The trustees' duties with respect to the reception and disposition of the sale proceeds were not affected by the new contract. Neither did its existence involve any conflict of interest between their duties as trustees and their personal interests. That such was the position and that the trustees were carrying on to the satisfaction of the appellant is evidenced by the fact that when appraised of all the facts, the appellant on May 4, 1940, when the trustees had acquired a majority of the stock, had increased their guarantees and were in active management of the respondent, executed a supplementary agreement which dealt with the towing charges from there on but left the trustees in the same position and with the same duties with respect to the sale price. That trustees cannot take advantage of their position as trustees to attain a personal benefit is well established, but here the new contract was not negotiated by the trustees, and while it involved a possible question between the contracting parties, it did not affect the trustees' position and any benefit that accrued was indirect and remote and not because of any conduct in relation to the new contract on the part of the trustees. Under these circumstances it cannot be regarded as a case in which the facts justify the imposition of liability on the trustees for the amount claimed.\nThe appellant also claims this amount of 30 cents per thousand feet from the respondent. The contract, as already intimated, does not specifically provide whether the logs should be sold at the mill or at the boom. There is a covenant, however, requiring the respondent to sell at the \"best possible price\" and also a provision that the purchasers would receive a portion of the purchase price \"in respect of their work of logging, booming and towing of the said logs.\" The agreement of June 20, 1935, between Waugh, Pedneault Bros. and Wilfret set up a mill for the sawing of the fir logs from the premises here in question and provided \"upon delivery of each boom of logs to the mill\u2026\" This provision plainly indicates that the logs were to be delivered at the mill. By an agreement dated December 18, 1935, the Pedneaults assigned to and the respondent did \"agree to assume and carry out and perform all of the covenants\" of the said agreement of the 20th June, 1935. This agreement of June 20, 1935, was replaced by an agreement dated October 1, 1936, between the respondent, the Esquimalt Lumber Co. Ltd. and appellant and its provisions contemplated that the logs should be sold at the mill. Moreover, this contract was entered into in 1934 and up until 1939 the logs had been sold at the mill and the towing charges paid by the respondent. Under these circumstances, and particularly because of the foregoing provision relative to towing charges, I think it but reasonable that the parties contemplated that the ordinary towing charges as distinguished from those that might arise in respect of logs at distant points, would be paid by the purchasers, and that a term to that effect should be implied. The respondent therefore in breach of this implied covenant sold the logs at the boom, and having regard to the directions for the disposition of the selling price by the trustees, it did better its position to the extent of 30 cents per thousand feet and deprived the vendor of a like amount. This 30 cents per thousand feet totalled $600.94 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal [25] should be varied by allowing this amount of $600.94 as a deduction, along with the items of $972.20 and $2,230.35 as therein specified.\nThe appellant has not succeeded in his main contentions upon this appeal. The respondent and trustees have filed but one factum and appeared by the same counsel. Under these circumstances, the respondent and trustees should have four-fifths of their costs in this court.\nThe dissenting judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The principal question to be determined in this appeal depends upon the construction to be placed upon the terms of an agreement in writing made between the appellant and Joseph Pedneault and Louis Pedneault carrying on business in partnership under the firm name of Sooke Harbour Logging Company, dated April 24, 1934, the benefit of which was, with the appellant's consent, assigned to the respondent company. By its terms the appellant granted to the purchasers the right until December 31, 1940, to enter into and upon and to cut, remove and carry away therefrom, inter alia, all of the timber suitable for the manufacture of lumber on Lot 78 in the Renfrew District of British Columbia and two adjoining timber licences numbered 3733 and 3734. The right thus granted was stated to continue \"so long as the purchasers are not in default in the observance of any of the covenants or agreements herein contained on their part to be observed or performed until the 31st day of December, 1940.\" Lot 78 was, by agreement, thereafter eliminated from the contract. As to the two timber licences the price to be paid by the purchasers was a stumpage of $2.50 per thousand feet board measure for all timber taken from them and 50 per cent of the surplus realized from the sale of logs over and above a deduction of $10.50 per thousand feet. To ensure the proper distribution of the moneys realized from the sale of logs, it was provided that as booms were sold the purchasers would be directed to pay the purchase price to the respondents Tait and Marchant, a firm of solicitors practising in Victoria who were directed to dispose of them by deducting from the sale price a sum equal to $10.50 per thousand, and to pay thereout the royalty and scaling fees, the stumpage payable to the vendor, booming charges and:\u2014\nTo pay into a special trust account, in the name of J. S. Waugh and Sooke Harbour Logging Company, the sum of forty cents per thousand feet to guarantee the due and proper logging by the purchasers of the said lands as hereinafter mentioned.\nany balance of the $10.50 remaining was to be paid to the purchasers and any remaining surplus of the purchase money was to be paid into a trust account to be divided equally between the vendor and the purchasers.\nThe principal issue is as to ownership of the moneys accumulated by the payment of forty cents per thousand feet above referred to, and the exact terms of the further provisions of the agreement dealing with these moneys are of importance. Paragraph 4 of the agreement read:\u2014\n4. The sum of forty cents per thousand feet to be paid into a special trust account as provided in sub-paragraph (A) (4) of paragraph 2 hereof shall be deducted and paid only from the proceeds of the logging of the first thirty-five million feet of the timber on the said lands, and is intended as a guarantee of the complete logging of the said lands; and if and when the said lands shall have been completely logged and the sale price above provided paid to the vendor, then the purchasers shall be entitled to all of the moneys in the said special trust account; but should the purchasers fail to complete the logging of the said lands in accordance with this agreement, and (or) the vendor shall lawfully cancel this agreement by reason of the purchasers' default in carrying out and performing the covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be observed and performed, then and in such case all moneys in the said special trust account shall be forfeited to and shall belong absolutely to the vendor as liquidated damages for the non-performance or breach of this agreement.\nBy paragraph 5 the purchasers agreed that they would cut and remove all of the timber from the lands and would pay to the vendor the stumpage price provided for in the manner and at the times described, and by sub-paragraph 6 (g):\nTo carry on the logging of the said lands continuously with all of the logging equipment of the purchasers until the whole of the said lands shall be logged, save and except in weather which makes logging, booming or towing unsafe, or in times of extreme fire hazard, or in periods when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss.\nA further term provided that if the purchaser should make default in performance of any of the covenants, terms, provisions or conditions of the agreement, the vendor should be at liberty to give the purchasers notice in writing of an intention to determine the agreement at the expiration of ten days from the giving of such notice, and that if such default should not be remedied within that time the purchasers' rights under the agreement should at the option of the vendor cease and determine.\nIt is, I think, unnecessary to examine into the manner in which the fund of $14,000 was eventually constituted, and sufficient to say that at the time of the commencement of the action, either in the hands of the appellant or in a special trust account in the Royal Bank of Canada at Victoria, this amount had been accumulated out of payments made for the purposes defined by the agreement.\nJoseph and Louis Pedneault entered on the property and commenced logging operations in the year 1934. In December 1935 they assigned their interest in the agreement with the appellant to the respondent company, by which operations were carried on during the years 1935 and 1936. The market price of logs was very low at the time the agreement was made but by 1936, when the Pedneaults sold their share interest in the company to one Garrison, the market had substantially improved and, according to Joseph Pedneault, they made money from 1934 to 1936. Thereafter, according to the account of the respondent company, the operations were unsuccessful: in 1937 there was a small loss and substantial losses were made in the years 1938, 1939 and 1940, so that in the latter year the company had become hopelessly insolvent. The respondents Tait and Marchant of whom Garrison had sought help advanced money to the company and, according to the respondent Tait, the losses were extremely heavy. Garrison abandoned the undertaking in the spring of 1940 and left the country transferring all of his shares in the company, which were sufficient to control it, to Tait and Marchant. On May 4, 1940, a further agreement was negotiated between the defendant company and the appellant whereby, inter alia, the time for logging the entire tract was extended to December 31, 1941, and the company agreed to log at least five million feet in the season of 1940. The company made an arrangement with one Bestwick to take out logs under which a considerable quantity were logged and sold during the year 1940, Bestwick being paid a flat price of $7.00 a thousand for logs delivered to Victoria but in October of that year he refused to operate further without an increase in the amount to be paid him and the operation was closed down. According to Bestwick, when he ceased operations in 1940, there were six or seven million feet left standing upon the limits which it would have been profitable to log at that time. In the spring of 1941 all the equipment of the respondent company had been removed from the limits and sold to Bestwick. While the time for removal of all the timber had been extended to December 31, 1941, nothing more was done by the purchasers after Bestwick ceased his operations. Upon conflicting evidence the learned trial judge accepted that given by Eustace Smith, a very experienced timber cruiser, who said that when he cruised the property for the appellant in 1942 he found 8,254,000 feet of economically accessible timber remaining upon the licences.\nBy its Statement of Claim the respondent company asserted that it had cut and logged all the timber which could be logged without loss, that the limits had been completely logged and that it had complied with all the requirements of the agreement entitling it to receive payment of what it, not inaccurately, designated as the Guarantee Trust Fund. The plaintiff's obligation under paragraph 1 of the agreement was to \"cut, remove and carry away therefrom all of the timber suitable for the manufacture of lumber\" and not merely that which could be logged without loss. The plaintiff invoked the provisions of subparagraph 6 (g), however, which as noted relieved it of the obligation of carrying on the logging of the said lands continuously under certain circumstances. While admittedly there was a substantial stand of timber suitable for the manufacture of lumber remaining upon Timber Licence 3734 when Bestwick ceased to operate in October 1940, the attitude taken by the plaintiff was that since this could not be logged in 1941 without incurring losses its obligations under the agreement had been discharged.\nThe case of the respondent company is that the words \"when the price and market for logs is such that logs cannot be sold without loss\" should be interpreted as referring to the logs cut from these properties, while the appellant contends that its proper meaning is that continuous logging is excused only when market prices are such that logging operations generally cannot be carried on on the Pacific Coast without loss. I think the appellant's contention is correct. The agreement as a whole was intended to ensure that all merchantable timber upon these limits would be cut and removed and the Pedneaults, after examining the property and therefore well knowing that there was on the upper levels of Timber Licence 3734 several million feet of rather small merchantable timber which they would be required to remove, undertook that obligation and the respondent company later assumed it. The guarantee trust fund was in the words of the agreement \"intended as a guarantee of the complete logging of the said lands.\" If the respondent company's contention were correct, its obligation to completely log the limits could be avoided by showing that to log the remaining eight million feet would result in a loss to it, irrespective of the state of the log market. This was a risk which the purchasers assumed when they entered into the contract and I think they are not relieved from their obligation by the proviso. No attempt was made to establish that logging operations generally on the Pacific Coast could not be carried on without loss in the year 1941. The respondent company endeavoured at the trial to avail itself of the proviso by showing that its own operations in the years 1937 to 1940 inclusive had resulted in a loss and, in a letter written by it to the appellant of March 26, 1941, the opinion was expressed that there would be a loss of not less than $3.00 per thousand in completing the logging of the limit. The learned trial judge being of the opinion that the proviso should be interpreted in the manner contended for by the appellant did not make any finding as to whether the respondent company could have cut and removed the remaining timber without loss. He did, however, find that the contention that an increase in logging costs during the period had resulted in a loss to the respondent company had not been proved. In the reasons for judgment of Sidney Smith, J.A. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal [26], it is said:\nThe purchasers found they could not continue logging these lands without loss, and paragraph 6 (g) then began to operate in their favour.\nWith great respect, I think this finding is not supported by the evidence. Bestwick, a practical logger, expressed the opinion that the timber remaining when he discontinued operations in October 1940 could be profitably logged and Eustace Smith considered that in each of the years 1936 to 1941 inclusive operations could have been carried on without loss. As opposed to this, the respondent Tait gave evidence that certain capital expenditures were required and that, in his opinion, the operations would result in a loss. No practical logging operator was called by the respondent company to establish this fact, while on cross-examination Bestwick expressed the opinion above referred to. If it were the fact that the remaining timber could not be taken out by the plaintiff company without incurring loss, the onus of establishing this rested upon it and, in my opinion, that burden was not discharged: on the contrary, in the absence of a finding by the trial judge, I think the evidence of Bestwick and Eustace Smith should be accepted. I am, therefore, of the opinion that even if the respondent company's contention as to the interpretation of clause 6 (g) were correct, the claim is not supported by the evidence.\nIf the Statement of Defence had merely put in issue the allegations made in the Statement of Claim, this would be decisive of the question as to the Guarantee Trust Fund. The defendant, however, while traversing these allegations alleged affirmatively various defaults by the respondent company in carrying out the terms of the agreement including, inter alia, its failure to cut and remove all the merchantable timber from the said lands, and that accordingly the moneys deposited in the special trust account had become forfeited \"and now absolutely belong to the defendant as liquidated damages for the non-performance and breach of the original agreement\" and by counterclaim asked a declaration that the moneys were so forfeited as liquidated damages. The respondent company replied and joined issue and by this pleading set up for the first time that the provision in the agreement providing for the forfeiture of the moneys was in the nature of a penalty and asked relief from the penalty. This plea was incorporated by reference in the reply to the counterclaim and in this manner the question was properly put in issue.\nIn considering this aspect of the matter, it is to be borne in mind that a cruise made of the two limits in 1944 by Eustace Smith had shown a little over forty-one million feet of merchantable timber upon the two limits and that by the agreement the fund to be accumulated by the payments of 40 cents per thousand feet were to be paid only from the proceeds of the logging of the first thirty-five million feet of the timber. This would provide a fund of $14,000 and, assuming the accuracy of the cruise, the stumpage payable upon the remainder of the timber computed at $2.50 a thousand would amount to $15,000. By paragraph 4 which stated that the fund was intended as a guarantee of the complete logging of the lands, it was provided that if and when the lands had been completely logged and the sale price (meaning the stumpage) paid, the purchasers would be entitled to receive the money. It was upon the basis that it had complied with this part of the clause that the action was launched. In my opinion, the pleader properly appreciated the position of the plaintiff in framing the Statement of Claim. The contention that the clause provides for a penalty is based upon the theory that the amount of the guarantee trust fund which, it is said, might be forfeited for a number of trifling defaults is so large that the court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction should grant relief. It may be noted in passing that in the result the trust fund was inadequate to provide against the situation which arose when the respondent company announced its intention of leaving the remaining 8,254,000 feet upon the limit uncut. The stumpage upon this quantity of timber would have been something in excess of $20,000 while the fund then accumulated was some $6,000 less. It is, however, said that the fund would equally be liable to forfeiture if the respondent company had cut all but an insignificant amount of the timber, and as paragraph 4 which provided for the forfeiture for failure to complete the logging of the lands further provided for forfeiture if \"the vendor shall lawfully cancel this agreement by reason of the purchasers' default in carrying out and performing the covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be observed and performed\", this would mean that if default were made in paying the stumpage of $2.50 on one thousand feet board measure of logs the fund would be forfeited. It is of importance to remember that this is not a case in which the plaintiff asks specific performance or asserts his willingness to complete his part of the agreement and asks relief from an alleged forfeiture. On the contrary, this plaintiff commenced the action by asserting that it had fulfilled all the terms of the contract and that it was entitled under the terms of the agreement to recover the moneys. The correspondence produced makes the attitude of the respondent company perfectly clear. By a letter dated March 26, 1941, addressed by the respondent company to the appellant, the latter was informed that an investigation as to the possibility of logging the remaining timber had been made and that it was found that there would be heavy losses and concluded:\u2014\nWe accordingly have no course but to advise you that it is impossible to open up the camp and proceed with the logging this year.\nAccording to Mr. Tait, there was at this time ample time to complete the logging before December 31, 1941. Further evidence of the intention of the respondent company not to proceed is shown by the fact that in the spring of 1941 it removed all of the logging equipment from the property and sold it to Bestwick. It appears that following this there were some negotiations between the parties for the purchase of the remaining timber but nothing came of this and on March 6, 1942, shortly prior to the commencement of the action, the solicitors for the respondent company wrote the appellant saying that under the contracts their client was only required to log timber which could be logged at a profit, that there was no longer any timber of that sort on the lands, so that the company was entitled to the guarantee funds and demanded payment of $14,000.\nIn my opinion, the letter of March 26, 1941, amounted to a repudiation of its obligations under the contract by the respondent company. The test as to what amounts to such repudiation is stated by Lord Coleridge, C.J. in Freeth v. Burr [27]:\nThe true question is whether the acts and conduct of the party evince an intention no longer to be bound by the contract.\nlanguage which was expressly approved in the House of Lords in Mersey Steel Company v. Naylor [28] and General Billposting Company v. Atkinson [29].\nThere is no distinction to be made between the position arising from the fact that the plaintiff misconceived its liability under the contract and that which would result from a wilful refusal to discharge its obligations under it. The argument for the plaintiff must, therefore, be that while failing to fulfil its covenant to cut and remove all of the timber and, in breach of another of its covenants, having removed its logging equipment without the consent of the appellant while there remained several million feet of merchantable timber standing and having, some eight months in advance of the expiration of the period, wrongfully repudiated its obligation to cut and remove the remaining timber, it is entitled as against the appellant to recover the accumulated fund of $14,000 which, in the words of the agreement, was payable to it \"if and when the said lands shall have been completely logged and the sale price above provided paid to the vendor\", leaving the appellant to his remedy in damages. While we have had the advantage of hearing a most careful and thorough argument on behalf of the respondent on the question as to the right of the respondent company to these moneys on the footing that to permit the appellant to recover them would be to enforce a penalty, we were not referred to any authority which, in my opinion, supports the position which the plaintiff must sustain if it is to succeed. The principles upon which the courts have proceeded in determining whether sums to be paid upon the breach of one or more covenants in an agreement are to be regarded as in the nature of penalty or as liquidated damages are summarized in the judgment of Lord Dunedin in Public Works Commissioners v. Hills [30] and in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre v. New Garage [31]. It was on the footing that these principles were applicable that the judgment of the Court of Appeal [32] proceeded in finding that the portion of the agreement, which provided that should the purchaser fail to complete the logging in accordance with its terms or if the vendor should lawfully cancel the agreement by reason of the purchaser's default in performing its obligations the moneys should be forfeited and belong to the vendor as liquidated damages, was in the nature of a penalty against which the court should relieve. It must, however, be borne in mind that in none of these cases was there, as in the present case, a fund set up to be deposited in a bank in the joint names of the parties or otherwise as a guarantee for the fulfilment by the purchaser of its obligations under the contract, which was to be forfeited if the purchasers failed to complete their bargain. The distinction is pointed out by Jessel, M. R. in Wallis v. Smith [33] where, after referring to the cases where the question is as to whether or not the sum to be paid or the obligations imposed is in the nature of a penalty, it is said:\u2014\nI now come to the last class of cases. There is a class of cases relating to deposits. Where a deposit is to be forfeited for the breach of a number of stipulations, some of which may be trifling, some of which may be for the payment of money on a given day, in all those cases the judges have held that this rule does not apply and that the bargain of the parties is to be carried out.\nIn the present case the purpose of establishing the fund was, in the language of the agreement, \"to guarantee the due and proper logging by the purchasers of the said lands.\" I am unable to see any distinction in the legal position of a deposit thus established for a definite purpose during the course of the performance of the contract and one which is paid in a lump sum at the time an agreement is negotiated. Unless they are to be distinguished the matter is, in my view, concluded by the authorities. In Hinton v. Sparkes [34], an agreement for the purchase of a public house with fixtures, etc. contained the following stipulations:\u2014\nAnd, as earnest of this agreement, the purchaser has paid into the hands of the vendor \u00a350, which is to be allowed in part payment of the completion of this agreement. If the vendor shall not fulfil the same on his part, he shall return the deposit, in addition to the damages hereinafter stated: and, if the purchaser shall fail to perform his part of the agreement, then the deposit money shall become forfeited, in part of the following damages: and if either of the parties neglect or refuse to comply with any part of this agreement, he shall pay to the other,\u00a350, hereby mutually agreed upon to be the damages ascertained and fixed, on breach hereof.\nInstead of depositing the \u00a350 the purchaser gave an I.O.U. for the amount: thereafter he failed to complete the purchase and the vendor sold the public house for ten pounds less than the purchaser agreed to pay for it and brought an action against the purchaser for breach of the agreement and upon the I.O.U. It was held that the fact that an I.O.U. had been given for the deposit did not affect the matter.\nBoville, C.J. said that the intention of the parties, as he gathered it from the agreement, was that this was to be taken as the ordinary case of payment of a deposit, to be forfeited on the purchaser's failure to complete the contract and that there was no answer to the action, and in dealing with the numerous cases to which he had been referred as to the distinction between penalty and liquidated damages held that they had no application to a contract in the form of that in question.\nIn Ex parte Barrell [35], the facts were that by a contract for sale of real estate it was stipulated that a portion of the purchase money should be paid immediately and the residue of this on the completion of the contract. There was no stipulation as to the forfeiture of the deposit in case the purchase went off through the purchaser's default. After the title had been accepted the purchaser became bankrupt and his trustee disclaimed the contract under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and called upon the vendor to repay the deposit. Sir W. M. James, L.J. said that the trustee had no legal or equitable right to recover the deposit; that the money had been paid to the vendor as a guarantee that the contract should be performed; that the position of the trustee was that while refusing to perform the contract he demanded back the deposit, and Sir George Mellish, L.J. agreeing with this conclusion said that even where there was no clause in the contract he could not have back the money, since the contract had gone off through his own default.\nIn Howe v. Smith [36], a purchaser paid \u00a3500 which was stated in the contract to be paid \"as a deposit and in part payment of the purchase money.\" The contract provided that the purchase should be completed on a day named and that if the purchaser should fail to comply with the agreement the vendor should be at liberty to resell and to recover any deficiency in price as liquidated damages. The purchaser was not ready with his purchase price and after repeated delays the vendor resold the property for the same price. On the purchaser bringing an action for specific performance, it was held that he had lost this right by delay: as to the deposit, although it was to be taken as part payment if the contract was completed, it was held to be also a guarantee for the performance of the contract and that the plaintiff having failed to perform his contract within a reasonable time had no right to its return. Cotton, L.J. after referring with approval to what had been said by Lord Justice James in Ex parte Barrell [37] said that a deposit was a guarantee that the contract should be performed and that if the purchaser repudiated the contract he could have no right to recover the deposit. Fry, L.J. said in part (p. 101):\u2014\nMoney paid as a deposit must, I conceive, be paid on some terms implied or expressed. In this case no terms are expressed, and we must therefore inquire what terms are to be implied. The terms most naturally to be implied appear to me in the case of money paid on the signing of a contract to be that in the event of the contract being performed it shall be brought into account, but if the contract is not performed by the payer it shall remain the property of the payee. It is not merely a part payment, but is then also an earnest to bind the bargain so entered into, and creates by the fear of its forfeiture a motive in the payer to perform the rest of the contract.\nIn Sprague v. Booth [38], the contract provided in terms that the deposit was paid as security for the due carrying out of its terms and that in the event of default it should be forfeited as liquidated damages. There the deposit was a sum of $250,000 on account of a purchase price of $10,000,000 for shares in Canada Atlantic Railway Company. In addition to the shares, certain bonds were to be issued by the company and delivered at a named date but, owing to what was held to be a default of the proposed purchaser, they were not ready for delivery. The plaintiff to whom the rights of the latter had been assigned repudiated liability to complete and claimed the return of the deposit. Counsel for the appellant contended, as has been done in the present case, that the forfeiture of the deposit was a penalty from which the court would relieve, that it was not one of liquidated damages, for the purchaser was exposed to it equally upon a refusal to perform, the slightest delay, or, in the absence of any delay, by reason of a deficiency in the smallest portion of the price, and relied upon the decisions In re Dagenham (Thames) Dock Co., Ex parte Hulse [39]; Cornwall v. Henson [40]; Public Works Commissioners v. Hills [41]. In rejecting this contention Lord Dunedin [42], after reciting the facts, said in part (p. 580):\nWhen therefore the parties have agreed that the furnishing of the corpus of the bonds should be entrusted to Webb, and when Webb failed to produce the bonds in time to be signed by June 1, it seems to their Lordships that it stopped the mouth of Webb or his assignee from saying that Booth was in default in not having signed the bonds. It therefore follows that the non-payment of the money was not excused by any default of Booth, and was therefore default on the part of Webb or his assignee. This result seems to follow equally whether time was or was not of the essence of the contract. If it was, the result must follow. If it was not, it might still be that, by offering the money, Webb or his assignee might have been entitled to be given specific performance on terms as to the actual date of payment and delivery of the bonds. But to consider themselves absolved by the mere non-production of the bonds, the completion of which they themselves had by their conduct prevented, and then\u2014without even proposing to offer the money\u2014to treat this as a basis for repetition of the deposit and a claim of damages for nonperformance, was, in the opinion of their Lordships, out of the question.\nAs in the present case the trustee in Ex parte Barrell [43] and the plaintiff in Sprague v. Booth [44] while wrongfully repudiating their own obligations under the contract sought to recover the moneys deposited, as here, to guarantee its performance. As pointed out by Lord Dunedin [45], in the passage quoted from his judgment, this differentiates that case from those in which while there has been default the purchaser seeks to remedy such default and to carry out his contract and asks relief. Here the plaintiff seeks to be placed in the same position as the plaintiff in Steedman v. Drinkle [46]. The equitable principle upon which the court acted in granting relief in that case has no application to the facts of the present case, in my opinion. The appellant is entitled to a declaration that he is entitled to the moneys accumulated in the trust fund, whether in his hands or in those of the Royal Bank.\nAs to the claim for $600.94 advanced against the respondent company and Tait and Marchant, I agree with my brother Rand and would allow the appeal as against the company.\nThe appeal as to the guarantee trust fund and as to the last mentioned claim against the respondent company should be allowed: the appeal from the dismissal of the said claim as against Tait and Marchant should be dismissed. The appellant should have his costs throughout as against the respondent company. The defendants by counterclaim, Tait and Marchant, were found liable to the appellant at the trial for a further sum of $972.90 and costs and did not appeal from that finding: they are, however, entitled to succeed, in my view, in respect of the claim of $600.94 and should have their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this court.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

V.\n\"B\", domiciled in Nova Scotia, caused to be registered in the names of employees at Halifax of the Royal Trust Company, shares of United States companies having no share registry in Nova Scotia. The certificates, endorsed in blank, had attached declarations of trust by the registered holders to the effect that they had no right or interest in the shares and had delivered them to the Trust Company to whom all dividends were to be paid. The Trust Company, in accordance with \"B's\" written instructions held the certificates for management and safekeeping. After \"B's\" death it was appointed administrator with the will annexed of his estate.\nHeld: that the shares were not \"property situate in Nova Scotia\" within the meaning of The Succession Duty Act, s. 9(8). The situs of the shares was where they could be effectively dealt with as between the company and the shareholders, namely the United States. Succession duty was therefore not payable under the Succession Duty Act, N.S., 1945, c. 7.\nStern v. the Queen [18961 1 Q.B:D. 211, distinguished. Kerwin J. was of the opinion that even if that case be treated as an extension in England .of the common law rule, it should not be so treated in Canada where the question of divided jurisdiction arises, but that the test of situs laid down in King v. National Trust [19331 S.C.R., 670, approved by Rex v. Williams [1942] A.C. 541, should be followed. Rand J. was of the opinion that the law-making sovereignity of England was to be distinguished from that of a province of the Dominion of Canada, and that the power \"of direct taxation within the province\", interpreted as it has been by the authorities cited, is to be exercised on the footing that there is only one situs for every class of property and that situs must be within the province, and for shares, there can be no such division of interest or powers in or annexed to them as would in the result attribute to them a situs in two or more places. In the circumstances of the case, Kellock J., with the concurrence of Estey J., said, the mere fact that the shares were not registered in the name of the deceased does not render inapplicable the principle of the decision in Rex v. Williams; In re Ferguson (1935) I.R. 21; Attorney-General v. Higgins 2 H. & N. 339.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ., that the provisions .of the Canada-United States of America Tax Convention Act, 1944, (Dominion) do not affect the power of the Province of Nova Scotia to collect and retain Succession Duty taxes.\nAPPEAL by the appellant, as Administrator with the Will annexed of W. Herbert Brookfield, deceased, from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] whereby it was held\u2014on a case stated as to\u2014whether Succession Duty was leviable and payable for the use of the Province of Nova Scotia in respect of certain shares held by the late W. Herbert Brookfield at his death in companies of American registry, which shares were registered in the name of his nominees and had been endorsed by them in blank,\u2014that Succession Duty was leviable and payable for the use of that Province.\nR. A. Ritchie for the appellant.\nT. D. MacDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014On October 7, 1937, W. Herbert Brookfield, domiciled and resident in Nova Scotia, made an arrangement with Royal Trust Company under which the latter from time to time, on his instructions, bought shares of the capital stock of various companies incorporated under the laws of different states of the United States of America. Each of these companies had its head-office in the United States 'and maintained no share register or transfer office in Nova Scotia. The shares were registered in the names of various persons employed by the trust company at its office at Halifax and the certificates for such shares were endorsed in blank by the respective persons in whose names they were made out. To each such certificate, singly or by groups, was attached a declaration of trust, signed by the person in whose name the certificate was made out, declaring that such person held the shares as nominee of the trust company and that he had furnished the company with authority to collect and receive all dividends to which he, as registered owner, might become entitled.\nMr. Brookfield died November 14, 1944, having previously made his last will and testament, wherein he appointed executrices but, they being unable or unwilling to act, administration with the will annexed was granted to the Trust Company. The trust company paid the Collector of Succession Duties for Nova Scotia a sum of money which included succession duty in respect of the property to which the testator was entitled in the shares. Later, the company paid the Collector of Inland Revenue of the United States a sum of money as Federal Estate Tax in respect of the said shares. The company claimed a refund of this latter amount from Nova Scotia on the theory that the provisions of the Canada-United States of America Tax Convention Act, chapter 31 Statutes of Canada, 1944, was applicable. The taxes therein referred to are the taxes imposed under the Dominion Succession, Duty Act and as to the first question raised by the stated case, I agree with the Court en banc that such an Act and the Convention could not have any effect upon the power of the province to collect and retain succession duty taxes.\nThe second question is more difficult. Section 3(1) of the Nova Scotia Succession Duty Act, chapter 7 of the 1945 Statutes, provides:-\n3 (1) For the purpose of raising a revenue for provincial purposes. and save as is Hereinafter otherwise expressly provided, there shall he levied and paid for the use of the Province a duty (called Succession Duty), at the rates hereinafter specified upon all property hereinafter mentioned which has passed on the death of any person who has died on or since the 1st day of July, A.D. 1892, or which passes on the death of any person who shall hereafter die, the duty to be according to the fair market value of such property at the date of the death of the deceased.\nand section 8(a) enacts:-\n8. Save as is hereinafter otherwise expressly provided the property On Which succession duty shall be levied and paid under this Act at the rates hereinafter specified shall be as follows:\u2014\n(a) all property situate in Nova Scotia which has passed as aforesaid or which passes as aforesaid on the death of any person, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere * * *\nThe subject matter of the taxation is property \"situate in Nova Scotia.\" Mr. Brookfield had the beneficial interest in the shares and undoubtedly at the time of his death that interest passed within the meaning of the Act; but the question is whether such interest is property situate in the province.\nThe court en banc decided that the question was concluded by the decision in Stern v. The Queen[2], but before dealing with that decision it is convenient to refer to certain propositions that have been established in cases of this nature. They were formulated by Chief Justice Duff, speaking for this court in The King v. National Trust Company[3], and were expressly approved and repeated by the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Williams[4]. As pointed out by Lord Uthwatt for the Judicial Committee in Treasurer of Ontario. v. Blonde[5], the authorities before the Williams case established that, if, for the purposes of Succession Duty Acts (such as the Nova Scotia Act), there be found within a particular provincial jurisdiction a place in which registered shares in a company can be effectively dealt with as between the shareholders and company, the shares are situate within that jurisdiction; but that in none of those cases was there present the feature that there \u2022were two places where the shares could effectively be dealt with, one within, and the other outside, the jurisdiction. Lord Uthwatt proceeded to say that The principle laid down in the Williams case was that if it were possible on rational grounds to prefer one of the alternative places to the other as the place of transfer for the shares in question, the selection should be made accordingly. It was in applying this principle that Viscount Maugham in the Williams case stated that their Lordships had come to the conclusion that the existence in Buffalo, at the date of the death, of certificates in the name of the testator, endorsed by him in blank, must be decisive. Their Lordships did not think it right to express any opinion as to the conclusion which they would have come to if the certificates had not been endorsed and signed in blank by the testator, since the point did not arise for decision and there were some obvious distinctions arising in cases where the endorsement on certificates has not been signed by the registered holder. This reservation, it will be noticed, was made in a case where the judicial committee was faced with the problem of preferring one of two alternative places, one of which was within the jurisdiction of a province and the other outside Canada.\nIn the Blonde case, as here, there was no place within the claiming province where a transfer of the shares could be carried through but, differing from the present case, the certificates, while physically situate in the claimant province, had not been endorsed in blank by the registered holder. I assume without deciding that we are dealing with \"street certificates.\" Instating in the Blonde case the first matter to be ascertained, Lord Uthwatt left aside the case of street certificates but in my view the presence in Nova Scotia of such certificates does not alter the effect of the proposition that in deciding in such cases as this whether a matter is \"taxation within the province\" within head 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act, the test is where the shares, not as between transferor and transferee, but as between the company and the owner, may be effectively dealt with. A transferee of such a certificate would, of course, obtain the right to take the necessary steps to become the registered holder of the shares represented by the certificate but that is not sufficient.\nThe judgment in Stern v. The Queen, supra, so strongly relied upon by the respondent and followed by the court en banc, was delivered by Wright J. on behalf of a Divi- signal Court. It was concerned with certificates of shares in a foreign company. In the statement of facts it is stated that while the forms of transfer and powers of attorney had in regard to a large number of the shares been signed by the firms or persons in whose names the certificates were made out, with regard to some of the shares, of which the certificates were in the name of Stern Bros., such forms had not been signed by them. Nevertheless, the case apparently proceeded on the basis that all the certificates were included in the first class. It is evident that Wright J. intended to follow Attorney-General v. Bouwens[6]. At the time, the view was held that he really extended the operation of that decision (12 L.Q.R. 105), and in the Court of Appeal in Winans v. Rex[7] at 1026, the Master of the Rolls states that the Bouwens case was \"possibly carried further in the case of Stern v. Reg.\"[8]\nIn the Winans case it was admitted for the purposes of argument that the bonds were all bearer bonds passing by delivery and that they were capable of being dealt with, and were in fact dealt with, for money on the stock exchange. The case had, therefore, nothing to do with shares. It had to do with taxation under the Finance Act of 1894 which was held to be analogous, not to the Legacy and Succession Duty Acts but to the old Probate Duty Acts, and it was in that connection that Lord Atkinson, on the appeal to the House of Lords [1910] A.C. 27, at page 35, cited the Bouwens and Stern cases for the proposition that probate duty would before the passing of the 1894 Finance Act have undoubtedly been payable in respect of the bonds. The only other law lord who referred to the Stern case was Lord Gorell who, at page 39, states that the Bouwens case was followed in Stern.\nI am inclined therefore to assume that the approval of the Stern case by Lord Atkinson and Lord Gorell was confined to cases of bonds. Even if that be not so and if the Stern case be treated as an extension in England of the common law rule in the Bouwens case, it should not be so treated here in constitutional cases. In England there is no question of divided jurisdiction but certainly in Canada it would make serious inroads upon the test of the situs of shares as being where they may be effectively dealt with as between the company and the owner.\nAnother argument of the respondent is put thus in his factum:\u2014\nThe notional rule of the Brassard[9] case fixes the situs of the property of a registered owner of shares as the locus of the share registry because that is where the rights that make up that property may be dealt with:\u2014the rights to vote, attend meetings and receive dividends. The rule would completely lose its logic if applied to such a case as the present where the deceased held none of these rights.\nIn the first place, Duff J., as he then was, in Smith v. Levesque[10], points out that situs ascribed to intangible property for the purpose of determining the authority of the executor to deal with it is not, strictly speaking, a fictitious situs. Then, so far as the respondent's present contention is based upon the fact that the deceased was not the registered owner nor in possession of the certificates, the trust company and its employees, in my view, were merely Mr. Brookfield's agents, bound to follow his instructions as to voting, attending meetings and receiving dividends. The contention that the real nature of Mr. Brookfield's property was a right of action under a Nova Scotia trust, is to overlook the realities of the situation. Even if the trust company and its employees were trustees, the trusts ended when the certificates, endorsed in blank, came into possession of the trust company as administrator with the will annexed of the deceased.\nThe appeal .should be allowed. Notwithstanding the form of the stated case and of a written agreement signed on behalf of the parties, I understand that if the above views prevail, the proper order to be made is that the answer to the following question submitted for determination, namely:\u2014\nWhether succession duty was leviable and payable for the use of the Province of Nova Scotia in respect to the property to which the said W. Herbert Brookfield was at the time of his death entitled or which passed upon his death by reason of the facts related in Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the Stated Case herein?\nis that such succession duty was not leviable and payable for the use of the province of Nova . Scotia and that the province of Nova Scotia was not right in exacting the said tax and is required to make a refund of the sum of $14,347.09 without costs of any of the proceedings in this court or in the court en banc.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014W. Herbert Brookfield died in November, 1944, and at the time of his death, had his domicile in the province of Nova Scotia. The administration of his estate, valued at more than $450,000 was given to the Royal Trust \u2022Company, appellant in the present case.\nPrior to his death, the testator caused to be registered in the names of certain persons, shares of incorporated companies having their respective head-offices in the United States of America, and no transfer office's in the province of Nova Scotia. It is common ground that these shares were held on the testator's behalf, for management and safe keeping, in the vaults of the Royal Trust Company in Halifax. The certificates were endorsed in blank by the respective persons in whose name's they were made out, and to each certificate was attached a Declaration of Trust.\nSome time after the death of Mr. Brookfield, the Royal Trust Company, as administrator of the estate, paid to the Collector of Succession Duties for the province of Nova Scotia, the sum of $65,258.97, in which amount were included duties on the shares previously referred to. An amount of $17,897.92 was also paid to the Collector of Inland Revenue of the United States, being the Federal American taxes due on the transfer of said shares. The appellant, then claimed a refund from the province of Nova Scotia amounting to $14,347.09, and a stated case was submitted to the Supreme \u2022Court of Nova Scotia -en banc. The question was the following:\u2014\nWhether succession duty was leviable and payable for the use of the Province of Nova Scotia in respect to the property to which the said W. Herbert Brookfield was at the time of his death entitled or which passed upon his death by reason of the facts related in Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the Stated Case ;herein?\nThe unanimous answer was that such duties were leviable and payable, and that the province of Nova Scotia was right in exacting the tax, and was not required to make a refund thereof. I agree with the Supreme Court en bane of Nova Scotia[11], that the Royal Trust, as administrator, cannot base its claim for a refund \u2022on the ground that under the Canada-United States of America Tax Convention Act, (Statutes of Canada, 1944, chap. 31) the taxes are not due. I fully concur in the following statement made by Mr. Justice Doull:\u2014\nI am of opinion that this convention can have no application to a question of situs arising under the Nova Scotia Succession Duty Act. I do not agree with the suggestion that the Dominion Parliament has power to change the Nova Scotia enactment, if such enactment is within the power of the Nova Scotia Legislature under the British North America Act, but in the present case, no such question arises for the convention by its terms deals only with \"the tax imposed under the Dominion Succession Duty Act.\" Equally true it is that while Canada is defined as the \"Provinces, the Territories and Sable Island,\" the definition is only \"in a geographical sense.\" The convention does not purport to affect any Provincial power.\nBut with due deference, I cannot agree with the court below on the second point.\nThe relevant section of the Nova Scotia Succession Duty\nAct is the following:-\n8. Save as is thereinafter otherwise expressly provided the property on which succession duty shall be levied and paid under this Act at the rates hereinafter specified shall be as follows:\u2014\n(a) all property situate in Nova Scotia which has passed as aforesaid or which passes as aforesaid on the death of any person, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere * * *\nThe words \"property situate in Nova Scotia\", mean property, and in the present case, \"shares that can be effectively dealt with in Nova Scotia, as between the shareholders and the company\". I am of the opinion that these shares purchased with the deceased's money, in which of course, he had a beneficial interest, issued in the name of nominees and endorsed by them in (blank, cannot be dealt with in Nova Scotia, as between the shareholder and the company, but only in the United States, where are the share registers and transfer offices.\nI would allow the appeal, but without costs here, or in the court en bane.\nRAND, J.:\u2014At the threshold of any consideration of the situs of shares of stock in relation to succession duty lie two recent rulings of the Judicial Committee. In Brassard v. Smith[12], the test of the local situation, the place where shares are to be taken to be situate, was enunciated in the question, where can they be effectually dealt with? In Rex v. Williams[13], this was declared to mean, dealt with as between the shareholder and the company. Situs, in other words, is at the locus of the controlling act from which the relation of shareholder immediately arises. As between transferor and transferee the test would :be virtually useless since a shareholder can, speaking generally, effectively transfer the right to a share in any part of the world.\nThe latter judgment affirms certain other propositions relating to death duties imposed by Canadian provinces: first, that as between provinces, moveable or immoveable property transmitted owing to death can have only one local situation; that the situs of intangible property must be determined by some \"principle or coherent system of principles\" deducible from the common law of England; and that a provincial legislature is not competent to prescribe the conditions fixing. situs for the purpose of defining the subjects of its taxing powers under section 92(2). The further rule was laid down that \"the solution must be the same in this case (where there were two valid registries, one in Ontario and one in Buffalo, New York) as it would have been if the testator had been domiciled in another province of Canada, say in Quebec, instead of in New York, and if all the other facts had been as they were in fact, including the existence of a separate registry in Quebec.\"\nThese pronouncements, re-affirmed in Treasurer of Ontario v. Blonde[14], treat mere transferability or merchantability of the right to :become a shareholder, in the initial stages of the enquiry, as having little if any relevance to situs; but they recognize as matters of a determinative nature what the law creating the shares has provided to evidence their characteristics as property. Registration in a book and representation by as certificate are tangible badges which set conditions to complete transferability of the shares as well as facilitate dealings with them. If, as in the case of bearer shares, in analogy to bearer bonds, the issuing jurisdiction has in effect embodied in a certain instrument the exclusive symbol of the total rights created, then, certainly, as a rule, the situs is taken to be the locality in which the instrument may at any time be.\nMr. MacDonald's contention is that the merchantability of street certificates differentiates the case here from the previous controversies. His argument is this: a share certificate endorsed in blank by the registered holder and transferred to a purchaser by delivery has come thereupon to represent a separate unit of property consisting of the beneficial interest in the share coupled with a power in the bearer to become a shareholder, with the delivery of the certificate concluding the transaction between the parties; the right thus acquired, as against the company, to make a transfer of ownership on the registry satisfies the requirement that direct and immediate legal relations must arise between the transferee and the company as the result of acts done at the situs. The difference between the two cases is obvious: in the one a person is or can be made a shareholder by acts within the jurisdiction; in the other, by such acts he is clothed with power only to make himself a shareholder by means of his further acts outside: and the test remains unsatisfied. For his proposition, however, Mr. MacDonald has the support of Stern v. The Queen[15], and the question comes down to this: whether in a province under the rules laid down, the legislative situation is such as will permit the distinction to be acted on.\nUnder a law-making sovereignty the subject-matter of taxation may in fact be anything on which power can be exerted or in respect of which the payment of money can be made the condition of the doing of an act or exercising a right within its territorial boundaries. In the Stern case there were street certificates within England which were essential to an entry of transfer on the register outside of England; and the legislative authority of England extended in effect to restrain the use of those certificates until, or to charge other property admittedly in England with, the payment of certain monies related to them. Whether these monies are taken to :be probate or estate duties or legacy or succession duties does not, for purposes of .jurisdiction in taxes, appear to be material.\nBut a province of the Dominion is not apparently in that degree of sovereignty. The power of \"direct taxation within the province\", interpreted as it has been by the authorities cited, is to be exercised on the footing that there its only one situs for every class of property and that that situs must be within the province. And for Shares, there can be no such division of interests or powers in or annexed to them as would in the result attribute to them a situs in two or more places.\nIt is not suggested that the law of New York has embodied the visible and exclusive evidence of these rights in one tangible and moveable symbol to be looked upon and dealt with as a chattel as in Attorney-General v. Bouwens[16], and that being so, we are remitted to the considerations by which the shares are localized in the place where they may be effectually dealt with. But it is conceded that an entry of the purchaser's name on the registry of the shares in New York would be essential to admitting him to membership in the company and the case comes then directly within the principles laid down.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed but as agreed without costs in both courts.\nKELLOCK J. (concurred in by Estey J.):\u2014The stated case shows that at his death on the 14th of November, 1944, the testator was domiciled and resided in Nova Scotia. Some time prior to his death the shares here in question, all common shares, were registered, pursuant to the instructions of the deceased, in the names of nominees of The Royal Trust Company, the share certificates being endorsed in blank. In every instance a \"Declaration of Trust\" was also executed by the nominee, stating that the shares were registered in the name of the shareholder as the nominee of The Royal Trust Company and that the certificates had been delivered to the Trust Company together with an irrevocable authority to collect and receive the dividends. It appears also that these certificates were so delivered pursuant to the direction of the deceased for safekeeping and management. They were therefore in the possession of the deceased through his agent.\nThe respondent contends that the case is not within the principle of the decision in Rex.v. Williams[17], for the reason that although the deceased was the beneficial owner, he was not the registered owner. It is said that in the case of certificates endorsed in blank, where the deceased was not the registered shareholder, the physical location of the certificates fixes the situs for succession duty purposes, their marketability there, according to the contention, being the 'determining consideration; and[18] that in any event the only property which passed on the death was a chose in action under a Nova Scotia trust.\nThe statute which is applicable is the Succession Duty Act of Nova Scotia, 9 Geo. VI, c. 7. By section 3, subsection 1, provision is made for the levying of a succession duty upon all property mentioned in the statute passing on the death of any person who has died on or since the 1st day of July, 1892. By subsection 2 \"property passing on the death\" is deemed to include for all purposes of the Act:\n(a) property of which the deceased was at the time of his death competent to dispose.\nBy section 2 (b) the expression \"property\" includes real and personal property of every description, whether tangible or intangible, and every estate and interest therein. By subsection 2 (a) of section 2, a person shall be deemed competent to dispose of property for the purposes of the Act:\nif he has such an estate or interest therein or such general power as would if he were sui juris enable him to dispose of the property.\nIn Bradbury v. English Sewing Cotton Co., Lord Wrenbury said at page 767:\nA share is, therefore, a fractional part of the capital. It confers upon the holder a certain right to a proportionate part of the assets of the corporation.\nCertain rights or incidents are attached thereto, such as the right to attend meetings and to vote, etc.\nIn the case at bar the property passing on the death of the late Mr. Brookfield was, in my opinion, the full beneficial interest in the shares and was not merely a chose in action. I think it unnecessary to say more as to the second branch of the argument.\nComing to the first branch, the deceased in Rex v. Williams, supra, an American citizen, domiciled in the state of New York, was the owner of certain shares of Lake Shore Mines Ltd., a company incorporated by letters patent issued under the Ontario Companies Act. The share certificates Were at all material times physically located in the state of New York and they had been endorsed in blank by the testator. At the date of the death, the company had an office in Toronto and one in Buffalo, in the state of New York, at both of which transfers of shares might properly be made. The executors had taken out probate in the state of New York and subsequently ancillary letters probate in Ontario, where the testator possessed property apart from the shares. The question for decision was as to whether the testator's property in the shares was liable to succession duty in Ontario. It was held that the shares were not so subject, not being property situate in Ontario. In the course of delivering the opinion of the Board, Viscount Maugham referred to the earlier decision of the Board in Brassard v. Smith[19], where the rule was laid down that in cases where there is but a single province in Canada in which shares of a company may be effectively dealt with, i.e., where they can be transferred on the books of the company, the situs of the shares for fiscal purposes is in that province. At page 558 he said:\nThe first observation is that the phrase used in laying down the principle clearly means \"where the shares can be effectively dealt with as between the shareholder and the company, so that the transferee will become legally entitled to all the rights of a member\", e.g., the right of attending meetings and voting and of receiving dividends.\nIn the circumstances present, in the Williams' case, as already noted, the shares were transferable either in Ontario or in New York, and it was held that the presence of the certificate's, endorsed as mentioned, in New York, was the determining element. As to whether a .different rule applies as between two provinces than as between one or more provinces and a foreign country, their Lordships stated at page 559: They observe that the solution must be the same in this case as it would have been if the testator had been domiciled in another province of Canada, say in Quebec, instead of in New York, and if all the other facts had been as they were in fact, including the existence of a separate registry in Quebec.\nThe same principle was applied in Treasurer of Ontario v. Aberdein[20].\nThe present problem differs from the problem presented by the facts in the Williams' case in that in the case at bar the deceased was not the registered owner.\nIn the Williams' case Viscount Maugham said at page 556:\nThe rule laid down in Brassard v. Smith[21] would in practice be useless if the place where the certificates for shares were found at the time of the death should be taken to be necessarily the situs of the shares. Their Lordships have no hesitation in holding that the situs of the certificates is not, taken alone, sufficient to afford a solution to the present problem.\nIn adverting to the fact that the certificates in the Williams' case had been endorsed in blank, their Lordships said at page 557:\nThis had the admitted result of making a delivery of the certificates with the endorsements signed in blank a good assignment of the shares, since it passed a title to the assignees both legal and equitable, with a right as against the company to obtain registration and to obtain new certificates; Colonial Bank v. Cady[22]. It must be accepted, therefore, as a fact, that the certificates were currently marketable in the State of New York as securities for the shares, and that they were documents necessary for vouching the title of the testator to the shares.\nAgain at page 558:\nThe late owner in the normal case was absolutely entitled to the shares as the registered owner of them in the books of the company, and, if resident in a country or province different from that in which the shares can be effectively dealt with, could nevertheless have sold the shares and completed the transaction by an attorney or otherwise.\nIn the present case the deceased, although not the registered owner, was in a position to deliver the certificates, endorsed in blank, to whomsoever he pleased and thereby to pass to his assignee the interest of the registered shareholder (Colonial Bank v. Cady, supra, per Lord Watson at 277) as well as his own interest, with a right as against the company to obtain registration and new certificates. It is difficult perhaps to see why, if the respondent's contention be correct, the ability of a registered owner to sell his shares and to satisfy his contract by delivering endorsed certificates, does not touch the question of situs, while the same capacity on the part of a beneficial owner has not the same effect.\nIn the Williams' case their Lordships went on to say at page 560:\nThe certificates endorsed and signed as they were cannot be regarded as mere evidence of title. They were valuable documents situate in Buffalo and marketable there, and a transferee was capable of being registered as holder there without leaving the State of New York or performing any act in Ontario. On the testator's death his legal personal representatives in the State of New York became the lawful holders of the certificates, entitled to deal with them there. Any sale by them would be \"in order\", and the purchaser could obtain registration in the Buffalo registry. If we contrast the position in Ontario the difference is obvious. Nothing effective could lawfully be done there without producing the certificates. In a business sense the shares at the date of the death could effectively be dealt with in Buffalo and not in Ontario.\nIn the case at bar the shares could be \"effectively dealt\" with only in some one or more of the United States. The transferee could not become \"legally entitled to all the rights of :a member\" in Nova Scotia; see Viscount Maugham at page 558. It seems to me therefore \u2022that, in the circumstances of the present case, the mere fact that the shares were not registered in the name of the deceased \u2022does not render inapplicable the principle of the decision in Rex v. Williams. The certificates here in question all require the production of the certificate for the purpose of transfer.\nThe conclusion as above to which I have come was the conclusion arrived at in somewhat similar circumstances in the \u2022Supreme Court of the Irish Free State in In re Ferguson[23]. In that case shares in a British company belonging to a person of unsound mind, which had been transferred into the name of the accountant of the Courts of Justice, were held to have their situs in England where the register of shareholders was located. The statute there considered was the Finance Act, 1894, the relevant provisions of which are all reproduced in the Nova Scotia statute set out above. The court applied the principle of Attorney-General v. Higgins[24], and Brassard v. Smith, supra, as well as Erie Beach Co., Ltd., v. Attorney-General for Ontario[25]. The argument presented in the present case on behalf of the respondent was rejected in Ferguson's case. Hanna, J., at page 49 says:\u2014\nMr. McCann distinguishes all these cases by the fact that in each of them the legal interest and the beneficial ownership were in the same person. In my view that cannot affect the position, even if we resort to the dissection of the legal situation as the Revenue Commissioners invite us to do. If the Chief Justice desired by an order to deal with the shares, it could not be effective save by operating upon the register in Great Britain where the property is situate and seeking in aid, if necessary, the jurisdiction of the British Courts. The executors also, in the final resort, must go to the register in Great Britain or appeal to the British Court. Accordingly, I think that the distinction drawn by Mr. McCann in this case does not effect the principle once the Court comes to the conclusion that it is the shares that pass.\nFitzgibbon J., at page 65 in delivering the judgment on appeal said:\nThe law is summed up by Lord Merrivale, quoting from Baron Martin's judgment in Attorney-General v. Higgins[26]: \"When transfer of shares in a company must be effected by a change in the register, the place where the register is required by law to be kept determines the locality of the shares.\" The Revenue Commissioners can have no doubt that estate duty is payable in Great Britain upon these shares by reason of the death \u2022of Sarah Ferguson; it has been decided by us that it was the property in these shares that passed upon her death; and it follows that the respondents are entitled to an allowance of the sum paid in duty in Great Britain.\nAt page 66 Fitzgibbon J., also said in dealing with the same point:\nWe do not agree with this contention, having regard to the circumstances in which the name of the Accountant came to be placed upon the registers, but in any event the decision of Eve J. in In re Aschrott[27], is an authority for the proposition that the same principles apply even when the name of the deceased person is not actually upon the register of shareholders at the time of his death.\nIn Aschrott's case the testator, a German subject, was entitled to stock, shares and securities in English, South African and American companies which had been purchased for him by certain German banks acting through their London agencies. The certificates were in all cases situate in London and the securities themselves were transferable in London at the outbreak of the war of 1914 and at the date of the testator's death in 1915. The securities were held in large blocks by the London agencies and had not prior to his death been specifically allocated to the testator so that it would appear that none of the certificates were in his name. By virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Peace Orders all the shares became charged with the claim of the Custodian of Enemy Property. The question for decision in the case was whether estate duty was payable on all or any of the securities which in turn depended, as put by Eve J., on the question \"were these shares in companies registered in South Africa and America, but having offices in England where certificates could be produced, transfers passed, and the names of transferees entered on the register, property situate out of the United Kingdom?\" It was held that the shares had their situs in England.\nIf it be the province where the shares are situate which has the constitutional authority to levy a succession duty upon the death of the owner, it seems past question that, upon the death of the person in Nova Scotia who is the registered shareholder but who is not the beneficial owner, if the register, of the company is situate in another province, say Quebec, the latter province would be entitled to levy succession duty in respect of nothing more than the interest of the nominee, i.e., the bare legal interest. The value of such interest would appear to be nominal only.\nIn the court below reliance was placed on the case Stern v. The Queen[28]. In that case the testator died in England owning shares in foreign companies, the certificates being in England and standing in the names of persons other than the testator. Some were endorsed' but some had not been at the time of the death. It was held that the certificates being currently marketable in England were liable to probate duty.\nThat case was decided upon a stated case which contained the statement, inter alia, that the delivery of a certificate endorsed by the registered owner in blank constitutes as between the parties to the transaction a good assignment of \"the shares\" both in law and in equity passing the title to the shares both legal and equitable. In giving judgment Wright J. said at p. 218:\nThere is in this country a document the existence of which vouches and is necessary for vouching the title of some one to the foreign share, so that in the absence of that document no one at all could establish a title to the share * * * It being a marketable security 'operative, though not completely operative, to pass the title, and. having a marketable value here, I think that it is itself a document which is a document of value in the hands of the executors within the jurisdiction of the Ordinary.\nIt would appear that the considerations which determined the decision were the existence of the endorsed certificates within the jurisdiction and their marketability there, together with the fact that as between transferor and transferee, the legal and equitable title to \"the shares\" was vested in the transferee.\nMarketability as later laid down in the Williams' case \"does not touch the question of situs\", and the \"situs of the certificates is not, taken alone, sufficient to afford a solution to the problem.\"\nUnless the decision in Stern's case proceeded on the ground, apparently assumed by counsel in Aschrott's case at: 317, and in Blonde's case at p. 27, that the shares in question in that case were transferable on branch registers in. England, I cannot consider it a governing authority as to the situs of shares for the purposes of succession duty in one of the provinces of Canada where situs has been authoritatively determined to depend on the considerations already discussed and not mentioned in Stern's case.\nIn Winans v. Attorney-General[29], a case concerned with bonds, Lord Atkinson at page 35 treated Stern's case and Attorney-General v. Bouwens, as founded on a common principle, as did also Lord Gorell at pp. 38-39. At page 31 Lord Atkinson said:\nIt is not disputed that the bonds are payable to bearer, are marketable in England, are not registered in the name of the deceased, nor is his name mentioned in them, are transferable in England by delivery, and that no act other than delivery need be done in or out of England to complete the title of the transferee.\nAll of this applies to the certificates here in question except the last, and the first and \"leading\" enquiry in the case of shares is the location of the place of transfer where the transferee will become legally entitled to all the rights of a member. That consideration is the same for the transferee whether or not he receives a certificate directly from the registered shareholder. In a case of shares as distinct from the case of bearer bonds Attorney-General v. Bouwens has been determined not to be, but Attorney-General v. Higgins, the governing authority.\nIn the judgment in Blonde's case, Lord Uthwatt left open the question of the situs of \"street certificates\". Until a different rule is established by their Lordships in such cases however, my view is as above. Bearer share warrants are subject to different considerations. In such case the legislation usually provides that delivery of the warrant in itself effects a transfer of the shares without more.\nI would allow the appeal. There should be no costs in this court or below.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Roland A. Ritchie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas D.

The accident happened as the car was overtaking two cyclists following one another on the right side of the pavement, appellant being ahead. Respondent contents that he was driving at 40-45 m.p.h. and that he sounded his horn twice, the first time at 100 to 125 feet from the cyclists and then a few feet away from them. Neither cyclists who were riding about 20 feet apart heard the horn. The collision occurred about the center of the pavement, as the appellant had swung to the left to cross the road without looking back or signaling. The trial judge found both parties equally at fault and the majority in the Court of Appeal held that appellant's negligence was the sole cause of the collision. Held, Rand and Estey JJ. dissenting, that appellant's action in crossing the road without looking back and without signaling his intention to do so was the sole cause of the accident. It being established by affirmative evidence against negative evidence that the horn was sounded twice, respondent has rebutted the presumption of fault created by section 53 of the Quebec Motor Vehicles Act.\nHeld also, that section 36(1) of the Quebec Motor Vehicles Act has no application when the vehicle overtakes the bicycle.\nPer Rand and Estey JJ (dissenting): The failure of the driver to give the warning in a reasonable manner as required by sec. 36(4), and the maintenance of his speed at 40-45 m.p.h. under the circumstances do not support the conclusion that the respondent has discharged the statutory onus imposed upon him by sec. 53(2).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec 1, reversing, St. Jacques J.A. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court, Sevigny C.J., and dismissing the action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. Bernier, K.C., Y. Bernier and A. Labette, K.C. for the appellant.\nJacques de Billy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: Il s'agit d'un accident o\u00f9 l'appelant, mont\u00e9 sur une bicyclette, a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par l'automobile de l'intim\u00e9 sur la route nationale qui va de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocati\u00e8re \u00e0 L\u00e9vis.\nL'appelant, en compagnie d'un ami, \u00e9galement en bicyclette, se dirigeait vers l'ouest et \u00e9tait \u00e0 la droite de la route. La voiture de l'intim\u00e9, conduite par son fils \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix-sept ans, allait dans la m\u00eame direction.\nJ'emprunte au jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure les quelques passages suivants:\nLe fils du d\u00e9fendeur (intim\u00e9) affirme qu'il a signal\u00e9 son approche et il est corrobor\u00e9 par ses deux fr\u00e8res \u00e2g\u00e9s de douze et quinze ans, lors de l'accident. L'automobile du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait conduite \u00e0 une vitesse de quarante \u00e0 quarante-cinq milles \u00e0 l'heure.\nLe demandeur et son compagnon ont jur\u00e9 que l'approche de l'automobile n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e\u2026 Il r\u00e9sulte de la preuve qu'il fut heurt\u00e9 par l'automobile du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au centre de la route\u2026 Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9fendeur, pour d\u00e9gager sa responsabilit\u00e9, devait \u00e9tablir hors de tout doute que l'accident n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 sa n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 sa conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible. (Article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles.)\nLe fait d'avoir signal\u00e9 avec son klaxon lorsqu'il approchait des bicyclettes, comme le pr\u00e9tend le fils du d\u00e9fendeur, est-il suffisant pour conclure qu'il n'y a eu ni n\u00e9gligence ni conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de sa part?\u2026\nLorsque le chauffeur du d\u00e9fendeur a signal\u00e9 son approche, comme il le pr\u00e9tend, l'automobile \u00e9tait \u00e0 environ cent pieds des cyclistes, \u00e0 une vitesse de quarante \u00e0 quarante-cinq milles \u00e0 I'heure, et il conduisait \u00e0 cette vitesse lorsque, \u00e0 environ vingt pieds en avant de lui, il a vu que le demandeur dirigeait son bicycle en travers de la route.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur base sa non-responsabilit\u00e9 sur les pr\u00e9cautions qu'il a prises et sur la faute commise par le demandeur en dirigeant sa bicyclette sur le centre de la route\u2026\nUn signal de klaxon, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ne suffit pas\u2026\nUn appareil sonore \"ne peut \u00eatre mis en usage que comme signal de danger\" (article 29, Loi des v\u00e9hicules\u2026\nIl (le d\u00e9fendeur) pouvait r\u00e9duire sa vitesse de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 arr\u00eater son v\u00e9hicule dans quelques pieds et s'il avait agi ainsi et avait eu quand m\u00eame un accident, il serait justifiable de l'attribuer \u00e0 la seule imprudence du demandeur\u2026\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il y a eu imprudence et n\u00e9gligence de la part du d\u00e9fendeur et qu'il y a eu aussi imprudence et n\u00e9gligence de la part du demandeur en dirigeant sa bicyclette vers le centre de la route et que, vu la faute contributive des parties, il y a lieu de r\u00e9duire de moiti\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation du demandeur \u00e9tablie \u00e0 la somme de $9,094.18\u2026\nCondamne le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 payer au demandeur une somme de $4,547.09 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et d\u00e9pens.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi 2 a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a rejet\u00e9 l'action du demandeur avec les d\u00e9pens contre lui tant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'en Cour du Banc du Roi.\nDans le jugement formel 3, on trouve les consid\u00e9rants suivants:\nConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur est clairement en faute d'avoir travers\u00e9 la route sans regarder en arri\u00e8re et sans donner aucun signal;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appelant s'est compl\u00e8tement disculp\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sulte de l'article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la collision survenue entre l'automobile du d\u00e9fendeur et le bicycle du demandeur ne peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 la vitesse que faisait alors le dit automobile du d\u00e9fendeur;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur a prouv\u00e9 que le conducteur, en la dite circonstance, pr\u00eatait la plus grande attention \u00e0 la direction de son automobile, a donn\u00e9 le signal qu'exige la loi avant un d\u00e9passement, s'est dirig\u00e9 vers la gauche suffisamment pour laisser aux bicycles tout l'espace requis, et a m\u00eame, au moment o\u00f9 la collision est devenue in\u00e9vitable, inclin\u00e9 davantage vers la gauche, de sorte que le demandeur avait alors \u00e0 sa disposition plus de la moiti\u00e9 de la voie pav\u00e9e; Consid\u00e9rant que la faute tr\u00e8s grave commise par le demandeur, en tournant tout \u00e0 coup vers sa gauche pour traverser le chemin, est l'unique cause de l'accident, et des dommages qu'il a subis;\nFait droit \u00e0 l'appel, et infirme le jugement attaqu\u00e9.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de quatre des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi contre M. le Juge St-Jacques, dissident.\nVoici ce que l'on trouve dans les notes de ce dernier juge:\nIl est certain, en effet, que le demandeur a commis une grave imprudence en entreprenant de traverser la route vers la gauche sans avoir en aucune fa\u00e7on signal\u00e9 ce changement de direction. Il \u00e9tait, \u00e0 ce moment, trop tard pour que le conducteur de l'automobile puisse \u00e9viter le choc qui s'est produit.\nIl ajoute, d'autre part, que le conducteur de l'automobile ne pouvait pas entreprendre de d\u00e9passer le demandeur \"sans avoir signal\u00e9 son approche d'une fa\u00e7on effective, lui permettant raisonnablement de croire qu'on l'avait entendu. Les dispositions des paragraphes trois et quatre de l'article 36 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules moteurs lui en imposent l'obligation, et, \u00e0 mon avis, ce serait une faute que d'essayer de s'y soustraire, sous le pr\u00e9texte que la route est libre et que le d\u00e9passement n'offre aucun danger\".\nLe savant juge est d'avis qu'il ne peut d\u00e9duire de la preuve, d'une fa\u00e7on certaine, que le conducteur de l'automobile a donn\u00e9 un signal pouvant \u00eatre entendu par le demandeur. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dit-il, para\u00eet avoir eu sur ce point de forts doutes, et lui-m\u00eame reste, comme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, \"avec des doutes tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\"\nEn pareille mati\u00e8re, s'il subsiste un doute, la jurisprudence est bien \u00e0 l'effet que le propri\u00e9taire de l'automobile ne s'est pas disculp\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement.\nIl \u00e9tait donc d'avis de rejeter l'appel.\nLa majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour 4, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9taill\u00e9 les circonstances de l'accident dans leurs notes, a \u00e9t\u00e9 au contraire d'avis que, devant les faits prouv\u00e9s, la prescription de l'article 53 devait c\u00e9der et que l'action devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nElle conclut de la preuve que le demandeur, sans signal qu'il entendait tourner \u00e0 sa gauche, sans s'assurer si la route \u00e9tait libre, sans aucune pr\u00e9caution, fit un virage brusque, soudain et presqu'\u00e0 angle droit, pour traverser la route. Le conducteur de la voiture de l'intim\u00e9 vit les deux cyclistes qui roulaient \u00e0 droite et rien de leur part n'indiquait une intention quelconque de changer leur course; il corna \u00e0 cent ou cent vingt-cinq pieds du dernier et se rangea \u00e0 gauche avec l'intention de les d\u00e9passer. Ce mouvement, suivant la preuve, mettait une partie de la voiture \u00e0 gauche du centre de la route. Au moment o\u00f9 l'automobile arrivait vis-\u00e0-vis du compagnon du demandeur (ce dernier t\u00e9moigne sur ce point et admet ce fait) le demandeur venait de faire le mouvement de couper \u00e0 travers la route. Le conducteur de l'automobile corna de nouveau et appliqua fortement ses freins; mais les deux cyclistes n'\u00e9taient \u00e9loign\u00e9s l'un de l'autre que d'une couple de longueurs de leur propre bicyclette et le mouvement du demandeur s'est fait \u00e0 une distance de seulement quelques vingt pieds de l'automobile.\nAucun indice ne pouvait laisser pr\u00e9sumer \u00e0 l'automobiliste qu'une telle man\u0153uvre devait s'effectuer: aucune circonstance pouvant faire na\u00eetre chez le conducteur la possibilit\u00e9 d'un soudain et rapide virage.\nM. le juge Bissonnette dit que \"la faute du cycliste est l'une des plus lourdes, des plus graves, des plus caract\u00e9ris\u00e9es qui puissent se commettre par un homme normal dans la force de l'\u00e2ge \u2026 Il est en faute, et, \u00e0 mes yeux, il est le seul artisan de cette collision \u2026 La vitesse n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de cet accident et le conducteur de l'automobile n'\u00e9tait pas tenu \u00e0 ces pr\u00e9cautions extraordinaires dont la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a fait \u00e9tat\u2026 Il fa'ut se demander, au-dessus de tout et avant tout, si la man\u0153uvre de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait un \u00e9v\u00e9nement pr\u00e9visible\u2026 La diligence que doit exercer le conducteur d'une automobile, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'article 53, est en fonctions de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice qu'il peut causer\u2026 Selon Planiol et Ripert, t. 6, p. 710, \"il n'est en faute que s'il existait pour lui une obligation de le pr\u00e9voir et de faire diligence pour \u00e9viter qu'il se produise\"\u2026 Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le conducteur n'avait donc pas le devoir de r\u00e9duire sa vitesse de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pouvoir arr\u00eater derri\u00e8re les bicyclettes si ces derni\u00e8res commettaient une imprudence impardonnable. (Allard v. Valli\u00e8res, 5)\u2026 La prescription que l'automobiliste doit rester ma\u00eetre de sa vitesse doit comporter en m\u00eame temps que le conducteur doit garder sur sa voiture une ma\u00eetrise suffisante pour parer aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements pr\u00e9visibles\"; (Plouffe v. McKenzie 6) Il faut se garder, ajoute le savant juge, d'\u00e9lever la pr\u00e9somption de l'article 53 \"au degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure. (Davis et Latulippe 7)\nEn outre, le savant juge fait remarquer que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a omis de consid\u00e9rer le paragraphe 4 de l'article 36 qui exige qu'avant de d\u00e9passer et avant de se ranger \u00e0 gauche, la personne conduisant un v\u00e9hicule automobile doit avertir de son intention au moyen de l'appareil sonore.\nIl s'en suivrait que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, qui semble s'\u00eatre appuy\u00e9 uniquement sur l'article 29 de la Loi et qui en a conclu que le conducteur d'une automobile ne devait se servir de l'appareil sonore de sa voiture que dans le but de signaler un danger, s'est m\u00e9pris sur le sens de la Loi, puisque l'article 36 (4) exige qu'un avertissement soit donn\u00e9 avec l'appareil sonore lorsque la personne conduisant un v\u00e9hicule automobile veut d\u00e9passer, afin d'avertir de son intention.\nL'honorable Juge Gagn\u00e9 commence par signaler imm\u00e9diatement la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages que contient le dossier.\nIl interpr\u00e8te la preuve comme \u00e9tablissant que le conducteur de l'automobile de l'intim\u00e9 a fait sonner son klaxon mais que, comme un bicycle qui \u00e9tait en avant, conduit par le demandeur, s'est dirig\u00e9 vers la gauche pour traverser la route \"tout \u00e0 coup\", l'accident \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable\u2026 Sa faute est d'ailleurs \u00e9vidente, ajoute-t-il. Il a entrepris de traverser la route sans regarder en arri\u00e8re et sans donner le moindre signal. C'est l\u00e0 une faute tellement grave qu'on peut dire qu'elle est la seule cause de l'accident.\nLa suggestion de l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance que si le conducteur de l'automobile avait r\u00e9duit sa vitesse de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 arr\u00eater son v\u00e9hicule dans quelques pieds, et si par la suite il y avait eu quand m\u00eame un accident, le d\u00e9fendeur serait justifiable de l'attribuer \u00e0 la seule imprudence du demandeur, ne lui para\u00eet pas fond\u00e9e. \"Exiger en outre de l'automobiliste qu'il r\u00e9duise sa vitesse \u00e0 un point \"qui lui permette d'arr\u00eater en quelques pieds\" serait rendre le d\u00e9passement impossible\".\nL'accident est arriv\u00e9 en 1944 alors que la limite de vitesse (voir Statut de Qu\u00e9bec de 1942, 6 George VI, Chapitre 43, article 4) \u00e9tait de quarante milles \u00e0 l'heure; et il est clair, pour l'honorable juge, que l'accident se f\u00fbt produit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on quand m\u00eame la voiture aurait circul\u00e9 exactement \u00e0 quarante milles. \"Ce n'est certainement pas l\u00e0 une cause de l'accident.\"\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a donc prouv\u00e9, \u00e0 l'avis du savant juge, que la vitesse \u00e9tait raisonnable, que le conducteur pr\u00eatait la plus grande attention \u00e0 la direction de son automobile, qu'il s'est dirig\u00e9 vers la gauche suffisamment pour laisser aux bicycles tout l'espace requis, et qu'il a m\u00eame inclin\u00e9 davantage vers la gauche au moment o\u00f9 la collision est devenue in\u00e9vitable.\nIl retient des trois t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s en faveur du d\u00e9fendeur, et dont il dit qu'ils sont \u00e9videmment v\u00e9ridiques, que \"ce signal a bien \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9\".\nL'enqu\u00eate a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le demandeur avait \u00e0 sa disposition plus que la moiti\u00e9 de la voie pav\u00e9e au moment o\u00f9 s'est produite la collision. Il s'en suivrait que le d\u00e9fendeur a raison quand il soutient que la faute tr\u00e8s grave commise par le demandeur, en tournant tout \u00e0 coup vers sa gauche pour traverser le chemin, est la seule cause de l'accident et des dommages qu'il a subis. \"L'appelant s'est compl\u00e8tement disculp\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9sulte de l'article 53\".\nM. le juge Pratte d\u00e9clare qu'il partage l'opinion de messieurs les juges Bissonnette et Gagn\u00e9, et qu'il \"ne trouve rien dans la preuve qui \u00e9tablisse \u00e0 la charge du conducteur une violation de la loi\". L'automobiliste doit pouvoir compter que ses co-usagers de la route suivront au moins les r\u00e8gles de la prudence \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire, dont la violation d\u00e9note, chez celui qui s'en rend coupable, une absence compl\u00e8te du souci de sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou de celle d'autrui. Rien ne permettait au conducteur de pr\u00e9voir que l'un ou l'autre des cyclistes allait d\u00e9vier de sa course; il pouvait donc continuer la sienne en comptant que les cyclistes continueraient la leur de fa\u00e7on normale. Le conducteur de l'automobile ne pouvait pr\u00e9voir que le cycliste qui, jusque-l\u00e0 s'\u00e9tait conduit normalement, \"allait commettre subitement et sans signe pr\u00e9alable, la supr\u00eame imprudence de virer \u00e0 gauche pour traverser la route\u2026 C'est cette man\u0153uvre inopin\u00e9e et impr\u00e9visible du demandeur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule cause de l'accident, et le d\u00e9fendeur doit en \u00eatre exon\u00e9r\u00e9\". Lors de l'audition devant cette Cour, le savant procureur de l'appelant n'a pu me convaincre que les propositions \u00e9mises par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 8 devaient \u00eatre mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9, tant sur les faits que sur le droit.\nL'on ne peut interpr\u00e9ter autrement que ne l'a fait la Cour d'Appel le passage du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'effet qu'un appareil sonore \"ne peut \u00eatre mis en usage que comme signal de danger\". L'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 sous l'impression que c'\u00e9tait le seul cas o\u00f9 un automobiliste devait se servir de l'appareil sonore. Or, l'article 36 (4) dit en toutes lettres, qu'il doit \u00e9galement s'en servir pour avertir lorsqu'il entend d\u00e9passer. Il s'en suivrait que l'honorable juge \u00e9tait d'avis que du moment que le conducteur de l'automobile du d\u00e9fendeur mettait an usage l'appareil sonore de sa voiture, il se rendait compte qu'il y avait danger, et que, d\u00e8s lors, il devait prendre les pr\u00e9cautions requises en pareil cas. Mais lorsque, \u00e0 cent pieds des bicycles, le conducteur a donn\u00e9 avec l'appareil sonore l'avertissement qui est prouv\u00e9, il ob\u00e9issait \u00e9videmment aux prescriptions de ce paragraphe 4 de l'article 36. Ce n'est que lorsqu'il fut \u00e0 vingt pieds du demandeur et que ce dernier fit le mouvement impr\u00e9visible dont parle la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, qu'il donne alors l'autre signal pr\u00e9vu par l'article 29 de la Loi, car alors le danger non seulement \u00e9tait \u00e9vident, mais comme le disent les juges de la Cour d'Appel, il \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable.\nJ'ai dit plus haut que la preuve d\u00e9montre que les deux avertissements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s, parce que l'on est en pr\u00e9sence de trois t\u00e9moins qui le jurent affirmativement, et, \u00e0 l'encontre de ces t\u00e9moignages, il n'y a que la preuve n\u00e9gative des deux compagnons \u00e0 l'effet qu'ils n'ont pas entendu. C'est une r\u00e8gle invariable que si la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins n'entre pas en doute, la preuve positive, en pareil cas, doit l'emporter sur la preuve n\u00e9gative. C'est ainsi que le d\u00e9cide la Cour Supr\u00eame dans la cause de Lafeunteum v. Beaudoin 9.\nIn the estimation of the value of evidence in ordinary cases, the testimony of a credible witness who swears positively to a fact should receive credit in preference to that of one who testifies to a negative. Je ne connais pas de d\u00e9cision rendue au contraire depuis ces derni\u00e8res cinquantes ann\u00e9es, et, d'ailleurs, nous sommes li\u00e9s par ce jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame.\nC'est avec raison que, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, l'on a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au jugement du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans l'affaire de Winnipeg Electric v. Geel 10, relativement au fardeau de la preuve dans l'application de l'article 53 de la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles. Ainsi que le dit fort bien M. le Juge Bissonnette, il ne faudrait pas transformer en pr\u00e9somption juris et de jure la pr\u00e9somption que cr\u00e9e cet article 53. Ce jugement 11 prononc\u00e9 par Lord Wright, donnait sur cette question les pr\u00e9ceptes les plus clairs que voici:\nIt is then for the defendant to establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury that the loss, damage or injury did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of himself or his servants.\nEt il est assez curieux de noter que Lord Wright, en se demandant de quelle mani\u00e8re le d\u00e9fendeur peut apporter une preuve disculpatoire, donne pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l'exemple d'un cas comme celui que nous avons dans la cause actuelle:\nby proof that the plaintiff was the author of his own injury; for example, by placing himself in the way of the defendant's vehicle in such a manner that the defendant could not reasonably avoid the impact.\nEt sur la question du fardeau de la preuve dans l'application de l'article 53:\nthe burden remains on the defendant until the very end of the case, when the question must be determined whether or not the defendant has sufficiently shown that he did not in fact cause the accident by negligence. If, on the whole of the evidence, the defendant establishes this to the saisfaction of the jury, he will be entitled to judgment: if however the issue is left in doubt or the evidence is balanced and even, the defendant will be held liable in virtue of the statutory onus, whereas in that event but for the statute the plaintiff would fail, because but for the statute the onus would be on him. A fortiori the defendant will be held liable, if the evidence actually establishes his negligence; No doubt the question of onus need not be considered, if at the end of the case the tribunal can come to a clear conclusion one way or the other, but it must remain to the end the determining factor unless the issue of negligence is cleared up beyond doubt to the satisfaction of the jury.\nC'est au cours de ce jugement que Lord Wright apporte l'approbation du Conseil Priv\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle telle que l'a expos\u00e9e M. le Juge Turgeon, parlant au sujet d'une l\u00e9gislation semblable \u00e0 celle de Qu\u00e9bec, dans une cause de la province de Saskatchewan, Stanley v. National Fruit Co. 12. Cette citation tir\u00e9e du jugement de M. le Juge Turgeon contient les passages suivants qui doivent \u00eatre retenus dans la pr\u00e9sente cause:\nBut if evidence for and against is given upon the points in question, the rule in favour of the preponderence of evidence should be applied as in ordinary civil cases; and the statutory onus will cease to be a factor in the case, if the Court can come to a definite conclusion one way or the other, after hearing and weighing the whole of the testimony. Nor does this statutory onus increase the degree of diligence required in the owner or driver of a motor vehicle \u2026 He must take proper precautions to guard against risks that might reasonably be anticipated to arise from time to time as he proceeds on his way. This degree of care, and nothing more, is required of him except in cases specially provided for, with which we are not concerned here.\nEt, en conclusion, Lord Wright ajoute dans cette cause de Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel 13:\nNor is it necessary further to emphasize that, in some running down cases under the statute, the defendant may discharge the burden, as already explained, by other evidence than that of inevitable accident.\nIl est tout naturel de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e9galement au jugement de cette Cour dans Charbonneau v. Dub\u00e9 14 car les faits de cette cause sont remarquablement semblables \u00e0 ceux du pr\u00e9sent appel. L\u00e0 comme ici, se posait la question de savoir si le chauffeur de l'automobile avait signal\u00e9 son approche au moyen de son klaxon. Le chauffeur avait jur\u00e9 qu'il avait fait fonctionner l'appareil sonore de la voiture, la derni\u00e8re fois \u00e0 environ 50 pieds de la bicyclette, et il \u00e9tait corrobor\u00e9 par deux t\u00e9moins qui \u00e9taient dans le camion avec lui. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le demandeur et son fils, L\u00e9o, disaient que le chauffeur n'avait pas klaxonn\u00e9, et surtout deux t\u00e9moins qui \u00e9taient sur les lieux et qui avaient vu l'accident d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent la m\u00eame chose. Sur cette preuve, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le chauffeur du camion n'avait pas signal\u00e9, bien qu'il tent\u00e2t de d\u00e9passer le bicycliste. Mais, \u00e0 la lecture de cette preuve, cette Cour en arriva \u00e0 la conclusion que ni le fils du demandeur, ni les deux autres t\u00e9moins avaient vraiment jur\u00e9 que le conducteur n'avait pas signal\u00e9, et qu'ils avaient simplement jur\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas entendu.\nSur une pareille preuve, la Cour Supr\u00eame 15 unanimement d\u00e9cida que la preuve positive du chauffeur du camion et de ses deux compagnons devait l'emporter sur celle des t\u00e9moins qui se contentaient de dire qu'ils n'avaient pas entendu.\nEn plus, dans la cause de Charbonneau v. Dub\u00e9 16, non seulement le demandeur-cycliste avait r\u00e9ussi devant le juge du proc\u00e8s, mais la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel avait confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, tout en d\u00e9clarant qu'il y avait eu n\u00e9gligence contributoire et en r\u00e9duisant, en cons\u00e9quence, le montant des dommages accord\u00e9 au demandeur. Cependant, la Cour Supr\u00eame fut d'avis que l'action devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et que l'appel devait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens, dans toutes les Cours.\nIci, la situation de l'appelant est moins favorable, car tout en ayant vu maintenir son action par la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, au moins pour la moiti\u00e9 de sa r\u00e9clamation, \"vu la faute contributive des parties\", la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a rejet\u00e9 l'action du demandeur, ainsi qu'il est dit plus haut, \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de quatre des juges de cette Cour.\nC'est dans cet \u00e9tat que la cause nous est maintenant soumise, et je suis incapable de d\u00e9couvrir en quoi la situation de l'appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire peut \u00eatre accueillie avec plus de faveur que celle du bicycliste dans l'affaire de Charbonneau v. Dub\u00e9. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, \u00e0 mon avis, le cas de Charbonneau \u00e9tait vraiment plus favorable que celui de Beaudin en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nJe consid\u00e8re que d\u00e9cider l'appel actuel d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente de celle que nous avons suivie dans la cause de Charbonneau v. Dub\u00e9 aurait pour effet de rendre deux jugements contradictoires.\nIl ne me reste plus qu'un dernier point \u00e0 signaler. Le procureur du demandeur-appelant a cit\u00e9 un jugement dans une cause de Moreau v. Thibault rapport\u00e9e au vol. de 1945 des Rapports Judiciaires Officiels de Qu\u00e9bec, C.S., p. 128, o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles, article 36, paragraphe 1, est \u00e0 l'effet que l'automobiliste qui rencontre par croisement une bicyclette doit laisser une distance d'au moins huit pieds entre l'automobile et la bicyclette, et que cette r\u00e8gle s'impose \u00e0 fortiori lorsqu'il s'agit d'un d\u00e9passement, vu qu'alors le bicycliste ne peut se rendre compte aussi bien du danger que s'il s'agit d'une voiture venant \u00e0 sa rencontre. Il me semble que pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pareille pr\u00e9tention de la part de l'appelant, il suffit de citer l'article de la Loi auquel il r\u00e9f\u00e8re:\n(36-1) Toute personne conduisant un v\u00e9hicule ou un animal sur un chemin public doit, quand c'est possible, tenir le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin \u00e0 sa droite, et laisser libre \u00e0 sa gauche le plus large espace possible, et au moins la moiti\u00e9 du chemin quand elle croise un autre v\u00e9hicule ou un troupeau d'animaux, ou, au moins huit pieds quand elle croise un pi\u00e9ton, un cycle ou un animal isol\u00e9.\nRemarquons bien le texte de cet article. Tout d'abord, il se lit: \"laisser libre \u00e0 sa gauche le plus large espace possible\". L'article dit: \"\u00e0 sa gauche;\" et si l'on tient compte des prescriptions de la loi, cela ne peut s'entendre que d'un croisement, au cours duquel le v\u00e9hicule ou l'animal qui est rencontr\u00e9 est toujours \u00e0 la gauche de l'automobiliste, tandis que s'il s'agissait d'un d\u00e9passement, il faudrait que l'article se lut: \"\u00e0 sa droite.\"\nPuis, si l'on en vient \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re partie de l'article: \"et au moins la moiti\u00e9 du chemin quand elle croise un pi\u00e9ton, un cycle ou un animal isol\u00e9\", le mot qui est employ\u00e9 est \"croise\" et l'on ne peut donc appliquer cette prescription au cas d'un d\u00e9passement. Mais, en plus, il est \u00e9vident que l'article exige d'une personne conduisant un v\u00e9hicule sur un chemin public, quand c'est possible, de laisser \u00e0 sa gauche, le plus large espace possible, et au moins la moiti\u00e9 du chemin quand elle croise un autre v\u00e9hicule ou un troupeau d'animaux, ou, au moins huit pieds quand elle croise un pi\u00e9ton, un cycle ou un animal isol\u00e9. Cela ne signifie pas (ce qui, je le dis en tout respect, serait absurde) que l'automobiliste doit laisser une distance d'au moins huit pieds entre son automobile et la bicyclette, mais que si il croise un pi\u00e9ton, un cycle ou un animal isol\u00e9, il doit lui conc\u00e9der au moins huit pieds du chemin du c\u00f4t\u00e9 o\u00f9 ce pi\u00e9ton, ce cycle ou cet animal se trouve.\nEn d'autres termes, si le chemin a par exemple 18 pieds de largeur, l'automobile peut occuper les dix pieds qui se trouvent \u00e0 la gauche du chemin, pourvu qu'elle laisse huit pieds du chemin au pi\u00e9ton, au cycle ou \u00e0 cet animal.\nNous sommes loin de compte, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant, qu'il faille une distance d'au moins huit pieds entre l'automobile et le pi\u00e9ton, le cycle ou l'animal. Une loi \u00e0 cet effet serait tout simplement impossibe et impraticable. Pour ces raisons, je ne puis d\u00e9couvrir aucun motif pour infirmer le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, et je suis d'avis que l'appel du demandeur doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts of this controversy are simple and few. On Sunday morning, September 3, 1944 the appellant aged forty and a brother-in-law of thirty-two, spending the day in the country, set out westerly for a short bicycle ride before dinner. The day was fine with a slight breeze facing them, the road was paved over a width of about 20'6\" and was straight for any distance material here, there was no other traffic in sight and very little at that time moving, and the two men were riding close to the right-hand side, one behind the other at a distance of twenty feet or so. Reaching a point opposite a house, the appellant who was ahead swung to the left intending to enter the roadway leading to it. At that moment the automobile of the respondent, who was engrossed in a document, driven by his 16-year-old son and carrying himself and two other younger sons, running between 40 and 45 miles an hour, passed the rear bicycle and in a moment struck the other with the right end of the front bumper just about the center of the pavement. No sound of the horn had been heard by either bicyclist. The tracks showed that just before the collision the auto had been moving angularly to the south side of the road and it came to a stop off the pavement after having dragged the bicycle about forty feet. The appellant was knocked twenty-five feet across the road and seriously injured. There were marks on the pavement indicating an application of the brakes seventeen feet before the impact, but the distance from the easterly end of these marks to the northerly edge of the pavement does not clearly appear.\nThe son claims that he was driving near the center of the highway and swerved to the left to pass the bicycles. It is not suggested that they were more than three or four feet from the northerly edge of the pavement and if the automobile had been straddling the center the right side would be at least 2\u00bd to the north of it. Taking the handle bars into account, the bicycles may have occupied as much as four feet, leaving a distance of approximately 3\u00bd between them and the automobile. The rear bicyclist, who gave his evidence very frankly, as in fact all the witnesses appear to have done, says the automobile seemed to sweep by him with a blast of air between three and four feet away; and on the best consideration I can give to the evidence I conclude that that was about the distance.\nThe judgment in the Court of King's Bench 17 more or less accepts the statement that the horn was sounded when the automobile was from 100 to 125' behind the bicycles. Admittedly moving at least sixty feet a second, it is obvious that considering its speed and position on the highway, the absence of traffic and the quiet conditions, the distance of 125' would be traversed in sounding a reasonable signal; and those factors would be most pertinent also to the point at which the warning would be commenced. So far from this it is claimed that a second signal was given when the bicycle was seen to turn out. I cannot accept this evidence of distance and it leaves me, as it left the trial judge, in doubt of the horn having been sounded at all. I should say that as an ordinary precaution a prudent driver in such circumstances, particularly of the speed and passing space, could and would effectually bring the warning home to the riders. Both of them had good hearing and the conditions, apart from the slight breeze, were favourable to an effective signal if one had been given. Although, as it was found by the trial judge and as I will take it, the appellant should have looked back or indicated his intention to turn, it was equally, if not more, important that the driver should have followed the course of a prudent man. That a bicyclist on such a day and in such conditions might have acted on the assumption, in the absence of a warning, that no automobile was within range, is, apart from the question of his negligence in so doing, not beyond the range of reasonable anticipation a prudent man would foresee. The person behind has the whole situation ahead of him; he sees the actual behaviour of the person ahead as well as the approaching danger; and that, in the surroundings here, the signal was not heard indicates that if given it was not sufficient, and calls for evidence to justify the speed and position more precise and weighty than was presented. It must not be forgotten that bicyclists are still lawfully on the highway, and their likely conduct must be interpreted in the prevailing conditions. On a little used back road it would be absurd to go through motions which are absolute on a busy city street; and whether on a highway through the countryside at a time when all is quiet and traffic virtually absent, a prudent man on a bicycle might not feel it to be somewhat ridiculous either to give a hand signal or to look around before changing his course, is a question of circumstances and of degree. The relations between the two parties are interlaced: and here the trial judge has found the appellant to have contributed to the accident.\nBut these matters have a bearing on the conduct of the driver behind. When it is considered what a slight and cheap precaution, while moving at such speed, is needed to remove all possibility of danger, such as a signal lengthened to three, four or even five seconds, carried up, if necessary, to a point beyond all possibility of not being heard, the complaint that no indication of turning has been given must be received with qualification. It may be that bicycles on a paved highway present risks that are an annoyance to people in a hurry in automobiles; but so long as they are not banned, the danger of serious injury to those using them must be recognized and the relatively trivial measures of warning and safely exacted.\nThe respondent was bound under the statute to satisfy the Court that he was not guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, and I agree with the trial judge and with St. Jacques, J.A. that he has not met that burden.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) in this action asks damages suffered when the bicycle upon which he was riding was struck by respondent's (defendant's) automobile. The appellant and his brother-in-law were riding their respective bicycles westward on the main highway along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River a few miles west of Ste. Anne de la Pocati\u00e8re about noon on Sunday, September 3, 1944. It was a clear day with a light wind from the west. The road, about 20 feet in width, was paved and the portion here in question level and straight. The appellant was travelling at 3-4 m.p.h. and about 10-12 feet in front of his brother-in-law. Both bicycles were close to the north side of the pavement, the estimates varying from 2 to 4 feet. The appellant, with the intention of crossing the road, suddenly turned to the south (his left) when at or near the center of the road he was struck by respondent's automobile also proceeding in a westerly direction.\nRespondent was a passenger in his automobile which at the time was driven by his son Guy, age 17. Guy saw the two bicycles in front of him and when about 100-125 feet east of them he sounded his horn, turned toward the left side of the road but maintained his speed of 40-45 m.p.h. until within about 20 feet of the bicycles he saw appellant suddenly and without signal turn toward the center of the road. Guy applied his brakes and again sounded his horn but was unable to avoid a collision.\nThe trial judge found both parties equally negligent. His findings are not based upon any question of credibility. He apparently concluded that all the witnesses were truthfully deposing to the facts as they remembered them. The appellant did not appeal but the respondent's appeal to the Court of King's Bench in Quebec 18 was allowed and the appellant's negligence held to be the sole cause of the collision. Mr. Justice St. Jacques dissenting would have affirmed the judgment at trial. The appellant in this appeal asks that the judgment of the learned trial judge holding the parties equally responsible for the collision be restored.\nRespondent's automobile being in operation on a public highway and having struck and injured the appellant the law in Quebec places the onus upon respondent to prove that the collision was not caused by his negligence or reprehensible conduct.\n53. (2) Quand un v\u00e9hicule automobile cause une perte ou un dommage \u00e0 quelque personne dans un chemin public, le fardeau de la preuve que cette perte ou ce dommage n'est pas d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence ou \u00e0 la conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du propri\u00e9taire ou de la personne qui conduit ce v\u00e9hicule automobile, incombe au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 la personne qui conduit le v\u00e9hicule automobile. The respondent's contention is that under the circumstances, a clear day, a dry paved road 20 feet in width, two bicycles in their proper places on the road proceeding without any indication of change in position and no other traffic nearby, the driver, having sounded his horn and turned slightly to the left, was justified in assuming that the bicycles would continue in that position and in maintaining his speed of 40-45 m.p.h. as he passed them. The immediate difficulty respondent encounters in maintaining this position is that the learned trial judge did not find that in sounding his horn the driver exercised reasonable care. Sec. 36(4) of the Motor Vehicles Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 142, provides:\n36. (4) When preparing to pass, the person driving a motor vehicle shall, before bearing to the left, give warning of his intention to do so, and make sure that it is possible to pass without any risk of a collision with a vehicle or an animal coming in an opposite direction. The warning shall be given by means of the sounding device.\nThe driver of the respondent's automobile under this section was required to \"give warning of his intention\" to pass by means of a sounding device. Under sec. 29(1) every motor vehicle operated on the highway \"must \u2026 be provided with a horn or other sounding device sufficient in capacity to be heard at a distance of two hundred feet\". The statute requires the driver of the forward vehicle upon hearing the warning to move toward the right, or if there, remain in that position until the passing is effected. The warning must be given at such a distance and in such a manner that the party ahead actually hears or ought to hear it. The evidence of the driver, Guy Choquette, and his brother's upon this point is as follows. Guy Choquette deposed:\nQ. Quelle sorte de coup de klaxon avez-vous donn\u00e9? Un coup ordinaire? Un petit coup? Ou un klaxonnement prolong\u00e9?\nR. Je ne pourrais pas dire au juste, l\u00e0\u2026 naturellement. Habituellement je donne toujours un coup prolong\u00e9; je ne donne jamais des petits coups.\nAs to how he proceeded just prior to the collision he deposed:\nR. Oui. J'ai klaxonn\u00e9 justement pour les avertir, d'ailleurs, c'est toujours ce que je fais quand je veux d\u00e9passer des cyclistes ou des pi\u00e9tons; j'ai klaxonn\u00e9 et j'ai continu\u00e9 comme \u00e7a, tranquillement, comme si rien n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, comme ant\u00e9rieurement\u2026 Au milieu de la route, j'allais \u00e0 une vitesse de quarante (40), quarante-cinq (45) milles \u00e0 l'heure, sur la recommandation de mon p\u00e8re. Je regardais le compteur et \u00e7a ne marquait pas plus de quarante (40), quarante-cinq (45) milles \u00e0 l'heure; j'ai klaxonn\u00e9 \u00e0 environ cent (100), cent vingt-cinq (125) pieds, la premi\u00e8re fois; ensuite j'ai pass\u00e9 comme \u00e7a. Je me suis aper\u00e7u que le cycliste qui \u00e9tait en avant de l'autre\u2014je ne me rappelle pas quelle distance s\u00e9parait les deux,\u2014a tourn\u00e9 devant moi quand j'\u00e9tais \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 une vingtaine de pieds. J'ai appliqu\u00e9 les freins et j'ai klaxonn\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps, mais l'auto avait assez d'\u00e9lan pour aller frapper\u2026 la victime, enfin.\nMarc Choquette, a brother of Guy, age 15, was seated in the back seat. When his brother sounded the horn for the first time he looked up but could not say at what distance they were from the bicycles but thought it was a sufficient distance to advise them. He stated that before the accident his brother was driving in the middle of the road and when he sounded his horn the first time he continued straight, that when he passed the first bicycle he was in the centre of the road. He was seated on the rear left-hand side and said he had a very good view.\nAuguste Choquette, age 12, also seated in the back seat, deposed:\nR. Je sais que la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il a klaxonn\u00e9, juste un petit coup comme \u00e7a, je ne me suis pas \u00e9nerv\u00e9. Dans un voyage, \u00e7a arrive plusieurs fois, \u00e7a. Un peu plus loin, \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 un grand coup de klaxon. Je me suis lev\u00e9 la t\u00eate et, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 une longueur d'auto, il y avait un cycliste qui avait la t\u00eate tourn\u00e9e vers nous autres.\nQ. Sais-tu \u00e0 quelle distance la machine \u00e9tait lorsque ton fr\u00e8re \u00e0 klaxonn\u00e9, la premi\u00e8re fois?\nR. Non. L\u00e0, je ne m'en rappelle plus du tout.\nThat the driver saw the bicycles is clear. As to how he sounded his horn upon his own evidence is a matter of conjecture, but to Auguste it was \"juste un petit coup comme \u00e7a\". The learned trial judge did not find that the horn had been properly sounded and no doubt in appreciation of its insufficiency he referred to it as \"un signal de klaxon, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce,\" or \"comme le pr\u00e9tend le fils du d\u00e9fendeur,\" or again, \"comme il le pr\u00e9tend\". That the horn was not sounded with sufficient strength appears to be the most probable explanation of the fact that upon a clear day with nothing present to interfere with a person's hearing or to attract one's attention neither of the two men riding the bicycles heard the sound of the horn. Moreover, the learned trial judge did not find that it was sufficient under the circumstances for the driver to sound the horn but once before he saw the appellant turn. He was driving upon a rural highway at a time when no other traffic was sufficiently near to be a factor. He had received no intimation from either of the bicyclists that they had heard the horn. Under these circumstances, to continue as he said he did, without further sounding his horn, at a speed of 40-45 m.p.h., even admitting that he turned slightly to the left, would appear, in the absence of an express finding of fact to the contrary, not to be exercising reasonable care, nor to be sufficient to discharge the onus placed upon the respondent under sec. 53 (2). His own statement is indicative:\n\u2026j'ai klaxonn\u00e9 et j'ai continu\u00e9 comme \u00e7a, tranquillement, comme si rien n'\u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, comme ant\u00e9rieurement.\nDionne, riding the second bicycle, asked when he had seen the automobile, replied:\nAu moment o\u00f9 elle me d\u00e9passait; le vent qu'elle m'a caus\u00e9, vu qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de moi, \u00e7a m'a effray\u00e9 et j'ai vir\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00eate \u00e0 gauche et j'ai vu l'auto.\nThe learned trial judge would have this and other evidence in mind when he stated:\nUn signal de klaxon, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, ne suffit pas pour permettre au chauffeur de continuer sa course \u00e0 une vitesse de quarante \u00e0 quarante-cinq milles \u00e0 l'heure et de laisser ainsi le risque d'un accident \u00e0 celui pour qui le signal a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\nand when he further stated:\nLa grande prudence qu'exige la circulation ne se limite pas \u00e0 de simples signaux et le fait du d\u00e9fendeur d'en avoir donn\u00e9 un, comme il le pr\u00e9tend, n'est pas suffisant pour le justifier et d\u00e9gager sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nThe appellant and respondent's driver were each of them under a duty to use' due care and both failed to do so. If the appellant had signalled or if the respondent's driver had reasonably sounded his horn, we are asked by the respective parties, and with some reason, to say that the collision would have been avoided. It seems under these circumstances rather that these respective failures constituted negligent conduct which continued to the moment of impact by virtue of which both parties contributed directly to the cause of the collision.\nThese factors distinguish this case from Charbonneau v. Dub\u00e9 19, where at p. 85 Mr. Justice Taschereau on behalf of the Court speaks as follows:\nLe conducteur conduisait avec prudence, \u00e0 une vitesse raisonnable; ses phares \u00e9taient allum\u00e9s, et il a signal\u00e9 son approche \u00e0 trois ou quatre reprises, le dernier signal \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 alors qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 35 pieds de la victime. Je ne puis me convaincre qu'il ait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses devoirs de chauffeur prudent, parce qu'il n'aurait pas signal\u00e9 davantage, comme le M reproche la Cour d'Appel.\nThis quotation emphasizes the important factors that are absent in the case at bar\u2014reasonable speed and a signal repeated three or four times.\nIn The King v. Anderson 20, the by-law of the City of Vancouver, unlike the Quebec statute, provided only that the horn should be sounded \"whenever it is reasonably necessary,\" and in that respect the cases are quite different.\nThe failure of the driver to give the warning in a reasonable manner as required by sec. 36(4), and the maintenance of his speed at 40-45 m.p.h. under the circumstances do not support the conclusion that the respondent has discharged the statutory onus imposed upon him by sec. 53(2).\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the \"learned trial judge restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bernier & Bernier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gagnon & de Billy.\n1 Q.R.

The Minister of National Revenue decided that the cigarettes and the automobile should be forfeited but his decision was reversed by the Exchequer Court. Held: Taschereau J. dissenting, that as the evidence established that respondent was guilty of a number of breaches of the Customs Act, any one of which was sufficient to warrant the seizure and forfeiture, his acquittal by a jury on a charge of unlawfully importing nor the fact that there had been no \"smuggling\" did not invalidate the seizure nor affect the right of forfeiture. Section 177 of the Customs Act considered.\nPer Taschereau J. (dissenting): The evidence shows that respondent did not smuggle the cigarettes, and as the Court has no jurisdiction to go beyond the reasons given by the Minister in the notice under sec. 172, it cannot therefore inquire whether he committed other infractions justifying the seizure.\nAPPEAL, ex parte, by the Crown from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Thorson J., reversing the decision of the Minister of National Revenue that respondent's automobile and goods be forfeited for breach of the Customs Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe, K.C. and J. Desrochers for the appellant.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014On November 19, 1945, the respondent, with his wife and his brother, went to Lewiston in the United States where he purchased 159,600 American cigarettes which he brought in his automobile on his return to Canada on November 20th. He arrived at the Customs Office at Armstrong, which is ten miles inside the border, about one o'clock in the morning of a stormy night. He stopped his automobile near the office. He entered the office and told Mr. Gosselin, one of the customs officers whom he knew, that he had returned from a trip to the United States and that he had brought in his automobile a small .22 rifle which he had purchased. When Mr. Gosselin, and also Mr. Poulin, another customs officer, asked him if he had any merchandise to declare, he replied that he had nothing else. Officer Poulin, who was on duty that evening, went out from the office to make an inspection of the automobile and, some minutes later, returned to the office saying to Gosselin that the automobile was full of cigarettes and that he was going to find a flashlight. Gosselin immediately went out of the office and the respondent followed him. Gosselin says that the respondent and his brother offered him $100 if he would let them proceed, but the brother and also the respondent's wife denied any such promise and Poulin says he did not hear it.\nWhen Poulin went out the first time he had seen three cartons of cigarettes on the front seat and when he made a more complete inspection he found that the luggage compartment of the automobile and the rear seat were full of cigarettes. The cigarettes were unloaded from the automobile and taken into the office and, when Gosselin told the respondent that the duty would be about $2,600, the respondent said that that was too much and that he could not pay it and asked permision to take the cigarettes and return to the store in the United States where he had bought them, but he was refused permission to do this. The officers detained the cigarettes, but because it was night and raining they permitted the respondent to continue his trip to St. Georges de Beauce with his wife and brother on condition that he return to the office the next day to deliver his automobile. When he did not return the officers caused the automobile to be seized.\nThe respondent admitted that, when questioned in the Customs Office as to whether he had any other goods to declare, he did declare that he had no other goods, but says he did so because there were other people in the Customs Office and he did not wish to declare his cigarettes in front of them, but he knew that the officer would see the cigarettes. It is to be noted that, while the respondent contends that he had understood that the customs duty would be thirty-five per cent of the value of the cigarettes and states that he paid about $1,100 for the cigarettes, nevertheless he did not have with him even $100 at the time he reported to the Customs Office. In addition, it is to be noted that he stopped at the office very late at night when it was dark and stormy, that he stopped a short distance away from the Customs Office and that the cigarettes were covered with two coats.\nOn December 4, 1945, a notice was given on behalf of the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise to the respondent that the cigarettes and automobile, valued at $4,910, had been seized and that he was charged with smuggling the cigarettes into Canada and with using the automobile for such illegal importation. The notice gave the respondent thirty days within which to submit evidence to refute this charge.\nOn July 3, 1946, the Minister of National Revenue rendered a decision that the cigarettes and automobile be forfeited, and, on July 4, 1946, notice was given to the respondent's solicitor of the Minister's decision.\nOn July 3, 1947, the Minister of National Revenue referred the respondent's claim to the Exchequer Court of Canada for adjudication under section 176 of the Customs Act.\nThe solicitors for the claimant and the respondent agreed, inter alia, that the evidence given at a trial of the respondent on a charge laid against him under the Customs Act in respect of the alleged illegal importation should be used instead of taking evidence in the Exchequer Court, and, further, that the respondent had been found not guilty by a jury of such charge and that there had been no appeal from that verdict.\nThe case came on for hearing before the learned President of the Exchequer Court at Quebec 2 on January 20, 1948, and on March 9, 1948, he gave judgment whereby it was adjudged that the respondent's automobile and certain goods which had been seized from him should be returned to him upon payment by him of the customs duty, and further that he was entitled to his costs.\nThe learned President held that the respondent's acquittal by the jury on the criminal charge did not make the question of whether the cigarettes were illegally imported res adjudicata. He held, however, that the proof showed that the respondent had not smuggled the cigarettes into Canada and that the forfeiture could not be upheld by reason of any other breach of the Customs Act because no other breach had been specified in the notice of December 4, 1945, to the respondent. The Minister of National Revenue, in the name of His Majesty the King, now appeals from that judgment.\nThe Customs Seizure Report by Officer Poulin was to the effect that the respondent was \"trying to import into Canada 159,600 cigarettes\". The notice to the respondent stated that \"les dites cigarettes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es en contrebande au Canada et que la dite automobile a servi \u00e0 cette importation ill\u00e9gale\".\nAfter he received such notice the respondent, through his solicitor, sent to Mr. Hicklin, Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs, an affidavit stating that he never had any intention of defrauding the customs and that he had imported these cigarettes with the intention of paying thirty-five per cent of their value at the customs office, but that, when he found several persons playing cards in the office, he felt that he would not make the declaration because there were too many people there but that he would wait until the officer in charge had gone out of the office. However, he states, he had told his brother and his wife, who were with him, to tell the officer, when he came to the automobile, that the goods were cigarettes and, as a matter of fact, when Officer Poulin came out his brother 'informed him that there were cigarettes in the automobile. The affidavit continues to state that when Poulin came out of the office he asked the respondent how many cigarettes he had and that he told Poulin immediately that all the goods in his car were cigarettes, that he had stopped at the office to pay the customs duty, upon which Poulin told him that they were going to unload them, which was done. Gosselin then informed the respondent that it would cost him $3.31 duty on each carton. The respondent answered: \"You must be mistaken, because they told me here that the duty was only thirty-five per cent\", to which the officer replied that thirty-five per cent represented the duty on other goods but not on cigarettes. Then, it is stated, the respondent asked the officer to give him back the cigarettes as he could not pay such a duty and that he would return them to the store where he had purchased them in the United States. This was refused on the ground that it was too late, although the cigarettes had not yet been seized, but the respondent stated that he said that it was his right to have them returned to him if he did not decide to import them into Canada. It was after that that they were declared seized and the officer kept the cigarettes. He was, however, allowed to pursue his trip to St. Georges de Beauce in his automobile and it was three days after these incidents that one Constable Charron, of the R.C.M.P., came to seize the automobile at St. Georges. The respondent's contention was that the automobile could not be seized three days after his return to his home at a time when none of the goods remained in the car, and, moreover, that the automobile was not subject to seizure because at the time he went through customs he had declared the goods in his possession. He denied that the cigarettes had been smuggled and that the automobile had been used for that purpose.\nIn answer to the affidavit Officer Poulin declared that the way the respondent acted it looked very much as if he wanted to avoid the duties and taxes on the cigarettes. He also denied the respondent's statement that he had been asked about the rate of duty on cigarettes or on any other goods. The declaration that the cigarettes were in the car only came after Poulin had seen them and when there was nothing else that the respondent could say. Poulin stated that as he went to the automobile the respondent did not say one word to him, but that his wife then declared that \"they were going to be ruined\". He states that he seized the cigarettes because the respondent refused to declare the same when asked and he only let him proceed in his automobile because it was one o'clock in the morning, it was raining and there was hardly any other means for him to go home, and, besides, he knew that he could get the automobile at any time afterwards. Poulin stated as a positive fact that the respondent never declared his cigarettes to him when asked and, therefore, the automobile was liable to seizure.\nThe statement of Officer Poulin is corroborated by Officer Gosselin.\nHaving the respondent's affidavit and the statements of the two Customs Officers, the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue decided that the cigarettes should be seized for having been smuggled into Canada and the automobile for having been used therein. He went over the several reports sent to him and concluded that while there were other factors which point towards deliberate intent to smuggle these cigarettes on which duty and taxes exigible were $2,636.20, the mere failure to declare them was sufficient and the cigarettes and the automobile should be declared forfeited. His recommendation was to that effect and the respondent was notified accordingly.\nThe respondent's solicitor wrote several letters to the Department asking that the decision on the confiscation should be stayed until the criminal charge against the respondent had been disposed of, but he was told by the Department that the criminal charge was an entirely distinct matter from the seizure and confiscation of the goods and automobile.\nOn the 24th of October, 1946, the respondent was acquitted of the criminal charge by a jury, and on the 19th of August, 1947, the respondent brought the matter before the Exchequer Court of Canada 3, with the result already mentioned.\nThe charge before the Criminal Court was that on November 20, 1945, without any legitimate excuse, the respondent had in his possession goods illegally carried into Canada, to wit, 159,600 American cigarettes of dutiable value of more than $200, and on which the duty exigible had not been paid, contrary to section 217(3) of the Customs Act.\nThe evidence of Officer Gosselin was very clear. He said that the respondent came into the Customs Office and declared that he had a rifle which he was bringing from the United States. Gosselin told him that he would have to leave it at the office until he got a permit from the Department to import it. He then asked him whether he was importing other goods and, if he had any, to declare them. The respondent's answer was that he had nothing except a few small parcels of goods purchased in 5, 10 and 15 cent stores of a value of a few dollars. Gosselin repeated the question whether he had anything else, and the answer was \"No, sir\". Gosselin asked him what amount he had spent in the United States and the respondent's answer was \"Almost nothing, perhaps $15, including the rifle.\" It was then that Officer Poulin said that he would go and inspect the automobile.\nWhen Poulin discovered the cigarettes the respondent and his brother told Gosselin: \"Don't be a fool, let us pass, you know us.\" Gosselin replied \"It is too late, I cannot let you pass; you ought to have declared that you were bringing cigarettes\"; and the respondent told him \"We will pay you, we will give you $100.\"\nOfficer Poulin, who was present with Gosselin in the Customs Office, corroborates Gosselin word for word, except that he did not hear the offer of $100.\nImmigration Inspector Caron was also in the Customs Office when the respondent appeared there on the 20th of November, 1945. He heard the questions put to the respondent and the latter's reply that he had with him a rifle and that his wife had some inconsequential things. This last answer of the respondent came when Officer Gosselin asked him if he had brought any other goods with him. Shortly afterwards the cartons of cigarettes were brought into the office. Subsequent to this the respondent told Caron that he had made \"une fausse man\u0153uvre\" and that he would have to take the consequences.\nIt was correctly decided in the Exchequer Court 4 that the acquittal of the respondent in the Criminal Court could not be invoked by him in the present case. That is in accordance with the judgment of this Court in La Fonci\u00e8re Compagnie d'Assurance de France v. Perras et al and Daoust 5.\nIt was, therefore, necessary for the case to be tried de novo absolutely as if no criminal charge had been brought against the respondent.\nThe respondent, being in possession, without lawful excuse, of goods which were dutiable and whereon the duties lawfully payable had not been paid, had the burden of proving any lawful excuse which he might invoke; and, unless he succeeded in this proof, the goods, according to the law, \"shall be seized and forfeited without power of remission.\" (Customs Act, sec. 217(1) and sec. 262(2).\nIn the present case the following sections of the Customs Act are pertinent:\u2014\nSec. 2, s.s. (2). All the expressions and provisions of this Act, or of any law relating to the Customs, shall receive such fair and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the protection of the revenue and the attainment of the purpose for which this Act or such law was 'made, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nSec. 2, s.s. (o). \"Seized and forfeited\", \"liable to forfeiture\", or \"subject to forfeiture\", or any other expression which might of itself imply that some act subsequent to the commission of the offence is necessary to work the forfeiture, shall not be construed as rendering any such subsequent act necessary, but the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by the commission of the offence, in respect of which the penalty or forfeiture is imposed.\nSec. 17. No goods shall be imported into Canada in any vehicle, ' other than a railway carriage, or on the person, between sunset and sunrise of any day, or at any time on a Sunday or a statutory holiday, except under a written permit from a collector, and under the supervision of an officer.\nSec. 18 (a). The person in charge of any vehicle other than a railway carriage, arriving by land at any place in Canada and containing goods, whether any duty is payable on such goods or not, shall come to the Custom-house nearest to the point at which he crossed the frontier line, or to the station of the office nearest to such point, if such station is nearer thereto than any Custom-house, before unloading or in any manner disposing of the same, and there make a report in writing to the collector or proper officer, stating the contents of each and every package and parcel of such goods and the quantities and values of the same.\nSec. 18 (2). Such person shall also then truly answer all questions respecting such goods or packages, and the vehicle, fittings, furnishings and appurtenances and animals, and the harness or tackle appertaining thereto, as the said collector or proper officer requires of him, and shall then and there make due entry of the same, in accordance with the law in that behalf.\nSec. 177. On any reference of any such matter by the Minister of the court, the court shall hear and consider such matter upon the papers and evidence referred and upon any further evidence which, under the direction of the court, the owner or claimant of the thing seized or detained, or the person alleged to have incurred the penalty, or the Crown, produces, and the court shall decide according to the right of the matter.\nSec. 190. (a) Any vehicle containing goods, other than a railway carriage, arriving by land at any place in Canada, whether any duty is payable or not;\n(c) Any goods brought into Canada in the charge or custody of any person arriving in Canada on foot or otherwise shall be forfeited and may be seized and dealt with accordingly, if before unloading or in any manner disposing of any such vehicle or goods, the person in charge does not\n(a) come to the Custom-house nearest to the point at which he crossed the frontier line, or to the station of the officer nearest to such point, if such station is nearer thereto than any Customhouse, and there make a report in writing to the collector or proper officer, stating the contents of each and every package and parcel of such goods and the quantities and values of the same; and\n(b) then truly answer all such questions respecting such goods or packages, and the vehicle, fittings, furnishings and appurtenances appertaining thereto, as the said collector or proper officer requires of him; and\n(c) then and there make due entry of the same in accordance with the law in that behalf. Sec. 193. (1) All vessels, with the guns, tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, and all vehicles, harness, tackle, horses and cattle made use of in the importation or unshipping or landing or removal or subsequent transportation of any goods liable to forfeiture under this Act, shall be seized and forfeited.\nSec. 197. If any goods entered or attempted to be passed through the Customs are found which do not correspond with the goods described in the invoice or entry, such goods may be seized and forfeited.\nSec. 203. If any person\n(a) smuggles, or clandestinely introduces into Canada any goods subject to duty under the value for duty of two hundred dollars;\n(b) makes out or passes or attempts to pass through the Custom-house, any false, forged or fraudulent invoice of any goods of whatever value; or\n(c) in any way attempts to defraud the revenue by avoiding the payment of the duty or any part of the duty on any goods of whatever value;\nsuch goods if found shall be seized and forfeited, or if not found but the value thereof has been ascertained, the person so offending shall forfeit the value thereof as ascertained, such forfeiture to be without power of remission in cases of offences under paragraph (a) of this subsection.\n3. Every one who smuggles or clandestinely introduces into Canada any goods subject to duty of the value for duty of two hundred dollars or over is guilty of an indictable offence and liable on conviction, in addition to any other penalty to which he is subject for any such offence, to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years and not less than one year, or to both fine and imprisonment, and such goods if found shall be seized and forfeited without power of remission, or if not found but the value thereof has been ascertained, the person so offending shall forfeit without power of remission the value thereof as ascertained.\nSec. 245. All goods shipped or unshipped, imported or exported, carried or conveyed, contrary to this Act, or to any regulation made by the. Governor in Council, and all goods or vehicles, and all vessels under the value of four hundred dollars, with regard to which the requirements of this Act or any such regulation have not been complied with, shall be forfeited and may be seized.\nSec. 253. Any person required by this Act, or by any other law, to answer questions put to him by any officer, who refuses to answer or does not truly answer such questions, shall, in addition to any other penalty or punishment to which he is liable, incur a penalty of four hundred dollars.\nWithout hesitation, I am of opinion that not only has the respondent not succeeded in proving that he had a lawful excuse to have in his possession the goods which were dutiable and on which duties lawfully payable had not been paid, and that he was entitled to recover the goods and the automobile which were seized, but the evidence on behalf of the Crown is conclusive that the respondent violated the Customs Act and that the cigarettes and the automobile were properly and legally seized and declared forfeited.\nThe respondent may truly be said to have violated almost all the sections of the Act applying in the circumstances which have been established in evidence. He was importing the cigarettes at a time when he could not do so except under a written permit from a collector and under the supervision of an officer. In the Custom-office he declared only the rifle which he had in his possession and he failed to declare the cigarettes; and, moreover, when questioned as to whether he had any other goods in his possession, he declared positively that he had none, contrary to s.s. 2 of sec. 18. It was, therefore, more than a failure to declare the cigarettes; it was an untrue answer, contrary to sec. 253, and a positive act for the purpose of defrauding the government, contrary to sec. 203 and its subsections. At that very moment the respondent had the cigarettes in his 'possession and concealed them and acted in a way so that the duties lawfully payable on the goods should not be paid, contrary to sec. 217 of the Act. Undoubtedly he was contravening sec. 245 of the Act in carrying and conveying the cigarettes without complying with the requirements of the Act. Under every one of these sections the cigarettes and automobile were liable to seizure and forfeiture.\nReferring again to subsection (o) of section 2, the words \"seized and forfeited\", \"liable to forfeiture\" or \"subject to forfeiture\", or any other expression which might of itself imply that some act subsequent to the commission of the offence is necessary to work the forfeiture, shall not be construed as rendering any such subsequent act necessary, but the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by the commission of the offence, in respect of which the penalty or forfeiture is imposed. Therefore, in acting as he did, the respondent made himself liable to the seizure and forfeiture of the cigarettes and the automobile, even if he had not subsequently got beyond the Customs Office in possession of these goods.\nWe are not concerned, therefore, with the necessity of inquiring whether what the respondent did really comes under the definition of \"smuggle\", because the contravention of the several sections to which I have referred was sufficient to warrant the seizure of the cigarettes and the automobile and their forfeiture. By virtue of subsection (o) of section (2)\u2014\"the forfeiture shall accrue at the time and by the commission of the offence\"\u2014there is no necessity of any subsequent act on the part of the respondent. Such subsequent act became unnecessary and the forfeiture accrued, even in the absence of such subsequent act, to wit: although he did not actually go beyond the Custom Office with the cigarettes in his possession.\nOf course, I am not at all disturbed by the respondent's explanation that the reason why he made his untrue answer to the questions put to him by the Customs Officers was because some other people were playing cards in the office. It would indeed be an easy way out of a contravention of the Customs Act and to escape the penalties and the forfeiture for a false declaration, if it were recognized that a smuggler would be relieved of the obligation of giving true answers to questions put to him by Customs Officers merely by reason of the fact that there were \"too many people in the Customs Office\".\nNor, with respect, do I agree with the learned President 6 that in the Exchequer Court of Canada the case had to be decided exclusively on the reasons given by the Minister when he ordered the seizure and forfeiture of the cigarettes and automobile. Under Section 177, dealing with the reference by the Minister to the Court, the Court is directed to hear and consider such matter upon the papers and evidence referred and upon any further evidence which, under the direction of the Court, the owner or claimant of the thing seized or detained, or the person alleged to have incurred the penalty, or the Crown, produces, \"and the court shall decide according to the right of the matter\". In my opinion, that section authorizes the Exchequer Court to explore the whole subject matter and the circumstances referred to it\u2014not to say anything of the fact that, in the present case, that is precisely what was done in the evidence submitted to that Court, to which the respondent made no objection. In the circumstances, it was fully within the power of the Exchequer Court to declare the seizure and forfeiture valid upon all the contraventions of the Act which were allegedly proven in the case.\nFor these reasons, I am dearly of opinion that the appeal should foe allowed with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court, that the respondent's claim should be dismissed and that the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, declaring the cigarettes and the automobile seized and forfeited in this matter, should be maintained.\nTascheeeau, J. (dissenting): L'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et traduit devant les tribunaux criminels \u00e0 St-Joseph de Beauce, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'accusation suivante:\nQue G\u00e9rard Bureau, ci-dessus d\u00e9crit, a, \u00e0 Armstrong dans le District de Beauce, le ou vers le 20 novembre 1945, sans excuse l\u00e9gitime, eu en sa possession des effets ill\u00e9galement import\u00e9s au Canada, \u00e0 savoir, 159,600 cigarettes am\u00e9ricaines, d'orne valeur imposable de $2,636.20, sur lesquelles les droits l\u00e9gitimes exigibles n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9s, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 217 (3) de la Loi des Douanes du Canada et ses amendements.\nLe proc\u00e8s pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par l'honorable Juge Cannon s'est instruit devant un jury, et le pr\u00e9venu a \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9. Le Minist\u00e8re du Revenu National avait cependant, avant de loger sa plainte, saisi \u00e0 Armstrong les 159,600 cigarettes am\u00e9ricaines ainsi que la voiture automobile dans laquelle elles \u00e9taient transport\u00e9es des \u00c9tats-Unis. L'intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u apr\u00e8s la saisie, l'avis requis par l'article 172 de la Loi des Douanes, en vertu duquel il \u00e9tait mis en demeure de fournir dans un d\u00e9lai de trente jours des explications de nature \u00e0 justifier sa conduite.\nLe 26 janvier 1946, au moyen d'un affidavit, l'intim\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 d'expliquer la raison pour laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 en possession de ces cigarettes, mais le 4 avril de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, le Sous-Ministre du Revenu National a avis\u00e9 Bureau que le Ministre avait ordonn\u00e9 que \"l'automobile et les cigarettes fussent confisqu\u00e9es\". Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cision n'\u00e9tait pas accept\u00e9e, le Ministre, s'autorisant des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l'article 176 de la Loi des Douanes, a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 la question \u00e0 la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier. L'honorable Pr\u00e9sident de cette Cour 7 en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y avait pas eu d'importation ill\u00e9gale, et a ordonn\u00e9 que mainlev\u00e9e soit donn\u00e9e de la saisie de l'automobile ainsi que des cigarettes sur paiement des droits de Douane. En vertu de l'article. 18 de la Loi des Douanes, toute personne en charge d'une voiture, et dans le cas pr\u00e9sent d'une voiture automobile, contenant des effets sur lesquels des droits sont exigibles ou non, doit avant de les d\u00e9charger ou d'en disposer de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, se rendre au Bureau de la Douane le plus rapproch\u00e9 de la fronti\u00e8re, et faire une d\u00e9claration par \u00e9crit indiquant la qualit\u00e9 et la valeur des marchandises.\nEn revenant des \u00c9tats-Unis, ayant dans sa voiture les 159,600 cigarettes am\u00e9ricaines en question, l'intim\u00e9 s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 Armstrong qui \u00e9tait l'endroit le plus rapproch\u00e9 o\u00f9 il devait traverser la fronti\u00e8re, et il d\u00e9clara \u00e0 l'inspecteur en charge qu'il n'avait aucune marchandise dans sa voiture, sauf une carabine calibre. 22, mais les autorit\u00e9s douani\u00e8res en inspectant l'automobile se sont vite aper\u00e7us de la quantit\u00e9 de cigarettes qu'elle contenait. L'explication de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'a pas voulu d\u00e9clarer devant les personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans le bureau de l'inspecteur cette grande quantit\u00e9 de cigarettes, parce qu'il ne voulait pas que la chose f\u00fbt connue, me para\u00eet inadmissible et ne peut en aucune fa\u00e7on excuser ou justifier cette fausse d\u00e9claration qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\nMais, malgr\u00e9 cette fausse d\u00e9claration, il demeure que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas import\u00e9 de cigarettes au Canada, car elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 saisies avant 1'\"importation\" au sens de la Loi des Douanes. En effet, pour qu'il y ait importation ill\u00e9gale, il faut que les marchandises aient travers\u00e9 la fronti\u00e8re sans que les droits exigibles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Or ici, tel n'est pas le cas. Aucune marchandise n'a travers\u00e9 la fronti\u00e8re et, en cons\u00e9quence, il n'y a pas eu d'importation ill\u00e9gale.\nIl y a clairement, cependant, une tentative d'importer ill\u00e9galement des cigarettes et il y a eu \u00e9galement, de la part de l'intim\u00e9, une d\u00e9claration fausse faite \u00e0 l'inspecteur des Douanes. La tentative d'importation est une offense pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 203 (1) (c) de la m\u00eame loi. En vertu de l'article 190, les cigarettes et l'automobile qui les contenait, pouvaient \u00eatre l\u00e9galement saisies pour cette double offense.\nMais il y a, pour que la saisie soit l\u00e9gale, une proc\u00e9dure essentielle qui doit \u00eatre suivie. En vertu de l'article 172, aussit\u00f4t que la saisie est faite, le Commissaire des Douanes doit notifier le propri\u00e9taire de la chose saisie, et doit lui expliquer les motifs de cette saisie, et lui demander de fournir dans les trente jours de la date de l'avis toute preuve qu'il d\u00e9sire apporter pour obtenir mainlev\u00e9e de la saisie. Or, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, aucun avis n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qui avait tent\u00e9 d'importer ill\u00e9galement des marchandises, ou qu'il avait fait une fausse d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'inspecteur des Douanes \u00e0 Armstrong. L'avis qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1946 informe l'intim\u00e9 que le 20 novembre 1945, on a saisi 159,600 cigarettes et une automobile parce que \"lesdites cigarettes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es en contrebande au Canada et que ladite automobile a servi \u00e0 cette importation ill\u00e9gale\". Or, il est clairement \u00e9tabli qu'aucune offense de cette nature n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise, et il en r\u00e9sulte que l'avis prescrit par l'article 172 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement donn\u00e9, et cet avis est une condition essentielle pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la saisie. Comme l'a dit l'honorable Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier, 8 la Cour n'a pas juridiction pour d\u00e9cider une confiscation. Ce pouvoir est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 exclusivement au Ministre, et la question que le Ministre peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Cour est la d\u00e9cision de confisquer qu'il a prise, et dans le cas actuel, la d\u00e9cision de confisquer parce qu'il y aurait eu importation ill\u00e9gale. C'est ce seul point que la Cour a \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, et elle n'a pas \u00e0 rechercher s'il y a eu d'autres offenses pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 la Loi des Douanes, qui pour-' raient justifier la confiscation. En donnant son avis, et les motifs qui selon lui ont justifi\u00e9 la saisie, le Ministre limite la juridiction de la Cour. L'appel donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier n'est qu'une revision de la validit\u00e9 de ces motifs.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 9, Thorson, P., dated March 9, 1948, pronounced on a reference by the Minister of National Revenue under section 176 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., cap. 42. The evidence consisted of the documents remitted to the Exchequer Court by the Minister, together with a transcript of the evidence taken in the Court of King's Bench, for the District of Beauce, upon the trial of the respondent for a breach of section 217(3) of the Act, viz., of being in possession of goods unlawfully imported on which the duties had not been paid. It appears that on the 19th of November, 1945, the respondent, accompanied by his wife and his brother, went by automobile to Lewiston, in the State of Maine, where he purchased, for resale in Canada, 159,600 American cigarettes. Returning on the following day, he arrived about 1.00 a.m. at the custom house at Armstrong, which is about ten miles inside the Quebec border. The respondent got out of his car, leaving the left front door open, entered the custom house and reported to the officers present that he had a .22 rifle to declare. He was asked if he had anything else to declare and he said, as he admits, that he had not, giving as the reason for this statement, according to the transcript, that there were other people in the office and that he did not want to declare the cigarettes before them.\nPoulin, one of the officers, then went outside and as he approached the automobile he saw three packages of cigarettes on the front seat. The brother and the respondent's wife were both sitting in the front seat and, on being asked why they had not entered the custom house to declare the cigarettes, they made no response. Poulin then proceeded to examine the car and found, as he says, that it was full of cigarettes. According to the respondent himself, apart from the three packages on the front seat, the remainder of the 159,600 cigarettes were in the trunk of the car and in large cartons between the front and the back seats. The cartons between the seats had a covering over them which Romeo Boudreau said was made up of his coat and that of his brother, but which Poulin says were old bags. The respondent in his evidence says as to these cartons that:\ncela ne se cache pas compl\u00e8tement.\nWhen the respondent went outside with Gosselin, the other officer, after Poulin had reported what he had found, Gosselin said the respondent offered him $100 to allow him to go through. The respondent denied this. The respondent, on being advised that the duty was some $2,600 said he could not pay and asked permission to take the cigarettes back to the United States. This was refused, with the result the cigarettes were seized but the respondent was allowed to continue his trip to St. Georges de Beauce, where he lived, on his undertaking to return the next day and surrender the car. When he did not live up to this undertaking the car was seized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nWhile the respondent suggests that in bringing in the cigarettes he relied on having been informed by one of the officers some days previously, (which is denied) that the rate of duty on goods from the United States was 35 per cent, it is significant that he had only a few cents with him on his return and was therefore not in a position to pay any duty.\nEventually, on the 4th of December, 1945, a notice was served upon the respondent under section 172 of the Act, the reasons for the seizure being stated to be:\nque lesdites cigarettes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es en contrebande au Canada et que ladite automobile a servi \u00e0 cette importation ill\u00e9gale.\nBy section 203(3) it is provided that every one who \"smuggles\" goods into Canada is guilty of an indictable offence. The section provides for the seizure and forfeiture of the goods and section 190 provides for the seizure and forfeiture of the car.\nThe learned trial judge 10 held that the respondent had not smuggled the cigarettes into Canada and ordered the release of the goods and car. He refused to entertain the contention of the Crown that although the evidence of the offence of smuggling was not established, nevertheless if the evidence established an infraction of any other statutory provision, the Crown could support the seizure under the notice given. The learned trial judge also held against the contention of the respondent that because of his acquittal upon the charge under section 217(3), it was, as between the respondent and the Crown chose jug\u00e9e that the cigarettes were not \"unlawfully imported\" and therefore the seizure could not be maintained.\nDealing with the last point first, while it might be contended with considerable force that an acquittal under section 217(3) would preclude a subsequent finding that the cigarettes had been \"smuggled\" into Canada within the meaning of section 203, I think, for reasons to be given, that the Crown is not thereby precluded from justifying the seizure under other provisions of the statute.\nIn my opinion the act of \"smuggling\", within the meaning of section 203, is not complete unless the goods are carried past the line of customs. That line, perhaps, may vary in differing circumstances. It may be that the mere crossing of the border with no intention of clearing the goods at any custom house, whether there be one at the point of crossing or not, would, in certain circumstances, be sufficient. As applied to the facts of the present case however, I think the act of smuggling had not been completed as the goods in fact were halted at the line of customs.\nIn Keck v. United States 11, it was held that the act of smuggling is not committed by an act done before the obligation to pay or account for the duties arises although such an act may indicate a future purpose to evade when the period of paying or securing the payment of duties has been reached. In the view of the majority of the court the act of smuggling was established only by the overt act of passing the goods through the line of the customs authorities without paying or securing the duties. The majority reached this view upon the meaning of smuggling at common law and in view of the fact that the legislation with which they had to deal dealt with a number of specific acts prior to the actual passing of goods through the line of customs, which acts were visited with penal consequences. In their view this indicated that the offence of smuggling was not made out by evidence of the commission of one or more of these preparatory acts. In my opinion this reasoning is applicable to the Canadian statute. It is enough to contrast clauses (a), (b) and (c) of subsection 1 of section 203.\nIn Bacon's Abridgment under the heading of \"Smuggling and Customs\", the following appears under letter F:\nAs the offence of smuggling is not complete unless some goods, wares or merchandise are actually brought on shore or carried from the shore contrary to law, a person may be guilty of divers practices which have' a direct tendency thereto, without being guilty of the offence. For the sake of preventing or putting a stop to such practices, penalties and forfeitures are inflicted by divers statutes; and indeed it would be to no purpose, in a case of this kind, to provide against the end, without providing at the same time against the means of accomplishing it.\nSo also Blackstone defines smuggling to be \"the offence of importing goods without paying the duties imposed thereon by the laws of the customs and excise\" (4 Black. Com. 154). The words \"importing without paying the duties\" obviously imply the existence of the obligation to pay the duties at the time the offence is committed, and which duty to pay is evaded by the commission of the guilty act.\nIn Grinnell v. The Queen 12, Ritchie, C.J., delivering the judgment of himself and of Fournier and Taschereau JJ., said:\nThe term \"smuggling\" has been defined to be the difference of importing prohibited articles, or defrauding the revenue by the introduction of articles into consumption without paying the duties chargeable thereon.\nIt is a technical word, having a known and accepted 'meaning. It implies illegality, and is inconsistent with innocent intent. The idea conveyed by it is that of a secret introduction of goods with intent to avoid (payment of duty.\nI therefore think that the offence of smuggling was not committed by the respondent in the present case.\nI proceed to deal therefore, with the other statutory provisions to which I have referred. In my opinion the evidence establishes a sufficient basis upon which the seizure and forfeiture are to be supported, and I think, with respect, that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the terms of the notice given by the Crown under section 172 precludes the seizure from being supported upon this footing.\nSection 203(1) (c) is as follows:\nIf any person in any way attempts to defraud the revenue by avoiding the payment of the duty or any part of the duty on any goods of whatever value; such goods if found shall be seized and forfeited.\nBy section 171 it is provided that wherever any vehicle or goods have been seized under any of the provisions of the statute or any law relating to customs, or when it is alleged that any penalty or forfeiture has been incurred, the proper officer shall forthwith report \"the circumstances of the case\" to the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise. In the present case the report states that the officer had seized the cigarettes and the car for \"trying\" to import and that he had charged the respondent with contravention of the customs laws as follows:\nTrying to import United States cigarettes in Canada illegally.\nThis report was followed by the notice to the respondent, already referred to. That notice included a copy of sections 171 and 178, inclusive, of the statute. The respondent on the 26th of January, 1946, sent in an affidavit setting out the facts from his point of view. Neither in that affidavit however, nor in the letter of his solicitor, which accompanied it, nor at any subsequent time, did respondent take any objection to the notice, nor did he 'construe it as an allegation of \"smuggling\" within the meaning of section 203. On the contrary, in his affidavit he states that he had never had any intention of \"defrauding the revenue\".\nIn the report of the Deputy Minister, in pursuance of section 173, the facts are reviewed and the report concluded as follows:\nThere are other facts which point towards deliberate intent to smuggle these cigarettes on which duty and rates were $2,632.20, but it is submitted that the failure to declare them is sufficient and they and the automobile should be forfeited.\nI recommend that the cigarettes and the automobile be forfeited.\nThis recommendation was accepted by the Minister and it is clear that the ground upon which the seizure was maintained was not that of \"smuggling\" but failure to declare with intent to smuggle.\nOn the reference of the matter to the Exchequer Court 13 the respondent filed a formal pleading in which he took no exception to the notice of the 4th of December, 1945. It is clear from this pleading that the respondent not only was not prejudiced in any way by the contents of the notice but that he understood the issue involved. Paragraphs 2 and 9 are sufficient to illustrate this:\n2\u00b0 Le r\u00e9clamant n'a jamais eu l'intention de frauder le Gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9 ni d'introduire clandestinement au Canada lesdites cigarettes et il n'a jamais fait servir son automobile \u00e0 cette fin;\n9\u00b0 En cons\u00e9quence, il est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que le r\u00e9clamant n'a pas viol\u00e9 la loi dans cette affaire et il pr\u00e9tend qu'on a saisi sur lui lesdites cigarettes et son automobile, contrairement \u00e0 la loi;\nIn his defence the Minister denied both of these paragraphs and alleged, inter alia, the following:\n8\u00b0 Le r\u00e9clamant a tent\u00e9 d'introduire clandestinement des cigarettes au Canada sans payer de droits de douane, et il a ainsi tent\u00e9 de frauder le revenu, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 190 de la m\u00eame loi, il a omis de faire, au bureau des douanes le plus rapproch\u00e9 de l'endroit o\u00f9 il avait travers\u00e9 la fronti\u00e8re, une d\u00e9claration par \u00e9crit au percepteur des douanes, d\u00e9claration \u00e9non\u00e7ant le contenu de toutes les marchandises qu'il importait;\n15\u00b0 Le r\u00e9clamant n'a jamais eu 1'intention de payer les droits sur les 159,600 cigarettes saisies. Lors de son retour au Canada, au moment de la saisie, il ne lui restait, de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 sa femme et \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, qu'une somme totale liquide d'au plus $179.00;\n16\u00b0 Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du bureau des douanes \u00e0 faire la d\u00e9claration des marchandises qu'il importait, le r\u00e9clamant a omis \u00e0 ce moment de d\u00e9clarer ses cigarettes, et il a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration qui rendait toute marchandise non d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, passible de saisie et de confiscation en vertu de l'article 251 de la Loi des Douanes du Canada;\n17\u00b0 Le v\u00e9hicule du r\u00e9clamant ayant servi \u00e0 importer des effets frapp\u00e9s de confiscation, devait aussi \u00eatre saisi et confisqu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 193 de la Loi des Douanes;\nI think it is plain that the parties thoroughly understood that the seizure of both the goods and the vehicle was being supported by the Crown upon an alleged attempt to defraud the revenue and that the completed act of \"smuggling\" within the meaning of section 203(3) was not the issue.\nIn my opinion the proceedings before the Exchequer Court under the provisions of section 177 were not limited by the terms of the notice given under section 172. By section 171 the proper officer is required to report to the Deputy Minister \"the circumstances of the case\". He did so and in that report the charge was not \"smuggling\" but \"trying to import illegally\". Again, by section 173, it is the \"circumstances of the case\" which the Deputy Minister is required to consider and report upon to the Minister and upon which the Minister gives his decision under section 174. Further, the decision of the court under section 177 is not an appeal from the decision of the Minister nor limited in evidence to that which was before the Minister. New evidence may be permitted and the court is called upon to decide \"according to the right of the matter\". In my view, therefore, the contention of the Crown is correct, that, if the evidence adduced before the Exchequer Court established an attempt to defraud the revenue within the meaning of section 203(c), or a breach of section 18(2), if that be not included in the farmer subsection, the seizure would be well founded. There remains therefore, for consideration the question as to whether or not the respondent has met the onus resting upon him under section 262 of the statute and has established that he was not guilty of a breach of the statute apart from section 217(3) and section 203(3). In my opinion it should be found that he has not. As already noted, the only evidence before the Exchequer Court 14 in addition to that which was before the Minister, was a transcript of the evidence in the Court of King's Bench. The explanation of the respondent for his false statement that he had nothing to declare beyond the rifle, that he did not want to make his declaration in the custom house because there were some strangers there, and that he intended to make full disclosure when he got outside, is not to be accepted. It is perhaps conceivable that, had the respondent himself given evidence in the court below, he might have impressed the learned trial judge with his honesty of purpose, but evidently his counsel did not think that the transcript of his evidence would be added to by respondent's presence in the witness box.\nThe whole circumstances are pregnant with suspicion. The cigarettes in the interior of the car were covered, or substantially so, with coats, or, as the officers say, old bags. The respondent had no money with which to pay the duty at the rate of 35 per cent or at any other rate. The conclusion which I draw from all the circumstances is that the respondent was presuming on being known to one of the officers, upon the lateness of the hour and the fact that it was raining, in the hope that by presenting himself at the custom house and declaring the rifle, and giving the assurance he had nothing else, he would be allowed to pass. Whether or not this be a correct appreciation of his intention, I think the court, in the absence at least of an opportunity of judging of the respondent's honesty from his presence in the witness box, should not be expected to say that the onus provided by section 262 is met in circumstances such as are here present. I would therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below and confirm the seizure.\nEstey J.:\u2014I agree it is not here established that the cigarettes were smuggled into Canada. The evidence, however, justifies the conclusion that the appellant at 1.00 a.m. on November 20, 1945, at the Customs House in Armstrong, Quebec, attempted to smuggle the cigarettes into Canada and in the course of doing so failed to make the report in writing to the collector or proper officer at the Customs House of the quantity and value of the cigarettes as required by sec. 190 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 42, and amendments thereto, and at the same time attempted to defraud the revenue by endeavouring to avoid payment of the duty within the meaning of sec. 203 of the Customs Act. These issues were raised before the learned President 15 and if either was established the cigarettes and the automobile were subject to seizure and forfeiture under sec. 143, 147 and 203 of the Customs Act.\nThe cigarettes and the automobile were seized by the customs officers at Armstrong on the morning in question.\nSec. 172 provides that the Deputy Minister of Revenue for Customs and Excise may notify the respondent \"of the reasons for the seizure\" and advise him that he may within 30 days from the date of the notice tender such evidence in the matter as he may desire for the purpose of contesting the validity of the seizure and possible forfeiture. The notice in this case was dated December 4, 1945, and gave as a reason for the seizure of the cigarettes and automobile:\n\u2026que lesdites cigarettes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9es en contrebande au Canada et que ladite automobile a servi \u00e0 cette importation ill\u00e9gale.\nThe learned President was of the view that this language restricted the issue to the act of smuggling and that the owner or claimant \"must answer only those reasons,\" or as he further stated: \"The only seizure regarding which the Minister may give his decision under section 174 is that of which the reasons have been made known according to section 172. There is no other seizure before him,\" and that \"the Court has no power to do what is not permitted to the Minister.\" He then stated:\nSince the evidence shows that the claimant has not smuggled the cigarettes into Canada and has not used his automobile for such importation, it follows that the reasons for the seizure of the cigarettes and the automobile are unfounded and the decision respecting the forfeiture, being based on the said seizure, is ill-founded and must be quashed. Upon receipt of the notice of December 4, 1945, the respondent consulted his solicitor who prepared an affidavit which he forwarded to the Deputy Minister with the request that the automobile be released.\nThe Deputy Minister made further inquiries and under sec. 173 submitted his report to the Minister. The Minister under sec. 174, and under date of July 3, 1946, directed \"that the cigarettes and the automobile be forfeited.\"\n174. The Minister may thereupon either give his decision in the matter respecting the seizure, detention, penalty or forfeiture, and the terms, if any, upon which the thing seized or detained may be released or the penalty or forfeiture remitted, or may refer the same to the court for decision.\nThe respondent was immediately notified of the Minister's decision and, after further correspondence, the Minister under date of July 3, 1947, referred the matter to the 'Exchequer Court under sec. 176.\n176. If the owner or claimant of the thing seized or detained, or the person alleged to have incurred the penalty, within thirty days after being notified of the Minister's decision, gives him notice in writing that such decision will not be accepted, the Minister may refer the matter to the court.\nThe terms of the Minister's reference in this case are as follows:\nBy virtue of the powers vested in me in that behalf, under Section 176 of the Customs Act, I hereby refer to the Exchequer Court of Canada for adjudication the claim of G\u00e9rard Bureau against the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, given on July 2, 1946, in the matter of the said Customs Seizure No. 20415\/2164, the said decision being to the effect \"that the cigarettes and the automobile be forfeited.\"\nThe directions to the Exchequer Court upon such a reference are contained in sec. 177.\n177. On any reference of any such matter by the Minister to the court, the court shall hear and consider such matter upon the papers and evidence referred and upon any further evidence which, under the direction of the court, the owner or claimant of the thing seized or detained, or the person alleged to have incurred the penalty, or the Crown, produces, and the court shall decide according to the right of the matter.\nThe foregoing sections 172 to 174 provide for the filing of material by the owner and consideration by the Deputy Minister who thereafter makes a report to the Minister upon which the latter either makes his decision or he may \"refer the same to the court for decision.\" If, therefore, in the opinion of the Minister the matter, in the first instance, is of such importance that it should be made the subject of a formal trial, where evidence is heard and the issues more thoroughly examined than is possible under the informal procedure contemplated up to the time the report is made to him, he may then direct under sec. 174 that it be referred to the Exchequer Court. It is significant that the language providing for this reference in sec. 174 is in effect identical with that of sec. 176 and when read with sec. 177 it is clear that the procedure is the same in the Exchequer Court whether the Minister has or has not made a decision.\nIt is therefore clear that these sections do not direct that the reference shall be merely a review of the Minister's reasons nor do they contemplate that if he has based his decision upon a particular section or provision in the statute that it must be either affirmed, varied or reversed upon that same basis. Parliament here provides for a disposition of the matter referred to the Court upon its merits. It contemplates in the Exchequer Court a trial de novo \"upon any further evidence which, under the direction of the court\" (sec. 177) either party may produce and in this regard the concluding words are of particular significance, \"and the court shall decide according to the right of the matter,\" (sec. 177).\nThe parties hereto have proceeded upon the basis of a trial de novo and filed pleadings in the Exchequer Court 16. The defence filed for the Attorney-General of Canada raised not only the issue of smuggling but also those of making a false declaration and of attempting to defraud the revenue. No exception was taken to these pleadings nor to any of the issues raised thereby and upon these issues the evidence was tendered before the learned President. It is, with great respect, the issues raised by the parties through their pleadings and not the terms of the notice under sec. 172 that determine the issues before the Exchequer Court. At most the intent and purpose of the notice under sec. 172, prepared by those charged with the administration of the Act, is to assist the owner or claimant in what may be the initial stages of dealing with the matter through the informal procedure before the Minister. The accused had been prosecuted for an offence arising out of his conduct at the customs on the morning of November 20, 1945, and found not guilty in October 1946, some time after the Minister made his decision. The parties hereto agreed that the evidence taken at the criminal trial should be tendered and made a part of the record in the Exchequer Court. It was this evidence and the material filed before the Minister that constituted the record before the learned President. It was in every respect a trial de novo upon the issues determined by the pleadings.\nThe evidence before the learned President was a matter of record. No witnesses gave oral testimony and therefore the appellate Court is in as good a position to draw inferences and conclusions from this evidence as the judge presiding at the trial. Upon this evidence there is no question but that the respondent failed to make the report in writing as required by sec. 190 and therefore the cigarettes and automobile were properly seized and subject to forfeiture.\nThe appeal should be allowed and an order directed that the cigarettes and the automobile be forfeited to the Crown.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: F.

The accused, being the proprietor of a rooming house, retained two suitcases belonging to a former woman roomer as security for unpaid rent. Four of her friends decided to obtain them without paying the rent. On arriving at the house one remained outside in a taxi and the three others went into the room occupied by the accused and his wife and when their purpose was known a fight started and the accused hit one of them with a hammer, fracturing his skull. The accused was convicted in police court of assault occasioning bodily harm, the magistrate holding that the men were not trespassers. The Court of Appeal being equally divided, his appeal was dismissed.\nHeld: The failure of the trial judge to appreciate that the men were wrongdoers and under the circumstances trespassers, as well as his failure to direct himself as to the effect of sec. 57 of the Criminal Code under which the accused had the right to resist provided he did not use more force than was necessary, amounted to misdirection and therefore a new trial ordered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 dismissing on an equal division, Richards and Coyne J.A. dissenting, the appeal of the appellant from his conviction, before Macdonell J., on a charge of assault occasioning bodily harm.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. A. Molloy for the appellant.\nC. W. Tupper, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellant, John Nykolyn, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon the person of Peter Farr at Winnipeg on July 29, 1947. His conviction was affirmed by an equal division in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 2, Mr. Justice Richards and Mr. Justice Coyne dissenting. Several grounds of dissent are set out in the formal judgment. It seems sufficient to deal with the following only:\n(1) The learned magistrate failed to direct himself that Farr, Pyke and Gendre were, as they entered upon the premises, trespassers engaged in the purpose of carrying out a conspiracy to commit a criminal offence. (2) That the invitation as found by the learned magistrate was given under duress or misapprehension of the purpose of the men, and therefore not an invitation in law.\n(3) That the accused had a right in law to resist the taking of the property from his premises.\nThe learned magistrate accepted the evidence of Farr, Pyke and Gendre, which may be summarized: The appellant conducted a rooming house. A few days before July 29, 1946, a young woman left appellant's rooming house but being unable to pay her rent the appellant retained her two suitcases, under the provisions of The Hotel Keepers Act, R.S.M. 1940, ch. 98. No question is raised as to the right of the appellant to retain these suitcases.\nFarr was present and took part in the conversation between the young woman and appellant when the suit-oases were retained. In fact he said that one of the suitcases was his, it having been loaned to her. The rent has neither been tendered nor paid. On July 29th Farr, Pyke, Gendre and Seymour were in the beer parlour at the Woodbine Hotel in Winnipeg where they had a few glasses of beer. There Farr told the other three the story of the retention of the suitcases and they decided to go and get them. They all went, as Pyke said \"We expected there might be some trouble,\" and as Farr said that they might \"over-awe\" the appellant \"with superior strength.\" They proceeded shortly after five o'clock in the afternoon in a taxi. At the rooming house Seymour remained in the taxi with the driver while Farr, Pyke and Gendre went into the rooming house. Appellant lived on the ground floor at the rear of the hall. Farr said that the three of them went to the door and when they knocked it was opened by appellant. Farr asked for the suitcases and the appellant said \"Just a minute\" and went out, while Mrs. Nykolyn said \"Take them.\" Farr and Pyke walked in, seeing the grips under a table in the room picked them up, when Mrs. Nykolyn began yelling and striking Pyke with a flashlight. Pyke apparently paid no attention to her conduct and carried one of the suitcases out to the taxi.\nThe evidence is not entirely clear as to just what happened but Gendre, who did not go into the room but remained in the hall, said that while Mrs. Nykolyn was yelling and striking Pyke with the flashlight, Nykolyn came out into the hall apparently following Farr who had the other suitcase. Gendre held the appellant, not because he entertained any fear of Nykolyn assaulting him, but because as he said, \"there was Peter Farr and Mr. Nykolyn arguing about suitcases, and I was going to quiet them down.\" He then said that after a couple of minutes \"I let Mr. Nykolyn go and he said 'Just a minute' and he went behind the door and he picked up a hammer \u2026\" Gendre said he saw Nykolyn hit Farr with the hammer and then he (Gendre) struck Nykolyn on the jaw with his fist as a result of which Nykolyn fell into his own room and he, Gendre, helped Farr out of the house.\nSeymour said he remained in the taxi and \"the taxi driver and I heard the screaming and we thought there was a murder on.\" The taxi driver said \"I could hear the noise, but I could not distinguish what it was.\"\nThe magistrate accepted the evidence of the three men but failed to direct his attention to the admitted fact that they had gone to appellant's home, as arranged in the beer parlour, to take from him the two suitcases. Farr knew why the suitcases were held because he was present when the appellant had asserted his right to and did retain them. Appellant, in retaining them, was exercising his right under the law of Manitoba and thereby had a property interest in and a right of possession to these suitcases. If, as they deposed, these men went there under the terms of a conspiracy or with a common intent to 'commit the offence of theft, they were wrongdoers' as they entered upon the premises and were, under the circumstances, trespassers. The learned magistrate made no reference in his judgment to this evidence and misdirected himself in law in stating \"When they were on the property they weren't trespassing\u2014 they rang the bell.\"\nThe magistrate also found that \"they were told they could get the grips\u2014there was no trespassing there.\" His finding that they were told to get the grips is based on the statement of Mrs. Nykolyn, who, immediately the door was opened, made some such remark as \"Take them.\" Some question was raised as to the authority of Mrs. Nykolyn to grant such permission on behalf of her husband, which, under the circumstances, I do not think it is neces- sary to consider. Why the invitation was given is not clear. It seems to have been given before any trouble started when she may have been under the impression that the parties had come for the suitcases and would pay the rent and take them lawfully. Certainly the moment she found they were taking them without doing so she began actively to resist. The fact that Mrs. Nykolyn may have been momentarily deceived in thinking the parties were upon a lawful errand and under that misapprehension gave the invitation as found, would not alter the fact that these men were throughout proceeding in the execution of their unlawful purpose and were trespassers. The learned magistrate did not direct his attention to this phase of the case. Perhaps it should be mentioned that apart from all questions as to whether the invitation was given under fear or apprehension of consequences or under the belief that the parties intended to pay the rent for which the suitcases were held, which does not appear to have been 'Considered, there is the important question whether or not by her conduct she had withdrawn any permission or licence she had given that would permit these parties to take the suitcases away. The learned magistrate did not direct his attention to this important issue and his failure to do so would seem, under the circumstances, to constitute a misdirection.\nThe appellant was in his own home in peaceful possession of the suitcases in question. Sec. 57 of the Criminal Code provides:\n57. Every one who is in peaceable possession of any movable property or thing under a claim of right, and every one acting under his authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending such possession, even against a person entitled by law to the possession of such property or thing, if he uses no more force than is necessary.\nThe appellant was in peaceful possession of the suitcases under a claim of right and therefore had, under the foregoing section, a right to resist these men in their endeavour to take the suitcasess provided or so long as he did not use more force than was necessary. The record here would indicate, particularly if the permission, found by the learned magistrate to have been given by Mrs. Nykolyn, was withdrawn or otherwise ineffective in law, that the issue under sec. 57 would be a very important part of this case and to which the learned magistrate did not direct his attention. Whether one in exercising his right under the foregoing section uses more force than is necessary is a question of fact which, under the particular circumstances of this case, should be determined at a trial where the evidence is directed to this issue and the question of credibility of the witnesses determined by the presiding magistrate who has an opportunity to observe them.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMurray, Greschuk, Walsh, Micay, Molloy and McDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

He further claimed an order for the delivery to him of the furniture and chattels on the premises, and damages for injuries done the premises, furniture and chattels. The wife by counterclaim sought a declaration that she was the owner of all the property, or in the alternative, that all the property was held by the husband in trust for her either wholly or to the extent of a one-half interest. The Court, treating the matter as if proceedings had been taken under s. 12 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 209.\nHeld: that the real property was that of the husband and gave him judgment for possession, but held further that even under that section, the husband was not entitled to mesne profits, as that is a claim for a tort barred by s. 7.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.:\u2014The proceeding for wrongful detention of the possession of land is the modern equivalent of the old action for ejectment, and therefore such an action in tort as is barred by s. 7 of the Act.\nThe majority of the Court expressed no opinion on this point.\nThe trial judge having decided that the wife was entitled to one half the furniture, and there being no appeal from that decision, it was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from an Order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Gale, J., after the trial of the action without a jury, wherein the learned trial judge dismissed the action of the appellant for possession of the premises, and for an accounting, and for delivery up of certain chattels and funds, and found that the defendant was entitled to a one-half interest in the house and premises, and in the goods and furniture upon the premises.\nR.F.

In the meantime, and immediately after the decree nisi, the husband demanded possession of the house and premises at 267 College Street, Kingston, in which the parties and their young son had lived and issued the writ in this action on July 4, 1946, claiming possession and mesne profits, an order for the delivery to him of the furniture on the premises and his personal belongings and chattels, and damages for injuries done the premises and furniture and chattels. This was done instead of proceeding by way of motion as provided by section 12 of The Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 209. The wife counter-claimed that she was the owner of the College Street premises, or in the alternative that the husband held them as trustee for her, or in the further alternative that the two were jointly entitled. The trial judge dismissed the action and declared that each party was entitled to a one-half interest in the College Street property and in the goods and furniture. The husband was ordered to pay the costs of the action and there were no costs of the counter-claim. On appeal this order was affirmed.\nThe litigation has already put the parties to considerable expense and we deem it advisable to treat the matter as if proceedings under section 12 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act had been taken. So dealing with the matter, it is impossible to reject the husband\u2019s claim that the property is his. We can find no evidence to substantiate the finding of the trial judge that there was an arrangement between the parties, well understood if not expressed, that they should mutually share in what they accumulated. No moneys earned by the wife in any way were advanced to the husband to purchase the earlier residences of the married couple, which, from time to time, were sold until the College Street property was purchased, nor were such moneys loaned by her to the husband. The law is quite clear that under these circumstances the land is the husband\u2019s. Rioux v. Rioux[1], is an example although what was dealt with there was money in a bank account. But while the husband is entitled to judgment for possession, he is not entitled to mesne profits. That is a claim for a tort, which is prohibited by the concluding part of section 7 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act.\nThe furniture stands in a different position. At the trial, the entire record in the divorce proceedings was put in as evidence by the plaintiff and it appears in that record that the wife had testified that the furniture belonged to her. In addition, her mother testified at the trial of this action that the husband had told her that when he sold certain furniture belonging to the wife, there was enough money to purchase the new. The trial judge decided that the wife was entitled to one-half of the furniture and as there was no cross-appeal from that decision, it must stand.\nWhile a question was raised as to the right of a husband to secure an order or judgment for possession of the matrimonial domicile, the point as to whether an action lies at the suit of a husband to recover judgment for possession simpliciter of real property was not argued and I express no opinion upon the subject since, in my view, it is unnecessary to do so. I would therefore set aside the judgments below and direct that there should be judgment for possession by the husband of the College Street property. Clause 3 of the formal judgment at the trial as to the goods and furniture stands with a variation that if the parties cannot agree as to their division, the matter will be referred to the local Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Kingston. The respondent is entitled to one-half of her costs of the counter-claim in the trial Court and one-half of her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court but no further order as to costs is made.\nRAND J.:\u2014This action was brought by a husband against his wife to recover land, including a house in which the wife and child were at the time living, as well as furniture and other chattels. In December, 1945, the husband had withdrawn from cohabitation and some time later the wife instituted proceedings for divorce. In that action an order nisi after trial was directed on June 5, 1946, by which provision was made for alimony; but as the decree is not before us it is impossible to say just what its terms are. On July 4, 1946 the writ in this action was issued and the order nisi was made absolute after the appeal to this Court had been brought.\nIn addition to possession of the land, the plaintiff claimed an accounting of rents and profits, the delivery of the chattels, and damages to both the real and personal property. The wife by counterclaim sought a declaration that all the property was held by the husband in trust for her either wholly or \u2018to the extent of a one-half interest.\nThe proceeding is clearly one in the nature of ejectment with mesne profits, and detinue, with damages for trespass. By section 7 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act of Ontario all actions of tort between husband and wife, except those necessary for the protection and security of the wife\u2019s separate property, are barred, and the initial question is whether or not the case is within that prohibition. That it is would seem to be reasonably clear. It alleges a wrongful detention of the possession of both land and chattels and mesne profits are damages in trespass. In Salmond\u2019s Law of Torts 5th Ed., p. 208, in the Digest of English Civil Law under the editorship of Edward Jenks 3rd Ed., p. 365 and in Pollock on Torts 14th Ed., at pp. 7, 271-7, such a claim is treated as in tort. Ejectment was a special form of trespass based upon a wrongful dispossession, and in a note on page 127, Salmond says:\u2014\nThe plaintiff in such cases recovers not only the land itself, but also damages for the loss suffered by him during the period of his dispossession (mesne profits), and it is by virtue of this right to damages that the wrongful dispossession of land is correctly classed as a tort.\nOriginally the relief in trespass de ejectione firmae was damages only. Gradually there was added to it the recovery of the land by the dispossessed tenant; and ultimately it became the mode by which conflicting claims to title, as well as possession, were adjudicated. Gradually also the claim for substantial damages or mesne profits beyond the nominal damages in the main action came to be severed from the ejectment; and on judgment for the latter, the courts treated the unlawful possession as a continuing trespass for which an action lay. Under the Judicature Act an action for recovery of land on any footing can include a claim for those profits.\nA slight elaboration of the elements of the action of ejectment seems to me to put the question beyond doubt. As this proceeding finally developed, from considerations leading to the recovery of the land by a termor as well as the applicability of the action to a freeholder, it was grounded in a fictitious expulsion of a fictitious lessee and it was this lessee who brought the action against the fictitious trespasser. The actual occupant was not allowed to defend unless he admitted the lease and the ouster, and having done that he was allowed to set up any title under which he might claim. But trespass was the foundation and the judgment established a trespass from the time of the wrongful detention of possession on which the claim for damages for mesne profits was based. The essential fact is that the action is conceived to be grounded on wrongful detention as a delict or tort; and the question is whether the text of section 7, considering the purpose of the statute as affecting primarily property of the wife and incidentally the relation of husband and wife, is not to be construed as being intended to protect the conjugal association to the extent of maintaining the ban on resort to the ordinary processes of litigation where that arises upon a fault or a wrong. At common law no action lay between husband and wife both because of a formal obstacle, i.e. that the wife could be impleaded only with the husband; and one of substance, that they were held to be one person between whom none of the ordinary rights or claims in law could arise. The Act contains no express provision enabling the husband to bring any action against the wife; that right, uniformly accepted to exist, arises only as an inference from the statute; and in defining the limitations of an exception from that inference, we should, I think, do so in the light of the considerations mentioned.\nSection 12 of the Act, under which the judge to whom the application is made, may make such order \u201cas he sees fit\u201d, seems designed to meet just such a controversy over possession, and this proceeding can be converted into an application under that section: Bashall v. Bashall[2], cited in Lush on Husband and Wife, 4th Ed., p. 601, in which it was held that the counterclaim for detinue by the husband was within the same ban of the statute.\nThe judgment declared the wife to be entitled to a one-half interest in both the land and personal property, and it was affirmed unanimously on appeal. The facts tend, no doubt, to excite sympathy for the wife and child, but we must resist the danger of allowing it to outrun rules too well and too long established to be disregarded. Viewing the evidence in the light most favourable to the wife, I can find nothing to warrant the holding either that there was a contract between them by which any interest in the property was to be hers, or that any money belonging to her can be said to be represented by the land. In the early period of their married life the wife accepted the difficulties of the situation courageously and for three or four years worked in outside employment at wages; but they went into the common fund used to carry the family life from day to day. It is, I think, impossible to trace any part of the money so earned into the purchase of the land or into the two properties whose purchase and sale preceded it. For those reasons the judgment in this respect cannot stand.\nThe personal property, however, is in a different position. Admittedly a substantial portion of the original furniture was the wife\u2019s, much of which came from her parents\u2019 home. A great deal of it was sold and new bought and there is evidence of an admission by the husband that most of what is now in the house was paid for with the proceeds of that sold. The judgment in this respect, therefore, should be affirmed.\nAlthough it is agreed by all members of the Court that the claim for mesne profits is a claim in tort, it is not unanimous that the claim for possession is clearly so. A number of questions are raised by that distinction, among them, the possibility of treating these claims as severable in the sense required; but in the circumstances of the case and notwithstanding my own view, I see no objection to assuming, without deciding, that the action, limited to the claim for possession, lies; in the circumstances, this basis of disposal does not change the result to which I would come by treating the proceedings as brought under section 12 of the statute.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed as to the land and the appellant will be entitled to an order for possession. If the parties cannot agree upon a division of the personal property there should be a reference to the Master for the necessary action. The respondent will be entitled to one-half the costs of the counterclaim in the trial court and one-half of her costs in both the Court of Appeal and this Court; there will be no other costs.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014On the hearing of this appeal the question was raised from the bench as to the appellant\u2019s right to bring action against the respondent for possession of the matrimonial home and furniture, as well as for mesne profits, even although the action had been commenced after the decree nisi in divorce proceedings brought by the respondent against the appellant but before decree absolute. The statement of claim alleges ownership in the appellant and (a) as to the real property claims possession, an accounting of rents and profits during the time the respondent \u201cunlawfully\u201d retained possession and damages to the premises; and (b) as to the chattels, an order for delivery and damages for injury thereto. There is no evidence of any injury to land or goods.\nUnder the provisions of section 7 of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O., 1937, cap. 209, a married woman is given in her own name against her husband, the same remedies for the protection and security of her separate property as if such property belonged to her as a feme sole, but, \u201cexcept as aforesaid no husband or wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort\u201d. By section 12, subsection 1, it is provided that, in any question between husband and wife as to the title to or possession of property, either party may apply in a summary way and the judge \u201cmay make such order with respect to the property in dispute and as to the costs of and consequent on the application as he thinks fit or may direct * * * any inquiry or issue touching the matters in question to be made or tried in such manner as he shall think fit\u201d.\nThe present action is, with respect to the real property, an action to exclude the respondent from the matrimonial home on the ground that she \u201cwrongfully\u201d retains possession, i.e., that she is a trespasser.\nIn order to determine whether or not this action is one barred by the provisions of section 7 it is necessary to have regard to the old forms of action. As stated by Salmond in the 10th Edition, page 3:\n* * * all satisfactory definition and classification of the different species of such injuries (civil injuries) must be based on the old procedural distinctions between forms of action, and must conform to those distinctions except in so far as they no longer have any relation to the substantive law of the present day.\nWhat the appellant seeks in this action is that which would formerly have been sought in the action for ejectment and for mesne profits.\nIn Adams on Ejectment the author says at page 334:\n* * * the action for use and occupation is founded on contract, the action of ejectment upon wrong, and they are therefore wholly inconsistent with each other when applied to the same period of time; since in the one action the plaintiff treats the defendant as a tenant, and in the other as a trespasser. And at page 333:\nOn the first introduction of the action of ejectment, and whilst the ancient practice prevailed, the measure of the damages were the profits of the land accruing during the tortious holding of the defendant; but when the proceedings became fictitious, and the plaintiff nominal, the damages assessed became nominal also; and no provisions have since been made by the Courts, either by engrafting additional conditions upon the consent rule, or by the invention of new fictions, to enable the jury in the action of ejectment to inquire into the actual damages, and include in their verdict the real injury sustained by the wrongful holding. The party has not, however, been left without redress\u2026 The Courts have sanctioned an application of the common action of trespass vi et armis to the purposes of this remedy. It is generally termed an action for mesne profits * * *\nIn Bramwell v. Bramwell[3], Goddard L.J., as he then was, said at 373:\nAn action for the recovery of land is the modern equivalent of the old action of ejectment. That action was a personal action and could only sound in damages. Then in favour of this class of remedy the courts determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recover as collateral and additional relief possession of the land itself (see Stephen on Pleading, 3rd ed. p. 12), but it was in fact always a species of the action of trespass. It is not necessary to decide it in this case, but I have the greatest doubt whether a husband can bring an action for the recovery of land against his wife, alleging that she is wrongly in occupation of it, because, if she is wrongly in occupation of the land and he has a right to the possession of it, it seems to me she is a trespasser and therefore he is suing her for a tort.\nSalmond at 214 says:\nThe wrong of dispossession consists in the act of depriving any person entitled thereto of the possession of land. This deprivation of possession may happen in two ways\u2014namely, either by wrongfully taking possession of the land, or by wrongfully detaining the possession of it after the expiration of a lawful right of possession. In the first case, the wrong of dispossession is also a trespass; in the latter it is not. But so far as regards the essential nature of the wrong and the remedies available for it, there is no difference between one form of dispossession and the other.\nAny person wrongfully dispossessed of land may sue for the specific restitution of it in an action of ejectment.\nAnd at page 217:\nThe action for mesne profits was a particular form of the action of trespass quare clausum fregit; * * * Whether the dispossession had or had not been effected by way of trespass, the claim for mesne profits was always in form a claim for damages for a continuing trespass upon the land.\nIn my opinion the claim with respect to the real property is an action in tort and barred by the provisions of section 7. The sole remedy of the appellant therefore was under that section, and in my opinion the course of the decisions uniformly recognizes this situation; Re M. and M.[4]; Gardner v. Gardner[5]; D. and D.[6]; Under the section however, there is no jurisdiction to award mesne profits; Larner v. Larner[7].\nSimilarly, with respect to the chattels, \u201cif a wife wrongfully converts to her own use the goods of her husband the only remedy of the husband, so far as he has any remedy at all, is to apply to the court under the special provisions of the Married Women\u2019s Property Act\u201d; per McCardie J. in Gottliffie v. Edelston[8] at 382. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Curtis v. Wilson[9], overruling Gottliffe v. Edelston does not affect the correctness of the view of McCardie J. in the excerpt quoted.\nIn his lectures on Forms of Action of Common Law Maitland says at page 76:\nWe have no longer to classify the forms for they are gone; but I think we still are obliged to say that every action for a chattel is founded on tort if it be not founded on contract * * *\nThe action having been wrongly constituted, it might well be dismissed with costs on that ground. The appellant was entitled to come before the court only by way of originating notice under section 12. In Bashall v. Bashall[10], referred to in the 4th Ed. of Lush on Husband and Wife, at page 601, in which Collins J. held that a husband could not sue his wife in detinue, the action was dealt with as though it had been commenced under the corresponding section of the English legislation. I think that may be done in the present instance, but the fact that the appellant had no right of action by writ affects the question of costs.\nOn the merits the evidence, in my opinion, does not establish any title or interest in the respondent with respect to the real property but there is ample evidence to support the finding of the learned trial judge with respect to the chattels and the appeal as to the chattels should be dismissed with the variation that if the parties cannot agree as to their division there should be a reference to the Master. Ordinarily where proceedings of this nature are initiated while the parties are still husband and wife, the court will not make an order for possession of the matrimonial home in favour of the husband so long as the relationship subsists unless other provision in substitution is made for the wife; Hill v. Hill[11], D. and D., supra. It has been held however, in Hichens v. Hichens[12], that the court may conclude a proceeding involving questions of title, which was commenced subsequent to the decree nisi, notwithstanding the decree absolute and that in such a proceeding the fact of the decree absolute may be taken into consideration.\nAppeal allowed. The respondent is entitled to one half of her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, but no further order as to costs is made.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Herrington & Slater.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.W.S.

International Rules of the Road, article 16, (P.C. 259, 1897).\nThe steamer Fanad Head and the auxiliary fishing schooner Flora Alberta collided in a dense fog on the Western Bank fishing grounds off the Nova Scotia coast. The schooner sank with a loss of twenty-one of her crew of twenty-eight. The Fanad Head was one of a convoy of eight ships in command of a commodore. The convoy was formed in three columns, the commodore's ship led the centre column, the Fanad Head the port column of two ships, separated from the nearest ships by three cables abreast and two astern. Under Admiralty orders, transmitted by the commodore each ship was required to keep in convoy order both as to speed and course. For some time prior to the collision the ships were running at eight knots an hour without lights, except for a cluster of white lights at the stern as a guide for the following ships, and fog signals were blown every ten minutes by the leading ship of each column. On hearing a high pitched whistle ahead and to port, the Fanad Head sounded her column number independently and showed navigation lights, and hearing no reply, sounded again some few minutes later, but did not reduce speed. Three to four minutes later she again heard a high pitched whistle to port and a few minutes later saw lights 300 to 400 feet from the bow whereupon she put her helm hard to starboard, her engines full speed astern and blew three short blasts. The Flora Alberta was preceding through the fog at nine knots an hour and blowing her fog whistle at regular intervals and her survivors said they heard no other fog signals until a steamer's whistle was heard at about the same time as her lights were sighted a ship's length away bearing down on them. Efforts of both ships to avert the collision were unsuccessful.\nInternational Rides of the Road, article 16, (P.C. 259, 1897), provide that every vessel shall, in a fog go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and. conditions and that a steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nHeld: Admiralty Orders to ships in convoy both as to speed and course are subject to the responsibility of the master of each ship in any situation of danger taking such independent action as good seamanship may require. Larchbank v. British Petrol [1943] A.C. 299 followed.\nHeld: also, Taschereau J. dissenting, that the negligence of both ships contributed to the collision and the blame should be apportioned to the extent of two thirds to the Fanad Head and one third to the Flora Alberta.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting, the speed of the Fanad Head was the determining cause of the accident. It was the duty of her Master, when he heard the fog signals of the Flora Alberta to reduce to moderate speed, and if the latter's position could not be ascertained, to stop the engines and navigate carefully. It seems clear he only inferred her position but this is not sufficient, he must ascertain it. Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. China Navigation Co. [1935] A.C. 177. The finding of the trial judge that the Flora Alberta some time prior to the collision had reduced to a moderate speed, was right.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Carroll J., Local Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1.\nH. P. MacKeen K.C. and Gordon Dunnet for the appellant.\nW. P. Potter K.C. and Donald McInnis K.C. for the respondent. Taschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014The owners of the ship Flora Alberta, a fishing schooner, claim $100,000 from the British ship Fanad Head owned by the Ulster Steamship Company, Limited, as the result of a collision which occurred on the 21st of April, 1943, on the High Seas on the Western Bank Fishing Grounds, and at a distance of approximately 90 miles southeast of Halifax.\nThe Fanad Head has a length of 420 feet, a breadth of 59 feet, and a net registered tonnage of 3002 tons. She is powered by triple expansion engines and her maximum speed is 11\u00bd knots. She was mastered by Captain Thos. Heddles, and left Halifax on April 20, 1943, with a general cargo, forming part of a convoy, destined for the United Kingdom. There were eight ships in the convoy, and the Fanad Head was leading the port column, the Commodore's ship ss. Telapa with Captain Hugh Roberts, was leading the centre column and was in charge of the convoy. The third column on the starboard side, was led by the ss. Tetela. There were three ships in this last column, three in the centre column, and two in the port column, separated by three cables abreast and two cables in line. The convoy was steering a course of 132 degrees, with an ordered speed of 10 knots.\nThe Flora Alberta was a vessel of about 140 feet long, had a breadth of 26.4 feet, with a registered tonnage of 93 tons. She left Lunenburg, N.S. on the 17th of April, 1943, bound for the Western Bank Fishing Grounds, west of Sable Island. She reached these grounds on the 18th of April where she stayed on the 18th, 19th and 20th of April. In the course of her operations, she drifted eastward, but on the 21st of April, a course was made to return to the bank, due west magnetic. It was while returning to the Fishing Grounds that on the 21st of April, in the midst of a very dense fog, a collision occurred and the Flora Alberta sank within a few minutes). Of a crew of twenty-eight members, only seven were saved.\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice Carroll, L.J.A. with the assistance of a nautical assessor, found against the Fanad Head, and gave judgment for the owners of the Flora Alberta. The appellant now appeals from that judgment. The main facts as revealed by the evidence, may be summarized as follows:\u2014\nAt 2 a.m. Standard Time, on April 21st, the fog was very dense and the visibility was poor. The convoy was running in a northwest-southeast direction at a speed of 8 knots. Previously, this speed had been 10 knots, but it had been reduced, not on account of the fog, but because the convoy would otherwise have arrived too early at a planned rendezvous with ships which were to join the convoy. Under orders, the eight ships were running without lights, the only exception being a white cluster at the stern as a guide for the following ships. The Fanad Head had starboard lights, and the Commodore's ship was equipped with starboard and port lights, while the leader of the starboard column had port lights as a guide for the leaders. Every ten minutes fog signals were blown, consisting of various blasts indicating the leaders' numbers, beginning on the Commodore's ship' and then on the leader on starboard, the Tetela, and then by the port leader, the Fanad Head. These fog signals were the signals ordered for the convoy, but were not the ordinary fog signals required by the regulations.\nThe Flora Alberta was heading in a westerly direction with her starboard side towards the oncoming convoy. The suggestion that she had turned around in an easterly direction, has been rightly discarded by the learned trial judge. She had been running at a speed of about 9 knots, but some time before the collision, the Master noting the depth of the water, and realizing that he was nearing the fishing area, reduced the speed to approximately 4\u00bd knots. The fog whistle was blown at regular intervals.\nIt is also in evidence that at 4:10 the officers on the bridge and the lookout of the Fanad Head, heard the sound of a high pitched whistle, and a second one at 4:17, both on the port bow. Captain Roberts of the Telapa says:\u2014\nI heard some time afterwards a definite sound signal a little forward of our port beam, one long blast, and close to the convoy. I formed the opinion at that time that this signal had some connection with the previous one that I thought I heard. I was suspicious and I was on the alert, and I knew definitely then that there was a ship in the vicinity.\nAfter the first blast, Captain Heddles of the Fanad Head immediately ordered the navigation lights switched on his ship, blew his column number independently, and on hear- ing the second whistle sounded his column number again, but did not reduce his speed. A few minutes later, he saw a white light and a green light at about 300 or 400 feet from his bow. He then ordered \"Hard astarboard\" and \"full astern\", and blew three short blasts. On the Flora Alberta some members of the crew heard only one blast a few seconds before the accident. At the same moment they saw the lights of the Fanad Head, but it was obviously too late to avoid the collision.\nI have come to the conclusion that the Master of the Fanad Head cannot be exonerated. His speed of 8 knots in this dense fog was clearly in violation of Article 16 of the International Rules which reads as follows:\u2014\nArt. 16: Every vessel shall, in a fog, 'mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of 'her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nIt was obviously the duty of the Master of the Fanad Head when he heard the fog signals of the Flora Alberta to reduce to a moderate speed, and if the position of the Flora Alberta could not be ascertained, his only alternative was to stop the engines and navigate carefully. From the blasts that 'he heard, it seems clear that he only inferred the position of the Flora Alberta, but this is not sufficient. He must ascertain it. In Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. China Navigation Co.2, it was held:\u2014\nIn order that the position of a vessel whose fog-signal is heard by another vessel may be \"ascertained\" within the meaning of art. 16 of the Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea, the vessel must be known by the other vessel to be in such a position that both vessels can safely proceed without risk of collision. An inference as to the vessel's position, based upon the direction from which the fog-signal was heard, the probable course which she is taking, and the improbability of her crossing the fairway in a fog, is not an ascertainment justifying a disregard of the precautions enjoined by the above article. Implicit obedience to the Regulations, upon which navigators are entitled to rely, is of great importance.\nIn his judgment Lord MacMillan made the following statement:\u2014\nThe position of the Toyooka Maru was not in their Lordships' opinion ascertained within the meaning of the Regulations. It was inferred, \"not ascertained, and as it turned out the inference was wrong.\" In re Aras 3 Sir Gorell Barnes said:\u2014\nI think it is exactly the same because it is so well known\u2014so absolutely well known\u2014that it is impossible to rely upon the direction of whistles in a fog, that I do not think any man is justified in relying with certainty upon what he hears when the whistle is fine on the bow, and is not justified in thinking that it is broadening * * * unless he can make sure of it.\nThe failure of the Master of the Fanad Head to go at a moderate speed and to stop his engines was, in my view, negligence in the circumstances, and the determining cause of this unfortunate accident. Moreover, the Master of the Fanad Head knew that in that particular region of the Atlantic, many fishing schooners were in the vicinity, and he should therefore have exercised a more vigilant look-out.\nThe speed of the Flora Alberta was moderate. She blew her whistle which was admittedly heard by the Fanad Head, and the moment she heard what is now proved to be the second blast of the Fanad Head, it was too late to avoid the accident. Her failure to hear the first blast, does not appear to be the result of any negligence, but must be attributed to the vagaries of sound signals, transmitted through the air, and which are caused by the lack of uniformity in the density of the fog or the atmosphere.\nIt is argued on behalf of the appellant that the Fanad Head forming part of the convoy, was subject to the orders of the Commodore, and that the precise orders were that the speed was to be 8 knots. It is said that the Commodore had a legal authority to give such an order as to speed, and that the Fanad Head was under a legal compulsion to obey the order of 8 knots while in convoy, and while subject to those orders.\nOn this point the law seems to be well settled.\nIn Larchbank v. British Petrol, 4, it was held that an \"emergency\" had arisen, not by reason of the mere fact of the fog, but because the Master of the British Petrol had good reason to think that the Larchbank might be approaching, even though he could not hear her, and that accordingly he should have sounded fog signals. The Larchbank was under orders to join a convoy, and although the British Admiralty had forbidden fog signals, it was held that in such an \"emergency\" the ordinary rules of the sea should be followed, and that fog signals should have been given.\nIn the Scottish Musician 5 it had been previously decided:\u2014\nA vessel enclosed in convoy has the same duty as every other vessel on the sea to take every possible means to avoid a collision. She is not to regard hereself, because she is in convoy as a vessel which is excused from keeping a lookout outside the convoy * * * On the contrary she has to take every possible means of avoiding a collision which she can take without danger, that is to say without creating more imminent danger still to her consorts in the convoy. She has a duty to the convoy to keep her station, but she must not press that duty to the point of never taking measures to keep out of the way of some other vessel which is threatening her with collision.\nIf any further authority is needed on that point, vide the Vernon City 6, and on Appeal 7. Nowhere will it be seen that a ship in a convoy must not take \"individual action\" when necessary, to avoid a collision, particularly as in the present case, where it is clear that an \"emergency\" arose.\nSuch also were the orders of the Commodore who clearly states in his evidence, that if a ship is in danger, she has to take individual action. The instructions of the Admiralty are that the Master of a ship, although in convoy, is responsible for the safety of his ship, and that if she is in any position of danger, it is for him to take whatever action he thinks fit. He says quite frankly that if, in his opinion, there is any danger, after hearing a whistle of a ship coming near him, he would naturally take some action irrespective of any ship astern or on either side of his own ship, and forming part of a convoy.\nFor these reasons I think that the trial judge was right, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014This is a case of collision. The fishing vessel Flora Alberta, between four and five o'clock Atlantic Daylight Time on the morning of April 21, 1943, was running on a west by north course in a dense fog approaching fishing banks lying about 90 miles to the south-east of Halifax. She had been hove to during the night and had drifted some distance to the east of the banks. The final speed is in dispute, but it is admitted that she had for some time been making at least eight knots an hour. The contention is that the speed had been reduced to 4\u00bd knots, and the trial judge has found the order for this to have been given about 15 minutes before the crash. Tanner, the captain, is contradictory. At one place he says he rang for reduced speed while in the pilot house, and in another while on his way to examine the key-sounding device in his cabin; in each case just before going to breakfast. He estimated the time between the signal and the impact at two or three minutes. On board the Fanad Head he spoke of ten knots as his speed. After making every allowance for the circumstance that he was then nearing the fishing grounds, I can find nothing to justify the finding of a 15-minute interval or an actual speed of 4\u00bd knots. I take the fact to be that some few minutes before the collision an order was given to reduce speed, but that the actual final speed was several knots greater than 4\u00bd and on that footing, having regard to the dense fog and the surrounding circumstances, I am unable to agree that the speed was not excessive. So far, therefore, the vessel was proceeding in violation of the rules of the sea.\nWas the Fanad Head at fault? She was one of a convoy of seven or eight vessels sailing in a generally south-easterly direction from Halifax in three columns a distance of three cables apart with the ships following each other at two cables or 1200 feet. The Fanad Head was the leading ship on the port side. In the center was the commodore's ship Tilapa and on the starboard the Tetela. In the port column one ship followed the Fanad Head. From 2 a.m. until 'after the accident, the convoy had been moving at eight knots an hour in the fog and from that time until about 4:06 standard time convoy signals had been given at intervals of ten minutes or thereabouts. These would be initiated by the commodore's vessel and would consist of five blasts, the first one two or three, short, to indicate the column, and they would be sounded only by the leading vessel of each line.\nAbout 4:10 a high pitched whistle was heard on the Fanad Head which appeared to come from slightly to port of the vessel's bow. At that time the master, Heddles, the first officer, Rea, an apprentice of twenty years, Stark, and the helmsman, were on the bridge and either then or shortly afterwards the second officer, Davey. The first three agree in their statements of what took place.\nHeddles describes the whistle as \"one blast of a high pitched whistle ahead on the port bow;\" \"we waited to see what would happen to see if they would blow again. Then the Chief Officer blew.\" It was the convoy signal, and was given independently of the commodore. It was blown a second time, likewise without regard to the commodore. After three or four minutes, the whistle was heard again three points on the port bow. He puts the time between two whistles at seven or eight minutes.\nIt is beyond doubt that the apparent shift from stem to three points port indicated to him a single vessel crossing from starboard to port and that she was out of danger; but \"a few minutes later\" they saw the loom of a white and a green light \"about 3\u00bd points on the port bow\" and at about two ships' length or 800 feet away. On the bearing of the first whistle the master was adamant; the second whistle made it obvious to him that the vessel was going clear; and \"I assumed she was clear.\"\nAs admittedly the Alberta was on a westerly or north of westerly course when the two met, some explanation had to be given of the change, and the master insisted that between the time of the first 'whistle and the collision she had about turned. \"She turned around. She could not possibly have come against me if she had not.\" This leaves no room for doubt of the effect upon his mind of the second whistle. Later on: \"I considered the danger was over when she altered her course.\" Asked \"And you say you sounded it again when you heard the whistle the second time?\"\u2014he answered: \"We blew our column number twice between his blasts to attract his attention\"; and later on, \"I did not consider an emergency had arisen until I sighted the Flora Alberta three points on the port bow.\" This evidence excludes the suggestion that after hearing the second whistle, any signal was given before the fishing vessel hove in sight when three short blasts were sounded.\nRea is to the same effect. He says: \"At about ten past four we heard a medium length blast of a high note on ahead. I immediately sounded my column number in reply, one short and four long\": \"we took independent action when we heard the whistle\": \"I waited then for about two or three minutes and then sounded the column number again. There was still no reply.\" Later: \"A couple of minutes after I sounded my column number the second time, we heard this same note about three points to the port bow. Just after that, about a minute, I saw a white light and the starboard green light and they appeared to me to be about a couple of ships' length away.\" The vessel was \"closing on us very rapidly.\" \"Thereupon the master ordered hard to starboard and rang the engines full astern.\" \"As he did that, I sounded three short blasts on our steam whistle.\" He agreed that he signalled \"twice when you blew your column number and then you blew three short blasts when you went astern.\" Asked, \"Did you take any steps after hearing that whistle (the second)\" he answered \"We had no time to take any step's, not at that time\"; \"Until I saw the green light, I thought it had gone from ahead to the port side going clear of me\" and \"We (meaning the master, Mr. Davey and the witness) all assumed it had gone clear.\" Questioned: \"You blew your column number twice you say;\" his answer was: \"Yes, between the two blasts we heard we blew once and then waited two or three minutes and then blew it again.\"\nStark is to the same effect. After the first whistle \"We immediately sounded our column number, and at the same time switched on the navigation lights, full brilliancy;\" \"About two minutes later we again blew our column number.\" Still later, \"We heard the same whistle again. We heard it broad on our port bow\", and \"Just about a minute after that we saw the lights\u2014a green side light and white masthead light.\" The vessel seemed to be coming across \"our bow at about 90 or 100 degrees.\" Asked \"What happened after 'the first whistle fine on the port bow\", he answered, \"We sounded our whistle independently of the commodore.\" Then: \"Did you hear the commodore sound his whistle after this deep-toned whistle (the first)?\" \"No, I never heard the commodore sound his whistle again.\" He gave the times of the three column signals sounded while he was on the bridge prior to the collision as: 4:06, 4:10 and about 4:12. The first had been a regular signal led by the commodore; and the witness means that after that sounding, the commodore's whistle was not heard again before the accident.\nNow, against this very clear and positive evidence by the persons most interested, there is, first, that of the commodore himself. Shortly after four o'clock he heard a faint whistle; it appeared to come \"fine on the port side of the convoy.\" He says: \"As a precaution, I sounded my column number\" and, asked whether he heard an answer, replied, \"I could definitely say that whenever I sounded my column number the leaders of the other two columns sounded theirs.\" Some minutes later he heard \"a definite sound signal a little forward of our port beam.\" \"About two or three points forward of our port beam and apparently close to the convoy.\" \"We immediately blew our column numbers, but I am not sure whether it was the Fanad Head who blew hers first. If she did, we would wait until she had finished sounding before we sounded so as not to have a confusion of signals. But there was definitely plenty of noise at that time.\" \"Did you do anything else on your vessel? No. This other ship being on that bearing, I knew my ship was clear, and it was too late to take any action for the convoy as a whole.\" Then: \"Did you sound any further column signals before you heard the three short blasts of which you have spoken\"; \"I cannot remember that, because we blew our whistles so often; knowing that there was a ship close to, we would blow our whistle as frequently as possible until all danger was past.\"\nThis testimony is vague and general compared with what, I have just considered. He is clearly confused about the initiation of the signals and I cannot accept it as going specifically to the sounding of a convoy signal after the second whistle. I draw the inference that he was satisfied, in the situation of the convoy, to leave to the Fanad Head the responsibility for dealing with the unknown craft ahead.\nThen there is Davey. He is asked at once, \"What did you hear?\" \"I heard a high sounding whistle on the port bow.\" And, \"having heard that whistle signal, did you hear any other signals?\"; \"We all sounded our column signals.\" But later: \"I heard it (the whistle) a couple of times. I do not know whether the chief officer heard it or how many times he heard it.\" \"I do not know whether her first whistle was reported. We may or may not have heard it all together.\" On re-examination: \"Do you remember where you were on the first occasion that you heard her first signal?\"; \"I am not sure about that, but I believe I was in the chart room when I heard her whistle the first time:\" \"It may have been\" in that room. This likewise cannot be taken to qualify the statements of the others. He is hazy about the circumstances of both whistles and not being on duty after four o'clock, although at times actually on the bridge, it would be but natural that the particular incidents affecting the navigation of the vessel would be more vividly impressed upon the minds of those on whom the immediate responsibility rested.\nThen Ward on the lookout is asked: \"After you had heard that (the second whistle) did you hear anything more from your own ship\"; \"Yes, she blew again.\" And, \"In about a minute\u2014it might have been a little more or less\u2014 I saw a white light bearing down on the port bow.\" Previously in speaking of the convoy signals: \"I could not say exactly how many times I heard them, but I heard them a few times\u2014twice or something like that\u2014\" Describing the signals given after the first whistle, he says: \"Yes, our own ship then blew some shorts and longs.\" Asked \"How many times had she blown that signal (the convoy signal) before you heard this other whistle signal?\" \"I don't know; I didn't pay any attention to our whistle blown.\" This evidence, too, lacks precision, and I am unable to treat it as affecting in any degree that of those on the bridge.\nThe vessels of the convoy, being under Admiralty orders as given to them by the commodore, were required generally to keep in convoy order both as to speed and position. This duty, however, was admittedly subject to the responsibility of each vessel to meet any situation of danger in which she might find herself. When, therefore, the second whistle was heard two or three points off the port bow at a distance which the commodore took to be not far from the convoy, did a situation of danger present itself to the Fanad Head which called for the independent exercise of good seamanship? I think the case comes directly within Larchbank v. British Petrol 8. The word \"emergency\" in the Admiralty direction there is the equivalent of \"danger\" here. The assumption by the master and officers of the Fanad Head that the Alberta was on a starboard-to-port course and had got clear was quite unwarranted. They could not justifiably act on the view that the same vessel had given both signals or upon the apparent quarter from which the first whistle came. Both signals indicated a vessel in motion forward of the beam and the situation called imperatively for at least such action on the part of the Fanad Head as could be taken without danger to or serious dislocation of the ships of the convoy. Nothing of that sort would have resulted from sound signals at the moment of the second whistle. Although it is difficult to be precise, yet it is I think unquestionable that at least from two to three minutes elapsed between the second whistle and the sighting of the lights of the Alberta. The three blasts were clearly heard by the Alberta and there is the strongest probability that had a signal been sounded at 4:17 it would have been heard on the Alberta. The failure to hear the signals given four or five minutes before when both vessels were making eight knots is, in the conditions of fog, quite consistent with that conclusion. It is evident, too, that with that additional two or more minutes there would have been sufficient time to manoeuvre the Alberta out of collision.\nAgainst this neglect, Mr. McKeen urges both the failure of the Alberta to hear the earlier signals sent out by the Fanad Head and to have seen the latter much sooner than it did. In the weather conditions then prevailing, swell, heavy fog and wind, the vagaries of sound are notorious: and counsel was driven to say that those who should have been on deck duty were either asleep or below: but their fog signals were being given and heard; and considering the circumstances and the ordinary apprehension of a fishing vessel for fog-shrouded dangers, I find it impossible to treat their evidence in this respect as deliberately false. It is a corroborating circumstance that the master of the Tetela, 1800 feet approximately south-westerly of the com- modore, did not hear the second whistle although he did hear the crash of the vessels coming together; and the distance between the Tetela and the Alberta at say 4:17 was considerably less than between the Fanad Head and the Alberta at say 4:13.\nNor can I conclude that the Alberta should have seen the Fanad Head in time to swing out of danger. The vessels were coming together at a rate of between 20 and 25 feet a second: and as the first officer, Rea, says, the final events crowded rapidly. Even if the Fanad Head had been seen at the moment of the emergency signal, the evidence would not justify us in saying that reasonable action by the Alberta would have been sufficient.\nIn these circumstances the question remains whether the Alberta by her violation of Article XVI contributed to the collision. Those on board the schooner could reasonably expect a reply from any vessel hearing their signal and the Fanad Head should have given it: the failure to do so misled the Alberta and influenced in fact both her course and speed: and that had the answer been given, the schooner, notwithstanding her speed, could have avoided the collision, is virtually conceded. Mr. McKeen's strenuous contention was that even after the three blasts there was time to have taken avoiding action; and to add two or three minutes longer is to conclude the question.\nBut rules of the road accumulate precautions in the general interest of safety; lookout, speed and sound signals anticipate not only accidental and unavoidable circumstances and situations, but the careless and the misjudged as well; and it is not sufficient for the respondent to say that the reply signal would have enabled him to nullify his own delinquency. What we are determining is liability and not abstract causation and it has not been shown that the collision would have taken place regardless of the speed of the Alberta.\nAlthough there is no order of precedence in these measures for safety, yet their actual interrelation is to be taken into account in determining degrees of responsibility. Sound signals are clearly dominant in fog and the error on the part of the Fanad Head was far more serious in its consequences than the excessive speed. I would, therefore, attribute to the fishing vessel one-third and to the Fanad Head two-thirds of responsibility.\nThe appeal should be allowed in part with costs in this Court and the judgment below varied accordingly. The respondent will be entitled to two-thirds of its costs in the Court below.\nKellock J.:\u2014It is not necessary to repeat an outline of the main facts appearing in evidence. With respect to the speed of the Flora Alberta when the Fanad Head was sighted, I think the learned trial judge was in error in his finding that it had been reduced to approximately four and one-half knots almost fifteen minutes before the collision. I find no evidence to support that finding. Nor do I think that attention should not be paid to the statement admittedly made by Captain Tanner aboard the Fanad Head the afternoon of the day of the collision. The learned trial judge did not hear any of the evidence of this witness and I see no reason why the statement most nearly related in time to the event here in question should not be taken as more reliable than statements made on much later occasions when the evidence of the witness, taken as a whole, appears to have been given without due care to be accurate. Tanner gives no reason why the statement should not be taken as representing the fact.\nRea, the first officer of the Fanad Head says that Tanner, on being asked as to the speed of the Flora Alberta, said that he was making ten knots. This evidence does not stand by itself. Captain Heddles, of the Fanad Head, said that in his opinion the speed of the Flora Alberta, when he observed her come out of the fog, was at least nine knots. Rea says the Flora Alberta was, at the same time, \"cruising rapidly\". In my opinion, therefore, it should be found that the speed of the Flora Alberta at the time of the collision and at all relevant times before that event was at least nine knots. That this was excessive in the circumstances, I have no doubt.\nNone of the witnesses called for the respondent would admit having heard any of the whistling of the Fanad Head or of any of the other convoy leaders. The reason given, in argument, was the existence of fog and the well known vagaries of sound in fog. If, however, one were to have regard to the evidence of Captain Tanner alone, he said, in answer to his own counsel, that under the conditions prevailing on that particular morning, the whistle of an ordinary steamer could be heard at a distance of seven or eight miles. There is also the fact that the whistling of the convoy leaders was heard in both directions, i.e., the whistling of the Telapa and the Tetela was heard by the Fanad Head and that of the latter by the Telapa. No witness was called from the Tetela, the leader of the starboard column.\nThe recklessness of speeding through the fog at nine knots in an area where, as Tanner knew, a convoy might be met with, does not add to the acceptability of the evidence on behalf of the respondents on this point. That such evidence is not to receive automatic acceptance is of course clear; The Curran 9, is an illustration, if one be needed. But I am, however, not prepared to find that the convoy signals were heard or should have been heard had a proper lookout been kept on the Flora Alberta. Negligence, however, in the matter of speed is to be charged to that vessel.\nAs to the visibility at the place and time immediately, preceding the collision, the only witnesses for the respondents who were able to speak, were the lookout, Knickle, and the helmsman, John Reinhardt, The others, with the exception of Best, who was drowned, were below when the Fanad Head was sighted. Knickle says he heard the Fanad Head's whistle and saw her lights at the same time. He says he did not see the form of the other ship at any time. He estimates the distance between the two ships as \"100 feet or so\", or about a ship's length, i.e., 140 feet, but he says, what is of course obvious, that he cannot be sure. As to the time interval between sighting the lights and the collision, he says he just had \"time enough to go aft and time enough to get back\". This is not very helpful.\nJohn Reinhardt also saw the steamer's lights at the same time as he heard the last whistle blown by her. He estimates the distance then separating the vessels at two shiplengths, which would be about two hundred and eighty feet, but he says he could not say how far she was away. It was the whistle which attracted the attention of both these witnesses.\nCaptain Heddles, of the Fanad Head, estimates the visibility at eight to nine hundred feet. When he saw the Flora Alberta he says she was about that distance away. Rea, the Chief Officer of the Fanad Head, says the same thing. Captain Roberts, the Commodore, estimated the visibility of lights at the time at about the same distance. Davey, the second officer of the Fanad Head, says the white light of the Flora Alberta was over a ship's length away when he saw it, but he cannot be more definite than more than a ship's length and less than three cables.\nStark, the apprentice on the Fanad Head, estimates the distance at not more than a ship's length. The Fanad Head is 420 feet long. Dennis Ward, the lookout on the Fanad Head, says he \"could just about make the bridge out and no more; just the outline of the bridge I could make out\"; i.e., the bridge of his own ship. He says further, however, , that when he saw the white light of the Flora Alberta he could not say whether it was at a greater or less distance than that between him and the bridge. He could not \"estimate the distance of light in fog\".\nWhen the helmsman on the Flora Alberta saw the appellant ship he turned his vessel to port and when Captain Tanner heard Knickle's call he came up on deck and gave Reinhardt the order to stop. The latter then rang for the stopping of the engine. The Fanad Head had reversed her engines when she whistled the last time and had also starboarded her helm.\nAs to the Fanad Head, it is admitted that she was subject to binding orders which required her to keep in the convoy, on its course, and at its speed. This does not mean, however, that she had to continue blindly no matter what eventuated. She was also obligated, if occasion arose, to observe the rules of good seamanship, having regard to the fact that there was a vessel behind her, which might as well as other vessels in the convoy on her starboard be out of position. I do not find fault with the Fanad Head because she did not stop her engines when she heard the whistle of the Flora Alberta on either the first or second occasion, having regard to her being in convoy and to the presence of the other vessels I have mentioned. I think, however, that her officers erred in assuming that the ship whose whistle was heard on two occasions, if it were in fact the same ship, had gone out of danger. No doubt they assumed that ship would have heard the whistling of their ship and that of the other convoy leaders just as the Fanad Head had heard the whistle of the Flora Alberta, but they erred in assuming that they had ascertained either her course or position. I think the Fanad Head ought to have sounded on hearing the Flora Alberta not only as she did the first time, but the second time as well when the latter was much closer, and failure to do so constituted negligence directly contributing to the collision.\nI think, however, that the excessive speed of the Flora Alberta was negligence of the same character. She was struck almost amidships. Therefore, as little as 100 feet would have made all the difference. Kerr, the engineer on the Fanad Head says that from the time he had got the engines of his ship going astern until he felt the bump of the collision was from one to one and a half minutes. There is a considerable body of evidence to the same effect. In one minute the Flora Alberta would travel 900 feet at nine knots and the Fanad Head 800 at eight knots.\nIn The Campania 10, Gorell Barnes J. said at p. 296:\n* * * as a general rule, speed, such that another vessel cannot be avoided after being seen, is excessive: see The City of Brooklyn 11.\nThe reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge were approved in the Court of Appeal.\nIn The Counsellor 12, Bargrave Deane J. said at p. 72:\nI think a very fair rule to make is this, and it is one which has been suggested to me by one of the Elder Brethren: you ought not to go so fast in a fog that you cannot pull up within the distance that you can see.\nIn The Zadok 13, Sir James Hannen said at p. 115:\nIt was the duty of both vessels under Article 13, to go at a moderate speed, and it appears to me that the object with which that rule of conduct is imposed is, not merely that the vessels should go at a speed which will lessen the violence of a collision, but also that they shall go at a speed which will give as much time as possible for the making of any proper manoeuvres which may become necessary by unforeseen circumstances\u2014for, in a fog, it cannot be told exactly from what quarter the danger may come. Without laying down any hard and fast rule in the terms of either Gorell Barnes J. or Bargrave Deane J., it is nevertheless apparent that the excessive speed of the Flora Alberta not only placed her in the path of the Fanad Head but also rendered her, when those on board did observe the Fanad Head, unable to man\u0153uvre out of danger which might have been possible had she been going as she ought to have been. The contrary is not to be presumed. Reinhardt, the helmsman, testified that if the Flora Alberta were going slowly she would answer her helm better than if she were going fast. There would have been more time for her to have answered her helm and more opportunity to have reversed her engine which apparently was not even attempted.\nI am also of opinion that the excessive speed itself may well have contributed to the failure of those on board the Flora Alberta to hear any of the whistling on the part of the convoy. The excessive speed in question would undoubtedly increase the noise of her passage through the water and it may well be also that the throb of her engine and the exhaust at that speed caused greater interference with the reception of sound than if she had been moving as she should have been in the circumstances.\nI think therefore that the Flora Alberta must be held to blame to the extent of one-third and I would allow the appeal to that extent. I think the appellant should have its costs in this court and the respondent two-thirds of the costs in the court below.\nEstey J.:\u2014This litigation arises out of a collision between the fishing schooner Flora Alberta and the Fanad Head, one of eight ships in a convoy, on the Western Bank Fishing Grounds about 90 miles out of Halifax. The learned trial Judge in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court in the district of Nova Scotia held the Fanad Head solely responsible.\nThe Flora Alberta was observing Atlantic Daylight Saving Time and the Fanad Head Atlantic Time. For convenience I have set forth all times on the basis of Atlantic Daylight Saving Time.\nThe collision occurred on the morning of April 21, 1942. at about 5.20 in a dense fog, a light north-west wind and a heavy swell. The Flora Alberta was proceeding west-by-north and the Fanad Head was proceeding 132\u00b0 true at the head of the third or port side column of a convoy that had set out from Halifax the preceding afternoon. The fog had existed since 3.00 a.m. and the extent of visibility without lights was about 400 to 500 feet and with lights about 800 to 900 feet. The eight ships in the convoy were placed three in a centre column, three in a starboard column and two in a port column, in the latter were the Fanad Head in the lead with the Timothy Dwight behind her. The commodore of the convoy was on the Tilapa at the head of the centre column. These columns were about 1800 feet apart and in the column the ships were about 1200 feet apart.\nAs it left Halifax this was a sectional convoy proceeding at 10 knots per hour. At that speed this section would have arrived at the point fixed for meeting the main convoy too early and therefore the commodore, sometime after leaving Halifax, reduced the speed of this section to 8 knots per hour, which speed the Fanad Head maintained until the collision was inevitable. At 5.00 a.m. Captain Heddles of the Fanad Head, his Chief Officer Rea, Second Officer Davey and Midshipman Stark were on duty, and Lookout Ward was on the forecastle head. Because of the dense fog the ships at the head of the respective columns were sounding their column numbers about every eight to ten minutes and were proceeding without lights, except a cluster in the rear and side lights in the front.\nAt about 5.00 a.m. Captain Heddles \"heard a blast, a short high note \u2026 ahead on the port bow.\" The Chief Officer blew his column number, the navigating lights were put on \"full brilliance\" and Captain Heddles \"waited to see what would happen, to see if they would blow again.\" He did not stop the Fanad Head, as he explained, \"because there was a ship lying astern, a ship; and on instructions in the convoy, we were to maintain our convoy speed.\" He did not reduce his speed. Three or four minutes later he repeated the column number. Seven or eight minutes after hearing the first blast he again heard the short high note about \"three points on the port bow\" which, as he states, led him \"to believe that she had crossed out of danger\" and a few minutes later, he saw \"the loom of a white light and one green one about three and one half points on the port bow.\" Captain Heddles then observed the Flora Alberta was crossing his bow and \"immediately put the helm hard to starboard and the engines full speed astern, -giving three blasts to that ship and to the next astern to indicate I was going full speed astern.\" These steps were of no avail and the Fanad Head struck the Flora Alberta amidships on the starboard side causing it to sink immediately when twenty-one of its crew of twenty-eight lost their lives. It appears obvious, and, indeed, it was not contested, that from the moment the Flora Alberta was seen the collision was inevitable. Nor is it contended that there was any negligence on the part of Captain Heddles prior to his hearing the first whistle. The entire issue so far as the Fanad Head is concerned is the conduct of its officers after they heard the first whistle.\nThe masters before leaving Halifax received certain instructions, the legality of which are admitted and which in these proceedings were deposed to by the commodore. It is significant that these instructions, so far as disclosed, did not cover circumstances such as encountered by the Fanad Head. It would rather appear that the management of the vessels was left in such circumstances to the commodore and his masters to take such action as good seamanship under the circumstances would require.\nThe commodore, referring to the duty of the captains or masters of the respective ships, stated:\nIf she is in convoy she is supposed to keep the course and speed of the convoy; but the Admiralty instructions are that the Master of a ship is responsible for the safety of his ship and if there is any position of danger it is up to the Master to take what action he thinks fit.\nHe further deposed:\nQ. Do you expect a ship under your command to go on and to continue steaming at some 7.5 knots after hearing a ship ahead of her sounding?\nA. No.\nQ. Do you, as Commodore, expect a ship under your command\u2014one of the leading ships of your convoy\u2014to steam on at a speed of 7.5 knots on hearing a fog signal forward of her beam?\nA. I would not expect that; she should in those circumstances take individual action, but that individual action depends on the Master of the ship. He further deposed relative to the master of the ship:\nHis orders are that he has to endeavour to keep his station in the convoy, but at the same time under Admiralty orders a Master is considered responsible for the safe navigation of his ship.\nCaptain Heddles himself when asked the question: \"You say that in convoy you must carry right on until you get an order to change?\" replied: \"No, sir. Not in an emergency. You take steps to avert trouble.\"\nThe commodore 'himself heard a faint whistle shortly after 5.00 a.m. but no one else on the Tilapa heard it. Then later he heard a definite sound signal, one long blast forward of his port beam but \"it was then too late to take any action for the convoy as a whole.\" This would indicate that at that time the commodore expected each ship to act upon its own initiative. When he heard the three short blasts he realized that the Fanad Head must have sighted the other ship.\nThat Captain Heddles when he heard the first whistle or \"short high note * * * ahead on the port bow\" was in a \"position of danger\" or emergency must follow from the fact that he knew he was proceeding through a fishing ground in a dense fog at a speed which apart from a convoy was admittedly excessive, and even in a convoy at a speed greater than the commodore would have expected once he heard a whistle. Under such circumstances it was his duty to take individual action. That he appreciated his position is evidenced by the fact that he immediately \"switched on the navigating lights full brilliance,\" sounded his column number (one short and four long), then \"waited to see what would happen, to see if they would blow again.\" In taking those steps he was acting on his own initiative. He did not, however, reduce the speed of the Fanad Head. When nothing transpired in three or four minutes he again blew his column number. Seven or eight minutes after he heard the first whistle he again heard the short high note, this time \"about three points on the port bow,\" which led him \"to believe that she had crossed out of danger.\" A few minutes later he saw the light of the Flora Alberta about three and one half points on the port bow at a distance of about 800 feet crossing the bow of the Fanad Head.\" This meant that the Flora Alberta was now going in a direction almost directly opposite to that Captain Heddles had concluded she was proceeding when he heard the first and second whistle. Indeed, he himself explained that somewhere between 5.17 a.m., or possibly earlier, and 5.20 a.m. the Flora Alberta \"turned around. She could not possibly have come against me if she had not.\" The circumstances and the other evidence do not support any such change of direction on the part of the Flora Alberta. Then when asked: \"Can you ascertain, with any degree of accuracy at all, the place from where the whistle comes?\" Captain Heddles himself replied: \"When it is clear, you can get the direction. On this occasion, when it was dull, it was difficult to locate it.\" All of the evidence emphasizes how unreliable is any conclusion as to distance or location of a whistle heard in a fog. The evidence of experienced seamen, including the commodore who said: \"Sound at sea is very deceptive,\" as well as the expert, make it clear that it is impossible to judge with any degree of accuracy the distance or location of the source of a sound heard at sea during a fog. It is stated in 30 Hals. 2nd Ed., p; 730, para. 940:\nIt is not correct, again, to say that a whistle having been heard, it can be located so as to be certain that it is a precise bearing on the bow; case after case in the Admiralty Court shows that that is not true.\nAs stated by Sir Gorell Barnes, on behalf of the Privy Council:\nIt is notorious that it is a matter of the very greatest difficulty to make out the direction and distance of a whistle heard in a fog, and that it is almost impossible to rely with certainty on being able to determine the precise bearing and distance of a fog \"signal when it is heard * * *\" The Chinkiang 14, quoted in H.M.S. Malaya, (1937) P. 191.\nOnce Captain Heddles found himself in what was a \"position of danger\" or emergency, it was his duty to take such action as good seamanship would require. The F. J. Wolfe.15 What in a particular case constitutes good seamanship is a question of fact. That the Fanad Head was here in a convoy is a circumstance to be considered along with the other circumstances, and when the master is thus called upon to take individual action the requirements of the \"International Rules of the Road\", adopted by Canada in 1897 (P.C. 259, 1897) become important. Even if they be not binding on a ship in convoy, they do embody the principles or requirements of good seamanship. As stated by Scott, L.J. in The F. J. Wolfe, supra, at p. 95:\nThose rules represent the considered views of almost generations of seamen of many nations.\nArticles 16 and 29 of these Rules read as follows:\nArticle 16. Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.\nA steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel, the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.\nArticle 29. Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, or master, or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper lookout, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.\nThe foregoing evidence and quotations relative to the location of the source of a whistle were illustrated in relation to art. 16 of the \"International Rules of the Road\" in Nippon Yusen Kaisha v. China Navigation Co. Ltd. 16, where two vessels were signalling each other in a dense fog. In that case the master of the Kiangsu concluded that from the fog whistle the position of the Toyooka Maru was on the south side of the channel. Their Lordships, in construing the word \"ascertained\" as it appears in the foregoing art. 16, stated at p. 182:\n* * * in the present case the only data were that the fog-signals were heard on the Kiangsu's port bow, that outward bound vessels keep to the south side of the channel and that it was improbable that a vessel would be crossing the fairway in a fog. An inference based on these data was not in their Lordships' opinion an ascertainment on which it was justifiable to disregard the precaution enjoined by Regulation 16. In order that the position of a vessel may be ascertained by another vessel within the meaning of the Regulation she must be known by that other vessel to be in such a position that both vessels can safely proceed without risk of collision.\nCaptain Heddles never ascertained the position of the Flora Alberta in that sense. His experience as a seaman should have indicated that any conclusion that he might entertain as to the location of the vessel sounding the whistle could not be accepted as reliable and ought not to be acted upon, certainly not in a manner to justify his proceeding as he did. The Fanad Head when it heard the second whistle was still in a position of danger or emergency. The duties of a master of a ship in such a position are described by Langton, J.:\nThe handling of a vessel when and after the whistle of the Lairdcastle was first heard falls into a somewhat different category. There was no convoy order to the effect that she was not to stop on hearing a whistle forward of her beam, and she is also open to criticism in not having stopped her engines at the moment when she first sighted the masthead light of the Lairdcastle. These are matters which fall to be decided in relation to the particular circumstances of each individual case. The Vernon City 17 affirmed on appeal 18.\nThe foregoing quotation repeats that which has been so often stated, that each of these collision cases must be decided upon its own facts. Both that statement and the individual responsibility of a master for the conduct of his ship in an emergency is emphasized in the Larchbank v. British Petrol 19. The master of the British Petrol, proceeding in a convoy, did not sound his fog signal when he knew the Larchbank was manoeuvring in a dense fog to take a position in the same convoy and immediately behind the British Petrol. The master explained he did not do so because he was forbidden by Admiralty Regulations. It was held in effect that he had misconstrued the Admiralty Regulations, which required that he under the circumstances should exercise his own discretion. The House of Lords affirmed the view of the learned trial Judge that in the emergency that there existed the master of the British Petrol was negligent in not sounding his fog signals. Lord Wright at p. 307 stated:\nThe extra and abnormal risk which here, in my opinion, constituted emergency consisted in the nearness of the Larchbank when the fog came down, her probable and at least possible operation of continuing to join the convoy, and the impossibility in the absence of fog signals, after the weather became so thick, of knowing where she was or what she was doing, particularly as no signal was heard from her. The master was, indeed, left with a discretion whether he would or would not sound his fog signal, or, if so, how often. This is a separate issue which only arises if there is found to be emergency. I think there was emergency. The judge has found, and I agree with him, that he exercised his discretion wrongly.\nIn that case both of the ships were held to be negligent, and the fault apportioned three-quarters to the Larchbank and one-quarter to the British Petrol. While Captain Heddles, when he heard the first whistle, sounded his column number and three or four minutes later did so again, the evidence does not disclose that after hearing the whistle a second time he caused any whistle to be sounded on the Fanad Head. He did not do so, as he explained, because he concluded that the ship sounding that whistle had passed out of danger. An experienced master, as already stated, was not justified in relying upon such a 'conclusion. If he had sounded a whistle at that time when the vessels had come much closer to each other, it would probably have been heard by the crew of the Flora Alberta and as two or three minutes still remained before the collision, it is possible that steps might have been taken by those on the latter vessel to avoid a collision. In fact he neither founded the whistle nor stopped his engines. Nothing was done and the Fanad Head continued at 8 knots until the lights of the Flora Alberta were actually seen and when he sounded the three blasts. The conclusion is unavoidable that at that time the position was such that nothing could have been done on the part of either crew to avoid a collision.\nCaptain Heddles knew that he was passing through a fishing ground in a dense fog when he heard the first whistle. In spite of that he took only the precautions, which have been mentioned, of putting on the lights and sounding the column number. When he heard the second whistle his conduct, based upon his conclusion as to the position of the Flora Alberta, would not be accepted as good seamanship. It was as a consequence of that conclusion that he took no further precautions. Under the circumstances of the fog, the whistles and his position in the fishing grounds, it was negligence on his part to maintain the speed of the Fanad Head at 8 knots up to the time when the 'Collision was unavoidable.\nThe evidence of Captain Tanner of the Flora Alberta and of his officers, Reinhardt and Knickle, was taken before other than the learned trial Judge, who, therefore, had not the advantage of observing the witnesses as they gave their evidence. He could but read their evidence and was in this regard in the same position as members of an appellate court with respect to the inferences and conclusions to be drawn.\nThe Flora Alberta had been on the fishing grounds since the 18th. On the morning of the 21st she had drifted eastward when at 4.00 a.m. her engines were started, and with foresail and mainsail set she was proceeding first due north and from 4.30 a.m. west-by-north at 9 knots per hour. Captain Tanner had altered the course at 4.30 and had gone down to breakfast three or four minutes before the collision. He heard no signal and just before he went down to breakfast he signalled for half speed, or 4\u00bd knots. The learned trial judge finds that Captain Tanner \"about fifteen minutes before the collision, reduced his speed to approximately 4\u00bd knots.\" With great respect, the evidence does not support such a finding. Indeed, apart from the statement that the signal was given just before he went to breakfast there is nothing to support the evidence that a reduction in speed was effected. It is not mentioned by any other of the witnesses of the Flora Alberta; moreover, while every allowance must be made for the pain and exhaustion he suffered that day, it is pertinent to observe that he did not mention any reduction in speed during his discussion later that same day with the officers of the Fanad Head. Reinhardt, who was at the wheel of the Flora Alberta from 4.30 until the collision, did not know the speed of the vessel. Captain Heddles, who observed the Flora Alberta crossing his bow, was of the opinion that she was going \"at least 9 knots\" per hour, and Rea stated, \"It was cruising rapidly\" and later suggested 10 knots per hour. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to conclude but that the Flora Alberta was immediately prior to and at the time of the collision proceeding at too great a speed.\nCounsel for the appellant pressed his contention that those in charge of the Flora Alberta were negligent in not hearing the whistles from the Fanad Head and taking consequent precautions. It was suggested if the officers on the one ship could hear the whistle those on the other could have heard it also. The expert was asked:\nQ. Therefore, so far as sound gradients are concerned, if A could hear B, B could hear A.? A. As far as temperature gradient is concerned, yes. That would not be true so far as wind velocity. You would hear down-bent and you wouldn't hear up-bent.\nThere was not sufficient information available to enable him to express an opinion relative to the wind velocity gradient and the matter was left in that position. All the witnesses who gave evidence from the Flora Alberta were in agreement that they did not hear any whistle until they had seen the Fanad Head, and under these circumstances, having regard to the acknowledged vagaries of sound in fog, I am not disposed to find that those in charge were negligent in this regard.\nThis collision was caused 'by both vessels proceeding in a dense fog at too great a speed which they maintained up to the moment of impact. Because the officers of the Fanad Head had heard the whistle approximately ten minutes before the collision and took no precautions, apart from sounding their column numbers and putting on their lights, to avoid a collision, I think that they are two-thirds to blame and the Flora Alberta one-third. The judgment at trial should be so varied and the appellant should have its costs in this Court and the respondents two-thirds of the cost in the Court below.\nLocke, J.:\u2014In absolving the Flora Alberta from blame in this matter the learned trial judge has found that about fifteen minutes before the collision the schooner, which had been moving through a fog at a speed of about 9 knots, reduced the speed to approximately 4\u00bd knots, that her fog whistle was blown at regular intervals and that those on board heard no other fog signal until about the moment of sighting the Fanad Head, when a whistle was heard and at the same time the lights of the approaching steamer sighted about a ship's length away on the starboard bow. A further finding is that there was nothing the Flora Alberta could have done after sighting the ship to avoid the collision. The witnesses Guy Tanner, Douglas Reinhardt, Walter Corkum, John Knickle, John Reinhardt and Garth Reinhardt, being all but one of the surviving members of the crew of the Flora Alberta, gave their evidence before a registrar and not in the presence of the trial judge, so that we are in an equally good position to estimate the weight to be given to their evidence.\nTanner, the captain, said that at about 4 o'clock daylight saving time of the morning in question the engines were started and the Flora Alberta steered due west through what is described as a heavy fog at a speed of 9 knots: that at 4.30 when the witness John Reinhardt took the wheel he was given instructions to steer west by north and that he (Tanner) then went down to breakfast. On direct examination he said that this was about 3 or 4 minutes before the collision and in response to a question as to what he had then done said: \"I went down and slowed her down\", and that this was done before he went forward for breakfast. Why after running at 9 knots since 4 a.m. he reduced the speed at this time he did not explain. On cross-examination he said that it was nearly 5 o'clock when he went to breakfast, that he had first gone to his own cabin and then come out on deck and proceeded to the forecastle and had been seated at his breakfast for about two minutes when he heard the shout \"Steamer\" from the look-out John Knickle and had then gone on deck. This evidence was given on January 3, 1945. On October 31, 1947 Captain Tanner again appeared before the registrar and gave certain further evidence. According to the record, he was recalled at the request of the learned trial judge to clear up some question as to the type of horn used on the Flora Alberta and the evidence should have been restricted to this. However, he was asked further questions in chief: one of these related to the time which elapsed between his going down to breakfast and the collision and he then said: \"That was just about\u2014just a few minutes.\" In answer to a further question as to the speed to which he had slowed down the vessel he said to half speed and that this was about 4\u00bd knots. Counsel for the Fanad Head had objected to the reception of the evidence unless it was evidence in rebuttal but proceeded to cross-examine and the witness then said that he had rung to the engineer for half speed before he had gone to breakfast. Captain Tanner had been picked up by the Fanad Head at some time between 5 and 6 a.m. and later on that day had a conversa- tion with the Chief Officer of the Fanad Head. This took place at about 1 p.m., Tanner having been invited to the Chief Officer's cabin to have a drink and he then, on his own admission when asked what speed the Flora Alberta had been going, said that it was at the rate of 9 knots an hour. When asked further as to whether he had not said they were going 10 knots he said: \"I did tell him 10 knots and that we were cutting down to half speed\"; then to the question \"He asked you what speed you were making and you replied 10 knots?\" he answered \"Yes.\" In addition to these statements, according to Chief Officer Edward C. Rea, Tanner had told him at this interview that he was making 10 knots and that the crew of the schooner did not reduce speed unless the captain ordered it. The second officer of the Fanad Head who was present at this interview corroborated Rea's account of what had been said by Tanner. John Reinhardt, a member of the crew of the Flora Alberta who was present, merely said that he did not remember the interview. Captain Heddles, the master of the Fanad Head and Chief Officer Rea, both of whom had seen the Flora Alberta a short space of time before the collision, estimated her speed at 9 and 10 knots respectively.\nUpon this evidence, I think the finding of the learned trial judge that the speed of the schooner had been reduced to 4\u00bd knots 15 minutes before the collision, or indeed that it had been reduced at all, cannot be supported. No witness suggested that this had been done 15 minutes before the collision. None of the other members of the crew who gave evidence suggested that the speed had been reduced at any time. In particular one would expect that either John Knickle who was at the wheel between 4 and 4.30 and who then went to the look-out, or John Reinhardt who succeeded him at the wheel at 4.30 and was there at the time of the collision, would have noted the change in speed but both of them were silent on the point. Asked on direct examination whether he had any idea at what speed the Flora Alberta was going, John Reinhardt said that he had not. Being then asked whether he had noticed anything about the engine exhaust, he said that the engine might have been running slower than usual but gave no opinion as to the speed. As to the admission made by Captain Tanner several hours after he had been picked up, the learned trial judge said that he attached little importance to the conversations, that both Tanner and Rea had denied making certain statements attributed to them and that it might be that under the circumstances \"each misinterpreted what the other said.\" This quite ignores the admission made at the trial by Tanner as to the statements made by him to Rea, as to which there was no possible ground for misunderstanding. Upon this issue, I think it should be found that the speed of the Flora Alberta at the time her look-out first saw the approaching steamer was 9 knots an hour.\nBy its preliminary act the appellant further contended that the Flora Alberta did not maintain a proper look-out. There is no finding as to this by the learned trial judge but, as he found the Fanad Head wholly to blame, it must be taken that he 'considered the claim to be unfounded. According to the witness Knickle, after he was relieved at the wheel at 4.30 he went forward to the bow where he had a clear view on all sides) and he heard no whistle blown until the Fanad Head loomed out of the fog a little forward of the starboard bow when he says: \"I thought I heard a little tinkle and a long blow. I'm not sure of that,\" and that he heard this and saw the lights almost at the same time. He immediately shouted \"Steamer\" and the collision followed almost immediately. Asked as to the distance between the vessels when he first saw the Fanad Head he estimated this at about 140 feet. John Reinhardt who had been on look-out on the bow between 4 and 4.30 says that he did not hear the sounds of any other ship while he was there and only heard the whistle of the steamer very shortly before the impact. He estimated that the distance separating the vessels was about two ship lengths of the Flora Alberta or about 290 feet when he first saw the Fanad Head. Walter Corkum who had been on look-out up until 4 o'clock and had gone below heard Knickle's shout but did not hear any whistle from the steamer. Captain Tanner whose movements have been described heard nothing. The respondent's preliminary act stated the distance at which the steamer was first seen as being 275 feet. There are a number of discrepancies in the various accounts given by the officers and the crew members of the Fanad Head and the commodore of the convoy, the master of the Tilapa, which led the centre column of the convoy. The master of the Fanad Head, Thomas Heddles, whose evidence was heard by the trial judge and who had had something more than fifty years at sea and had held a master's certificate since 1903, said that the visibility at the time of the collision was about 800 or 900 feet. In pursuance of orders from the commodore of the convoy, the column leaders blew their respective column numbers at intervals of about seven minutes from 2 a.m. when the fog had set in until the time of the accident. The commodore's ship sounded first, sounding two short and three long blasts, the leading ship on the starboard column followed sounding three short and two long, and this was followed by the Fanad Head blowing one short and four long blasts. The Fanad Head was steering a course 132\u00b0 true and judging from the whistles on the beam the captain considered that he was in his correct position in the convoy. Following the Fanad Head at a distance of two cable lengths was an American vessel, also part of the convoy. According to Captain Heddles, at about 10 minutes past 4 (which would be 5.10 a.m. by the clock of the Flora Alberta which was set at fast time), he was on the bridge with Chief Officer Ilea and a midshipman named Stark when he heard a high pitched whistle ahead fine on the port bow. On hearing this the Chief Officer, without waiting for the commodore, blew the column number. The speed of the Fanad Head at this time was 8 knots and, according to the captain, since there was a ship following them and they had 'been instructed to maintain their convoy speed this was not slackened. At the same time as the Fanad Head blew its column number, the navigating lights were switched on to full brilliance. Three or four minutes later the column number was again blown independently. Shortly thereafter the captain heard what he described as a high pitched whistle about three points on the port bow. He estimated the time this second whistle was heard at about 7 or 8 minutes after it had first been sounded. He said that \"a few minutes later\" he saw the lights of the schooner crossing his bow at what he described \"as a fairly good speed and distant approximately 800 feet.\"\nChief Officer Rea who came on duty at 4 o'clock and relieved the second officer on the bridge said that the commodore blew his column number at 4 or 5 minutes past 4 and the Fanad Head did likewise: that at about 4.10 he heard a medium length blast of a high note on ahead and immediately again sounded the column number in reply. After putting on the navigating lights and waiting 2 or 3 minutes he sounded the column number again. It was, he says, about a couple of minutes after this that he heard the whistle again about three points on the port bow, and about a minute after that he saw the lights of the schooner. The master had immediately ordered hard to starboard and rung the engines full astern and as he did this three short 'blasts were sounded on the steamer whistle. According to this witness, he saw the lights of the Flora Alberta when they were about two ship lengths' away.\nDennis Ward, a seaman who was on look-out on the forecastle head of the steamer, had gone on duty at 4 o'clock, at which time the vessel was blowing its column signal. He says these signals were being blown from one leading ship to the other and thought the Fanad Head was blowing every minute or two. After he came on watch he said he heard some of the other vessels in the convoy blowing what he described as \"shorts and longs\" and that some 8 or 10 minutes after he had gone on watch he heard a high note whistle a little on the port bow and ahead. He says that he heard the same whistle again later and about a minute after that saw the lights of the schooner which he thought to be about three points on the port bow. Asked as to how far he could see in the fog, he said that he could just see the outline of the 'bridge of the Fanad Head from the forecastle but could not estimate the distance from the steamer where he had first seen the lights of the schooner.\nEdward Davey, the second officer, said that after 2 o'clock when the fog commenced the column numbers were sounded at ten minute intervals on the average. He had been relieved by the Chief Officer at 4 o'clock and, after going into the chartroom to write up the scrap log, had returned to the bridge and heard what was apparently the first whistle from the schooner at about two or three points on the port bow and says that all the leaders then sounded their column numbers. Thereafter he saw a light on the port bow and heard the order \"full speed astern\" and \"hard-astarboard\" and the collision followed. Davey was unable to express an opinion as to how far he could see in the fog but said that the lights of the schooner were over a ship length's away when he saw them. On cross-examination he said that he had heard the whistle of the schooner twice and was indefinite as to the length of time between the two, saying that it was 3 or 4 or 5 minutes. Charles H. Stark, the midshipman who had been on the bridge with the captain when the whistle was first heard and who was at the time his evidence was given the second officer of the Fanad Head, had come on duty at 4 o'clock and said that at 4.05 or 4.06 the Fanad Head and the other leaders had sounded their column numbers. He heard the whistle which he described as being \"right ahead or fine on our port bow\" and said that immediately the steamer sounded her column number again. The navigating lights were then switched on and about two minutes later the column number blown again. A few minutes later, he says, he heard the same whistle again, this time broad on the port bow, and about a minute after that saw the green light and white mast head light of the schooner which was then about three or four points on the port bow. Stark said that the sounding of the column number of the Fanad Head twice after they heard the first whistle was done independently of the commodore and he had not heard the commodore sound his column number after hearing the whistle. He estimated the distance between the two vessels when he first saw the light of the schooner as being one ship's length.\nCaptain Hugh Roberts, the master of the Tilapa, said that he heard the whistle of what proved to be the schooner shortly after 4 o'clock. He described it as a faint whistle and he was the only one on his vessel who heard it and said that it appeared to be fine on the port side of the convoy. As a precaution he sounded his column number and says that the other leaders of the convoy sounded theirs after that and that he distinctly remembers hearing that of the Fanad Head from its position abeam. Some time afterwards he heard what he described as a definite sound signal a little forward of the port beam and apparently close to the convoy and immediately the column numbers were blown again. Whether it was the Fanad Head who blew first he was not certain but said that there was \"definitely plenty of noise at that time\". After that he heard the three short blasts from the Fanad Head followed by the sound of the collision. Captain Roberts estimated the visibility at the time at about 400 or 500 feet.\nIn addition to these witnesses who were either officers or members of the crew of the ships concerned, Oliver Bertram, a marine engineer who had been torpedoed and landed in Canada and was returning to England as a passenger on the Fanad Head, gave evidence that he was in his stateroom on the starboard side and had been awake for some time before the collision. He could hear the whistle of the Fanad Head and of the other ships on its starboard side, though the port-hole was closed. He said that these whistles were at fairly regular intervals of between 7 and 10 minutes and that before the accident there seemed more frequent whistles. He had heard also the three short blasts from the Fanad Head, the significance of which he appreciated and had then got up and gone on deck. Charles Third, a marine engineer who was travelling as a passenger on the Fanad Head under similar circumstances, occupied a cabin on the port side and was wakened by the frequent blowing of the whistles. He said that every few minutes there was a blast and then there were three short blasts and appreciating what these signified he got up and went on deck.\nThere is no finding of fact which casts any doubt upon the veracity of any of these witnesses. The evidence of Heddles and Rea was taken more than two years and that of Roberts, Davey and Stark nearly three years after the collision occurred and it would be strange if there were not some discrepancies in the recollections of these witnesses. It is, in my opinion, established from their evidence that the convoy leaders were regularly sounding their column numbers at intervals of approximately ten minutes after 2 o'clock on the morning in question, that this was last done prior to the time when the whistle of the Flora Alberta was heard at about 5 minutes after 4: that both the Fanad Head and the Tilapa again sounded their column numbers promptly following the first of the two whistles and that the Fanad Head sounded again some two or three minutes prior to the time when the second whistle from the Flora Alberta was heard. It appears to me that it is not established that the Fanad Head blew again after hearing the second whistle until the Flora Alberta was sighted and the three short blasts were given. In my opinion, the evidence also establishes that the visibility was such that the lights of the schooner were visible at least 400 or 500 feet distant. It was proven that the navigating lights of the Fanad Head were switched on at full brilliance as soon as the first whistle was heard from the schooner and yet Knickle did not see them until they were about 140 feet distant. Much evidence was given as to the unreliability of bearings taken to sound signals in a fog and some to the effect that during a considerable fog a fog horn or whistle may not be heard a very short distance which would under normal conditions be heard several miles away. In so far as the latter point is concerned, there is a conflict in the evidence. Neither Heddles nor Rea had had any such experience with steam whistles such as those on the Fanad Head and it is significant that the column leaders had since 2 a.m. verified their positions in the convoy by sounding their column numbers and that, according to Captain Roberts, when the Tilapa had sounded the signals they were answered every time. The Fanad Head was equipped with a double whistle located on the funnel operated by steam. Rea considered that the range of the whistle would be about 4 miles. When the three leaders blew their column numbers at about 4.05, each signal consisted of 5 blasts and the evidence establishes that, at least the Fanad Head and the Tilapa if not the leader of the starboard column, blew these signals again promptly following the time when the first whistle was heard, and the Fanad Head at least blew again shortly before the second whistle of the schooner was heard. Thus, while the single blast of the whistle of the Flora Alberta was heard at about 4.10 by the Captain, Chief Officer, Second Officer, Stark and Ward of the Fanad Head and Captain Roberts of the Tilapa and also the second blast sounded 7 or 8 minutes later, we are asked to believe that the great volume of sound from the steamers was inaudible to those who were supposed to be on watch on the Flora Alberta. The evidence does not satisfy me that this was the case. I think the only proper inference is that if the column numbers sounded were not heard on the Flora Alberta it was because no proper watch was being kept or that, having been heard, the Captain was mistaken as to the direction from which they proceeded and did not slacken speed.\nBy Article 16 of the International Regulations the Flora Alberta while proceeding in a fog was required to \"go at a moderate speed having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions\". There was a clear breach of this rule on her part. By the same article she was required upon hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog signal of a vessel the position of which was not ascertained, so far as the circumstances of the case admitted, to stop her engines and then navigate with caution until the danger of collision was over. Assuming the signals from the vessel were heard the Flora Alberta should have stopped her engines and, as required by Article 19, should have kept out of the way of the steamer which was on her starboard side. If the signals were not heard it was, in my opinion, due to a failure of those who were supposed to be on watch on the schooner to attend to their duties. The schooner was proceeding at a dangerously high rate of speed under the circumstances. It appears to me to be further apparent that the look-out was negligent in failing to see the lights of the approaching steamer, which were on at full brilliance, when she was 400 or 500 feet distant. Had the schooner been proceeding at the rate suggested by her master of 4\u00bd knots and had the look-out been alert and detected the position of the steamer at this distance and the engines then reversed, the collision would have been averted, even had the schooner not altered her course.\nAs to the Fanad Head, she was proceeding in the convoy and was bound to conform to the instructions of the commodore which at the time in question required her to maintain a speed of 8 knots an hour and her position in the convoy and not to sound her whistle independently, except in an emergency when the master would be required to exercise his own discretion for the safety of his ship. When the master heard the first whistle from what proved to be the Flora Alberta, she was apparently at a distance and fine on the port bow and in view of the position of the ship in the convoy, with the American vessel following her at three cable lengths, I think no fault can be found in that the master did not at that time stop the engines. The International Regulations did not apply without qualification to the Fanad Head at this time in view of her obligation to obey the convoy orders and I do not consider that an emergency existed when the whistle was first heard. Having heard the whistle of the Flora Alberta which was apparently a high whistle and not of great volume, the master would, in my view, be justified in assuming that the great volume of sound from the three vessels blowing their column numbers would be audible to those on the other ship and that they would have ample time to take measures for their own safety. I think, however, a different situation was created when the second whistle was heard. While it is not entirely clear upon the evidence, I am of the opinion that the proper inference is that the column number of the Fanad Head was not blown again after the second whistle was heard and that the only signal given by her was the blowing of the three short blasts when the schooner was sighted. Assuming she was kept upon the course of 132 degrees true, it is difficult to understand the apparent change in the position of the Flora Alberta from being fine on the port bow to three points on the port bow, unless either the schooner executed some such man\u0153uvre as is suggested in the evidence of the master of the Fanad Head or, owing to fog, the bearing of the signals could not be properly determined. In view of the evidence as to the unreliability of sound bearings taken during fog conditions and of the evidence of the Captain and the helmsman of the Flora Alberta, I think the latter is the explanation to be accepted. On this footing the situation was that the master of the Fanad Head inferred that the schooner was going to port and the inference was erroneous. When the second whistle was heard forward of the beam and clearly much closer than the earlier signal, I think a state of emergency existed requiring the Fanad Head to take independent action and that the engines should then have been stopped and the whistle blown again, and that had these steps been taken the accident would have been averted.\nIn my opinion both ships were at fault and the negligence of each continued up to the moment of collision and contributed to its occurrence and accordingly the damages should be apportioned. (The Eurymedon 20, Greer, L.J. at p. 50: Admiralty Commissioners v. North of Scotland 21, Viscount Simon at p. 354). I would apportion the liability one-third to the Flora Alberta and two-thirds to the Fanad Head. As to costs the appellant should have its costs of this appeal and the respondents should be allowed two-thirds of their taxable costs in the court below.\nAppeal allowed in part, the liability being apportioned one third to the Flora Alberta, two thirds to the Fanad Head. Appellant to have costs of this appeal and respondents two thirds of their taxable costs in the Court below.

Dartmouth (1802) 7 ves. 137 applies.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 varying, Coyne J.A. dissenting, the judgment of Montague J., declaring certain moneys paid to the life tenant were capital in the hands of the executor.\nHugh Phillipps, K.C. for the appellants.\nF. L. Bastedo, K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This appeal concerns the administration of the estate of a testator, George Gilmour Lennox, and the proceedings commenced with an application by his executor to the King's Bench in Manitoba for an answer to the following question:\u2014\nIs the portion of the moneys received from the T. Herbert Lennox Estate which represent income or revenue in the hands of that estate, income or revenue in my hands and therefore the property of Cora Bell Lennox, widow, or is it capital and therefore to be held for the residuary legatees?\nT. Herbert Lennox referred to in this question died in 1934. By his will, following a bequest of household goods and furnishings to his wife and a devise to her of the use or rent of a summer dwelling, he devised and bequeathed the balance of his estate to his trustees. After providing for an annuity for his wife, he directed that upon her death a number of legacies should be paid and the residue divided equally among his brothers and sisters who should survive his wife. Because of the point involved in this appeal, it is not without significance to notice clause 8 of the will of T. Herbert Lennox:\u2014\n8. I authorize my trustees to invest the moneys of my estate in any investments which they deem reasonably secure and likely to return a fair annual income, not being restricted to investments expressly authorized by law, and with power to retain the investments made by me in my lifetime as long as they think proper, and to reinvest the proceeds of the same, or any part thereof in similar securities.\nThe wife of T. Herbert Lennox died August 8, 1937, and the legacies payable on her death were paid June 8, 1938. The residue, which included 300 shares of the capital stock of T. Sisman Shoe Company Limited, was not divided among the four brothers and sisters of T. Herbert Lennox who survived the latter's widow. One of these brothers was the testator, George Gilmour Lennox, who died April 15, 1942. His will, after revoking previous ones and appointing an executor and directing him to pay debts, proceeds:\u2014\nI DIRECT that the rest and residue of my estate shall be invested in such securities as my executor may deem advisable and the income from same paid to my beloved wife, Cora Bell Lennox, as long as she shall live.\nI HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE that the house in which I am living at the time of my death and the furniture in the same are the property of my wife.\nI FURTHER DIRECT AND REQUEST that my Executor, if he deems it advisable, shall be at liberty to pay, in addition to the income from my estate, a further amount not exceeding five per cent of the capital of my estate in any one year to my wife as an additional allowance to her.\nOn the death of my beloved wife, I DIRECT AND REQUEST such part of my estate as shall remain be divided into three equal parts and one part I GIVE, DEVISE and BEQUEATH unto my niece Avis Beatrice Ainley Cels; one part to my nephew Lennox Arthur Williams, son of my sister; and one part to my niece Helen Marguerite Williams, now Helen Marguerite Fuller, daughter of my sister, respectively for their sole and only use forever.\nCora Bell Lennox, the testator's widow, died July 14, 1947, having received from her husband's estate the sum of $1,600. In the meantime, disputes had arisen between her, on the one hand, and Lennox Arthur Williams and Helen Marguerite Fuller, two of the residuary beneficiaries under the will of the testator, on the other. The testator's executor had received from time to time from the executors of T. Herbert Lennox cheques representing income or revenue earned by the latter's estate. While the executor's affidavit, filed on the application for advice, states that all of this was claimed by the two residuary beneficiaries to be capital, such claim is properly confined to the dividends declared and paid by the Shoe Company. The par value of each of the 300 shares held by the T. Herbert Lennox estate was $100 but, for succession duty purposes, each was valued at $240. Down to and including 1945, the annual dividend had been at a substantial rate but at the end of 1946, or early in 1947, while the application to the Court was pending, an extraordinarily large dividend was declared. In accordance with certain amendments to the Income War Tax Act, the Company paid the income tax of $73,178.81 out of its total accumulated undistributed income of $369,230.99 for the period 1917 to 1939. The directors objected to paying the balance in cash and decided that it should be distributed as a dividend in the following manner:\u2014$46,052.18 in cash; the sum of $100,000 by the issuing of 1,000 shares of non-transferable preferred stock and the issuing of $150,000 debentures. The T. Herbert Lennox estate was entitled to 30 per cent of each of these items and the estate of George Gilmour Lennox would be entitled to one-fourth of the share of the T. Herbert Lennox estate. The disposition of this one-fourth share has been treated as involved in the question submitted to the Court.\nAt the conclusion of the argument before him, the judge of first instance decided that the moneys referred to in the question and the cash and the preferred stock and debentures comprising the dividend declared by the company at the end of 1946 or early in 1947 were capital in the hands of the testator's executor. While no reasons were given, we were advised that the learned judge proceeded on the ground that the income which Cora Bell Lennox was entitled to receive was limited to the income from securities in which the testator's executor actually invested. While the appeal by Cora Bell Lennox to the Court of Appeal 2 was pending she died but the proceedings have been continued at the suit of her executor and executrix, William Sidney Ronald and Beatrice Avis Ainley Cels, the latter being also one of the residuary beneficiaries under the testator's will.\nThe Court of Appeal 3 dismissed the appeal with the, following variations:\u2014\n1. That the entire residue of the George Gilmour Lennox estate (including the 75 shares of stock in the T. Sisman Shoe Co. Ltd., with all earnings and undistributed or undeclared accretions to the value thereof) be valuated as at the 15th day of April, 1942, being the date of the death of the said George Gilmour Lennox;\n2. That the amount so ascertained by said valuation shall be, and shall be treated as, capital in the estate of the said George Gilmour Lennox;\n3. That interest on the sum or amount of that valuation be paid or allowed to Cora Bell Lennox from the said 15th day of April, 1942, until the date of her death, namely, the 14th day of July, 1947;\n4. That the interest be computed yearly at the rate of four per cent per annum;\n5. That if in any year or years of that period, the said Cora Bell Lennox was actually paid by way of income, to which as life tenant she was entitled, any sum or sums in excess of four per cent of the said valuation but not in excess of five per cent of the residue so valuated, she shall be allowed to retain that excess sum or sums as being paid to her out of capital of the residue;\nFrom that order the representatives of the estate of Cora Bell Lennox now appeal and the other two residuary beneficiaries cross-appeal. The cross-appeal is based on the reasons which found favour with the judge of first instance but in my opinion the testator's will is not capable of the construction adopted by him and the cross-appeal fails. However, subject to a variation, the main appeal also fails as it is clear that the majority of the Court of Appeal 4 were quite right in deciding that the rule in Howe v. Lord Dartmouth 5 applies.\nThe rule was well established even before the decision whose name it bears and has been followed consistently ever since (see Wentworth v. Wentworth 6). Statements of the rule appear in all the textbooks and a convenient reference is to page 241 of the 4th edition of Hanbury's Modern Equity:\u2014\nWhere residuary personalty is settled on death for the benefit of persons who are to enjoy it in succession, the duty of the trustees is to convert all such parts of it as are of a wasting or future or reversionary nature, or consist of unauthorized securities, into property of a permanent and income-bearing character.\nNecessarily it is there stated in wider terms than need be considered in this appeal since it takes account of cases as well where the rule operated to the benefit of life tenants, as where it assists residuary beneficiaries. As applied to this appeal, it may be put thus:\u2014The life tenant of residuary personal estate is not entitled to the income produced by unauthorized investments. As pointed out in the third edition of Gober on Capital and Income, at page 171, on the authority of the cases there referred to, the rule does not proceed on any presumed intention of the testator that the property should be converted but is based on the presumption that he intended it to be enjoyed by different persons in succession; an intention which can only be carried out by means of conversion and investment in permanent securities.\nIn the present case there clearly was to be an enjoyment in succession. While the rule may be excluded if the will discloses an intention either by an express direction or by necessary implication that the property shall be enjoyed in its existing state, the onus of showing that the words in any particular will exclude the rule lies on those who say that it ought not to be applied: per Thesiger L.J. in Macdonald v. Irvine 7 and James L.J. at 124, and other cases referred to in Gober at 179. Here, the circumstances that the testator's executor had power to pay the widow-part of the capital not exceeding five per centum in any one year and that what was to be divided upon her death was \"such part of my estate as remained\" do not exhibit such an intention. Nor, in the direction to the executor to invest in such securities as he may deem advisable, is there found an authority to him to invest in unauthorized securities. The cases collected in 33 Halsbury, 2nd edition, paragraph 418, show that such a direction has uniformly been held to mean authorized securities only. It is in connection as well with the power to retain as with the power to invest that a comparison of the testator's will with clause 8 of the will of T. Herbert Lennox is enlightening.\nIn the absence of such authority in the will, the Sisman Company shares are unauthorized investments: Manitoba Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 221. Mr. Justice Coyne 8 refers to the following provision in section 30 of the Trustee Act, R.S.M. 1913, c. 200:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall \u2026 empower any administrator, executor or trustee to purchase any bank or other stock with moneys entrusted to him as such administrator, executor or trustee aforesaid.\nand to the fact that it was omitted in S.M. 1931, chapter 52, and in subsequent legislation. However, this cannot alter the construction of the Trustee Act as no authority in Manitoba was ever given trustees to purchase bank or other stock except stock of the Government of the Dominion of Canada or of any province.\nWhen once the position of affairs is appreciated and stated, there is, I think, no difficulty. On April 15, 1942, when the testator died, the time had already arrived for the executors of T. Herbert Lennox to distribute the residue of his estate. The testator's executor had no power to retain or invest in unauthorized securities. Even if it be a fact that there were obstacles in the way of the executors of T. Herbert Lennox selling or transferring the Company's shares (and we have no information upon the subject), that does not alter the application of the rule since equity considers that as done which ought to have been done.\nCounsel for the respondents stated that he did not seek to have repaid any moneys paid by the testator's executor to Cora Bell Lennox in excess of the amounts to which she was entitled under the formal order of the Court of Appeal but, in any event, clause (1) of that order should be amended so as to be restricted to the 75 shares of stock (including all earnings and undistributed or undeclared accretions) since there were other income-bearing assets in the estate of T. Herbert Lennox. In case it might be necessary to consider the point on some future occasion, it should be stated that the rate of 4 per centum per annum is accepted as one adopted by the Court of Appeal and as to which counsel for the respondents stated he raised no question.\nWith the variation mentioned above, the appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Phillipps and Tallin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aikins, Loftus, Macaulay & Company.\n1 [1948] 4 D.L.R. 753; 2 W.W.R. 640.\n2 [1948] 4 D.L.R. 753; 2 W.W.R. 640.\n3 [1948] 4 D.L.R. 753; 2 W.W.R. 640.\n4 [1948] 4 D.L.R. 753; 2 W.W.R. 640.\n5 (1802) 7 ves. 137.\n6 [1900] A.C. 163 at 171.\n7 (1878) 8 Ch. 101 at 121, 124.\n8 [1948] 4 D.L.R. 753; 2 W.W.R. 640.\n",

VI, c. 14, ss. 6 (b), 2 (k).\nW. domiciled in B.C., Canada, bequeathed to his wife \"the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars or one-half of my estate whichever may be the larger sum\", making this bequest a first charge on the estate. W. died in Vancouver in 1921. His widow, also domiciled in B.C., died in 1924 leaving the residue of her property to Bonnie S., domiciled in California, U.S.A., who died in January 1941 and left all her property to her husband George S., also domiciled in California, and appointed him executor. He died in 1944 and left all his estate to his nephew R., domiciled in California. R. died in 1944 leaving portions of the estate bequeathed by George S. to members of his family. The estate of W. in B.C. consisted chiefly of real property and the executor delayed the sale of it until November 1945, when the sum of $250,000 was realized therefrom. The respondent Fitzgerald was appointed by a California Court administrator with the will annexed of Bonnie S. and by virtue of a Power of Attorney from him the respondent Walsh was appointed ancillary administrator of the estate of Bonnie S. in B.C. Upon his death he was succeeded by Tupper who is now the sole executor of the will of W. and of W's widow. The Minister of National Revenue assessed duties on the succession from George S. to R. and on the succession from R. to his family. On appeal to the Exchequer Court by the administrator, the assessments were set aside.\nSection 2(k) of the Act reads as follows: \"Property includes property, real or personal, movable or immovable, of every description, and every estate and interest therein or income therefrom capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on the death, and any right or benefit mentioned in section three of this Act\".\nHeld, affirming the judgment below, (Locke J. dissenting), that there was no \"property situated in Canada\" within the meaning of sec. 6 of the Succession Duty Act, as neither George S. nor R. had, in the British Columbia estate, the interest that is required by sec. 2(k) of the Act. All that devolved upon their deaths was a right to have the estate of Bonnie S. administered and that right was a chose in action properly enforceable in the country of Bonnie S.'s domicile, i.e. in California.\nPer Locke J. (dissenting): Raeburn in his personal capacity and those claiming under his will each succeeded to an interest in property situate in British Columbia out of which the legacies were payable, within the meaning of sec. 2(k) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, and such successions were liable to duty.

Special Income Tax Commissioners [1921] A.C. 1 distinguished).\nAPPEALS by the Minister of National Revenue from the decision of the Exchequer Court 1, O'Connor J., setting aside the assessments made under the Dominion Succession Duty Act, 1940-41, Statutes of Canada, c. 14, in the estate of George V. Steed, deceased, and in the estate of James Kenneth Raeburn, deceased.\nJ. W. Pickup, K.C. and John J. Connolly, K.C. for the appellant.\nC. F. H. Carson, K.C. and Alfred Bull, K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal against a judgment of the Exchequer Court 2 pronounced in two appeals from assessments made under the Dominion Succession Duty Act, chapter 14 of the 1940-41 Statutes of Canada and in an action commenced in the Exchequer Court by a writ of immediate extent. The proceedings in this action and in the two assessment appeals were consolidated as the question to be determined is the same in all three.\nThat question depends upon whether there was \"property situated in Canada\" within the meaning of section 6 of the Succession Duty Act firstly upon the death of George Steed, and secondly, upon the death of James Kenneth Raeburn, both of whom were domiciled in California, in the United States of America. Section 6, so far as relevant, reads as follows:\u2014\n6. Subject to the exemptions mentioned in section seven of this Act, there shall be assessed, levied and paid at the rates provided for in the First Schedule to this Act duties upon or in respect of the following successions, that is to say, \u2026\n(b) where the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled outside of Canada, upon or in respect of the succession to all property situated in Canada.\nIt is admitted that upon each death there was a \"succession\" as defined by section 2 (m) of the Act:\u2014\n(m) \"succession\" means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person, to any other person in possession or expectancy * * *\n\"Deceased person\" is defined by section 2(d) to mean a person dying after the coming into force of the Act. The Act came into force on June 14, 1941; George Steed died August 16, 1944, and James Kenneth Raeburn was killed while serving in the United States Armed Forces December 13, 1944.\nIn order to appreciate the nature of the property which, on behalf of the appellants, it is alleged was situate in Canada, it is necessary to state certain events that occurred before George Steed's death. One Adolphus Williams, domiciled in British Columbia, died at Vancouver in 1921, having made his last will and testament and codicils. By the will the testator bequeathed to his wife Katherine the sum of $150,000 \"or one-half of my estate whichever may be the larger sum to be paid to her by my trustees as hereinafter mentioned free of succession duty, and I direct that the bequest to my wife shall be a first and prior charge on my estate and shall not be subject to any abatement whatsoever.\" By virtue of the will and first codicil, Walter William Walsh, the testator's wife Katherine and William Godfrey were appointed trustees and executors, and by the second codicil the testator directed his trustees to pay to his wife in equal consecutive monthly instalments, commencing immediately after his death, interest at 5 per cent per annum on the legacy on such portion thereof as might from time to time remain unpaid, and directed that this interest, as well as the legacy, should be a first and prior charge on his estate and not subject to any abatement whatsoever. These directions mean nothing more than that the widow was entitled to be paid the legacy and interest in priority to any other legatee.\nProbate was granted to the three executors. The bulk of the estate consisted of real estate in Vancouver. The widow received interest on the legacy but no part of the principal and she died domiciled in British Columbia in 1924, having made her last will and testament and a codicil thereto whereby she devised and bequeathed all her property to her trustees to pay debts and transfer the residue to her sister Isabella Steed, generally known as and hereafter called Bonnie Steed. Probate was granted to the named executors, William Godfrey and Walter William Walsh.\nBonnie Steed was the wife of George Steed and she died January 10, 1941, domiciled in California, having made her last will and testament wherein she devised and bequeathed all her property to her husband and appointed him executor. No proceedings to prove this will in California were taken during the lifetime of George Steed but on March 26, 1941, probate was granted in British Columbia to him, limited to his wife's estate in that province.\nGeorge Steed, domiciled in California, died August 16, 1944, and by his will he left all his property to his nephew, James Kenneth Raeburn, and appointed him executor. Probate of this will was granted in the name of Mr. Raeburn by a California court on December 22, 1944, in ignorance of the fact that he had been killed on the 14th of that month. Subsequently, in March 1945, the California court granted letters of administration with the will annexed of George Steed to Mr. W. T. Fitzgerald, who also in November of that year was granted letters of administration with the will annexed of Mr. Raeburn. By his will, Mr. Raeburn divided among various people what he had inherited from his uncle George Steed but appointed no executor.\nIt appears that Mr. Walsh, the surviving executor of Adolphus Williams considered it expedient to hold the several parcels of real estate in the hope that they would increase in value and that something would be available for the legatees mentioned in the will of Adolphus Williams other than the latter's widow Katherine. The real estate was not sold until November 5, 1945, at which time, upon receiving the purchase price, Mr. Walsh segregated a sufficient sum to pay the balance of Katherine Williams' legacy and all accrued interest thereon, and placed such sum in the bank in his name in trust.\nHowever, the important date so far as George Steed is concerned is that of his death, August 16, 1944. Upon his death, all that any one claiming under him was entitled to, in relation to the Vancouver real estate of Adolphus Williams, was a right to have the estate of Bonnie Steed administered. The crux of the matter is to ascertain where that right was naturally and properly enforceable, per Lopes and Kay L.JJ. in the Court of Appeal in Sudeley v. Attorney General 3, whose judgments were explicitely approved in the House of Lord 4. That right was the property which devolved upon the death of George Steed, and that property had its situs, not in Canada, but in Bonnie Steed's domicile, California. It matters not that George Steed took out probate of his wife's will in British Columbia limited to her property there, since George Steed's executor, Raeburn, died without having been effectively granted probate of George's will and without he, himself, having appointed an executor. Upon George Steed's death there was no personal representative of Bonnie Steed in Canada. Neither, it is true, was there one in California but that was her domicile, and the right of any one claiming under George Steed to have the estate of the latter's wife administered was naturally and properly enforceable in the country of her domicile. As a matter of fact, on January 11, 1946, letters of administration with the will annexed of Bonnie Steed were granted in California to Mr. Fitzgerald and on February 6, 1948, letters of administration with the will annexed of all the unadministered estate within British Columbia, of Bonnie Steed, were granted to Mr. Walsh. Before that namely on November 5, 1945, Mr. Walsh had set aside the balance of Mrs. Williams' legacy and interest, and holding that sum in his capacity as administrator with the will annexed of Bonnie Steed, his duty apparently would be to remit that sum, less debts and administration expenses to Mr. Fitzgerald, the administrator in the country of Bonnie Steed's domicile. An order to that effect was made in the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon Mr. Walsh's motion for directions and what prevented those directions being carried out was the issuance of the writ of immediate extent.\nMr. Pickup relied upon the judgment of the House of Lords in Partington v. Attorney General 5 but that was merely a decision as to what duty was payable in view of the particular steps taken by the plaintiff Partington. In Re Berchtold 6, is a decision on the conflict of laws and it is dangerous and misleading to attempt to apply conflict of laws cases to those of taxation.\nThe only remaining decision of importance put forward as bearing on the matter is that of the House of Lords in Skinner v. Attorney General 7. The point there was whether there was \"property in which the deceased or any other person had an interest ceasing on the death of the deceased\" within section 2, subsection 1, paragraph (b) of the Finance Act, 1894, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. (1) Property passing on the death of the deceased shall be deemed to include the property following, that is to say: \u2026\n(b) Property in which the deceased or any other person had an interest ceasing on the death of the deceased, to the extent to which a benefit accrues or arises by the cesser of such interest; but exclusive of property the interest in which of the deceased or other person was only an interest as holder of an office, or recipient of the benefits of a charity, or as a corporation sole;\nBy testamentary dispositions a testator devised and bequeathed his property to two nephews, subject to specific and pecuniary legacies, including an annuity to his wife. He died domiciled in Northern Ireland and his assets in England were of such little value that no estate duty was payable there in respect thereof. However, his executors invested the greater part of the estate in English securities and it was under those circumstances that upon the death of the testator's widow the English authorities claimed estate duty in respect of the testator's estate in so far as it was then represented by English securities.\nIn his speech, which was approved by all the other peers, Lord Russell of Killowen, 8 with reference to the provisions of the Finance Act set out above, stated at page 358:\u2014\nIt appears to me to be beyond question that an annuitant, whose annuity is payable out of a testator's estate and who is therefore interested in the whole estate, is necessarily also interested in all the parts which compose the whole; and that her right to take proceedings (if necessary) to have the estate administered for the purpose of providing her annuity, is merely the right of enforcing or realizing that interest which she has in the whole and its parts.\nAt page 359 he pointed out that in the Sudeley (2) case the interest which was being repudiated was a proprietary interest, and proceeded:\u2014\nThe case is not in any way a decision that the widow or her executors had no interest in the mortgages, and it is certainly no authority against the view that an annuitant whose annuity is charged on the estate of a testator \"has an interest\" in the different items of which that estate from time to time consists.\nThese extracts from Lord Russell's speech indicate the difference between the Skinner 9 case, on the one hand, and the Sudeley 10 case and the present one, on the other. Here, we are not dealing with a statute imposing a tax on the passing of property in which a deceased had an interest, ceasing on his death, but with one which imposes a tax upon a succession to property situate in Canada, By section 2 (k) of the Succession Duty Act:\u2014\nproperty includes property, real or personal, movable or immovable, of every description, and every estate and interest therein or income therefrom capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on the death, and any right or benefit mentioned in section three of this Act;\nUndoubtedly, as it is put by Lord Halsbury in the Sudeley (2) case, in a loose and general way of speaking, George Steed had an interest in the British Columbia real estate held by Mr. Walsh as trustee of Adolphus Williams but what is referred to in (k) is not such a nebulous interest but a proprietary interest, either legal or such an equitable one that is recognized by our Courts, and that Steed did not have. All that devolved upon his death was a right to have the estate of Bonnie Steed administered; and that right was a chose in action properly enforceable and therefore situated in California and not in Canada.\nThe same result necessarily follows in connection with the death of James Kenneth Raeburn and the appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of an unusual situation, the facts of which, however, can be shortly stated.\nAdolphus Williams, whom I shall call A, dies in 1921, domiciled and resident in British Columbia where his property is situate, bequeathing his wife, to be called B, one-half of his estate but to be not less than $150,000. The executor of A continues an investment which constitutes the bulk of the assets for the purposes of the estate and in the result B becomes entitled to the minimum sum. The time required for this, however, carries the administration beyond the year 1944. B dies, domiciled in British Columbia, in 1924, leaving her estate to Bonnie Steed, called C, a domiciled resident of California. C dies in January, 1941, leaving her estate to George Steed, her husband, called D. D dies in August, 1944, leaving his estate to a nephew, James Raeburn, called E, of California, who lost his life while serving in the armed forces of the United States in December, 1944. Administration with the will annexed was granted in California to the respondent Fitzgerald in the estates of D and E: and the question is whether those two estates are liable for succession duty under the Succession Duty Act of the Dominion which came into force in June, 1941.\nAlthough the definitions of \"property\" and \"succession\" in the Act are sufficiently broad to cover any property interest which is descendible, the determination of this controversy rests, I think, on a comparatively simple ground which is not affected by them.\nAn executor holds strictly a representative capacity; he stands in and enforces the right of the testator. At com- mon law a legatee could not bring an action against an executor before at least the executor assented to the legacy; and a fortiori that rule is applicable where the bequest is residual and unascertained. It is equally clear that rights in action, as assets of the estate, can be asserted in a court only by the legal representative.\nBut in addition to his capacity of representing the deceased, the executor in equity is looked upon as quasi-trustee for the beneficiaries; and the beneficiary is entitled to resort to that court to have the duty of the executor enforced. The \"interest\" in property that is transmitted results from that right and becomes, therefore, an equitable interest, subject to the rules which underlie equitable administration,\nThe applicable section of the Act is 6 (b) and the duty is based on the operation of the territorial law in vesting a title to property which is within its jurisdiction. The res here as to B and C is undoubtedly in Canada. C acquired a direct right against the representative of B in respect of an interest in property resulting from a personal equitable right in the representative of B against the representative of A. But when C died, domiciled and resident outside of Canada, what was then the legal position? I think it was this: as equity in working out the rights and interests in property which it confers considers that done which ought to be done, the relation of the law of Canada to C must be determined as if the executor of B had reduced the assets of the estate to possession; in that situation, after administering in Canada, his duty, which the law of British Columbia would authorize him to carry out, was to transfer the property to the person entitled, C, in California. When it would then appear that C was dead, a new transmission came to the notice of the court in Canada, while the property was still there; but subject to the administration of that property as an asset of C in Canada, the duty of the executor of B became to deliver the asset over to the representative of C either in Canada or in California. At that point the transmission by Canadian law ends; the personal representation of C remains until the estate is fully administered in California; the death of a particular executor does not affect that representation; and the desti- nation of the Canadian property is to that estate in California. The interests of D and E arise out of rights existing by virtue of the law of California as the new situs of the res and are enforceable against the personal representatives there. The concern of Canadian law with the estate of C would be for the ascertainment of the persons entitled under the domiciliary law and the tax deduction to be made from the sum otherwise to be sent out of the country. Since the obligation lies between a Canadian personal representative and a Californian personal representative, with what is equivalent to a corporate existence on both sides, the death of a beneficiary of the estate of C neither appears to the Canadian law nor is it relevant to any action by it. In contemplation of law, therefore, and as it would in fact be carried out in formal procedure as the duty of the executor in Canada, the funds have become possessed by the executor at the domicile in California, they have ceased to be property in Canada, and the Canadian law has nothing further to do with them.\nIn this conception a present equitable interest which can be realized only in the course of a series of administrations is deemed to exist; but a present \"transmission\" takes place only subject to the rules and conditions which attach to equitable operation. In that contemplation, if execution of a series of future administrations carries the realized property beyond the jurisdiction, transmission by the local law obviously ceases; present equitable interests arise by that law only up to that point. Succeeding interests may arise and be recognized by the local jurisdiction, but they would not be taken as having been created locally. This view of the nature of transmission seems to underlie the statement of Dicey, 5th Ed. at page 336 where he says: \"There can be no succession to property without administration.\"\nThe case of Partington v. Attorney-General 11, was pressed upon us. There a domiciled resident of the United States became entitled to personal property of a deceased person in England. Administration of the estate was granted to the solicitor to the Treasury. The legatee died before receiving the bequest and her husband died without administering her estate. A son by attorney was then granted administration of both estates, and the question arose whether probate duty became payable on each. The majority opinion in the House of Lords, that it did, was based largely upon two circumstances: that administration of both had actually been granted; and that under a rule followed in England administration of the estate of a deceased wife must be taken out either by the husband or by his legal representative. Lord Westbury dissented. He viewed the situation in this way: the principal administration in each case would be in the United States; the legal representative of the mother either by himself or certainly after administration taken out in England, could give a discharge to the administrator of the original estate, and with that done the English courts would no longer be interested in the property which would thereafter be administered according to the law of the domicile. He impliedly rejected the view that administration of the father's estate in England was necessary to establish the right of the son to represent his mother there; and if the son had been named the executor of his mother's will it would seem to be beyond doubt that the father's estate would never be brought in question before the English courts: certainly that would appear to be so in relation to succession duty. The situation so conceived is that here. The only question before Canadian courts is the power to discharge the executor of B: that is possessed by the administrator of C: The estates of D and E do not come in question. The power of discharge is the converse aspect of the view of the equitable operation in respect of \"interests\" already expressed and obviously leads to the same result. The two grounds mentioned, together with the fact that it was probate duty there as against succession duty, distinguish it from the present controversy, to which the opinion expressed by Lord Westbury is, I think, unassailable in its application.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014The Crown in the first appeal claims duty upon the succession consequent upon the death of the late George V. Steed, who died domiciled in California, entitled to the residue of the estate of his deceased wife, Bonnie Steed, also of California domicile. In the second appeal the claim is for duty upon the succession consequent upon the death of one Raeburn, who died domiciled in California, entitled to the residue of the estate of George V. Steed.\nThe Dominion Succession Duty Act came into force on the 14th of June, 1941. Bonnie Steed died on the 10th of January of that year, leaving a will under which she appointed her husband sole executor and sole beneficiary. Bonnie Steed was entitled under the will of her sister, the late Katherine Williams, to the residue of the latter's estate, all of the assets of which were locally situated in British Columbia. Bonnie Steed also had other assets to the value of some $10,000 in California. Katherine Williams had died on the 9th of April, 1924, being in her turn entitled to substantial benefits under the will of the late Adolphus Williams, all of whose assets were also in British Columbia. At the date of the death of George Steed on August 16, 1944, the estate of Adolphus Williams had not been fully administered. That did not take place until November of 1945. Consequently, the estates of his widow and of Bonnie Steed were also unadministered.\nIn the meantime J. K. Raeburn, the sole executor and sole beneficiary under the will of George Steed, had died in December 1944; domiciled in California. W. T. Fitzgerald was appointed by the California court as administrator with the will annexed of the estate of George Steed on the 12th of March, 1945, and on the 28th of November, 1945, Ftzgerald was also appointed administrator with the will annexed of the estate of Raeburn. George V. Steed had, on March 26, 1941, taken out letters probate in British Columbia limited to the estate of Bonnie Steed there. On the 16th of January, 1946, Fitzgerald was appointed in California administrator with the will annexed of Bonnie Steed. Pursuant to a power-of-attorney given by Fitzgerald, Walter William Walsh, who was the surviving executor of the estate of Adolphus Williams, was, on February 5, 1946, appointed by the court in British Columbia administrator de bonis non of the estate of Bonnie Steed. The Crown's claim as against the estate of George V. Steed is rested upon the fact of his death prior to the actual distribution of the British Columbia assets of the estate of Bonnie Steed in the lifetime of George V. Steed. It is said that there was a succession to property in British Columbia within the meaning of the Succession Duty Act on the death of George Steed which is taxable under the provisions of 6 (b) of that Act.\n\"Property\" is defined by section 2(k) of the statute as including real and personal property and every estate and \"interest\" therein capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on death. The question in each appeal is whether there was, upon the death of George Steed and of Kenneth Raeburn, respectively, any succession to property or an interest therein in Canada consequent thereon.\nDealing first with the situation arising upon the death of George Steed, the assets of the estate of Bonnie Steed, of which he was residuary beneficiary, consisted of certain assets in California where she was domiciled and where her executor was also domiciled and also an interest in the residuary estate of Katherine Williams. I think the situation becomes clear if one disregards the fact that George Steed was also the sole executor of Bonnie Steed and if the situation be considered as though another person still living were the executor. When the executor of Katherine Williams had realized upon her residuary estate and was in a position to pay, it would have been necessary to take out administration to the estate of Bonnie Steed in British Columbia, Bonnie Steed being then dead and there being no person qualified by the law of British Columbia to give a discharge. Bonnie Steed's representative would have been liable to succession duty in such event but the law of British Columbia would have had no further concern with the moneys so paid over beyond enforcing the claim of the personal representative appointed by the law of the domicile of Bonnie Steed, namely, California, to payment over of such moneys.\nThe argument on behalf of the Crown is that it would be the duty of the executor of Katherine Williams before paying the administrator in British Columbia of the estate of Bonnie Steed, to inquire whether any of the beneficiaries of that estate, or those claiming under them, were then dead, and to refuse to pay such part of the proceeds of Katherine Williams' estate from which any such deceased person might ultimately obtain a benefit without payment of succession duty under the Dominion Act or without a release under that Act having been obtained.\nIt seems to me that in the absence of clear language in the legislation such is not the case. I think this view finds support in the judgment of Lord Westbury in Partington v. Attorney-General 12. The fact that this judgment was a dissenting judgment does not affect the present point.\nIn Partington's 13 case one, Mary Shard, had died in England in 1819 intestate, leaving one, Isabel Cook, her next-of-kin, domiciled in the United States. The latter died in 1825 without having taken out letters of administration and Isabel Cook's husband, Ellis Cook, also died in 1830 without having taken out letters of administration to his deceased wife. After his death the appellant, under a power-of-attorney, took out letters of administration in England to the estate, first of Ellis Cook and then of Isabel Cook, and it was held that probate duty was payable in respect of both estates. In his judgment Lord Westbury pointed out that the administration of the estate of Isabel Cook was necessary to enable that administrator to give a valid discharge to the administrator of Mary Shard but neither the personal estate of Isabel Cook nor that of Ellis Cook had to be distributed or administered in England. He was therefore of opinion that there was no basis for the levying of duty in respect of the estate of Ellis Cook. The personal representative of Mrs. Shard was of course entitled to receive a discharge upon the distribution of the assets in his hands. As Isabel Cook was dead, Mrs. Shard's administrator was entitled to have a discharge from a personal representative of Isabel Cook appointed in England. It was therefore necessary to take out letters of administration to Isabel Cook in England but solely for the purpose of giving such a discharge. Beyond that the law of England was not interested. In Lord Westbury's view therefore the course that ought to have been adopted by the parties was to have taken out administration to the estate of Isabel Cook in the appropriate court in the United States and ancillary letters of administration in England. Notwithstanding that this course was not in fact followed, Lord Westbury would have decided the liability on the part of the estate of Ellis Cook to duty as though that course had in fact been followed.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley, however, held that both estates were liable to duty as would have been the case had both been domiciled in England. Administration having in fact been taken out in England in respect of both estates it was not, in his view, for their Lordships to say that they were not bound by this course of action. He was unwilling to decide what might have been the case if the course suggested by Lord Westbury as the proper course had in fact been followed. The judgment of Lord Chelmsford and that of Lord Colonsay also proceeded on the basis of the course actually adopted by the parties. Lord Cairns was, however, of the view that, notwithstanding the course followed, both estates were liable to duty.\nIn my opinion in the case at bar the representative of Bonnie Steed was entitled to receive that to which Bonnie Steed was entitled under the will of Katherine Williams and to give a good discharge therefor. The accident that George Steed was not only beneficiary but executor and was dead when the time came for payment over does not affect the principle. I do not think the law of British Columbia could be further interested once the moneys reached the hands of the personal representative in British Columbia of Bonnie Steed, whose duty it then was to remit to the administrator in the domicile; Eames v. Hacon 13.\nI pause at this point to deal with an argument of Mr. Pickup, that because in fact George Steed proved the will of Bonnie Steed in British Columbia before there was any administration taken out to her estate in California, British Columbia was thereby constituted as the local situation of all her estate and the main forum of its administration, with the result that George Steed died entitled to the residue of Bonnie Steed's estate, all of which was situate in Canada. In my opinion this argument is not entitled to prevail. I think the case must be viewed apart from such accidents. Administration was always necessary in California and was ultimately taken out there and the administration in British Columbia ultimately granted subsequent to the death of George Steed was purely ancillary.\nThere is a further consideration which confirms the view to which I have come, as above expressed. In Lord Sudeley v. Attorney-General 14, a case dealing with probate duty, it was held that the residuary legatee of a testator who died domiciled in England where his estate was undergoing administration, but whose property included mortgages on real property in New Zealand, was not entitled to any part of the mortgages in specie but to require the testator's executors to administer his personal estate and to receive her share and that this was an English asset of the estate of the residuary beneficiary. The judgment of Lopes L.J., in the Court of Appeal 15 was approved. At p. 363 that learned judge said:\nThe right of the executors of Frances (the widow and residuary legatee of the testator) as against the executors of her husband is a right to have his estate administered. Administration where? The husband was domiciled in England, his will was proved in England, his executors are in England, and his estate is being administered in England, and the money recoverable will be brought to England. The executors of the husband can only be sued in the English Courts by the executors of Frances. It is an English chose in action, recoverable in England, and is, in my opinion, an English and not a foreign asset * * *\nWith respect to estate duties in England the law is thus stated in Dymond on Death Duties, 10th Edition, at page 93:\nIn the case of absolute interests in an unadministered estate the right of a residuary legatee, under English law and many other legal systems, is not to the specific assets of the testator. He is entitled merely to require the executors to administer the estate, and to pay him the clear residue, or a share thereof, as the case may be. The same rule applies under an intestacy. If, therefore, a residuary legatee or person entitled under an. intestacy dies while the original estate is still under administration, the locality of his interest, as an asset in his estate, is determined by the residence of the debtors, viz., the personal representatives of the original testator or intestate (Sudeley v. A.-G. (1897) A.C. 11; Barnardo's Homes v. Special Commissioners of Income Tax (1921) 2 A.C. 1; Re Steinkopff, Favorke v. Steinkopff (1922) 1 Oh. 174), and by the forum of administration, the latter being determined by the domicile of the testator or intestate. In practice, as between Northern Ireland and Eire and Great Britain the domicile is treated as the material factor; \u2026 The Revenue has conceded the application of the general principle stated above to cases where the deceased beneficiary was also the sole personal representative of the other deceased person.\nThe author points out at page 87 that as regards claims for estate duty on property situate in Ireland such property ranks as colonial or foreign property.\nIf the question be looked at therefore in accordance with the view of the text writer, the locality of the interest of George Steed in the estate of his deceased wife was situate in California, where the executor was domiciled and where the main administration would proceed. It has not been considered by any text-writer, so far as I have been able to find, that anything said in Skinner v. Attorney-General 16 is relevant to the situation referred to by Dymond.\nIt was contended in the case at bar, however, that the decision in Skinner's (1) case was, however, relevant. In that case the House was concerned with a claim of the revenue to estate duty under section 2, 1 (b) of the Finance Act, 1894, in respect of investments in England made by the executors of a deceased person who died domiciled in Northern Ireland where his estate was undergoing administration, leaving annuities, among others, to his widow. Estate duty was claimed upon the death of the widow on the ground that the widow had had an \"interest\" in the English investments ceasing on her death within the meaning of the legislation.\nIt was held that section 2, 1 (b) did apply. In the course of his judgment Lord Russell of Killowen considered the decision in Sudeley's case and said that it was not in any way a decision that the widow in that case, or her executors, had no interest in the New Zealand mortgages, but that the gist of the decision was that she had no interest in the mortgages so as to make them an asset of her estate.\nAssuming that the view of Lord Russell was that for the purposes of such legislation as the Finance Act, the widow in Sudeley's case was to be considered as having an interest within the meaning of that Act, and applying that view to the case at bar, George Steed had not only his claim against the executor of Bonnie Steed in California, but an interest in the assets of Bonnie Steed, one of which was an interest in the assets of the estate of Katherine Williams in British Columbia. In other words, George Steed had an interest in the interest of Bonnie Steed in Katherine Williams' residuary estate. When one comes to Kenneth Raeburn, he, similarly, had an interest in the interest of George Steed in the interest of Bonnie Steed in the residuary estate of Katherine Williams.\nIn my opinion, while \"property\" is defined by section 2(k) of the statute as including every estate and \"interest\" in real and personal property capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on death, I see no reason for construing this statute, without more express language, as including an interest in an interest or more remote interests.\nIn my opinion therefore the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014The bequest by Adolphus Williams to Katherine Wylie Williams, his wife, was the sum of $150,000 or one-half of his estate, whichever might be the larger sum, and it was directed that this bequest should be a first and prior charge on the estate and not subject to any abatement. After making certain further smaller bequests all of the testator's real and personal property was devised to trustees to sell and call in and convert into money and out of the proceeds to pay the debts and the legacies bequeathed by the will, and the trustees were empowered to postpone the conversion of any of the testator's property for so long as they should think best in the interest of the estate. The trustees were further empowered at the request of the wife to convey any part of the real and personal estate at their own fair market value in satisfaction of her legacy. By a codicil it was provided that the named trustees should pay interest on the legacy to the wife in monthly instalments at the rate of five per cent from the date of the death of the testator. By the will of Katherine Wylie Williams made on July 15, 1922, following the death of her husband, after directing the payment of debts, funeral, testamentary expenses, probate and succession duties, and providing a legacy of $5,000 to John Walter Walsh, the trustees were required \"to convey, assign, transfer and set over all the rest and residue of my property, both real and personal, unto my sister Isabella Steed, wife of George V. Steed, of the City of San Francisco, in the State of California\" and in the event of her prior death to transfer such residue to George V. Steed. In the exercise of the discretion given to them by the will of Adolphus Williams, his trustees delayed the conversion into money of the Castle Hotel property in Vancouver, which was the main asset of the estate, until November of 1945 when they were able to effect a sale for $250,000 cash and to provide for the balance of the legacy of $150,000 and accumulated interest for the first time since the death of the testator. In the interval Mrs. Williams had died in the year 1924 and her sister Isabella Steed, who is referred to in the proceedings as Bonnie Steed, on January 10, 1941. Mrs. Williams had received some payments by way of interest upon her legacy and Bonnie Steed some small payments of principal, and the balance payable to the estate of Katherine Wylie Williams at the date of the sale of the property was $134,952.66, the balance of the principal amount of the legacy, and $24,-394.67, accumulated interest.\nAdolphus Williams, his wife Katherine and Bonnie Steed all died prior to the date upon which the Dominion Succession Duty Act came into force and the duty imposed did not attach to the successions in any of these estates. The will of Bonnie Steed made on December 9, 1924, at San Francisco, where she resided with her husband and was domiciled, after directing payment of her debts bequeathed \"all my property, real, personal and mixed of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situated\" unto her husband and appointed him executor. Following the death of Mrs. Steed her husband applied for probate of her will to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, limited to the estate within that province and letters probate were issued on April 1, 1941, and at the time of the death of George V. Steed on August 16, 1944, no other probate had been obtained in California or elsewhere. By the will of George V. Steed made in California on February 4, 1941, he bequeathed \"all my property of whatsoever kind and wheresoever situated\" unto James Kenneth Raeburn, his wife's nephew, and 'by the will of Mr. Raeburn dated October 11, 1944, he left the estate which he had inherited from George V. Steed to his sister and other relations, in varying proportions. Raeburn was killed while on active service with the American Forces in December 1944. It is upon the successions in these two estates that the duties in question have been levied.\nThe assessment made upon the estate of Steed is upon what is said to be a succession of the value of $159,347.33 which, according to the notice of assessment, consisted of money on deposit with the main branch of the Royal Bank of Canada at Vancouver standing in the name of W. W. Walsh in trust. In the estate of Raeburn the dutiable value of the successions is stated to be $143,205.29. The notice in connection with this estate does not assume to designate any particular place as the situs of the moneys bequeathed. While Raeburn had been named the executor of George V. Steed and an application for probate made on his behalf granted in the Supreme Court of California on December 22, 1944, in ignorance of the fact that he had been killed in action earlier that month, his will did not name an executor. Raeburn who by virtue of sec. 75 of the Administration Act, cap. 5, R.S.B.C. 1936 would have had all the powers and rights of George V. Steed as executor of the estate of Bonnie Steed in British Columbia, did not exercise those rights and nothing has been done pursuant to these powers from the date of Steed's death. On March 12, 1945, letters of administration with the will annexed of the will of Raeburn were granted to the respondent Fitzgerald by the Superior Court of California and on January 11, 1946, a like appointment was made in that court in relation to the will of Bonnie Steed. Thereafter Fitzgerald, by power of attorney, authorized the appointment of Mr. Walsh as ancillary administrator of the Bonnie Steed estate in British Columbia and letters of administration with the will annexed de bonis non were granted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on February 5, 1946. Upon the death of Mr. Walsh, Mr. R. H. Tupper was appointed to succeed him as administrator de bonis non of this estate. Property is defined by sec. 2 of the Dominion Succession Duty Act as including inter alia \"property, real or personal, movable or immovable, of every description, and every estate and interest therein or income therefrom capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on the death.\" Succession is defined as meaning:\nevery past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person, to any other person in possession or expectancy, and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession.\nThe duties imposed by the Act are levied where the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled outside of Canada \"upon or in respect of the succession of all property situate in Canada\" and the point for determination is as to whether the succession of Raeburn under the will of George V. Steed and of Nan Raeburn, Thomas W. Raeburn, Elizabeth W. R. Allan and William J. M. Raeburn, under the will of J. K. Raeburn, were successions to property situated in Canada.\nI do not think that the proper determination of this question depends upon the fact that by the will of Adolphus Williams the bequest to his wife was declared to be a first charge upon the estate, since I think this was simply intended as a direction that the wife should be paid in preference to all other legatees and that there was no intention to create a charge in the sense of an encumbrance upon the real and personal assets. Nor do I think that the fact that letters probate of the will of Bonnie Steed were obtained in British Columbia by her executor affects the matter since no one now is vested with the status of executor of the estate in British Columbia and the claim to the moneys in question is made by the administrator with the will annexed, properly authorized by the court in the jurisdiction in which Mrs. Steed was domiciled and died. I am, however, of the opinion that George V. Steed at the time of his death had an interest in the assets of the estate of Adolphus Williams, within the meaning of subs. (k) of sec. 2 of the Act, and that the rights of Raeburn and of his legatees under the respective wills gave to these persons an interest in that property.\nAs of the date of the death of Steed on August 16, 1944, the remaining assets of the Adolphus Williams estate consisted of the Castle Hotel property and some other less valuable properties in Vancouver, and the unpaid portion of the legacy to Katherine Williams with accumulated interest was to be paid out of moneys realized from the sale of the property, in priority to the other legacies. It was this right which the trustees of Katherine Williams were required by her will to transfer and set over unto Bonnie Steed and it was this right which passed to George V. Steed under the bequest of the residue of his wife's estate and of which he died possessed. The right to receive the amount of the bequest from the executors of Katherine Williams was vested in Steed qua executor of his wife's estate. I am, however, of the opinion that Steed in his personal capacity had not only what was referred to by Romer, J. in In re Smyth 17, as an equitable chose in action entitling him to require the executor to administer the estate but also an interest in the assets out of the proceeds of which the legacy was to be paid. In A.-G. v. Watson 18, a testator bequeathed an annuity of \u00a31,000 per annum to be paid out of his residuary estate and primarily out of the income thereof during the life of the annuitant or such less period as in the will mentioned. By s. 2, sub-s. 1 of the Finance Act, 1894, property passing on the death of a deceased was deemed to include property in which the deceased had an interest ceasing on the death of the deceased to the extent by which a benefit accrued or arose by the cesser of such interest, and upon the death of the annuitant the question arose as to whether he had an interest in the testator's residuary estate within the meaning of this section. Lush, J. said at p. 431:\u2014\nOn behalf of the defendants it has been contended that the annuitant had no interest in the corpus, and that no annuitant can be said to have an interest in the property out of which the annuity is payable unless the property has been actually appropriated and set apart to answer the annuity. If that is so of course the contention on behalf of the Crown fails, because there has been no express appropriation or setting apart of any specific property to answer this annuity. But in my judgment that is not the true interpretation to be placed upon s. 2, sub-s. 1 (b), of the Finance Act, 1894. The object of the section is to make estate duty payable whenever there has been a succession in fact, or that which is equivalent to a succession\u2014whenever there has been a cesser of an annuity by reason of the death of the annuitant, which cesser causes a benefit to accrue to that property. And I think one is bound to construe the words \"had an interest\" in the wider sense and not to restrict the words, and put upon them the narrower meaning for which Mr. Disturnal has contended on behalf of the defendants. In my judgment this annuitant had, according to the ordinary use of language, an interest in the corpus of this property; she had an annuity accruing from day to day, payable out of the property, and it was to that property that the annuitant would necessarily look for the payment of her annuity. It is true she had no estate in the property, but she had an interest in it, because that was the source of the annuity bequeathed to her by the testator. It was the fund to which she could look and to which she was entitled to have recourse, and even to claim to have realized for the purpose of paying the annuity.\nIn Skinner v. Attorney-General 19, this decision was approved, Lord Russell of Killowen saying that an annuitant whose annuity is payable out of a testator's estate and who is, therefore, interested in the whole estate is necessarily also interested in all the parts which compose the whole and that her right to take proceedings (if necessary) to have the estate administered for the purpose of providing her annuity is merely the right of enforcing and realizing that interest which she has in the whole and its parts.\nIn the present case the learned trial judge in coming to the conclusion that the administrator of the estate of George V. Steed had no interest, legal or equitable, in the assets of the estate of Adolphus Williams, considered that the matter was concluded by the decision of the House of Lords in Attorney-General v. Sudeley 20, which was followed in Dr. Barnardo's Homes v. Special Income Tax Commissioners 21. In Sudeley's 22 case a testator who had died domiciled in England by his will, after bequeathing certain legacies, gave the residue of his real and personal estate to his executors in trust for his wife for life, and by a codicil gave one-fourth of his \"said residuary real and personal estate\" to his wife absolutely. The will was proved in England by his executors domiciled there and the estate included mortgages on real property in New Zealand. The wife died and her will was proved in England and at the date of her death her husband's estate had not been fully administered, the clear residue had not been ascertained and no appropriation had been made of the New Zealand mortgages to the particular shares of the ultimate residue. It was contended by the executors of the wife that no probate duty was payable under her will upon what they contended to be her fourth interest in the New Zealand mortgages since this was an asset the situs of which was New Zealand. It was held that the rights of the wife's executors was not to one-fourth or any part of the mortgages in specie but to require her husband's executors to administer his personal estate and to receive from them a fourth of the clear residue and that this was an English asset of the wife's estate and, accordingly, probate duty was payable under her will upon one-fourth of the value of the mortgages. Dealing with the contention of the executors, Lord Herschell said that the whole fallacy of the argument rested on the assumption that the testatrix was entitled to any part of the mortgages as an asset and that he did no consider that she or her executors had \"any estate, right or interest, legal or equitable, in these New Zealand mortgages so as to make them an asset of her estate.\" In Skinner's case Lord Russell pointed out that this passage from Lord Herschell's speech made it clear that the interest which had been repudiated was a proprietary interest and that it was not an authority for the proposition that the widow or her executors had no interest in the mortgages, and was certainly no authority against the view that an annuitant whose annuity is charged against the estate \"has an interest\" in the different items of which that estate from time to time consists. As Lord Russell pointed out, the whole point of the decision was that the widow did not own any part of the mortgages.\nThe decision in Dr. Barnardo's Homes 23 case does not appear to me to be at variance with this view of the law. There Dr. Barnardo's Homes National Incorporated Association named as the residuary legatee of an estate claimed that certain income received from investments of the estate following the testator's death but before the residue had been ascertained was exempt from income tax on the footing that the residue was its property. Following the decision in Lord Sudeley's 24 case it was held that until the residue was ascertained the institution had no property in any specific investment forming part of the estate or the income therefrom and that accordingly income tax had been properly levied.\nI think the rights of George V. Steed as at the time of his death were of the same nature as that of the annuitant in In re Smyth 25 and in Skinner's 26 case and that the matter is not affected by the fact that in Steed's case an action against the executors of Katherine and Adolphus Williams for the protection of his rights would normally be made by him in his capacity of executor of the estate of his deceased wife. It was to the real property held by the trustees of Adolphus Williams that Steed was entitled to look for the payment of the legacy and had the personal representative of his wife's estate been someone other than himself and had it been necessary to take some step for the protection of his legacy or to compel the administration of the estate of either Katherine or Adolphus Williams, Steed could have brought such an action in his own name had the personal representative declined to act, joining the representative of his wife's estate as a party defendant. As pointed out by Lord Russell of Killowen in Skinner's 27 case, his right to take proceedings, if necessary, to have the estate administered for the purpose of providing the legacy was merely the right of enforcing or realizing the interest which he had in the whole estate. In my opinion, the decisions in Sudeley's 28 case and in that of Dr. Bar-nardo's Homes 29 do not affect the matter to be decided here. The definition of \"property\" in sec. 2(k) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act says that the term includes every interest in property, real or personal, and not merely proprietary interests. If there could be any doubt as to the sense in which the word \"proprietary\" was used by Lord Russell in Skinner's 30 case it would be dispelled by the context. It was used to distinguish between the interest of one who claims a right of property in or ownership of assets, and one who has an interest arising out of \/the fact that an annuity is to be paid out of the income of such assets or the proceeds of their sale. In my opinion, Steed had no such proprietary interest in the assets of the estate of the late Adolphus Williams in the sense that that term is used in Skinner's 31 case, but that appears to me to be aside from the point.\nThe tax imposed by the Dominion Succession Duty Act is upon the succession and in the estate of Steed the succession of the interest was to Raeburn and I consider that his rights as against the assets in the hands of the executors of Adolphus Williams did not differ from those of his predecessor. When Mr. Raeburn made his will it was in the form of a letter addressed to his sister and was apparently made while he was on active service. The exact nature of the bequests to Nan Raeburn, Thomas W. Raeburn, Elizabeth W. R. Allan and William J. M. Raeburn, was expressed to be fractional portions of the estate which he had inherited from the late George V. Steed and in the case of Nan Raeburn certain bonds, an insurance policy and some cash which had not formed part of the inheritance. In the case of these legatees a further administration intervenes but, for the same reason which leads me to conclude that George V. Steed died possessed of an interest in the assets of the estate of Adolphus Williams within the meaning of sec. 2(k) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, I think these legatees succeeded to such an interest.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment in the Exchequer Court set aside. There should be a declaration that the moneys deposited in the Royal Bank of Canada in trust are liable to payment of succession duty at the appropriate rate on the dutiable value of the successions referred to in the assessment notices. The appellant should have the costs of the proceedings in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Clark, Robertson, Mac-Donald & Connelly.\nSolicitor for the respondent Fitzgerald: E.

Without alteration of its share capital it then, under section 4(2) of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, S. of C. 1940-41, c. 32, sought to have added to its own standard profits those of the businesses it had taken over. Section 4(2) provides:\n\"On the application of a taxpayer who acquired his business as a going concern after January 1, 1938, if the Minister is satisfied that the business carried on by the taxpayer is not substantially different from the business of his or its predecessor, he may direct that the standard profits of the said predecessor may be taken into account in ascertaining the standard profits of the said taxpayer.\"\nHeld: Affirming the decision of the Exchequer Court (1)\u2014, that the appellant did not acquire its business as a going concern after January 1, 1938. What, it did was to enlarge the business previously carried on by it by purchase of the assets of the three companies. S. 4(2) therefore does not apply to such a case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, 1 Cameron J., affirming the assessment of the appellant under The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, S. of C. 1940-41, c. 32, as amended, for the taxation year 1942.\nJohn R. Cartwright K.C. and B. M. Osier for the appellant.\nG\u00e9rard Beaudoin and E. S. McLatchy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal against a decision of the Exchequer Court affirming the assessment of the appellant, the Borden Company Limited, under The Excess Profits Tax Act, chapter 32 of the Statutes of 1940 as amended, for the taxation year 1942. Either under its present or a previous name, the appellant has been in existence for a number of years, manufacturing milk products and also carrying on a fluid milk and dairy products business. It is, I think, unnecessary to state in detail the various changes that occurred in the nature of the business carried on by the appellant before 1937 because in that year it purchased all the shares of twenty-six operating companies from a subsidiary of a United States parent concern and all the assets and business of one of its own subsidiaries, and by this step re-entered the fluid milk business which for some time previous, it had ceased to operate.\nAmong the companies the shares of which the appellant had purchased in 1937 were Laurentian Dairy Limited, Moyneur Co-operative Creamery Limited, and Caulfield's Dairy Limited. As of January 1, 1941, it purchased the assets of the first two companies and as of June 1, 1942, it purchased the assets of the third company.\nUnder section 3 of The Excess Profits Tax Act there is to be assessed, levied and paid a tax upon the excess profits of every corporation or joint stock company residing or ordinarily resident in Canada or carrying on business in Canada. The appellant did not file a consolidated return pursuant to subsection 3 of section 35 of the Income War Tax Act and, therefore, it does not come within paragraph (i) of section 2(c) of The Excess Profits Tax Act but within paragraph (ii) so that, as to it, \"excess profits\" means the amount by which its profits exceed one hundred and sixteen and six hundred and sixty-six one thousandths per centum of its standard profits. For present purposes, \"standard profits\" means the average yearly profits in the years 1936 to 1939 both inclusive because it is admitted that the appellant was during those years carrying on the same class of business as it did in the year in question, 1942.\nUnless, therefore, the appellant can bring itself within some other provision of the Act, there can be no question that it was correctly assessed. The contention is that subsection 2 of section 4 applies:\u2014\n(2) On the application of a taxpayer who acquired his business as a going concern after January first, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, if the Minister is satisfied that the business carried on by the tax- payer is not substantially different from the business of his or its predecessor, he may direct that the standard profits of the said predecessor, may be taken into account in ascertaining the standard profits of the said taxpayer.\nI think that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that it cannot be said that the appellant acquired its business as a going concern after January 1, 1938. The case of a company which starts a new business is referred to in other provisions of the Act, and apparently what Parliament had in mind in subsection 2 of section 4 is a new taxpayer who has acquired its business as a going concern after the specified date. The appellant is not a new taxpayer with reference to the business carried on by it. It is the same taxpayer carrying on a business, enlarged, it is true, to some extent by its purchase of the assets of the three companies, but it is still the same business, and it cannot be said that that was acquired as a going concern after January 1, 1938. Furthermore, \"predecessor\" is not an apt word in the context in which it is found to describe any of the three companies.\nThe trial judge dealt with the question as to whether in any event the power of the Minister, to \"direct\" is to direct the Board of Referees for whose appointment provision is made by section 13 of the Act. At the moment I have grave doubts as to whether this is so but I prefer to express no opinion on the subject since my conclusion on the first point is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. The standard profits of Laurentian Dairy Limited, Moyneur Co-operative Creamery Limited and Caulfield's Dairy Limited were quite properly not taken into account in ascertaining the standard profits of the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.\u2014The appellant carried on a large business during the standard period under The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and its standard profits standing alone are not in question. In 1941 and 1942 it acquired the assets and business of three subsidiaries as going concerns which themselves were carried on during that period, but without alteration in its share capital. It now seeks to have added to its own standard profits those of the businesses taken over and section 4(2) of the Act is invoked. I think it clear that section 4(2) is confined to a case where after January 1, 1938, a person acquires \"his business\" as distinguished from an addition to his business, as a going concern that was carried on in the standard period and continues it in substance as it was under his or its predecessor. In that situation section 5(2) comes into play. If the acquisition has been made in 1938, on the application of the taxpayer, or if after January 2, 1939, without an application, the Minister refers the case to the Board of Referees. Section 4(2) provides that in either case the Minister may direct the Board to take into account the, standard profits, if there were such, of the predecessor. Two years is ordinarily the minimum period for the determination of such profits as average yearly profits, under the definition section 2(1) (i), and where the successor has less than that time within the standard period the case thus becomes or may become one for the Board.\nWhat the appellant did was to add to the capital employed in its business. The Act makes provision for such cases, but the conditions laid down were not here complied with.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.\u2014Section 4, subsection 2, of The Excess Profits Tax Act, as it stood with relation to the year 1942, is as follows:\nOn the application of a taxpayer who acquired his business as a going concern after January first one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, if the Minister is satisfied that the business carried on by the taxpayer is not substantially different from the business of his or its predecessor, he may direct that the standard profits of the said predecessor may be taken into account in ascertaining the standard profits of the said taxpayer.\nAs of January 1, 1941, the appellant purchased, as a going concern in each case, the business and assets of Laurentian Dairy Limited and Moyneur Co-operative Creamery Limited, and as of June 1, 1942, the business and assets of Caulfield's Dairy Limited. Appellant contends that the above subsection is applicable to entitle it to have included in its standard profits for the year 1942, or the proportionate part thereof, the standard profits previously applicable to the companies whose assets were purchased. It is contended by the respondent, and this contention has been given effect to by the court below, that the subsection does not apply to a taxpayer who, while already in business, acquired a further business or businesses since the date mentioned in the subsection.\nThe appellant's contention really is that \"his\" in the first line of the subsection is to be read as \"a\". Read literally in its actual form the subsection does not apply to the case at bar and when one finds that there is other provision in the statute covering the identical case presented by the facts here present, the subsection is, in my opinion, to be construed as the learned judge (below has construed it. Subsection 1 of section 4 makes provision for an adjustment of standard profits where any alteration in the capital employed has taken place, provided other conditions not here present are met. The phrase \"capital employed\" is defined in the first schedule to the Act and includes the value of assets acquired by purchase after the commencement of the business of the purchaser. This being so, I think there is no ground upon' which the appellant's contention can be sustained. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Fisher.\n1 1948 Ex. C.R. 20.\n",

The respondent in proceedings taken under section 29 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, to register the words \"super-weave\" as its trade mark, obtained a judgment from the Exchequer Court of Canada declaring that it had been proved to its satisfaction that the mark had been so used by the respondent as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of textiles as indicating that the respondent assumed responsibility for the character and quality of wares bearing that mark.\nIn so doing the respondent complied with the practice of the Exchequer Court\u2014under r. 35 it published notice of the filing of its petition for registration in the Canada Gazette; under r. 36 it served the Minister with a copy of the petition and of the notice, and no one appearing to oppose its application for registration, it then under r. 37 filed the required affidavit with the Registrar of the Court, served the Minister with notice and moved for a declaratory order by serving notice upon the Registrar of Trade Marks whom it named as respondent in the style of cause. The latter then opposed the application.\nHeld: that the appeal should be allowed, and that (reversing the decision of The Exchequer Court), the petition be dismissed.\nHeld: also, Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting in part, that the compound word \"super-weave\" is a laudatory epithet of such common and ordinary usage that it can never become adapted to distinguish within the meaning of s. 2(m) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932. It being impossible to bring the word within the meaning of \"trade mark\" as defined by s. 2(m), an application under s. 29 cannot succeed.\nRand and Kellock JJ. agreed with the majority of the Court that the appeal should be dismissed but only on the ground that the onus of proof imposed upon the applicant by s. 29 had not been met.\nPer Rand J.\u2014The expression \"has become adapted to distinguish\" as used in The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, s. 2(m), includes any case in which the word mark has in fact become the identifying badge of the article to which it is attached so that when associated with goods of a particular trade whatever primary meaning it may have had is submerged and only the trade designation remains.\nPer Rand and Kelock JJ.\u2014When it is proposed to withdraw an ordinary word from the common use the task of establishing the secondary meaning becomes greater according to the extent of that use.\nPer Kellock J.\u2014By the terms of s. 20m) if the symbol \"has become adapted to distinguish\" and \"is used\" for any of the purposes mentioned therein that is sufficient to constitute a registerable mark provided it is not excluded under such sections as 14, 26 and 27. The Court has no discretion to exclude any word apart from the sufficiency of evidence adduced in support of its having become adapted to distinguish the wares of the applicant.\nA clearly descriptive word which has acquired a secondary meaning within s. 29(1) is a word which \"has become adapted to distinguish\" within s. 20m) so that in the case of such a word to satisfy the requirements of the latter part of s. 29, is to satisfy the definition in s. 20m).\nPer Estey J.\u2014A survey of the relevant sections and of the Statute as a whole lead to the conclusion that the phrase \"adapted to distinguish\" has the same meaning in our statute as under the statute in Great Britain. It follows that words commonly used and appropriately described as laudatory epithets cannot become registrable as trade marks. Also, that the appellant having been named as a party and so treated by the Exchequer Court, had the necessary status to appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Cameron J., (July 30, 1947), granting a declaration in the terms of s. 29(1) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, with respect to the compound word \"super-weave\" in relation to cotton goods, woollen goods and synthetic textiles as to the whole of Canada.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. and J. C. Osborne for the appellant.\nG. H. Riches for the respondent.\nKerwin, J.\u2014This is an appeal by the Registrar of Trade Marks from an Order of the Exchequer Court made on the application of the Respondent, G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited, under Section 29 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932. This section reads as follows:\u2014\n\"29. (1) Notwithstanding that a trade mark is not registrable under any other provision of this Act it may be registered if, in any action or proceeding in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the court by its judgment declares that it has been proved to its satisfaction that the mark has been so used by any person as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class of wares in association with which it has been used, as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of person by whom they have been produced or for their place of origin.\n(2) Any such declaration shall define the class of wares with respect to which proof has been adduced as aforesaid and shall specify whether, having regard to the evidence adduced, the registration should extend to the whole of Canada or should be limited to a defined territorial area in Canada.\n(3) No declaration under this section shall authorize the registration pursuant thereto of any mark identical with or similar to a mark already registered for use in association with similar wares by any person who was not a party to the action or proceeding in which the declaration was made.\nBy the Order appealed from, the Court declared that it had been proven to its satisfaction that the trade mark \"SUPER-WEAVE\" had been so used by the respondent as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and users of textiles including cotton goods, woollen goods and synthetic textiles, as indicating that the respondent assumed responsibility for their character and quality or for their place of origin. And the Court further declared that having regard to the evidence produced, any registration of the said trade mark \"SUPER-WEAVE\" in association with textiles including cotton goods, woollen goods and synthetic textiles should extend to the whole of Canada.\nThe preliminary point raised by the respondent may first be determined. Under rule 35 of the Exchequer Court Act notice of the application was given in the Canada Gazette requiring any person desiring to oppose the petition to file a statement of his objections with the Registrar of the Court within fourteen days after the last insertion of the notice, and serve a copy upon the petitioner. No objections were filed, but presumably Rule 35 was complied with by the petitioner, and a copy of the petition and notice above mentioned was served upon the Minister charged with the administration of the Act. Certainly the petitioner complied with Rule 37, which provides that if no one appears to oppose the application, the petitioner may file with the Registrar of the Court an affidavit in support thereof, and upon ten days' notice to the Minister, and upon serving him with a copy of any affidavit so filed, may move the Court for such Order as upon the petition and affidavit he may be entitled to. This was done by serving a notice upon the Registrar of Trade Marks, who was named as respondent in the style of cause, notifying him of the application for an Order setting the date for the hearing of the application. The Registrar of Trade Marks opposed the application, but the respondent complains that it had no notice of the intention of the Registrar of Trade Marks, and now takes the position that the latter never was a party to the proceedings and has no status to appeal. This objection cannot prevail, as the Registrar was named as a party and was so treated by the Exchequer Court. However, I agree with the learned trial judge that the Registrar of Trade Marks should comply with Paragraph 2 of Rule 36 and file and serve a statement of his objections to such a petition.\nThe evidence on the application consisted of the affidavit of the vice-president of the respondent, showing the nature of the latter's business and how it has progressed, and the nature of its advertising, together with several affidavits from persons connected with the laundry business or hospitals in different parts of Canada. The deponents were not cross-examined and no affidavits were filed in answer. It might be pointed out that generally speaking the advertising shows that the word \"SUPERWEAVE\" is overlaid with the words \"COTTONS Reg\u2019d.\", and no satisfactory explanation of the precise meaning of this was given. However, even accepting the findings made by the trial judge upon this evidence, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed. The trial judge referred to the principle laid down in what is known as the Perfection Case, Joseph Cros-field's & Sons Ltd. Application 1, that an ordinary laudatory epithet cannot acquire a secondary signification. He also referred to the decision of the President of the Exchequer Court in C. Fairall Fisher v. British Columbia Packers, Limited, known as the \"Sea-Lect Case, 2, and, as a matter of fact, the trial judge, shortly after the decision in the present case, decided in Standard Stoker Company Inc. v. The Registrar of Trade Marks, 3 that the word \"standard\" used in connection with goods was of a laudatory nature and could not mean the articles made by the Petitioner.\nIt might be added that this same principle was approved by the House of Lords in A. Bailey & Co. Ltd. v. Clark, Son & Morland, Ltd., 4 and by the Privy Council in The Canadian Shredded Wheat Co. Ltd. v. Kellogg Co. of Canada, Ltd., et al, 5.\nThe trial judge considered that \"SUPER-WEAVE\" is not an ordinary laudatory epithet such as \"best\", \"perfect\" or \"select\". He would have refused an application for the single word \"SUPER\", which, as he points out, is here used as an abbreviation of the word \"superior\". In his opinion, \"WEAVE\" is descriptive of the character of the goods as indicating that they are manufactured by the process of weaving, and \"SUPER-WEAVE\" in its primary sense would indicate a better quality of weaving. He considered that the word \"SUPER-WEAVE\" was not a common or ordinary laudatory word in ordinary use, but that it came within the statement in the judgment of the Master of the Rolls in the Perfection Case, supra, at p. 854, that \"in the case of a peculiar collocation of words it (the Court) might be satisfied with reasonable proof of acquired distinctiveness even though the words taken separately might be descriptive words in common use.\" With respect, I am unable to agree. The Oxford English Dictionary contains the following definitions of \"superior\", \"super\" and \"weave\".\nSUPERIOR, a.\n6. Higher in status or quality than; hence greater or better than * * * more or better than, above, beyond.\nSUPER, sb.\n6.=superfine\n1881 Instr. Census Clerks (1885) 64 woolen cloth manufacture*** Super Weaver. 1885 Times (Weekly ed.) 5 June 7\/2 of the power looms, 1700 are devoted to the production of extra supers and 3-ply carpets.\nSUPER, a.\n2.=superfine 4.\n1842 Bischoff Woolen Manuf. II. 187 Long wool of the best class that is grown in Kent, which we term super matching, or long drawing.\nSUPER, prefix\n6. prefixed to sbs. with adj. force; higher in rank, quality, degree, or amount; of a higher kind or nature; superior.\nWEAVE, sb.\n2. A particular method or pattern of weaving.\nThe word \"SUPER\" is thus indicative of \"superior\", or \"superfine\" quality especially in the textile industry, and the word \"WEAVE\" is particularly apt to describe an important characteristic of textiles. The result is that the compound word \"SUPER-WEAVE\" clearly indicates and describes textiles that have a superior or superfine weave, an attribute that is unquestionably much desired by purchasers and users of such wares and, therefore, an attribute which a trader in textiles would naturally wish to emphasize in offering his wares for sale. Such a word may not be commandeered by one manufacturer and registered under The Unfair Competition Act so as to prevent others from claiming the same quality in their merchandise and using the same or a similar expression to describe it.\nIt may be advisable to say that I am dealing only with an application to register. The decision of the Court of Appeal in the Matter of an Application by J. & P. Coats, Ld. 6 for registration of a Trade-Mark (sheen), so much relied upon by the respondent, was decided, as the Master of the Rolls points out at p. 380, on the basis that the word \"sheen\" was clearly not a merely laudatory word like \"perfection\", or \"best\", or \"classic\", or \"universal\", or \"artistic\".\nIt was not contended that if the Court came to the conclusion that \"SUPER-WEAVE\" was an ordinary laudatory expression the application should succeed, but, in view of the argument addressed to us, it is advisable to state what appears to be the proper construction of section 29 of the Act. The opening words of subsection 1 \"notwithstanding that a trade mark is not registrable under any other provision of this Act\" require one to examine the definition of trade mark in section 2(m). That definition states that \"trade mark\" means a symbol \"which has become adapted to distinguish\". While this wording differs from section 9 of the English Act in question in the Perfection Case, since in section 9 \"distinctive\" is stated to mean \"adapted to distinguish\", no distinction should be drawn between the uses of the different tenses. Turning again to section 29, while the Court is empowered to grant the declaration mentioned, notwithstanding that a trade mark is not register-able under any other provision of the Act, the original idea underlying such legislation, as it has been developed in England, should be followed here, with the result that, if a word is held to be purely laudatory, no amount of use or recognition by dealers or users of words as indicating that a certain person assumes responsibility for the character or quality of the merchandise would be sufficient to take such an expression out of the common domain and enable the user thereof to become registered as the owner of a trade mark under The Unfair Competition Act.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the Petition dismissed, both without costs.\nTaschereau, J.\u2014The learned trial Judge reached the conclusion that he was satisfied that the trade mark \"Super-Weave\" had been so used by the respondent, as to have been generally recognized by dealers in and users of textiles, cot- ton and woollen goods, as indicating that the respondent assumed responsibility for their character or quality or for their place of origin.\nHe also held that the same words were not ordinary laudatory epithets and that they may constitute a trade mark so as to be entitled to registration.\nWih due respect, I cannot agree, as I believe that the compound word \"Super-Weave\" is a laudatory epithet, and is capable of application to the goods of any one else. Of its very nature it is common property and cannot be made the subject of monopoly. It is used for the purpose of advertising the superior quality of the weaving of a particular commodity.\nI agree with my brother Kerwin, that the appellant, having been named as a party, and having been so treated by the Exchequer Court, has the necessary status to lodge the present appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed, but without costs.\nRand, J.\u2014This appeal raises questions in the interpretation of the Unfair Competition Act, 1982, of some difficulty and they exemplify again the necessity for caution in interpreting a Canadian statute by the light of English decisions on English statutes.\nMr. Gowling invites us to attribute to \"trade mark\" the characteristic of being \"distinctive\" as defined in the English Trade Marks Act, 1905, and as this involves the substance of the contention on behalf of the Registrar it is desirable to consider briefly the conceptions of trade mark attributes written into these statutes.\nUnder section 9 of the English Act certain essential particulars are prescribed for a registrable mark and then an omnibus subsection (5) permits under certain conditions the registration of \"any other distinctive mark\". For that purpose, \"distinctive\" means \"adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade mark from those of others\"; and in determining whether a mark is so adapted the tribunal may \"in the case of a trade mark in actual use, take into consideration the extent to which such user has rendered such a trade mark in fact distinctive for the goods with respect of which it is registered or proposed to be registered\". From this it is seen that the determination in each case is whether the mark is \"distinctive\" as defined, whether the quality and character of the word, as it is found in the body of the language, stamp it as so adapted; and it follows that for various reasons certain words will be excluded. The monopoly of a registered mark appropriates from ordinary trade use words which otherwise would be open to all; and the legislative requirement raises at once interests of the public as well as competitors. Under the English decisions it is settled that words of the normal vocabulary which a manufacturer or seller of goods would ordinarily use in either describing or appraising his wares are outside the scope of the statute; and even though by long continued and exclusive use a word may have come actually to indicate particular goods, that fact is only evidential of the character of the word mark which the statute requires.\nOn the other hand there can be this de facto distinctiveness. It is doubtful that any word can be said to be incapable, regardless of time or circumstance, of such an adaptation. We would say of such a mark that it \"has become distinctive\"; and I find that the Lord Chancellor in the Glastonbury case, 7 at page 258 in dealing with that aspect of adaptation, says: \"It is not in dispute that the respondents in the circumstances of this case were called upon to prove by evidence that the word 'Glastonbury' or 'Glastonbury's' alone had become, at the date of registration, adapted to distinguish their goods from those of other persons.\" The Court there rejected the mark because in spite of the de facto adaptation it had not the distinctive quality specified by the statute. The difference between the two conceptions is made clear also by Lord Parker in the W. & G. mark case, 8 at page 637; and by Lord Justice Hamilton in R. J. Lea Ltd., 9 at page 463 in this language: \"Further, the Act says 'adapted to distinguish'; the mere proof or admission that a mark does in fact distinguish does not ipso facto compel the judge to deem that mark to be distinctive. It must be further 'adapted to distinguish', which brings within the purview of his discretion the wider field of the interests of strangers and of the public.\" With that distinction in mind, then, let us examine the definition of \"trade mark\" in section 2(m) of the Canadian Act. By this, \"trade mark\" means \"a symbol which has become adapted to distinguish particular wares falling within a general category from other wares falling within the same category and is used by any person in association with wares entering into trade or commerce for the purpose of indicating to dealers in, and\/or users of such wares that have been manufactured, sold, leased or hired by him or, etc.\" The word \"distinctive\" is seen to be absent; it appears only once in the statute, in section 28(1) (d) where it is used in relation to a foreign mark. That fact I consider significant. On the other hand, in the definition of \"distinguishing guise\", section 2(d), the expression \"is adapted to distinguish\" is used. There is, therefore, no restriction to marks which are \"distinctive\" in the sense of the English Act.\nThe expression \"has become adapted to distinguish\" includes then any case in which the word mark has in fact become the identifying badge of the article to which it is attached; that when it is presented to the mind associated with goods of a particular trade, whatever primary meaning it may have had is submerged, and only the trade designation remains: J. & P. Coats, Ld., 10. If, therefore, a word is used which describes or imports characteristics or qualities of goods, that connotation must have so disappeared before it can be said to have become so adapted; and when it is proposed to withdraw an ordinary word from the common use the task of establishing that exclusive secondary meaning becomes greater according to the extent of that use.\nWith these considerations in mind, I turn to the case before us. The mark offered is the compound word \"Super-Weave\". For thirteen years it has been used in connection with textiles, including cottons, woollens and synthetic fabrics, and the mode of its use has taken several forms. The elements of it are ordinary words and their sense is clearly descriptive of quality, and for that reason it was assumed, and properly so, to be excluded from section 26; but an application was made to the Exchequer Court under section 29, and it becomes necessary to give some: consideration to the language of that section:\u2014\n29. (1) Notwithstanding that a trade mark is not registrable under any other provision of this Act it may be registered if, in any action or proceeding in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the court by its judgment declares that it has been proved to its satisfaction that the mark has been so used by any person as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class of wares in 'association with which it has been used, as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of person by whom they have been produced or for their place of origin.\nThe expression \"as to have become generally recognized * * * as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality, etc.\" appears in this statute, apparently, for the first time. It is contained also in section 2, subsections (k) and (l) in relation to definitions of the word \"similar\". \"Responsibility\" seems to signify only what is imported by every trade mark, i.e. the commercial integrity and dependability of the owner of the mark. But the proof required by the section is both the fact that the mark has become adapted to distinguish certain goods from other goods of the same class as required by the definition and that the owner of it has become generally known as assuring quality or character, etc.\nWhat, then, is the evidence of these matters offered to the Court? There are eight affidavits by customers of the applicant who are familiar with the wares and who say, incorporating the language of the section, that in effect \"Super-Weave\" means to them the goods of the applicant. There is also evidence of considerable advertising over the period of its use. What is asked for is the monopoly of this mark throughout the Dominion. The purchasers generally are laundries, dry cleaners, linen suppliers, hotels, hospitals and other institutions; but that the exclusiveness of the identifying sense of the word is in fact present to the minds of the customers, apart from that part of the trade which has not spoken, is by no means made out; and much less has it been shown to be recognized \"generally\" by Canadian dealers as attaching responsibility to the owner. Obviously, to customers purchasing these goods over some years the word would be associated with their origin; but that is short of the identification with the goods in which the descriptive sense of the word has disappeared. Neither that nor the general recognition required has, in my opinion, been made out and the application fails.\nThe respondent took the objection that the Registrar, representing the Minister, had no standing to appeal because he had not, under rule 38 of the Exchequer Court, appeared by filing a statement of objections to the application. I agree that the rule applies to the Minister. By rule 41, however, notice of trial must be served on the Minister. The effect of this is that any default under rule 38 is superseded; and notwithstanding default, the Minister continues as a party. That being so, he has a right of appeal under section 56 of the Act.\nAs this is the first occasion upon which this Court has been called upon to interpret the unusual language of this statute, the applicant should be given leave, if it desires, to present new evidence to the Exchequer Court to bring. itself within the section. I would therefore allow the appeal without costs and refer the matter back to that Court.\nKellock, J.\u2014By the judgment of the Exchequer Court (Cameron J.) in appeal, respondent has been granted a declaration in the terms of section 29(1) of the Unfair Competition Act with respect to the compound word \"Super-Weave\" in relation to cotton goods, woollen goods and synthetic textiles extending to the whole of. the Dominion.\nAppellant contends in the first place that as the words in question are of a laudatory character and clearly descriptive of the said goods they are incapable of registration under the statute. It is said that the Canadian Statute in this respect is to all intents and purposes the same as the corresponding provisions of the English Trade Marks Act, 1905 and that the decisions under the last mentioned statute, excluding from registration laudatory epithets, have equal application under the Canadian Act.\nThe first four paragraphs of section 9 of the English statute provide certain essentials of a registrable trade mark but if a mark does not come within them it may yet be registered upon order of the Board of Trade or the court if it is \"distinctive\", i.e., if, as defined by the statute, it is \"adapted to distinguish\" the goods of the proprietor of the mark from those of other persons. In the determination of that question the tribunal is authorized, if the mark has been in use, to take into consideration the extent to which such user has rendered the mark in fact distinctive, but it has been held that this is a purely discretionary power.\nBailey's case 11, is an illustration of the well settled effect of the English statute, namely, that distinctiveness in fact is not conclusive upon the question of registrability. One extract from the judgment of Lord Maugham L. C. at p. 258 is sufficient:\nIt is not in. dispute that the Respondents in the circumstances of this case were called upon to prove by evidence that the word \"Glastonbury\" or \"Glastonburys\" alone had become, at the date of registration, adapted to distinguish their goods from those of other persons, and it is further admitted, that even if that question were answered in the affirmative, the tribunal was not bound to allow registration.\nBy the terms of section 2(m) of the Canadian Statute however, if the symbol \"has become adapted to distinguish\" and \"is used\" for any of the purposes mentioned in the paragraph, that is sufficient to constitute a registrable mark provided it is not excluded under such sections as sections 14, 26 and 27. The court, in considering whether or not any particular word satisfies the provisions of the definition section, has no discretion under the Canadian Statute to exclude any word at the threshold of the hearing or to refuse to hear evidence designed to establish that in fact it has become adapted to distinguish. Section 26(1) (c) excludes all words which are clearly descriptive or mis-descriptive of the character or quality of the wares in connection with which it is proposed to use them and no differentiation is made as among words or classes of words whether laudatory or otherwise. In my opinion therefore it is not open to the court to exclude any word apart from the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in support of its having become adapted to distinguish the wares of the applicant.\nThe language used in section 2(m) is \"has become\" adapted to distinguish not \"is\" distinctive or \"is\" adapted to distinguish. In the Perfection case 12, Fletcher Moulton L. J. in discussing the provision in the English statute enabling the court to take into consideration the extent to which user had in fact rendered a mark distinctive, said at p. 147:\nTo my mind this provision can bear but one interpretation. It recognizes that distinctiveness, i.e., being adapted to distinguish the goods from those of other traders, is not necessarily an innate quality of the word. It may be acquired. There may be cases in which, if the Court says, \"The word is descriptive of the goods, and cannot be distinctive solely of your make of those goods,\", the applicant may (if he can) reply thereto, \"I will shew that it can become distinctive of my make of those goods by shewing that it has actually become so either generally or in a particular market.\" To use a phrase suggested by Farwell L. J. during the argument, the reply is of the type of 'solvitur ambulando': \"It can denote my goods because it actually does so.\"\nIn that case the learned Lord Justice was satisfied that the evidence showed that \"the past user of the word has identified it in the eyes of the public with the goods of the applicants\". Nevertheless under the English statute although a mark has become distinctive, that fact does not necessarily remove objection to a word itself if the word, considered as a word, \"is\" not adapted to distinguish. Under the Canadian statute however, if a word \"has become\" so adapted, that is sufficient.\nAs was said by Kindersley V. C. in Archer v. Kelly, 13, at 304:\nThe word \"become\" in its usual and proper acceptation imports a change of condition, that is the entering into a new state or condition by a change from some former state or condition.\n\"Adapted\" means \"fitted\" or \"suitable\". A word not originally fitted or suitable to serve as a trade-mark may in my view become so, and I am unable to identify the expression \"has become\" with \"is\", although, no doubt it may well include it.\nWhile section 26(1) (c) is exclusionary, nevertheless registration may be had if, on application to the court under section 29, it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the mark has been so used as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class1 of wares in association with which it has been used as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality, or for the other matters mentioned in the subsection. It is contended by the appellant that the applicant under this subsection is met at the outset with having to establish that he has a \"trade-mark\", i.e., that he must satisfy the court that the mark meets the provisions of section 2(m). In this view, having regard to the provisions of section 12, an applicant who is a manufacturer or vendor is required to establish under section 2(m) that:\n(a) his mark has become adapted to distinguish his wares; and\n(b) that it is used in association with the wares for the purpose of indicating to dealers in and\/or users that they have been 'manufactured or sold by him;\nand under section 29(1):\nthat the mark has been so used as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users as indicating that such person \"assumes responsibility for their character or quality\".\nThe words \"assumes responsibility for their character or quality\" in the above section are also to be found in sections 2(k) and (l) and I think that these words were intended by the draftsman to be construed as the equivalent of the words \"manufactured, sold, leased or hired by him\" as used in section 2(m). Reference to sections 26(1) (c) and 27(1) (b) would indicate that in their context the words \"the character or quality of the wares\" was there intended to serve a somewhat similar function.\nIn section 2(m) the use specified is use for a purpose. In section 29(1) the use is use which has produced a result. I think that whatever may be the situation in the case of other symbols, a clearly descriptive word which has acquired a secondary meaning within section 29(1) is a word which has \"become adapted to distinguish\" within section 2(m) so that in the case of such a word, to satisfy the requirements of the latter part of section 29 is to satisfy the definition in section 2(m).\nWhile the approach to the construction of the Canadian statute is not, in my opinion, the same as in the case of the English Statute, nevertheless by reason of section 26(1) (c) I would employ the language of Fletcher Moulton L. J. in the Perfection case, supra at 858:\nThe tribunal before whom is brought an application to register a word under paragraph 5 is entitled to regard the word as prima facie unsuitable by reason of its being outside the specified classes, and it is for the applicant to show that it is proper to be registered * * * The extent to which the Court will require the proof of this acquired distinctiveness to go will depend on the nature of the case. If the objections to the word itself are not very strong it will act on less proof of acquired distinctiveness than it would require in the case of a word which in itself was open to grave objection.\nI think that the burden of proof increases in direct ratio to the degree in which a word, or words, is in common use as descriptive of an article of trade or laudatory thereof. In Canadian Shredded Wheat Co. v. Kellogg, 14 Lord Russell said at 142:\nBut the onus on the person who attempts to establish this secondary meaning is a heavy one * * * Where the words are purely descriptive and in common use it is even more difficult to conceive a case in which they could acquire a secondary meaning.\nI think this language is applicable to the present statute.\nComing to the evidence, the respondent alleges that on January 1, 1933, it adopted the word \"Super-Weave\" as a trade-mark and applied the same to cotton, woollen and synthetic textiles) and that it has since continuously used the said mark in Canada therewith. In the affidavit supporting the petition, made by an officer of the respondent, it is said that a small percentage of the goods manufactured or merchandised by the respondent is sold to the retail trade but that sales are confined principally to launderers, dry cleaners, linen suppliers and institutions such as hospitals and hotels which purchase goods from the respondent either by the piece or manufactured into articles such as laundry bags, laundry wash mats, press cover cloths, towels, knitted padding for ironers and similar types of products. While it is said, as above mentioned, that the respondent has continuously used the words \"Super-Weave\" since its adoption on January 1, 1933, it is significant that on the 20th of January, 1933, the respondent registered, not the trade-mark \"Super-Weave\" but \"Hardie's Super-Weave\". While this registration was with respect to \"cotton, woollen, linen and all other cloth materials and merchandise\", and while the affidavit says that the petitioner's wares have always been identified by the trade-mark \"Super-Weave\", simpliciter, the exhibits show that what was in part used was \"Superweave\" as one word with the words \"Cottons Reg'd.\" superimposed thereon. The affidavit also says that all stationery, invoices, wrapping paper, packages and cartons used by the petitioner in connection with the merchandising and distribution of its products have the word \"Super-Weave\" prominently displayed thereon but the stationery produced bears the words \"G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited Super-Weave Cotton Goods\". Similarly, the sample of wrapping paper used to package small parcels has the same words in slightly different form and the same applies to the sample of cartons used in the case of large packages. Again, the purchase order form and the same applies to the sample of cartons used in the case of large packages. Again, the purchase order form uses the words \"Superweave\" with the words \"Cottons Reg'd.\" superimposed, and the same is true of the invoice form, the salesman's order form and the form of desk pad. The respondent's letter-head uses \"G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited Super-Weave Cotton Goods\" and the office order form uses the style \"G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited, Manufacturers and Wholesalers Super Weave Textiles\".\nUnder the provisions of section 6 a trade-mark is deemed to have been, or to be used, for the purposes of the Act. in association with wares if \"by its being marked on the wares themselves, or on the packages in which they are distributed, or by its being in any other manner so associated with the wares at the time of the transfer of the property therein or of possession thereof in the ordinary course of trade and commerce notice of the association is then given to the persons to whom the property or possession is transferred\". None of the exhibits produced, as mentioned above, which would appear to come within, the contemplation of this section use the words \"Super-Weave\" alone.\nIn In re Powell's Trade-Mark 15, at 401, Lindley L. J. said:\nThe cases which have been referred to * * * all shew that the user as a trade-mark must be the user of that which is registered as the trademark alone, and mot in combination with something else.\nSee also Richards v. Butcher 16.\nIn addition to the affidavit mentioned above, the respondent filed an affidavit by officers of two laundries in Toronto, one in the city of St. John, N.B., one in the city of Winnipeg, one in the city of Montreal, one in the city of Victoria, one in the city of Calgary. There is also an affidavit of the superintendent of a hospital of the city of Toronto. All of these affidavits are essentially in the same form. The following are typical paragraphs:\n2. That the said NEW METHOD LAUNDRY CO. (LIMITED is a firm of launderers, dry cleaners and linen suppliers using various types of textile goods, including laundry bags, laundry identification tags, laundry wash nets, sheeting, press cover cloths, 'knitted padding for ironers towels and towelling.\n3. That I have been familiar with the trade mark \"Super-Weave\", as used by G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited, in association with textiles since 1933, and I am familiar with all the products of G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited by reason of receiving advertising literature correspondence and invoices describing said products which are sold under the name \"Super-Weave\".\n4. That said NEW METHOD LAUNDRY CO. LIMITED, have since 1933 purchased from G A. Hardie & Co. Limited many hundreds of dollars worth of textile goods bearing the trade mark \"Super-Weave\".\n5. That the said trade mark \"Super-Weave\" indicates to me that textiles, including Cotton goods, Woollen goods and Synthetic textiles bearing the said trade mark are manufactured and sold by G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited, that they are of a defined standard and that G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited assumes responsibility for their character and quality. The said trade-mark has no other meaning to me.\n6. Whenever I see textiles sold under the name \"Super-Weave\", I immediately associate the same with the products of G. A. Hardie & Co. Limited, and I am led to believe that the same are manufactured and sold by the said firm.\"\nIt is obvious that these affidavits are quite insufficient to establish the \"general\" recognition required by the provisions of section 29. There must be hundreds of other laundries and there are many other hospitals throughout the country, none of which are so much as mentioned in the evidence.\nThe statement in paragraph 5 that the trade-mark upon the goods indicates to the deponents that \"they are of a defined standard\" is illustrative, in my opinion, of the weight to be given to the affidavits themselves. By section 30, subsection 3, it is provided that if the mark is intended to indicate that the wares are of a defined standard, the application for registration must contain an exact definition of what the use of the mark in association with wares is intended to indicate in respect of the standard which such wares have attained. Nowhere in the affidavits is any information given as to this standard which is indicated to these deponents by the use of this trade-mark and in the absence of such information I take it that these words were quite ignorantly used. Further, an applicant such as the respondent is precluded by section 12 from adopting a mark to indicate its goods are of a defined standard. In my opinion affidavits of this nature, without any evidence as to how they were obtained and which are limited entirely to customers of the applicant for registration, are quite insufficient to satisfy the heavy onus resting upon the person desiring to obtain a judgment under the provisions of section 29 in circumstances such as are here present.\nThe proper practice to be followed in obtaining evidence of any weight for use on such an application as that here in question is indicated in Hack's case, 17, where questionnaires had been submitted to a large number of persons and firms for the purpose of ascertaining by question or questions, not leading in their nature, the meaning to the addressees of the particular trade-mark there in question. The evidence submitted in support of the present petition falls far short of that which is necessary under section 29.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted that should the court be of opinion that the evidence was insufficient the petition should not be dismissed on that ground for the reason that no statement of objections was filed in the court below on behalf of the appellant and the respondent therefore had no notice until the actual trial that any such objection would be taken. Moreover, there is some difference of opinion between counsel as to whether any point was in fact made at the trial with respect to the insufficiency of the evidence. In view of this situation, while I think the appeal should be allowed, I think the petition should be remitted to the court below for a rehearing and that both parties may be at liberty to adduce further evidence. On such rehearing the actual use of the mark will require to be considered as well as the kind of goods with respect to which it had been used in connection with the question as to whether the use in fact made is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 29.\nRespondent also contends that the appellant has no right of appeal to this court and that in any event as no statement of objections was filed in accordance with the second paragraph of rule 36 of the Exchequer Court rules, respondent should not be heard. It is said he is not properly before the court.\nIt is not and could not, in view of the circumstances, be contended that the appellant was not a party to the proceedings in the court below as the respondent itself made the appellant the party respondent in those proceedings. Section 56 of the Unfair Competition Act is accordingly sufficient warrant for appeal.\nAs to the necessity for filing a statement of objections even if this requirement applies to the Minister, which I am inclined to doubt, rules 37 and 41 both would require, in any event, notice to be given to the Minister of the hearing and it cannot be contended that the Minister could not at the hearing take any ground of objection because of any failure to file objections. Further, rule 300 authorizes relief to be given against such \u00e0 failure and in my view it would be proper in the present case to relieve against any such obligation if it in fact exists.\nI think therefore, that there is no substance in the objections of the respondent. I would allow the appeal and remit the petition to the court below to be dealt with in accordance with the principles indicated above upon any further evidence which may be adduced by either party.\nEstey, J.\u2014The respondent, its head office in Toronto, manufactures and distributes textiles. Early in 1933 it adopted and identified its merchandise by the compound word \"super-weave\" or \"superweave\", and in 1947 commenced these proceedings under s. 29 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932 (S. of C. 1932, c. 38), for a declaration that might lead to the registration of this word as a trade mark. The petition was granted in the Exchequer Court and the appellant appeals from that decision.\nS. 29 provides:\n29. (1) Notwithstanding that a trade mark is not registrable under any other provision of this Act it may be registered if, in any action or proceeding in the Exchequer Court of Canada, the court by its judgment declares that it has been proved to its satisfaction that the mark has been so used by any person as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class of wares in association with which it has been used, as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of person by whom they have been produced or for their place of origin. Respondent submits that \"super-weave\" as normally-used is descriptive of the \"character or quality\" of textiles, and therefore not registrable under s. 26(1) (c), but that because this word \"super-weave\" has been continuously used since 1933 in association with its textiles, it has acquired a secondary meaning in the sense that it has \"become generally recognized by dealers in and\/users\" as to justify the declaration provided for in s. 29.\nThe appellant submits that the word \"super-weave\" as ordinarily used is a laudatory epithet and cannot \"become adapted to distinguish,\" and therefore not a trade mark within the definition in s. 2(m). He cites Leopold Cassella & Co., 18, Bailey & Co. Ld. v. Clark, Son & Morland Ld., 19, and R. J. Lea, Limited 20. These cases, decided under the Trade Marks Act, 1905, in Great Britain (7 Edw. VII, c. 15, as amended in 1919) distinguish between distinctiveness in fact and distinctiveness defined in that Act as \"adapted to distinguish.\" The proof of distinctiveness in fact is relevant but is not conclusive in determining whether a trade mark is \"adapted to distinguish.\" In R. J. Lea, Limited, supra, Hamilton, L. J., (as he then was) stated at p. 463:\n* * * the mere proof or admission that a mark does in fact distinguish does not ipso facto compel the judge to deem that mark to be distinctive. It must be further \"adapted to distinguish,\" which brings within the purview of his discretion the wider field of the interests of strangers and of the public.\nThe issue between the parties hereto involves the construction in our statute of the definition of \"trade mark\" in s. 2(m), \"word mark' 'in s. 2(o), s. 26 under which registration of certain classes of word marks is prohibited, and the meaning and purpose of s. 29 in relation to the definition and registration of trade marks.\n\"Trade mark\" is defined in s. 2(m):\n2. (m) \"Trade Mark\" means a symbol which has become adapted to distinguish particular wares falling within a general category from other wares falling within the same category, and is used by any person in association with wares entering into trade or commerce for the purpose of indicating to dealers in, and\/or users of such wares that they have been manufactured sold, leased or hired by him, or that they are of a defined standard or have been produced under denned working conditions, by a defined class of persons, or in a defined territorial area, and includes any distinguishing guise capable of constituting a trade mark. This definition is divided into two main parts: First, it is required that the symbol \"has become adapted to distinguish\" particular wares from others within the same category, and second, it must be \"used by any person in association with wares entering into trade or commerce for the purpose of indicating to dealers * * *\" The purpose of a dealer in adopting a trade mark is that it distinguishes his wares from those of all other dealers. A trade mark, therefore, in that sense must be distinctive. The word \"distinctive,\" however, does not appear in definition 2(m): On the contrary, the words are \"has become adapted to distinguish.\" The phrase here appears for the first time in our statute law, but the phrase \"adapted to distinguish\" has been in the statute law of Great Britain since the enactment of the Trade Marks Act, 1905. S. 9(5) of this latter statute provides in part \" 'distinctive' shall mean adapted to distinguish,\" and as above explained, this phrase has been given a meaning, as indicated by the quotation from R. J. Lea, Limited, supra, different from that of \"distinctive in fact.\" The essential difference is that a symbol which distinguishes in fact the wares of the particular person is not sufficient to obtain registration under the British statute. It must in addition be established that the word is \"adapted to distinguish\" which involves wider considerations of the rights and interests of the public in the words of our language and more particularly of those commonly and ordinarily used in commendation and praise of wares. The rights of the public in these words have long been protected and dealers prevented from obtaining the exclusive right or monopoly in their use through the registration of them as trade marks both in the law of Canada and Great Britain. Partlo v. Todd 21.\nThese two phrases \"adapted to distinguish\" and \"distinctive in fact\" were both well known in the law respecting trade marks when the legislation here in question was enacted. It is therefore significant that in the definition of trade mark (s. 2(m)) Parliament adopted the phrase \"has become adapted to distinguish\" rather than \"has become distinctive in fact.\" The adoption of the latter would have changed the law, while the fact that they adopted \"has become adapted to distinguish\" would, under the circum- stances, indicate an intention not to change the law. In view of the foregoing it would appear that the words \"adapted to distinguish\" are in the phrase \"has become adapted to distinguish\" the dominant and important words. These words, as Lord Justice Hamilton pointed out, involve considerations of strangers and the public generally and are therefore of wider import than \"distinctiveness in fact.\"\nThat the interest of the public is always important was emphasized in this Court upon a somewhat different point in Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Goodrich Co. Ltd. 22, where Rinfret, J. (now Chief Justice) stated at p. 196:\n* * * and it should not be forgotten that legislation concerning patents, trademarks and the like exists primarily in the interest and for the protection of the public, so much so that it could be said that the public is a third party to all patent or trade-mark litigation.\nSee also Eno v. Dunn, 23, at p. 262.\nAt the hearing of this appeal the two words \"has become\" were emphasized and it was suggested that they involved the conclusion that evidence of use would be sufficient to establish that the word mark was \"adapted to distinguish.\" If Parliament had desired to effect so important a change in our law it would have adopted the phrase \"has become distinctive in fact\" or some such words as would have more clearly expressed such an intention. More particularly is this true as these phrases and their separate and distinct significance were so well known. As already indicated, the dominant words in the phrase are \"adapted to distinguish\" rather than \"has become.\" Moreover, that these words \"has become\" were not intended to convey such a meaning finds support in the position and effect of the proof of use in the definition 2(m) and s. 29.\nIt is pertinent to observe that a \"word mark\" in the language of s. 2(o) means \"a trade mark consisting only of a series of letters and\/or numerals and depending for its distinctiveness upon the idea or sound suggested by the sequence of the letters and\/or numerals and their separation into groups, independently of the form of the letters or numerals severally or as a series.\" Distinctiveness founded upon idea or sound is basic in this definition and indicates that it is in the word mark itself rather than in its use that the quality of distinctiveness must be found. It would therefore appear to be more in accord with the language of both ss. 2(m) and 2(o) that the phrase \"bas become adapted to distinguish\" refers principally to that which is inherent in the symbol itself.\nThe trade mark defined in s. 2(m) is registrable under the Act unless either its adoption or registration as such is therein prohibited. This is made clear by the provisions of s. 39:\n39. If there is no objection to the registration of a trade mark for the registration of which a sufficient and complete application has been made, the Registrar shall, subject as hereinafter provided, forthwith cause such trademark to be entered in the register as of the date upon which such application was received by him.\nThe statute therefore contemplates that the trade mark which comes within the terms of the definition of 2(m) will be registered unless within the terms of s. 39 there is an objection to the registration within the meaning of the statute.\nThese objections are expressed in the Act in the main by prohibitions against either the adoption of or the registration of the trade mark as such. This view is emphasized by the language of these sections in which the prohibition is always directed against a trade mark as illustrated by the opening words of ss. 14 and 26. In this latter section these are, \"Subject as otherwise provided in this Act a word mark (a trade mark under s. 2(o)) shall be registrable if it (a) does not contain more than thirty letters * * * (c) is not * * * clearly descriptive or misdescriptive of the character or quality of the wares ***(f) is not similar to, * * * some other word mark already registered * * *.\" If the registrar refuses registration either because the word mark does not come within the definition of ss. 2(m) and 2(o) or if within that definition then because either its adoption or registration is prohibited by some provision in the statute, the applicant may appeal under s. 51 to the Exchequer Court.\nIt will be observed that all of the foregoing takes place without reference to s. 29, and, moreover, that s. 29 does not provide an appeal from the decision of the registrar. The opening words of this section, \"Notwithstanding that a trade mark is not registrable under any other provision of this Act,\" indicate that it is dealing only with trade marks and that it is in the nature of an overriding section which makes possible registration otherwise prohibited. It is important to observe that s. 29 applies only where the trade mark is not registrable and therefore has no reference to the provisions where the adoption of the trade mark is prohibited as in s. 14.\nIt is, moreover, significant that Parliament in s. 29 does not ask the Court to determine whether the symbol \"has become adapted to distinguish\" as that phrase appears in s. 2(m). On the contrary, and with equal significance, Parliament here adopts in s. 29 language more closely related to the definition of \"similar\" in relation to \"trade marks\" in s. 2(k).\n2. (k) \"Similar,\" in relation to trade marks * * * so resembling each other * * * in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers in and\/or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality * * *\nThe proof required in s. 29 is stated as follows:\n* * * that the mark has been so used by any person as to have become generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class of wares in association with which it has been used, as indicating that such person assumes responsibility for their character or quality * * *\nThe language in s. 2(k) in so far as it relates to trade marks is not directed to any question as to whether the symbol \"has become adapted to distinguish.\" No question of similarity under 2(k) arises until the symbols are trade marks within the definition 2(m). The word \"similar\" as so defined appears in s. 26(1) (f) already quoted and there the only question before the registrar is whether registration should be prohibited because the word marks are similar and therefore the likelihood of confusion and deception.\nIf registration is refused under s. 26(1) (c) (as in this case the respondent concedes \"super-weave\" would be) because the word mark is clearly descriptive, it is still open to the applicant to apply under s. 29 and there to make such proof as to satisfy the Court that the word mark \"has become generally recognized\" as in that section provided. The effect of the declaration is that, although the word mark is within the class which is clearly descriptive in association with these wares and therefore not registrable under s. 26(1) (c) this applicant has so used it in association with his wares as to cause it to lose its significance as a word of description and that it is now \"generally recognized by dealers in and\/or users of the class of wares in association with which it has been used, as indicating that such person assumes reponsibility for their character or quality * * *\" It is in this section that Parliament provides proof of use by the applicant and while the phrase \"distinctiveness in fact\" is not here used, the declaration when made in relation to a word mark may foe regarded as equivalent to the establishment of \"distinctiveness in fact.\" This evidence, it will be observed, by the express language of s. 29, is given in relation to a trade mark as defined in 2(m), the registration of which is otherwise prohibited.\nThe language and plan of our statute is substantially different from the Trade Marks Act of 1905 in Great Britain but in principle its provisions for registration are similar and in effect much the same. It has always been recognized in both the common and statute law of both countries that with respect to trade marks there are words of such common and ordinary use that no person should be permitted to adopt them as trade marks and thereby acquire the exclusive right or monopoly to the use thereof. Even if in a particular instance in relation to specific wares evidence established \"distinctiveness in fact\" there remained that larger consideration of public interest which prevented their classification as words \"adapted to distinguish.\" No amount of use by an individual could defeat the public interest and make possible their adoption as a trade mark. In the present enactment Parliament has not only not indicated a change but has adopted the phrase \"adapted to distinguish\" well known in the law of Great Britain under which this very principle is protected. Its meaning and position in Great Britain would be present to Parliament in the adoption of this phrase, and, indeed, it might with propriety be suggested that the language was for that very reason adopted. In any event, a survey of the relevant sections and of the statute as a whole lead to the conclusion that the phrase \"adapted to distinguish\" has the same meaning in our statute as under the statute of Great Britain. It follows that words commonly used and appropriately described as laudatory epithets cannot become: registrable as trade marks.\nThe compound word \"super-weave\" contains the well- known, commonly used laudatory epithet \"super\" and the equally well-known word \"weave\" commonly used to describe the texture or method of manufacture. It is a well-founded principle recognized in both the authorities and statute law that such words (subject to a descriptive word becoming \"generally recognized\" as in s. 29) should remain the common property of dealers and users and the public generally and no person or corporation should be granted the exclusive right to or a monopoly in the use of such words such as registration of a trade mark bestows upon the applicant.\nWhen these words are joined to form the compound word \"super-weave\" it means, as stated by the learned trial Judge, \"a better quality of weaving,\" and, with respect; I think would be so understood and commonly used by dealers and users, and as such properly classified as a laudatory epithet.\nI agree that the Registrar of Trade Marks was a proper party to this appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed, but without costs, and the applicant's petition dismissed.\nAppeal allowed and Petition dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The King, [1949] S.C.R. 510\nDate: 1949-06-02\nToronto Transportation Commission (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King, On The Information Of The Attorney-General Of Canada (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1949: March 2, 3, 4; 1949: June 2.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown, claim by\u2014Damages\u2014Negligence\u2014Common Law\u2014Exchequer Court Act, B.S.C., 1927, c. 34, s. 50A\u2014Ontario Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 115.\nThis action arose out of a collision on the Kingston Road in the city of Toronto on December 22, 1943 between a street car of the appellant and a truck and trailer on the latter of which was loaded a Bolingbroke aircraft, and which formed part of a convoy of Royal Canadian Air Force vehicles. As a result of the damage sustained by the aircraft the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty exhibited an information against the appellant in the Exchequer Court claiming the damage had been caused by the latter's negligence.\nThe trial judge found that both parties were equally at fault, but held that the Crown was not responsible for the negligence of its servants and gave judgment for the Crown in the full amount of its claim together with costs of the action.\nHeld: That the trial judge's allotment of blame, in equal proportions to the servants of each party, was correct.\nHeld: Also, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, that while if the common law alone were applicable, the Crown would have no claim by reason of the fact that it failed to prove that the negligence of the appellant's servants alone caused the damage, yet since the Crown is able to take advantage of the Ontario' Negligence Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 115, it is therefore entitled to one half of its damages.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O'Connor J.1, awarding damages to the Crown (Dominion) for injury to an aircraft owned by the Crown occasioned by the negligence of the servants of the (defendant) appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nI. S. Fairty, K.C. and A. H. Young, K.C. for the appellant.\nN. L. Matthews, K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin, J\u2014A Bolingbroke aircraft owned by His Majesty in the right of Canada had sustained damage at Picton and it was sent thence to London, via Toronto, all in the Province of Ontario, for repairs. The motors and main planes were removed from the aircraft, which was loaded on a trailer drawn by a truck with the planes set along the side of the aircraft on the trailer. The truck and trailer formed part of a convoy of Royal Canadian Air Force vehicles. On December 22, 1943, at about 6.45 p.m., while the convoy was on the Kingston Road, in the City of Toronto, a collision occurred between the aircraft on the trailer and a street car owned and operated by Toronto Transportation Commission, causing further damage to the aircraft. The Attorney General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty exhibited an information against the Commission in the Exchequer Court, claiming that this further damage had been caused by the negligence of the Commission's operator of the street car and asking that the amount of it be paid by the Commission.\nThe trial judge found 2 that the trailer containing the aircraft and the truck to which it was attached were stationary at the time of the collision and that the street car, having come to a stop on a signal of the Ontario Provincial Police who were leading the convoy, started up again and was in motion at the time of the collision. He held that the street car operator was negligent in failing to remain stationary until the entire convoy had passed. However, he held further that W\/O Vodden of the R.C.A.F., who was in charge of the convoy, was negligent in taking the convoy, at night, through the City of Toronto on a main east and west highway of the Province of Ontario, in view of the width of the load on the trailer and the absence of lights to mark the outer edges of the load. He also held that Sergt. Taggert of the R.C.A.F. was negligent in the performance of his duties in two respects, i.e., in failing to properly supervise the passing of the convoy and in halting the convoy when the truck and trailer in question were in a certain position. He found these two officers or servants of the Crown, on the one hand, and the operator of the street car, on the other, to be equally at fault. He fixed the damages at $14,702.71 but, holding that the Crown was not responsible for the negligence of its officers or servants, gave judgment against the Commission for the full amount, together with the costs of the action.\nFrom that judgment the Commission appeals to this Court. It submits that the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of the Crown's servants. It alleges that the amount fixed as damages is unwarranted; and, finally, that in any event it should be held liable for only one-half of the proper amount of damages on the footing that the Ontario Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 115, applies to the Crown. The respondent, seeking to uphold the judgment in its favour, submits that the accident was caused entirely by the negligence of the street car operator but contends that even if Vodden and Taggert, or either of them, are held to be negligent in any degree, such negligence cannot operate to defeat the claim of the Crown for the full amount of the damages fixed in the Exchequer Court.\nAs has been stated, the convoy was in charge of W\/O Vodden. When it started from Picton it consisted of an Ontario Provincial Police car, a truck and trailer containing another aircraft, the truck and trailer that subsequently figured in the accident, and a station wagon. At Oshawa a conference was held and it was decided to proceed, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour on a winter day, but another Ontario Provincial Police car joined the procession, which proceeded on its way to Toronto. When it entered the limits of that city, it consisted of (1) a police car driven by Constable Robertson, (2) a second police car driven by Constable Hefferon who was accompanied by Sergt. Taggert, (3) a truck with trailer containing an aircraft, (4) the truck and trailer in question, driven by LAC\/Jones who was accompanied by LAC\/Novak, (5) a station wagon driven by LAC\/Shipp, who was accompanied by W.\/O Vodden. Each truck and trailer had the proper vehicle lights, which were lighted; each trailer was very long and had a load nineteen feet in width; each trailer was equipped with proper clearance lights but had no lights to mark the outer edges of the aircraft; each aircraft carried a large checkerboard on the engine mounts and a red flag at the outer edges of the centre section. These boards and flags would give warning of the size of the load in the daytime but were useless at the time of the accident.\nThe convoy proceeded westerly along the Kingston Road in Toronto where there are two sets of street car tracks. An automobile was parked near the northwest corner of the Kingston Road and Main Street and in order to pass it, it was found necessary for the two trucks and trailers to veer towards the south. The evidence as to what subsequently happened is extremely contradictory. It is admitted that a street car proceeding easterly on the southerly set of tracks stopped,\u2014whether as a result of the police orders or because the operator saw the convoy is immaterial although there appears to be no reason for doubting the evidence of the Police and Crown witnesses. The first and second cars went beyond the street car, and the truck and trailer next in line passed the street car safely. The operator, Smith, says he did not move his street car, and in that he is confirmed by another Commission employee who happened to be returning home on the street car and by an independent witness on the sidewalk on the south side of the Kingston Road. This is denied by several witnesses for the Crown who say the street car started up and ran into the aircraft on the trailer attached to No. 4 vehicle. On this conflicting evidence, the trial judge found that the operator did start the street car, and with this finding I agree. Not only should not such a finding be not disturbed but it appears to be consistent with the evidence that, after the accident, quantities of sand were found on the tracks, which apparently could not have been there except as a result of the street car having been started, particularly when Smith testified that he did not use any sand at any time. I also agree that no assistance may foe found in the evidence of experts called by each side, one of whom expressed an opinion that the street car was in motion and the other that the truck and trailer were moving at the time of the impact. The operator Smith was, therefore, guilty of negligence in starting the street car before the entire convoy had passed, and this was the cause of the occurrence.\nHowever, bearing in mind that it was about 6.45 p.m. on December 22 that the convoy was proceeding on a main highway in the City of Toronto, W\/O Vodden was negligent in not having clearance lights on the outside limits of the load; the clearance lights on the trailer would be a snare and a delusion, and the red flag was useless. Sergt. Taggert was negligent, as found by the trial judge, because, instead of getting out of the police car and going back to the trucks and trailers, where he would have been able to direct the No. 4 vehicle to proceed, he remained in the police car and attempted to supervise the passing of the two trucks and trailers from that position. I agree that the damage was also caused by the combined negligence of these two and Smith and that the negligence of none may be said to be subsequent to that of another, and that the trial judge's allotment of blame, in equal proportions to the servants of each pary, was correct.\nI now turn to the question of damages. The evidence warrants the finding that the cost of repairing the centre section of the aircraft would exceed the price of a new one installed. New parts were obtained at a cost of $12,734.46 and to this the trial judge added the estimate made by the witnesses Lewis and Patterson of the cost to the plaintiff of making the necessary repairs and installing the centre section, $2,310.00. These sums total $15,044.46, which the trial judge considered to be the amount of the damages suffered by the Crown as a result of the accident. The appellant suggests that the trial judge misunderstood its arguments when he said:\u2014\"Counsel for the Respondent (the Commission) contended that as a new centre section had been placed in the aircraft, the value of the aircraft would be increased and that the Defendant should not be compelled to pay the full value of a new centre section.\" In its factum it contends that certain evidence relied upon by it and contained in two reports indicates that the aircraft had received extensive damage at Picton and was in need of substantial repair and overhauling before the street car collision, and that an allowance should have been made for this. I have examined the record in the light of this submission and while it is true that damage to the airplane had occurred at Picton, it was not to those parts damaged by the street oar. The trial judge made a just estimate of this damage and no error can be found in his allowance of $14,702.71, being the amount claimed by the respondent less an allowance subsequently made by it for the salvage of the nacelle, and which is slightly less than the amount that would otherwise have been fixed.\nI am unable to agree, however, that on these findings the Crown is entitled to recover the full amount of $14,702.71. The Crown is plaintiff in an action based upon the negligence of the defendant's servant. The defendant does not make a claim against the Crown but in resisting the action sets up the negligence of the Crown's servants which equally caused the damage. There is no question that if, when the doctrine of contributory negligence was in full flower, one subject sued another for damage in these circumstances the plaintiff could not recover because he failed to prove that the defendant caused the damage. The Crown coming into Court could claim only on the basis of the law applicable as between subject and subject unless something different in the general law relating to the matter is made applicable to the Crown. The cases that decide that at common law the Crown is not responsible for the negligence of its servants are not in point as there claims were advanced against the Crown. Nor are such cases as Black v. The Queen 3, where a claim on a surety bond otherwise recoverable by the Crown was held not to be defeated by laches of its officers. Here, if the common law alone were applicable, the Crown would have no claim by reason of the fact that it failed to prove that the negligence of the Commission's servants caused the damage. In Admiralty, the Commissioners for Executing the Office of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, as plaintiffs, have been held to be entitled only to one-half of their damages when their officers, as well as the defendant, were held to be at fault. The Chinkiang 4, The Hero 5.\nThe Crown is able to take advantage of the Ontario Negligence Act and is therefore entitled to one-half of the damages. The appeal should be allowed with costs. In lieu of the judgment a quo there should be substituted a judgment for the Crown for $7,351.35 with costs of the action.\nKellock J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 6 in favour of the respondent with respect to damage to an aircraft being carried on a transport trailer while in collision with a street car of the appellant. The learned trial judge, while holding that there had been negligence in equal degree on the part of the servants of both the parties which contributed to the accident, came to the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to recover in full on the ground that the Crown was not affected by the negligence of its servants.\nThe transport trailer in question was the fourth vehicle of a convoy of five vehicles which was proceeding west on the Kingston road in the City of Toronto on December 22, 1943, the convoy being led by two Ontario provincial police cars, the third vehicle being another transport trailer, also loaded with a Bolingbroke aircraft similar to that on the transport in question and the rear being brought up by an Air Force station wagon carrying a driver and the Air Force officer in charge of the convoy. This convoy had passed the intersection of Main Street and the Kingston Road and by reason of the fact that each aircraft overhung its transport trailer by some five or six feet on each side and also by reason of the fact that there was an automobile parked on the north side of the Kingston Road west of Main Street, the convoy had swung out well into, or south of the centre of the street, for the purpose of passing the parked automobile. The appellant's street car being observed approaching by both provincial policemen, the police cars proceeded west on the southerly set of tracks signalling by flashing their headlights for the street car to stop. It is common ground that the street car did in fact stop. Where it stopped, and why it stopped, were, how-over, in controversy at the trial.\nThe contention of the appellant was that while thus at a standstill the street car had been run into by the aircraft, but the learned trial judge found against this. He found that the transport trailer here in question, while standing, had been run into by the street car, accepting the evidence of the respondent, that after the convoy had passed the parked car, but before the two transport trailers with their overhanging loads had returned to the north side of the street, they had been stopped when the approaching street car was sighted. After the street car had been stopped a signal was given by the Air Force sergeant riding in the second police car for the number three vehicle to proceed and it thereupon passed the street car in safety. According to the finding of the learned trial judge, the street car then started up and ran down the number four vehicle. The evidence on behalf of those in charge of that vehicle, and the Air Force officer in the station wagon, who was in charge of the convoy, was that the lights on both the two last mentioned vehicles were turned off and on and the horns were sounded to call the attention of the street car operator to the presence of the overhanging load of the aircraft in the path of the street car, but without effect. The learned trial judge further found as a fact that the operator had started forward when he knew that the entire convoy had not passed and that he saw the clearance lights on the number four vehicle and the headlights on both that vehicle and the station wagon being turned on and off.\nAppellant attacks the finding of negligence on the part of the operator of the street car but, in my opinion, it is not entitled to succeed in this respect. The evidence of the motorman at the trial was to the effect that he had not stopped as the result of any signal from the police but because he had seen the overhanging load of the number three vehicle and he did not think there was sufficient clearance for the street car. He said that after the number three transport went past he was in the act of releasing his brakes preparatory to starting up again when he noticed number four transport and thereupon, and before his car had made any movement, he put on the emergency brake to hold it in its then position as it was on a slight grade.\nThis evidence, as already mentioned, was not accepted by the learned trial judge and, in my opinion, with respect, on adequate grounds. The learned trial judge, however, points out that the clearance lights on the left hand side of the number four vehicle would tend to deceive the motor-man into thinking that they indicated the most southerly point in the highway occupied by that vehicle and that the operator of the street car would be facing its headlights and to some extent the lights of the station wagon, which would make it impossible for him to see the overhanging portion of the load and he was of opinion that this situation was calculated to mislead the street car operator. He was also of opinion that the checker-board, mounted upon the load itself, and the red flag at the extreme southerly point of projection of the load, were both useless on a dark night. No reliance is, however, placed by counsel for the appellant upon any deception in this respect on the part of the motor-man. I think no other position could be taken consistently with the evidence of the motorman who does not make any such suggestion.' His evidence is that he saw the. vehicles in question and remained stationary.\nIn a report made by him to the appellant on the day in question, and subsequent to the accident, he said that as he was proceeding east he noticed a transport truck coming west with some object extending over on to the east bound track; that he immediately applied his emergency brake and stopped the car; that it proved to be an aeroplane loaded on a flat trailer attached to a transport truck and that at the time that danger became apparent to him the other vehicle was some thirty feet distant. At the trial he said that as number three vehicle passed him he had turned his head to the left and the Air Force officer in charge of the convoy in the station wagon said that he saw this and that the operator continued to look to his left following with his eyes the other aircraft right up to the time of the collision.\nIn view of the findings of the learned trial judge, it would appear that if the motorman, as he says, saw the number four vehicle with its overhanging load, he was negligent in proceeding. If he did not see it he was negligent in failing to do so and the explanation of his having failed to see it may well lie in the fact that his attention was attracted by the number three vehicle and that he started forward without seeing that his path was clear as the Air Force witness deposes.\nWith respect to the respondent, the learned trial judge found that it was negligent to have taken such a convoy into the city after dark with the clearance lights on the left hand side by the transport trailer, as already described, but with no warning light on the southerly end of the overhanging load, with the result that east bound traffic might well be misled into thinking that the clearance lights marked the southerly limit of the number three vehicle and its load. He held further that the Air Force sergeant riding in the second police car was negligent in halting the convoy without making sure that no part of the load on either transport trailer was south of the centre line of the street and in failing properly to supervise the passing of the street car by both transport trailers. This he should have done in the learned judge's view, by getting out of the automobile and placing himself in a position in the street where he could have controlled the situation. Instead of doing that he had ridden on the running board of the second police car and had signalled the number three transport to follow, intending, as he said after having seen it safely pass the street car, to have gone back on foot and brought number four vehicle through.\nThe respondent contends that the finding as to negligence on the part of its servants was not negligence contributing to the accident and that in any event, the respondent is not affected by any negligence on the part of the Air Force personnel.\nWith respect to the position of the clearance lights on the number four vehicle and the absence of any light on the southerly end of the overhanging load, I think the proper conclusion is that this is not a factor which contributed to the accident in view of the evidence of the appellant's motor-man quite apart from the position taken by counsel for the appellant.\nIt should have been evident however that the undertaking of conducting such a convoy through busy streets in a city such as Toronto, was one which called for the exercise of the utmost care on the part of those in charge, particularly when the undertaking was to be carried out at night. It is apparent that in the course of its progress from Picton this convoy had, even in daylight, been guided through \"tight spots\" by an officer on foot and in close contact with each transport trailer as it manoeuvred through. In fact the driver of the number four vehicle said that it was usual and necessary to have someone ahead in a position to guide him through difficult places. Sergeant Taggert himself intended, after having guided number three vehicle through, to go back on foot for the purpose of guiding number four. The question is whether it was negligence on the part of those in charge of the convoy to assume that there would be no movement on the part of east bound traffic until the whole convoy had gone through, or whether precaution should have been taken to see that such movement did not take place on the part of some inadvertent person, such as the street car operator, who evidently was unaware that there was more than one aircraft in the convoy. In my opinion it is not placing the duty too high to say that such a precaution should have been taken and that its failure was negligence contributing to the accident and that was the view of the learned trial judge. I therefore think the finding of negligence on the part of those in charge of the convoy in this respect must be affirmed.\nWith respect to the contention that the Crown in such a case as this may recover the full amount of its damage if a defendant is at all negligent, no authority has been cited in support. The cases referred to by counsel for the Crown were all cases where the Crown was a defendant. It seems to me that when the Crown brings an action at common law, it accepts the common law applicable to such a claim. This is illustrated by analogy in my view in The Chinkiang 7, where, in cross actions between the Admiralty as owners of a naval vessel, and the owners of a merchant ship, both ships were held to blame and Admiralty recovered a moiety of its damage. The result thus arrived at seems to me to have been rested upon the basis of the law as administered in Admiralty in collision cases, and the Crown, in bringing a claim in the Admiralty Court was subject to the law so administered. The rule in Admiralty is stated by Dr. Lushington in The Milan 8, as follows:\n* * * that by the law of the Admiralty, as it is called if the owner of one ship bring an action against the owner of another ship for damage by collision, and both ships be found to blame, the party proceeding recovers only a moiety of his damage; if there is a cross-action, the damages are divided, each party recovering half his own loss.\nIn China Merchants' Steam Navigation Co. v. Bignold 9, a case involving cross-suits in connection with a collision between a merchant ship and a King's ship in which both were held to blame, Sir R. P. Collier in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said, at 517:\nThat being so, the ordinary rule of the Admiralty Court applies; and therefore * * * the damages should be divided between the parties according to the Admiralty rule, which is that each party shall obtain from the other half of the damage which he has suffered. As stated in Chitty on Prerogatives of the Crown, page 245, the King \"may maintain the usual common law actions * * * And though the King chuse a common law action, he may, by virtue of the prerogative we have just noticed, commence it in any court\". In a common law action based on the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff may not recover if the injury has been contributed to by the negligence of his own servant; William v. Holland 10. Where, therefore, the Crown brings such an action I think that by analogy to the rule applied in the case of a proceeding in Admiralty, the action is subject to the common law rule, and it is clear, by reason of section 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, that the members of the Air Force here in question are to be considered as servants of the Crown for the purpose of this proceeding. While the section does not create any direct or specific right in the Crown, it places the Crown in recognized common law relationship and its rights are those arising from that relation under the rules of that law; Attorney-General v. Jackso'n 11, per Rand J. at 493.\nOn this basis the result in the case at bar, in view of the finding of negligence on the part of servants of the respondent would be that the Crown's claim would be dismissed. It is well settled, however, that the Crown may take the benefit of a statute and, applying the provisions of the Ontario Negligence Act, the Crown should recover one moiety of its claim. As to the quantum, I think the trial judge has correctly dealt with the Crown's claim.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed to the extent indicated. I think the appellant should have its costs in this court and the respondent should have its costs in the court below.\nAppeal allowed and amount of recovery reduced to $7,351.35 with costs in favour of appellant in this Court and costs in favour of respondent in the Court below.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Irving S.

C'est ce qu'ont reconnu \u00e0 la fois la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi, 2 en le d\u00e9clarant propri\u00e9taire, \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e, en ordonnant \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de lui en livrer possession ainsi que de tous les fruits civils en provenant depuis le 20 octobre 1947, date de l'institution de l'action p\u00e9titoire intent\u00e9e par l'appelant.\nCependant, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi en Appel ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait un droit de r\u00e9tention sur l'immeuble et qu'elle ne serait tenue d'en remettre la possession \u00e0 l'appelant que lorsque ce dernier lui aurait rembours\u00e9 la somme de $4,440.38, valeur des pr\u00e9tendues am\u00e9liorations faites par l'intim\u00e9e sur l'immeuble, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme depuis la date du jugement. Les honorables Juges St-Jacques et Surveyer (ad hoc) \u00e9taient dissidents.\nLes deux Cours ont appuy\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9claration des jugements sur l'article 417 du code civil.\nComme mon coll\u00e8gue, l'honorable Juge Taschereau, je suis d'avis que cet article-l\u00e0 ne s'applique pas au cas qui nous occupe.\nL'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble sur lequel Moreau a construit pour elle, en vertu de l'entente du 16 juin 1945. Elle ne faisait pas des am\u00e9liorations sur un immeuble dont elle \u00e9tait seulement possesseur, dans le sens de l'article 417; elle construisait sur son propre terrain. Ce n'est pas \u00e0 cause d'un vice de titre (qu'elle aurait ignor\u00e9) qu'elle est maintenant d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par un acqu\u00e9reur subs\u00e9quent (l'appelant) qui a fait enregistrer son titre d'acquisition et qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie du pr\u00e9cepte de l'article 2098. Si cette vente subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 l'appelant n'avait pas eu lieu, l'intim\u00e9e demeurait propri\u00e9taire incontestable \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Moreau qui, au bureau d'enregistrement, apparaissait comme le propri\u00e9taire. Ce dernier n'aurait jamais pu valablement revendiquer l'immeuble de l'intim\u00e9e. Elle n'a qu'\u00e0 s'en prendre \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame d'avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois de se faire consentir le contrat d\u00e9finitif qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu dans l'entente qu'elle avait faite avec Moreau, puis de le faire enregistrer. L'appelant, que les deux Cours ont refus\u00e9 de qualifier de fraude ou de mauvaise foi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus diligent et, par le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, a recueilli le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de sa diligence \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e.\nL'intim\u00e9e est sans doute la victime de la fraude de Moreau, mais elle se trouve dans la pr\u00e9sente situation \u00e9galement \u00e0 raison de sa n\u00e9gligence \u00e0 parfaire son titre et \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger en le faisant enregistrer.\nNous avons au dossier la liste des impenses qu'elle a r\u00e9clam\u00e9es de l'appelant et pour lesquelles le jugement dont est appel lui a reconnu le droit de r\u00e9tention. Pour la plupart, elles sont ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'acquisition de l'appelant le 22 ao\u00fbt 1946, ce qui voudrait dire qu'elles auraient toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 faites ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la vente de Moreau \u00e0 l'appelant. Par suite, l'appelant en acqu\u00e9rant l'immeuble acqu\u00e9rait \u00e9galement toutes ces impenses, ou am\u00e9liorations. Les seuls item post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la vente par Moreau \u00e0 l'appelant pourraient \u00eatre celui du 6 d\u00e9cembre \"pour vitre et faire poser les feutres en dehors et feutre autour des portes, $64.66\" et celui du 20 d\u00e9cembre, \"pour chez Nobec, d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me de chauffage, $2.50\" soit en tout $67.16.\nM\u00eame parmi les impenses r\u00e9clam\u00e9es et qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 des dates ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l'acquisition de l'appelant, il s'en trouve plusieurs qui ne peuvent pas l\u00e9galement constituer des impenses; telles que l'achat du terrain, l'assurance sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le charbon et les lustres qui, suivant le cas, peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des meubles que l'intim\u00e9e aurait le droit d'enlever de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nDans les circonstances, comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel, ordonne dans son jugement que l'une ou l'autre des parties puisse demander une reddition de comptes relative aux fruits et revenus de l'immeuble depuis le 20 octobre 1947, \u00e0 la date de la remise de possession par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, nous devons comprendre que cette reddition de comptes entre les parties pourrait \u00e9tablir leurs droits respectifs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Mais, sur cette question de r\u00e9tention, je partage les vues des deux juges dissidents en appel et de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau. Je suis d'avis que le cas qui nous est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ne tombe pas sous le coup de l'article 417 du code civil, ni d'ailleurs sous le coup de l'article 412, car, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, le titre de l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas entach\u00e9 de vice; il \u00e9tait tout au plus incomplet; et ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 pour l'intim\u00e9e la perte de son immeuble, c'est le fait que l'appelant a fait enregistrer son titre avant que l'intim\u00e9e ne l'eut fait elle-m\u00eame et que, dans ce cas, l'appelant a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'article 2098 du code civil.\nSauf donc pour l'intim\u00e9e de faire valoir les r\u00e9clamations qu'elle peut avoir, au cours de la reddition de comptes qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e entre les parties, l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu sur le seul point qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 par l'appelant devant la Cour du Banc du Roi en Appel, et qu'il a subs\u00e9quemment fait valoir devant nous. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention de l'immeuble, et cette partie du jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e en sa faveur par le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance et par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d'Appel, doit en \u00eatre retranch\u00e9e. Pour le reste, le jugement qui a ordonn\u00e9 la remise de possession \u00e0 l'appelant par l'intim\u00e9e, sauf aux parties \u00e0 proc\u00e9der \u00e0 se rendre des comptes mutuels, ainsi qu'il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au jugement, doit suivre son cours et recevoir son plein effet.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9e devra payer les frais de l'appelant dans toutes les Cours.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.\u2014Dans son action, le demandeur all\u00e8gue que par acte authentique pass\u00e9 devant notaire, le 22 ao\u00fbt 1946, il a acquis de Louis Antoine Moreau, entrepreneur de la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite comme suit:\nCette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 connue et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant les Lots num\u00e9ros soixante-et-un et soixante-et-deux des subdivisions du lot originaire num\u00e9ro trente-quatre (61 et 62 de 34) du cadastre officiel pour la paroisse de Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, Banlieue, avec les b\u00e2tisses dessus construites, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances.\nTel que le tout est actuellement et dont l'acqu\u00e9reur se d\u00e9clare content et satisfait.\nMoreau aurait acquis cet immeuble de la succession Eug\u00e8ne Lamontagne, aux termes d'un acte de vente pass\u00e9 le 7 septembre 1945, et enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec sous le num\u00e9ro 298, 262. Dans le cours de novembre 1946, le demandeur a averti la d\u00e9fenderesse qu'il s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur de l'immeuble ci-dessus d\u00e9crit, et que les locataires occupant les appartements devaient dans l'avenir, lui payer les loyers. Les conclusions de son action sont \u00e0 l'effet qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble en question, qu'il a droit \u00e0 la possession, aux revenus et aux fruits civils provenant dudit immeuble depuis le 1st septembre 1946, et que la d\u00e9fenderesse, en possession de l'immeuble soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'abandonner dans les quinze jours du jugement \u00e0 intervenir.\nL'honorable Juge Boulanger de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action en partie, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le demandeur, propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble, et lui en a accord\u00e9 la possession ainsi que tous les fruits civils en provenant, depuis le 20 octobre 1947. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait cependant droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention de l'immeuble, et qu'elle ne serait tenue d'en remettre la possession au demandeur, que sur paiement par ce dernier de la somme de $4,440.38, valeur des am\u00e9liorations faites par la d\u00e9fenderesse, le tout avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de la date du jugement. La Cour d'Appel 3 a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, les honorables Juges St-Jacques et Surveyer dissidents.\nC'est de ce jugement qu'il y a appel.\nAfin de bien comprendre les faits n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du pr\u00e9sent appel, il est important de remonter \u00e0 la date du 16 juin 1945. A cette date, L. A. Moreau, un des mis-en-cause, a entrepris de construire pour l'intim\u00e9e, dans la paroisse du St-Sacrement, dans la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, sur les subdivisions 61 et 62 du lot originaire num\u00e9ro 34 du cadastre officiel de la paroisse de Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, et dont ledit Moreau \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, l'ayant acquis de la succession Lamontagne. Le co\u00fbt total de la maison et du terrain a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $12,500.00. Le contrat intervenu entre les parties se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nQu\u00e9bec, 16 juin 1945.\nLa pr\u00e9sente est une entente entre L.-A. Moreau, entrepreneur de 69, 1\u00e8re rue, Qu\u00e9bec, et Mlle Regina Dionne de 50 rue d'Aiguillon, Qu\u00e9bec.\nL.-A. Moreau s'engage de construire une maison de 32 x 44 lambriss\u00e9e en brique, quatre logements, de quatre chambres plus chambre de bain, plancher bois dur\u2014carr\u00e9 de 3\"\u2014enduit au pl\u00e2tre, syst\u00e8me de chauffage eau chaude, buckwheat, la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique sera incluse mais les lustres seront \u00e0 la charge du propri\u00e9taire mais pos\u00e9s par l'entrepreneur, L.-A. Moreau. Le terrain sera de 50' x 80' sur la rue voisine de l'H\u00f4pital St-Sacrement, en bas du chemin Ste-Foy. Le prix pour le tout est de ($12,500.00) douze mille cinq cent dollars.\nMlle Dionne paiera S3,000, dont 11,000 pour l'achat du terrain, $500 sur la signature du contrat. Ces logements devront se louer $50 par mois chacun. En aucun cas Mlle Dionne peut r\u00e9clamer son argent et L.-A. Moreau se donne 3 mois pour ex\u00e9cuter son d\u00e9sir. D\u00e8s la signature du contrat L.-A. Moreau s'engage de commencer la construction de Mlle Dionne imm\u00e9diatement. Un devis complet sera pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et soumis \u00e0 Mlle Dionne pour'son approbation. L.-A. Moreau s'engage de n\u00e9gocier un emprunt pour satisfaire les besoins de Mlle R. Dionne.\nOnt sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, ce 16i\u00e8me jour de juin 1945.\nEntrepreneur: L.-A. Moreau,\nPropri\u00e9taire: Regina Dionne,\nN\u00ba 50 d'Aiguillon, Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe mis-en-cause Moreau a rempli ses obligations en vertu de ce contrat, a construit la maison et a remis les clefs \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e dans le cours du mois de f\u00e9vrier 1946, alors qu'elle avait pay\u00e9 la somme de $4,440.38. Il est arriv\u00e9 cependant que l'intim\u00e9 n'a jamais fait enregistrer son titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et le 23 ao\u00fbt 1946, Moreau qui avait re\u00e7u de l'intim\u00e9e la somme ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e, et qui lui avait remis la possession de l'immeuble, l'a vendue \u00e0 l'appelant pour la somme de $15,000.00. L'acte de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 au bureau d'enregistrement de la division de Qu\u00e9bec, sous le num\u00e9ro 307,484, et audit acte il est stipul\u00e9 que l'appelant acqu\u00e9reur pourra \"jouir, faire et disposer de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\" \u00e0 partir de la date de l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat de vente, et qu'il pourra percevoir les loyers depuis le 1st septembre 1946.\nPersonne n'appelle de cette partie du jugement, d\u00e9clarant le demandeur-appelant propri\u00e9taire, ni de la r\u00e9serve faite \u00e0 l'une et l'autre des parties du droit de demander une reddition de comptes relative \u00e0 la perception des fruits et revenus. Mais l'appelant se plaint de ce que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait droit de retenir l'immeuble, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit rembours\u00e9e de la somme de $4,440.38. Ce droit de r\u00e9tention lui serait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'application de l'article 417 du Code Civil qui traite des am\u00e9liorations faites \u00e0 un immeuble par un possesseur, et qui se lit ainsi:\n417. Lorsque les am\u00e9liorations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par un possesseur avec ses mat\u00e9riaux, le droit qu'y peut pr\u00e9tendre le propri\u00e9taire du fonds d\u00e9pend de leur nature et de la bonne ou mauvaise foi de celui qui les a faites. Si elles \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds ne peut les faire enlever; il doit dans tous les cas en payer le co\u00fbt, lors m\u00eame qu'elles n'existent plus, sauf la compensation des fruits per\u00e7us, si le possesseur \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi.\nSi elles n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires et qu'elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le possesseur de bonne foi, le propri\u00e9taire est encore tenu de les retenir si elles existent et de payer soit la somme d\u00e9bours\u00e9e, soit celle au montant de laquelle la valeur du fonds a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e.\nSi, au contraire, le possesseur \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi, le propri\u00e9taire peut, \u00e0 son choix, les retenir en payant ce qu'elles ont co\u00fbt\u00e9 ou leur valeur actuelle ou bien lui permettre de les enlever \u00e0 ses frais, si elles peuvent l'\u00eatre avec avantage pour ce tiers et sans d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer le sol; aux cas contraires, les am\u00e9liorations restent au propri\u00e9taire du fonds sans indemnit\u00e9; le propri\u00e9taire peut, dans tous les cas, forcer le possesseur de mauvaise foi \u00e0 les enlever.\nL'intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend qu'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession de l'immeuble en question, elle a sur celui-ci un droit de r\u00e9tention pour les am\u00e9liorations qu'elle y a faites, aussi longtemps qu'elle ne sera pas rembours\u00e9e de la somme de $4,440.38.\nJe crois que cette pr\u00e9tention n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nLes relations juridiques qui ont exist\u00e9 entre Moreau et l'intim\u00e9e ne sont pas celles d'un propri\u00e9taire et d'un possesseur, condition essentielle pour que s'applique l'article 417 du Code Civil. Il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour qu'il entre en jeu, que le possesseur ait fait des am\u00e9liorations sur le terrain d'autrui. Or, il me semble clair que ce n'est pas ce qui est arriv\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e a acquis le terrain de Moreau, et celui-ci s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 construire pour l'intim\u00e9e une maison que d'ailleurs il a construite. Le 19 juin 1945, soit trois jours apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat, l'intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 la somme de $1,500.00 en acompte, et le 10 ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, elle a vers\u00e9 un autre montant semblable, en paiement de ce qu'elle devait, et pour le prix du terrain, et en acompte pour le co\u00fbt de la construction. Elle a aussi fait d'autres versements et d'autres paiements qui ont tous servi \u00e0 l'\u00e9rection de la maison, \u00e0 son chauffage, au peinturage, etc. Elle \u00e9tait indiscutablement propri\u00e9taire de cette maison qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite pour elle, ainsi que du terrain. Il est vrai qu'elle avait la possession de l'immeuble, mais c'est la possession ordinaire que tout propri\u00e9taire a de son bien. Elle a construit et am\u00e9lior\u00e9 sa propre maison, et je ne vois pas comment pourrait s'appliquer l'article 417 du Code Civil. Elle n'a rien am\u00e9lior\u00e9 sur le sol d'autrui; elle a construit et am\u00e9lior\u00e9 sur un sol qui \u00e9tait le sien. Je m'accorde avec M. le Juge St-Jacques qui dit:\nLes mots \"possesseurs\" et \"propri\u00e9taire\" sont mis en opposition d\u00e8s le premier paragraphe de cet article qui, \u00e0 mon avis, se rapporte au cas o\u00f9 un possesseur a fait, avec ses mat\u00e9riaux, des am\u00e9liorations sur un terrain qui ne lui appartient pas, et il faut, pour que cet article s'applique, que les am\u00e9liorations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur le terrain d'autrui.\nMoreau a vendu cet immeuble le 23 ao\u00fbt 1946, pour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration, \u00e0 l'appelant Plamondon, alors qu'il apparaissait comme propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9, et Plamondon a fait enregistrer son acte d'acquisition. L'article 2098 du Code Civil dit:\n2098. Tout acte entre vifs, transf\u00e9rant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un immeuble, doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 par transcription ou par inscription.\nA d\u00e9faut de tel enregitsrement, le titre d'acquisition ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 au tiers qui a acquis le m\u00eame immeuble du m\u00eame vendeur, pour valeur, et dont le titre est enregistr\u00e9.\nIl s'ensuit n\u00e9cessairement que le titre de Plamondon est valide, et qu'il peut l'opposer \u00e0 celui de l'intim\u00e9e, et il a en cons\u00e9quence le droit de r\u00e9clamer l'immeuble et d'en demander la possession, tel que d'ailleurs l'ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens, et le jugement a quo doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 en en retranchant du dispositif, ce qui suit:\nd\u00e9clare que la d\u00e9fenderesse a un droit de r\u00e9tention sur l'immeuble ci-dessus et qu'elle ne sera tenue d'en remettre la possession au demandeur que lorsque ce dernier lui aura rembours\u00e9 la somme de $4,440.38, valeur des am\u00e9liorations faites par elle sur le susdit immeuble, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats de la date du jugement; les frais divis\u00e9s.\nL'intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e9galement les frais et en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour d'Appel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St-Laurent, Taschereau, St-Laurent & No\u00ebl.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Fernand Choquette.\n1 Q.R.

The Elise was owned by Estonian nationals and registered in that country but, at the date of the decree and always thereafter, was beyond the jurisdiction of Estonia and at the date of suit within that of Canada.\nHeld: that as the decree was a penal, (Rand J., political), law of a foreign country of a confiscatory nature, it would not be enforced in the Exchequer Court at the suit of a corporation established by Estonia and to which a subsequent decree purported to transfer ownership.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, New Brunswick Admiralty District, 1, in favour of the plaintiffs in an action in rem respecting the proceeds of the sale of a foreign merchant ship.\nThe facts and the questions of law raised are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. Paul Barry, (and P. A. Beck of the New York Bar), for the appellants\nC. F. Inches, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice: \u2014This action is to determine the ownership of the sum of $44,177, with bank interest, which amount is held in the Admiralty Court, New Brunswick Admiralty District, and represents the proceeds of the sale of the S.S. Elise, after payments of all claims against the vessel.\nThe Elise was a steamship owned by the co-partnership of Laane and Baltser, the appellants. She was of Estonian Registry, and was registered at Parnu, in Estonia, where the office of the appellants was also maintained. The appellants were Estonian citizens.\nThe Elise was engaged in running between the United Kingdom and Canada in the summer of 1940, and in the month of August, 1940, she arrived at the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick, having been damaged by grounding. She was arrested at the instance of certain members of the crew for wages, and sold by Order of the District Judge in Admiralty of the Province of New Brunswick. The sale was held by public auction on January 25, 1941, and the amount realized by the sale was $88,000. After payment of the crew's wages and all other claims against the ship, including one for breach of charterparty, there remained the sum which is the basis of the dispute in the present action.\nIn the month of June, 1940, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (hereinafter referred to as the U.S.S.R.) occupied the Baltic States, including Estonia, and set up a government in Estonia which passed certain laws purporting to nationalize certain properties. Two different sets of Decrees or Declarations were apparently passed.\nOne of the Decrees purported to establish the company (respondent in this appeal), and another Decree purported to transfer ownership of all Estonian vessels to the latter. In September, 1942, the respondent issued a summons in rem, claiming the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the Elise, and the appellants appeared in the proceedings and claimed the proceeds for themselves. The basis of the respective claims appears in the admissions which were agreed to by counsel for the appellants and the respondent.\nFrom these admissions it appears that prior to the 17th of June, 1940, there existed the Republic of Estonia, the existence of which and the Government of which was not recognized by the Government of Canada de facto as it was constituted prior to June, 1940. This is so stated in a letter, signed by the Secretary of State for External Affairs for Canada, required by counsel for both parties for production in the Court in this case. According to this letter, the Republic of Estonia has ceased de facto to have any effective existence. In the same letter the Secretary of State for External Affairs stated that the Government of Canada recognizes that Estonia has de facto entered the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, but does not recognize this de jure. It adds that it is not possible for the Government of Canada to attach a date to this recognition. It further states that the Government of Canada recognizes the Government of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic to be the de facto government of Estonia but does not recognize it as the de jure government of Estonia; and again it is stated that it is not possible for the Government of Canada to attach a date to this recognition. The letter of the Secretary of State for External Affairs further states that the question of the effect of a Soviet decree is for the Court to decide and not for the Government.\nPrior to the 17th of June, 1940, the Elise was owned by the appellants, who did business in co-partnership at Parnu, in Estonia, under the firm name of \"Laane and Baltser\". The steamship was duly registered and was of the approximate gross tonnage of nine hundred and ninety tons. She had left Estonia prior to July, 1939, and had arrived in the Port of Saint John, New Brunswick, on or about the 15th of August, 1940, without having returned to Estonia in the meantime. She had been sailing between the United Kingdom and the Dominion of Canada only during 1940. It was while the Elise was in the Port of Saint John that she was arrested by virtue of several processes issued out of the Exchequer Court of Canada, New Brunswick Admiralty District; and she was ordered sold as aforesaid.\nOn or about June 17, 1940, a new Government was established in Estonia known as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (hereinafter referred to as the E.S.S.R.). The E.S.S.R. became a constituent Republic of the U.S.S.R., and was recognized as such by the Government of Canada, de facto but not de jure, as already mentioned. On August 28, 1940, a new constitution of the E.S.S.R. was published, and Article (6) thereof purported to nationalize the shipping enterprises of juridical and natural persons, such as joint stock companies, partnerships and large scale enterprises, together with their whole property, whatsoever it may consist of and wheresoever it may be, including deposits and current accounts in banks of the Republic and abroad, further, all rights belonging to such enterprises, such as claims to insurance sums, etc. The amount of compensation for the nationalized ships was fixed at twenty-five per cent of their value; and the Council of Peoples Commissars of the E.S.S.R. was charged with the approval of the list of shipping enterprises subject to nationalization and with the fixing of the order of payment of compensation for the nationalized ships.\nAccording to an \"Extract-Translation\" from the Estonian State Gazette, the list of shipping enterprises subject to nationalization, approved by the Government of the Republic on July 28, 1940, included: \"Shipping Association whose part-owners are: A. Laane and F. Baltser\". This extract from the State Gazette of Estonia is certified to by J. Kaiv, Acting Consul General of Estonia in New York.\nOn October 25, 1940, there was passed a Decree of the Council of Peoples Commissars of the U.S.S.R. on the \"Organization of the Estonian State Steamship Line\", section (1) of which provides for the organization on the territory of 'the E.S.S.R. of the aforesaid line in direct subordination to the Peoples Commissariat of Maritime Fleet with the seat of its administration at Tallinn; and a copy was filed of the \"Statute of the Estonian State Cargo and Passenger Steamship Line\", by virtue of which the respondent line was organized as a corporation under the laws of the U.S.S.R. On June 17, 1940, and on the respective dates of the above mentioned decrees, the appellants were citizens of Estonia, residing and domiciled therein. The appellant Baltser is presently residing in Sweden.\nThe summons in rem against the proceeds of the sale of the Elise, claiming ownership of these proceeds by virtue of the laws of the U.S.S.R. and of the E.S.S.R., and, in particular, the Decrees herein above referred to, was issued on the 11th of September, 1942. In the summons the respondent claimed all rights of title and possession thereof to have been transferred to and to have become vested in the respondent, and that the latter was, therefore, entitled to the balance of the proceeds of the sale. The respondent claimed that the decrees and the statute purported to transfer and vest in it all rights of title and possession in and out of the steamship line.\nNow, the dispute between the appellants and the respondent is as follows:\u2014\nIn paragraph 18 of the Admissions, the plaintiff (respondent) alleges that:\u2014\nOn the basis of the facts herein recited and admitted, as a matter of law, the decrees and statute of the de facto government hereinabove referred to, nationalized the said steamship and entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action and to receive the said proceeds; claimed.\nAnd the defendants (appellants) deny this allegation, contending that, as a matter of law, based upon the same facts, the decrees and the statute have not the effect alleged by the respondent; and that the said statute and decrees are (a) acts of a de facto government only, (b) confiscatory in nature and not recognized by our law as effective in transferring property outside of the jurisdiction of the promulgating authority, and (c) are contrary to the constitution of Estonia as it existed prior to June 17, 1940. All these facts and statements are borne out, either (by the admissions of the parties or by the letter of the Secretary of State for External Affairs, dated January 2, 1947.\nThe admissions conclude by stating that the questions at issue between the plaintiff (respondent) and defendants (appellants) are:\u2014\n(1) Were the Decrees and Statutes herein recited effective in nationalizing the Steamship ELISE and transferring ownership to the plaintiff herein?\n(2) Is the plaintiff entitled to maintain the action and receive the proceeds?\nThe learned trial judge, in an elaborate judgment, was of the opinion that the plaintiff (respondent) was entitled to succeed. He went on to say:2.\nBut I do not think that that conclusion disposes of the elements in the action. Although the defendants claim the entire proceeds in court \"and such further and other relief as the circumstances may require,\" there is no specific claim, and there was no suggestion at the trial by either party, that in the event of the plaintiff succeeding on the main issue the defendants' compensation for the nationalization of the ELISE should be first paid out of the fund under dispute. I think that a proper disposal of the case requires that I give this aspect due consideration.\n* * *\nI would assume from the admissions that the nationalization of the ELISE under the decree of October 8, 1940, was to be of immediate effect and, accordingly, the value may be taken as of that date as well. There is, however, no specific evidence of the value of the ELISE on that date. Under an order of the late District Judge of this Court the vessel was appraised on January 3, 1941, and reported to have a value of $112,000 \"provided that she is placed in running order and back in class at Lloyds\". This report adds that the above valuation \"does not include extra equipment, stores or fuel on board\". The ELISE was sold by the marshal at public auction on January 25, 1941, for $88,000. The date of sale having been only about four months subsequent to the date of the decree, it would appear fair to all concerned to take $88,000 as the basis for calculating the compensation. The allowance for compensation may therefore be taken to be $22,000. If anyone concerned places a greater value on the ELISE, this sum should, of course, be treated as only partial satisfaction.\nH. A. Porter, K.C., on behalf of the Secretary of State of Canada, as Custodian of \"enemy property\" under the latest Qrder-in-Council (P.C. 8526) of November 13, 1943, has informed the Court that the Custodian waives the commission of two per centum chargeable on the proceeds in court by the terms of that order. The itemized account for Mr. Porter's costs with respect to all actions in connection with the ELISE has been approved by the respective solicitors on the record in the aggregate sum of $978.13, and they have consented to this sum being paid from the proceeds without taxation.\nIn view of the difficulty of the main point of law involved in this action, and of the distribution of the proceeds between the parties, there will be no order with respect to the costs of the parties in the cause or for the applications in chambers preceding the trial.\nThere will be a reference to the Registrar to report on the amount of the proceeds in court and the net sums payable to the plaintiff and the defendants respectively. The Registrar's fees hereafter chargeable, and the court stenographer's costs on the trial will be paid from the proceeds before payment to the parties. In the result, the defendants are entitled to the sum of $22,000 less half the above fees and costs, and the plaintiff is entitled to the balance of the proceeds then remaining. All payments will be subject to the consent of the Custodian.\nI now proceed to answer the two questions at issue between the parties, referred to above.\nI will not pause to inquire whether, on their true construction, the decrees had the effect of immediately nationalizing the ship Elise, nor if the transfer to the State or to the respondents became operative before the so-called compensation was paid to the appellants.\nMr. Kaiv, in his affidavit, stated that \"the decrees and statute, dated October 8, October 25, and October 29, mentioned above, are the same decrees and statute discussed in the English case of A\/S Talinna Laevachisus and others v. Talinna S.S. Line and another 3. The case referred to by the Consul General was decided on April 18, 1946, by Mr. Justice Atkinson, of the King's Bench Division. It was there held that the confiscatory decrees in question issued by the E.S.S.R. Government were illegal and unenforceable in English Courts. This case concerned the winding up of the Vapper Shipping Association, whose ship, The Vapper, was among vessels which were purported to have been nationalized under the same decrees as are here in question. It was an interpleader issue to decide the title to insurance policy moneys paid in respect of the loss through war risk; and it was claimed by the representative of the shareholders in the association owning the vessel and also by some of the individual shareholders. The effective defendants were the Estonian State Steamship Line, who contended that, the Vapper being among vessels which were nationalized under Estonian law in July, 1940, the plaintiffs were divested of their rights, which became vested in the Estonian State Steamship Line, who were accordingly entitled to receive the money.\nUpon appeal before Lord Justice Scott, Lord Justice Tucker and Lord Justice Cohen 4, the judgment of Mr. Justice Atkinson was upheld. In the reasons of Lord Justice Scott, at p. 111, he said:\u2014\nIf the decree did apply, the legislation involved taking 75 per cent of the moneys without compensation, and English law treats as penal foreign legislation providing for compulsory acquisition of assets situate in this country, and a fortiori of assets which consist of choses in action enforceable only in English Courts, unless that legislation provides for just compensation; and 25 per cent of money cannot be just compensation.\nLord Justice Tucker, at p. 113, held that the decree did not have the effect of nationalizing the ship, the Vapper, as the final process of nationalization, to wit, the drawing up of a nationalization deed and transfer balance sheet, which effects the transfer of the enterprise and its assets, had not been undertaken with regard to the association or the Tallina Shipping Company. He added:\u2014\nAs a matter of construction I would, moreover, have thought that in the absence of express words, which are lacking, these decrees\u2014 although perhaps on their face purporting to transfer ships outside the jurisdiction\u2014would not suffice to effect the assignment of a chose in action situate in a foreign country * * * This decree of October 8th is legislation which could only be enacted by the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.\nIn the Vapper case evidence had been adduced that the decree was unconstitutional and, in that respect, Lord Justice Tucker added:\u2014\nThis reasoning appears on the face of it to be correct and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary must, I think, be accepted.\nIn Government of the Republic of Spain et al v. National Bank of Scotland, Ltd. 5, the Court of Session was seized with a somewhat similar case in connection with a claim of the Republic of Spain. In the course of the judgment of the Lord Justice-Clerk (Aitchison), the following appears at p. 426:\u2014\nIf the Decree of Requisition of the Spanish Government fell to be regarded as a confiscatory or penal law it could have no validity outside Spanish territory, and the Courts of this country, in accordance with an accepted rule of international law, would not grant their aid to the execution.\nThe action was dismissed.\nReference might also be made to the decision of the Court of Appeal in The Jupiter (No. 3), 6, that the nationalization decrees had no effect on property not situate within the territory of the U.S.S.R.; that the Jupiter was not at the date when the decrees were promulgated within the territory of either of the Republics which later, with others, formed the U.S.S.R., and the appeal was dismissed.\nI would also like to refer to Lorentzen v. Lydden & Co. Ltd. 7, where Atkinson J. decided that a decree of the Norwegian Government had an extra-territorial effect and operated to pass the ownership of the chose in action, which was situate in England, to the curator appointed by the Norwegian Government, and that, therefore, the curator was entitled to maintain the action, but on the ground that the decree was not of a confiscatory character; if it had been, effect would not have been given to the decree.\nOn the whole, the respondent, or plaintiff, in this case had the onus of proving its right to claim the moneys in Court. In my opinion, it has completely failed to do so. The decrees relied on by it were declared illegal and unconstitutional by the English Court of Appeal in the Talinna case. It may be doubted whether their language was sufficient to vest the steamship Elise in the respondent. In the Talinna case it was held that they lacked the necessary wording to make them effective in that respect; and, further, that they were incomplete in the sense that the last stage to give them force of law had not been proceeded with. At the material time the Elise was in the Port of Saint John, Canada, a foreign country. She was then in possession of the appellants and the respondent never got possession of the ship, nor any control of her, before the ship was sold by the Marshal. The proceedings herein were instituted after the sale and were not directed against the ship herself, but against the proceeds of the sale, then deposited in a Canadian Admiralty Court.\nMoreover, the decrees are of an evident confiscatory nature and, even if they purport to have extra-territorial effect, they cannot be recognized by a foreign country, under the well-established principles of international law. Quite independent of their illegality and unconstitutionality, they are not of such a character that they could be recognized in a British Court of Law.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be maintained and the proceedings of the respondent dismissed. There should be an order that the proceeds of the sale of the Elise in Court should be paid out to Laane and Baltser except that the Registrar's fees, the Court Stenographer's costs and the total amount of the costs of the Solicitor for the Custodian of Enemy Alien Property (all of which I refer to in my judgment) should first be paid out of the fund, the balance going to the appellants as aforesaid. The appellants are entitled to their costs against the respondents in this Court and below.\nKerwin J. (Concurred in by Estey J.):\u2014This is an appeal by Ado Laane and Frederick Baltser against a judgment of the Exchequer Court, New Brunswick Admiralty District, directing that the proceeds of the sale of the steamship Elise, now in Court, be paid out to the parties in the proportion of one-fourth to the appellants and three-quarters to the respondents, after the deduction and the costs of the solicitor for the Custodian of Enemy-Property.\nThe action was fought on the basis of a statement of admissions signed on behalf of the parties, together with the documents thereto attached. From this statement it appears that the Elise was owned by the defendants (the present appellants), who did business in co-partnership at Parnu, in the Republic of Estonia, where the ship was registered. It left the Republic prior to July, 1939, and never returned. During 1940 it sailed between the United Kingdom and Canada, arriving on one of its trips at Saint John, New Brunswick, on August 15, 1940. While there in port, it was arrested by virtue of several processes issued out of the Exchequer Court and it was ordered sold, the sale taking place on January 25, 1941. The sum of $88,000 was realized and, after satisfying the claims against the steamship, there was a balance on hand in Court amounting to $43,709.08, together with bank interest from December 31, 1945. Proceedings were taken by the plaintiff, The Estonian State Cargo & Passenger Steamship Line, claiming these proceeds and an appearance was entered on behalf of Laane and Baltser.\nPrior to the execution of the admissions, the following letter was received by the solicitor for the appellants from the Secretary of State for External Affairs of Canada:\u2014\nRe: Estonian State Cargo and Passenger Steamship Line v. Proceeds of the Steamship ELISE.\nYour letter of December 23 encloses four questions put jointly by you and Mr. C. F. Inches, representing all the parties to this action. You, desire my answers to these questions for production to the court in this case.\nQuestion 1. Does the Government of Canada recognize the right of the Council of Peoples' Commissars of U.S.S.R. or any other authority of the U.S.S.R., to make decrees purporting to be effectual in Estonia?\nAnswer: The Government of Canada recognizes that Estonia has de facto entered the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, but does not recognize this de jure. The question of the effect of a Soviet decree is for the Court to decide.\nQuestion 2. Does the Government of Canada recognize the existence of the Republic of Estonia as constituted prior to June 1940, and if not when did such recognition cease?\nAnswer: The Government of Canada does not recognize de facto the Republic of Estonia as constituted prior to June 1940. The Republic of Estonia as constituted prior to June 1940, has ceased de facto to have any effective existence. Question 3. Does the Government of Canada recognize that the Republic of Estonia has entered the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and if so, as from what date, and is such entry recognized as being de facto or de jure?\nAnswer: The Government of Canada recognizes that Estonia has de facto entered the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but has not recognized this de jure. It is not possible for the Government of Canada to attach a date to this recognition.\nQuestion 4. Does the Government of Canada recognize the Government of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, and if so, from what date.\nAnswer: The Government of Canada recognizes the Government of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic to be the de facto government of Estonia but does not recognize it as the de jure government of Estonia. It is not possible for the Government of Canada to attach a date to this recognition.\nSincerely Yours\nLOUIS S. ST. LAURENT\nSecretary of State for External Affairs.\nThe statement of agreed facts was then completed, containing the following admissions. Prior to June 17, 1940, there existed the Republic of Estonia, the existence of which, and the government of which, was recognized by the Government of Canada. On or about that date, a new government was established in Estonia known as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, hereafter called the E.S.S.R. This E.S.S.R. became a constituent republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Russia), hereafter referred to as U.S.S.R., and according to the letter from the Secretary of State for External Affairs was recognized as such by the Government of Canada de facta but not de jure but, as appears from the letter, without it being possible to attach a date to this recognition.\nOn August 28, 1940, a new constitution of the E.S.S.R. was published, of which article 6 declares water transportation to be state property. On August 1, 1940, the newly established government passed a decree or regulation concerning the movement of ships. Considerable discussion occurred in the Court below and at bar as to the precise meaning and effect of paragraph 11 of the admissions, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. That on October 8, 1940, there was passed a decree of the Presidium of the Provisional Supreme Soviet of the E.S.S.R. on Nationalization of Shipping Enterprises and Seagoing Ships and Riverboats, Section 1 of which purports to nationalize, inter alia, the Steamship ELISE \"wheresoever it may be\" and Section 2 of which fixes the amount of compensation to be 25 per cent of its value; a copy of this Decree is hereto annexed marked \"C\". Coupled with this must be read paragraphs 18 and 19:\u2014\n18. The plaintiff alleges that on the basis of the facts herein recited and admitted, as a matter of law, the decrees and statute of the de jacto Government hereinabove referred to, nationalized the said steamship and entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action and to receive the said proceeds; and the defendants deny this allegation, contending that as & a matter of law, based upon the said facts herein recited and admitted, the said decrees do not have the effect alleged by the plaintiff and that the said statute and decrees are (a) acts of a de facto government only, (b) confiscatory in nature and not recognized by our law as effective in transferring property outside of the jurisdiction of the promulgating authority and (c) are contrary to the constitution of Estonia as it existed prior to June 17, 1940.\n19. That the questions at issue between the plaintiff and defendant, are:\n(1) Were the Decrees and Statutes herein recited effective in nationalizing the steamship ELISE and transferring ownership to the plaintiff herein?\n(2) Is the Plaintiff entitled to maintain the action and receive the proceeds?\nOther paragraphs in the admissions show that the plaintiff is a corporation organized under the laws of the U.S.S.R. and no question really arises as to its right to sue. As of June 17, 1940, and on the respective dates of the decrees above mentioned, Laane and Baltser were admittedly citizens of Estonia, residing and domiciled therein.\nReading paragraphs 11, 18 and 19 together, I concur with the trial judge that without it being necessary to call evidence to prove the applicable law, the parties have agreed that the decree of October 8, 1940, nationalized the Elise \"wheresoever it may be\" and fixed the compensation therefor at 25 per cent of its value. This construction is borne out by the proceedings that were taken with a view of taking evidence by commission and then abandoned in view of the agreed statement of facts. I also agree that the affidavit of Mr. Kaiv expresses an opinion with respect to the law of the former Republic of Estonia as constituted prior to June, 1940. The answer of the Secretary of State for External Affairs to question 2 shows that such republic has ceased to have any effective existence and Mr. Kaiv's opinion is therefore irrelevant.\nThe effect of such a nationalization decree in the Courts of Canada is a different matter. On October 8, 1940, the ship was not in the jurisdiction of the new republic and, therefore, the decision in Luther v. Sagor 8, has no application as the goods there in question were at the date of the decree of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic within the jurisdiction of that country. Even a public ship in foreign waters is not, and is not treated as, territory of her own nation: Chung Chi Cheung v. The King 9. The authorities cited in a note to rule 54 in the 5th edition of Dicey's Conflict of Laws at page 212 establish that the Courts of this country have no jurisdiction to entertain an action for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a penal law of a foreign state. Confiscation of the property in England of the former King of Spain was considered as penal legislation in Banco de Vizcaya v. Don Alfonso 10. Huntington v. Attrill 11, referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Court below, was merely a decision that the action being by a subject to enforce in his own interest a liability imposed for the protection of his private rights was remedial and not penal. I quite agree that the decision in the Jupiter (No. 3), 12, was dealing with a decree which the Court found did not even purport to have extra-territorial operation, but the reasoning of the Lord Ordinary in Government of Republic of Spain v. National Bank of Scotland 13, and that of Lord Justice Scott in A\/S Tallinna Laevahius v. Estonia State S.S. Line 14, appeal to me as being correct statements of the law applicable.\nIn my view the decree of October 8, 1940, is of a confiscatory nature just as much as if the compensation had been fixed at one per centum. It is not in the same class as that considered by Atkinson J. in Lorentzen v. Lydden & Co. 15, where the Norwegian Government, on the eve of taking its departure for England, passed an Order in Council by which all ships registered in Norway, that were outside the German occupied area, were requisitioned, and it was provided that compensation should be fixed according to Norwegian law. Nor are we dealing with a case where a foreign government is in possession and attempts are made to implead it. The plaintiffs here bring the action, and the decree in question being of a confis- catory nature, the rule to be applied is correctly set forth in Cheshire's Private International Law, 3rd edition, p. 180: \u2014\"If the previous owner is in possession, his legal ownership is, in the view of English law, unaffected 'by the confiscatory legislation of a foreign sovereign.\"\nFor these reasons I would set aside the judgment a quo and substitute therefor an order that there be paid out of the proceeds in Court of the sale of the Elise the total amount of the Registrar's fees and Court Stenographer's costs and the total amount of the costs of the solicitor for the Custodian of Enemy Property (all of which are referred to in the judgment appealed from) -and that the balance be paid out to Laane and Baltser. The appellants are entitled to their costs against the respondents in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nRand J.:\u2014The facts as, for the purposes of this appeal, I assume them to be, can be shortly stated. The vessel Elise during the summer of 1940 was engaged in running between the United Kingdom and Canada. She was owned by the appellants, Laane & Baltser, Estonian citizens carrying on business in partnership at Parhu, Estonia, where the vessel was registered. In August, 1940, while at Saint John, New Brunswick, she was arrested for wages and detained until January 25, 1941, when she was sold under an order of the Admiralty Court.\nIn June, 1940, the U.S.S.R. occupied Estonia and on or about the 17th of that month a soviet government of the state was set up. In July, 1941, the country was invaded by German forces which maintained military control until driven out in September, 1944, when the former government re-assumed power. On October 8, 1940, a decree passed by the appropriate authority purported to nationalize all Estonian merchant vessels including those in foreign ports; on October 25th a decree of the Council of People's Commissars, U.S.S.R., of which Estonia was a constituent republic, provided for the organization of the Estonian State Steamship Line, which I take to be the respondent, and was followed by what is called a statute of the Line, setting up its constitution. The property in all state vessels thereupon became vested in the respondent. The Elise was at all times held by those in charge of her for the original owners. The respondent now lays claim to the balance of the proceeds from the sale.\nThe local Judge in Admiralty held the vessel to be in transitu as distinguished from being locally situate at Saint John, that the law applicable to her was that of her registry, Estonia, and that effect must accordingly be given to the decrees. Subject to a deduction of 25 per cent which the October decree provides as compensation for the taking, the funds in court were therefore awarded to the state corporation.\nWhatever may be the significance or the legal consequences of a vessel being in transitu there can be no doubt that once a private ship is voluntarily brought within a country's territory it is submitted to the laws of that country. The jurisdiction arising is primary and fundamental; but the particular law to be applied to determine legal relations in respect of the vessel is quite another matter. But, whether viewed as recognition of legal effects of foreign law or as affirmative enforcement of foreign law, that its application is through the act and authority of the territorial state follows from the language of Chief Justice Marshall in Schooner Exchange v. M'Fadden 16:\u2014\nAll exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within its own territories, must be traced up to the consent of the nation itself. They can flow from no other legitimate source.\nThere is the every-day attribution of the law of the domicile of a deceased person to the succession of moveable property in the foreign territorial jurisdiction; but that attribution lies within the determination of the territorial state and the law of the domicile may in a proper case be modified or disregarded: Marjoribanks v. Askem 17; Re Selot's Trust 18; Dicey, 5th Ed., 454 and 535. In such case, the territorial law, subject, it may be, to national interests such as the payment of local debts, vests vacant property in a new ownership; but it would be a contradiction of the original postulate to treat the foreign law as operating through its own jurisdictional efficacy. The result of so conceiving the legal effectuation may make little or no difference in the general run of cases, but it furnishes a guidance in such instances as the present which the other conception does not appear to do. A like illustration is furnished by bankruptcy where the foreign jurisdiction lends such aid as it thinks proper to what is con- sidered to be a desirable universal distribution of assets among creditors by recognizing the title of the assignee obtained in the principal administration: Dicey, 5th Ed., pp. 498-9.\nNor is the operation of the local law here affected by the principle of \"immunity\". That term connotes the negative aspect, abstention or forebearance of law and its processes. Here the local law must decide ownership to the fund in court and deliver possession of it as it would of the vessel. The principle is illustrated by cases in which the foreign sovereignty itself in some form enters the territorial jurisdiction.\nIn dealing with ships, there are, undoubtedly, special considerations to be taken into account. Registered vessels have not, ordinarily, an actual localization. They enter world commerce and in the interest of international commercial relations of great magnitude and complexity, rules of practical convenience commanding general assent are a virtual necessity. For that reason, the law of the registry has been accorded special regard, and in important respects it is accepted as governing the vessel: Dicey, 5th Ed., pp. 342, 348, 996 et seq.\nBut convenience and expediency are merely relevant factors in reaching the juridical determination; the application is by the territorial power and jurisdictionally with such modifications of a foreign rule as it pleases. It is what we should expect, therefore, that there are certain rules, more or less clearly defined, by which the enforcement in the domestic forum of a foreign law is refused.\nIt is now established that a common law jurisdiction will not enforce directly or indirectly the penal or the revenue laws of another state, to which Dicey in Rule 54, 5th Ed., adds, political law; and there is the general principle that no state will apply a law of another which offends against some fundamental morality or public policy.\nThe first question then is whether there is some such policy of New Brunswick with which the confirmation of the attempted acquisition of this vessel by Estonia would conflict. The taking of property for public purposes with- out compensation certainly clashes with our notions of the conditions which should attend the exercise of that power, and I should not view the proposed award of 25 per cent of the value as avoiding that conflict. The provincial law is invoked to effect the transfer of the appellant's property on those terms: and we must ask whether the considerations of international expediency so far transcend normal policy as to overcome the repugnance of our political conceptions toward such an act. I do not think they do.\nThe effect of the decrees bears elements also of analogy to the operation of a revenue law. A state imposes a tax as a small fraction of the property of its citizens, and it is taken for a public purpose. But whether the fraction is five or seventy-five per cent and even though limited to certain classes of property, coercion and public object are common to both cases. We refuse to aid a neighbour state in collecting the lesser exaction even though taxation is universally accepted as a proper state faculty; on what ground should we enforce the greater?\nBut there is what I think a still more important aspect in which the question is to be viewed. The acquisition of property here is not to be dissociated from the larger political policy of which it is in reality an incident. The matters before us evidence the fundamental change effected in the constitution of the Estonian state, of which that acquisition is only one, though an important, particular. What has been set up is a social organization in which the dominant position of the individual, as recognized in our polity, has been repudiated and in which the institution of private property, so far as that has to do with producing goods and services, has been abolished; and those functions, together with the existing means, taken over by the state. If at the time of the decrees every Estonian ship had been sunk, their principal purpose would still have been realized in vesting in the state, apart from ports and immoveable works in Estonia, the monopoly of carrying on shipping services.\nWhat is asked of the foreign territorial law is, therefore, to aid in the execution of a fundamental political law of Estonia which serves no interest of the foreign state. The law of conflicts is concerned with the determination of rights in property and personal relations which are con- ceived as distinct from the law under which they arise; but laws of the class in question are not migratory and are deemed to be operative only within their own territories. If the transfer of property by such a law of Estonia has been satisfied by the condition of territorial jurisdiction, the title will be recognized and enforced, as in England the similar decrees of Russia: Luther v. Sagor 19. But where that legislative basis is absent there is no warrant in international accommodation to call upon another state to exercise its sovereign power to supply the jurisdictional deficiency in completing such a political program: Ingenohl v. Wing On & Co. 20; Coding v. The King 21; Emperor of Austria v. Day 22; Dicey, 7th Ed. pp. 212, 214. Lorentzen v. Lydden 23 is quite distinguishable. There the King of Norway, as parens patriae, was empowered to act for his subjects held in an enemy occupied zone by taking steps necessary to the protection of their property rights. It was an administrative enactment with procedural incidents which involved no question of political policy.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment in favour of the appellants with costs in both courts.\nKellock J.:\u2014It is admitted in this case that the steamship Elise, the proceeds of which are here in question, was prior to June 17, 1940, owned by the appellants and that by July of 1939 the ship had left the Republic of Estonia and had arrived at Saint John, N.B., on or about the 15th of August, 1940, without having returned at any time to Estonia. While at Saint John the vessel was arrested and ultimately sold in January, 1941. The admissions further state that on or about June 17, 1940, a new government was established in Estonia known as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, referred to in the admissions as the E.S.S.R., and that the E.S.S.R. became a constituent republic of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, being recognized by the Government of Canada de facto but not de jure.\nThe earliest relevant decree of this new state is that of October 8, 1940, which, according to the admissions, pur- ports to vest the title to the ship in the respondent. The decree entitles the owners to compensation fixed at twenty- five per cent of the value of the ship. Seventy-five per cent of the value is thus taken without compensation. The question at issue between the parties is the efficacy under the law of New Brunswick of this legislation.\nIn Dicey, 5th Ed., p. 610, note (k), it is stated that \"if movables are outside the territory of a confiscating power then clearly the extra-territorial effect cannot be claimed as of right\". Such effect depends upon the consent of the lex situs; Schooner Exchange v. M'Fadden 24. In my opinion the law of England or of New Brunswick accords no such consent. All of the decisions and expressions of judicial opinion to which we have been referred or which I have been able to find, support this view.\nIn Barclay v. Russell 25, the claim of the State of Maryland to bank stock in England which had been vested in trustees under legislation of the old colony of Maryland before the war of Independence, the claim being rested upon legislation of the state subsequent thereto, was denied. At page 434 the Lord Chancellor said:\nI find no general principle carrying it farther, than that the new-formed Government may invest itself with all the rights, that it can command: no farther.\nIn Lecouturier v. Rey 26, Lord Macnaghten said at 265:\nTo me it seems perfectly plain that it must be beyond the power of any foreign Court or any foreign legislature to prevent the monks from availing themselves in England of the benefit of the reputation which the liqueurs of their manufacture have acquired here or to extend or communicate the benefit of that reputation to any rival or competitor in the English market.\nLord Loreburn L.C. said at p. 273:\n* * * but this property * * * is property situated in England, and must therefore be regulated and disposed of in accordance with the law of England.\nIn Ingenohl v. Wing On & Co. 27, it was held by the Privy Council that the purchase from the American Cusi-todian of Alien Property of a business in the Philippines, together with the good will and trade-marks, could not transfer to the purchaser the title to trade-marks or trade names in China. Earlier in the same year in the case Ingenohl v. Olsen & Co .28, the Supreme Court of the United States had before it an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines arising out of the same sale in which the original owner of the Philippine business, who also carried on business at Hongkong, had obtained a judgment for costs against the defendants in an action brought to restrain the defendants from infringing the plaintiff's trade-marks in Hongkong.\nIn giving the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Holmes said at p. 544:\nA trade-mark started elsewhere would depend for its protection in Hongkong upon the law prevailing in Hongkong and would confer no rights except by the consent of that law * * * If the Alien Property-Custodian .purported to convey rights in English territory valid as against those whom the English law protects he exceeded the powers that were or could be given to him by the United States.\nAnd at page 545:\n* * * but no principle requires the transfer to be given effect outside of the United States. * * *\nIn the El Condado 29, there was in question a claim by the Government of the Republic of Spain against the National Bank of Scotland for loss alleged to have been sustained by reason of the granting of an interim interdict at the instance of the defendants, under which the use of the steamship there in question had been lost to the plaintiff for a considerable period. The pursuer's claim to the ship was based on a decree of the Republic Government of Spain and it was alleged that the Spanish Consul at Glasgow had taken possession. The defence was, inter alia, that the decree was ineffectual to attach property outside Spanish territorial waters. In giving judgment at the trial Lord Jamieson said at p. 87:\nWhile our Courts will treat as binding legislation of a confiscatory character enacted by a foreign Government recognized by His Majesty's Government as a Sovereign Government so far as affecting property within the foreign Government's jurisdiction, such legislation will not be held to affect property situated in this country or out with the territory administered by such Government.\nThis judgment was upheld on appeal.\nAgain in A.G. Der Manufacturen, I. A. Woronin etc., v. Huth & Co. 30, in an action brought by a Russian company against a firm of bankers in London claiming certain war bonds and moneys which it was alleged the defendants held on behalf of the plaintiff company, the defendants' main contention was that by reason of certain Russian legislation either the company had ceased to exist or those claiming to initiate or ratify the issue of the writ in the name of the company had no right so to do.\nIt was held by Wright J., as he then was that the confiscatory decrees there in question had no extra-territorial effect. He cited the opinion of Lord Cave, L.C., in Employers' Liability Assce. Co. v. Sedgwick Collins & Co., 31, and that of Sargant L.J. in the Court of Appeal in the same case, 32, as well as that of Hill J. in the Court of Appeal in The Jupiter (No. 3), 33, Lecouturier v. Rey 34, and the cases cited in Dicey on Conflict of Laws, 4th Ed., page 576, note (h), now 5th Ed., page 610, note (k).\nThe case A\/S Tallinna, etc. v. Tallinna Shipping Co., Ltd. et al 35, before Atkinson J. and on appeal, 80 Ll.L.R., page 99, was an interpleader issue to decide the title to certain policy moneys paid in respect of loss through war risk of the Estonian Steamship Vapper in July, 1945. The money was claimed by the plaintiffs and individual shareholders in the association owning the vessel. The effective defendants were the Estonian State Steamship Line, who contended that the Vapper, being among vessels nationalized under Estonian law in July, 1940, became vested in them. It was held that this legislation had not been proved, but in the course of his judgment Atkinson J. said at p. 256:\nThere can be no question but that this legislation that followed was confiscatory in character, and it is well settled that our Courts will not give effect to legislation of that kind.\nThe judgment was upheld on appeal, 80 Ll.L.R., 99. In the view of Scott L.J., at p. 111, the legislation, had it been proved, was to be regarded as penal and non-enforceable. As to its penal character however, one might compare what was said by Viscount Haldane in Ingenohl v. Wing On, supra at 359, and to Huntington v. Attrill 36.\nOn the main question reference may also be made to of certain Registrar's fees and Court Stenographer's costs the view of Viscount Cave and Lord Sumner in Russian, etc. Bank v. Comptoir d'Escompte 37, at 125, and of Lord Finlay at 137.\nThere remains for consideration the judgment of Atkinson J. in Lorentzen v. Lydden & Co. 38, at 202. In that case the Norwegian government had issued a decree requisitioning all ships registered in Norway situated outside the area occupied by the Germans and owned by, inter alia, a company carrying on business in that area. The decree provided however, for compensation to the owners. The curator appointed under the decree brought action on behalf of the owners of a vessel covered by its terms against the defendants, a firm carrying on business in London, to recover damages for breach by the latter of a contract of charter. The defendants denied any right in the curator to collect claims belonging to the owners of the vessel and denied the right of the Norwegian government by legislative or executive act to transfer the title to claims or other property situated in England. At page 215 Atkinson J. said:\nIt seems to me that the English courts are entitled to take into consideration the following matters: that this is not a confiscatory decree, see art. 5 of the decree, that England and Norway are engaged together in a desperate war for their existence, and that public policy demands that effect should be given to this decree * * * It is not confiscatory, it is in the interests of public policy, and it is in accordance with the comity of nations.\nWhatever may be the true basis upon which this judgment rests it was not regarded by Atkinson J. himself in the later case of the Vapper as being at all relevant to the decision in that case as it was not mentioned.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and answer in favour of the appellants the questions asked. I concur in the order proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. Paul Barry.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Inches & Hazen.\n1 1948 Ex. C.R. 435.\n2 [1948] Ex.

Due to his inability to obtain the necessary timber in time, respondent was permitted by the Government to suspend temporarily the work. He therefore advised appellant, who had started delivering the stone, to suspend further deliveries until notified again. Appellant brought action for the annulment of his contract. This action was rejected by the Superior Court and by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: Taschereau J. dissenting, that the contract for the stone was not subordinated to all the terms of the contract for the dock, and as appellant did not acquiesce in the suspension, and as it was not established by respondent that the execution of the work had been rendered impossible as required by art. 1202 C.C., respondent was guilty of a breach of contract.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1 affirming, Bissonnette and Gagn\u00e9 JJ.A. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court, Edge J., dismissing appellant's action for breach of contract.\nG.

Le dit John Tremblay s'engage \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 Hector Bouchard toute la pierre qu'il aura besoin pour la cons- truction du quai de St-Sim\u00e9on. Cette pierre sera rendue sur le quai en place. La pierre devra \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieurs du d\u00e9partement et elle devra \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne pas retarder les travaux. A la demande du dit Hector Bouchard. Le dit Hector Bouchard paiera au dit John Tremblay la somme de $1.75 la verge cube. Le paiement sera fait suivant les estim\u00e9s des ing\u00e9nieurs. Le dit John Tremblay fournira 'tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour ex\u00e9cuter ce contrat.\nEt nous avons sign\u00e9s.\nIl est entendu que le contracteur du quai an fera mettre un cantit\u00e9e qui luis fodras a ter et il la rendras e sest frais.\nHector Bouchard\nJohn Tremblay.\nL'appelant pr\u00e9tend que l'intim\u00e9 a refus\u00e9 de remplir ses obligations en vertu de ce contrat et il en demande la r\u00e9siliation avec, en plus, le montant de $708.41 et \"sous r\u00e9serve pour le demandeur de tous ses recours ult\u00e9rieurs pour dommages lorsque ceux-ci pourront \u00eatre liquid\u00e9s.\"\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l'action et la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 2 a confirm\u00e9 le jugement \"sans en admettre tous les consid\u00e9rants\", les honorables juges Bissonnette et Gagn\u00e9 \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe contrat plus haut reproduit \u00e9tait un sous-contrat par lequel l'appelant s'engageait \u00e0 fournir et livrer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 une certaine quantit\u00e9 de pierre qui devait permettre \u00e0 ce dernier de remplir un contrat principal pour la construction du quai \u00e0 St-Sim\u00e9on dans le comt\u00e9 de Charlevoix, que l'intim\u00e9 avait sign\u00e9 avec Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Ministre des Travaux Publics du Canada. La date de son ach\u00e8vement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 20 juin 1947.\nPour l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat principal, l'intim\u00e9 avait besoin de 650,000 pieds de bois. Le contrat principal pourvoyait que ce bois pouvait \u00eatre: \"pine, spruce or Douglas Fir\".\nLe contrat avec le Ministre des Travaux Publics comportait que l'intim\u00e9 devait fournir \u00e0 ses frais \"every kind of labour, superintendence, services, tools, implements, machinery, plant, materials, articles and things necessary for the due execution and completion of all and every the works set out or referred to in the specification hereto annexed.\"\nC'est donc \u00e0 lui qu'il incombait de fournir le bois requis. Le Gouvernement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait bien consenti \u00e0 obtenir pour lui une certaine quantit\u00e9 de \"Douglas Fir\"; mais son obligation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait exclusivement telle qu'elle est exprim\u00e9e dans le contrat. En plus, le Ministre pouvait, de temps \u00e0 autre, retarder ou suspendre les travaux; mais restait la question de savoir si, en l'esp\u00e8ce, telle suspension ordonn\u00e9e ou consentie par le Ministre pouvait l\u00e9galement affecter le sous-contrat. En fait, \u00e0 la suite d'une visite d'inspection d'un monsieur Loignon, attach\u00e9 au D\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics, et sur le rapport de ce dernier qui constata que, le 6 septembre 1946, l'intim\u00e9 manquait de bois, et que celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 command\u00e9 par le D\u00e9partement arriverait trop tard pour que le contracteur se mette \u00e0 l'ouvrage pour commencer les travaux de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger avant l'hiver, l'ach\u00e8vement du contrat qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 au 20 juin 1947 fut, du consentement du Ministre, suspendu et, d\u00e8s septembre 1946, les travaux furent arr\u00eat\u00e9s jusqu'au mois d'avril 1947. L'intim\u00e9 en avertit l'appelant verbalement.\nL'appelant avait confi\u00e9 \u00e0 un monsieur Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay l'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat de pierre.\nLe 17 ao\u00fbt 1946 Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay lui demanda de lui dire imm\u00e9diatement o\u00f9 il devait placer cette pierre parce que, disait-il \"Bouchard ne pr\u00e9tend pas recevoir la pierre sur le quai au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'elle y arrive.\" En cons\u00e9quence, il sommait l'appelant de lui indiquer l'endroit, en l'avertissant qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par lui de le faire, il lui deviendrait impossible d'ex\u00e9cuter son contrat, et qu'il le tiendrait responsable de tous les dommages qu'il en souffrirait, car il ajoutait qu'il \u00e9tait organis\u00e9 maintenant pour l'ex\u00e9cution du sous-contrat et qu'il lui fallait garder ses hommes et ses camions engag\u00e9s.\nCette mise-en-demeure ne fut communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 que le 24 septembre 1946, assez longtemps apr\u00e8s que l'appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu par l'intim\u00e9 que les travaux \u00e9taient suspendus jusqu'au mois d'avril 1947.\nEn transmettant la lettre du 17 ao\u00fbt venant du sous-contracteur Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, l'appelant \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 que le refus par ce dernier de recevoir la pierre ne faisait pas son affaire, car il avait fait \"une d\u00e9pense d'environ $600.00 pour l'organisation de l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat pour le charroyage d'ici au mois de novembre prochain\". Il terminait sa lettre en disant: \"Donc, si c'est possible, je pourrais faire charroyer une bonne quantit\u00e9 de cette pierre sur le quai, imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les bateaux sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s.\"\nA cette lettre l'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible de mettre une bonne quantit\u00e9 de pierre sur le quai, mais \"et comme vous savez que les travaux du quai sont suspendus pour d'ici au mois d'avril, faute de manque de mat\u00e9riaux\u2026 pour aucune consid\u00e9ration je ne vous permettrai \u00e0 mettre une verge de pierre \u00e0 terre ou sur le quai\u2026 Quand je serai pr\u00eat \u00e0 la recevoir, je vous avertirai assez d'avance.\"\n\u00c9videmment, lorsqu'il \u00e9crivit sa lettre du 24 septembre, malgr\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu verbalement par l'intim\u00e9 que les travaux \u00e9taient suspendus, comme il y fait allusion dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l'appelant ne consid\u00e9rait pas le contrat r\u00e9sili\u00e9 par suite du d\u00e9lai que subissaient les travaux jusqu'au mois d'avril 1947, mais il se d\u00e9clarait pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire charroyer une bonne quantit\u00e9 de cette pierre sur le quai ; et, lorsqu'il re\u00e7ut la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 lui r\u00e9it\u00e9rant par \u00e9crit l'information qu'il lui avait donn\u00e9e que les travaux \u00e9taient suspendus jusqu'au mois d'avril, il n'insista pas. Il n'y eut aucune r\u00e9ponse de sa part \u00e0 la lettre qu'il re\u00e7ut alors de l'intim\u00e9; il ne persista pas \u00e0 vouloir charroyer la pierre sur le quai; et ce n'est que le 4 mars 1947, par l'action qu'il intenta alors contre l'intim\u00e9, qu'il signifia \u00e0 ce dernier qu'il entendait traiter la lettre du 28 septembre 1946 comme constituant un bris du contrat et que, par les conclusions de son action, il demanda que ce contrat fut annul\u00e9 et qu'il r\u00e9clama la somme de $708.41, repr\u00e9sentant $385.00 pour deux cent verges de pierre d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9es et $323.41 de dommages.\nA l'action de l'appelant, l'intim\u00e9 plaida qu'il avait parfaitement le droit de suspendre les travaux, \u00e0 la connaissance de l'appelant, et que cette suspension ne constituait pas une cause de r\u00e9siliation. Il expliqua que la suspension des travaux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue n\u00e9cessaire par le fait que le bois, dont il avait besoin pour la fabrication des cages utilis\u00e9es dans la construction du quai, \u00e9tait un bois sp\u00e9cial appel\u00e9 \"Douglas Fir\" qui pouvait \u00eatre obtenu de Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique), par l'entremise du D\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics, que ce bois n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 lors de l'institution de l'action, qu'il avait de ce fait \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 de construire ses cages en bois, et, qu'\u00e0 raison de cela, la suspension des travaux n'\u00e9tait en aucune mani\u00e8re due \u00e0 sa faute, n\u00e9gligence ou incurie, mais \u00e0 une cause en dehors de son contr\u00f4le.\nQuant \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation de $768.41, l'intim\u00e9 fit l'objection que, en vertu de son contrat avec l'appelant, la pierre devait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieurs du D\u00e9partement, et que le paiement ne devait en \u00eatre fait que suivant les estim\u00e9s de ces ing\u00e9nieurs. Comme cette condition pr\u00e9alable n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie et que, d'ailleurs, ce ne serait qu'au moment o\u00f9 la pierre serait empil\u00e9e dans les cages en bois que les ing\u00e9nieurs pourraient faire le mesurage, \u00e9tablir la quantit\u00e9 de pierre livr\u00e9e et en estimer la valeur en argent, l'action du demandeur, de ce chef, n'\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e ni en fait ni en droit et \u00e9tait pour le moins pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. C'est cette d\u00e9fense que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a accueillie.\nLe jugement de cette Cour fait d'abord remarquer que le contrat entre les parties ne stipule aucun d\u00e9lai pour la livraison de la pierre, que, d\u00e8s le 15 ao\u00fbt 1946, l'intim\u00e9 avisa l'appelant qu'il avait suspendu les op\u00e9rations de construction du quai et que cette suspension fut subs\u00e9quemment approuv\u00e9e par le D\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics sur le rapport de son repr\u00e9sentant, M. Loignon; qu'il est exact que d\u00e8s lors les travaux ne pouvaient \u00eatre continu\u00e9s sans que l'intim\u00e9 ait sur place toute la quantit\u00e9 de bois n\u00e9cessaire, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi les caissons que l'intim\u00e9 aurait faits auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits par les glaces durant l'hiver; que la suspension des travaux, cons\u00e9quemment, ne pouvait \u00eatre imputable \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qu'il devait \u00eatre exon\u00e9r\u00e9 parce que l'ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue impossible par un obstacle impr\u00e9visible; que ce fait devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 icomme un cas de force majeure formant obstacle au m\u00eame titre que tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement naturel et que, par suite, l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9tabli qu'il s'\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 absolue d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation.\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure proc\u00e8de ensuite \u00e0 constater que l'appelant n'avait pas fait la preuve d'une mise-en-demeure \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9; qu'il ne pouvait lui r\u00e9clamer le prix de la quantit\u00e9 de pierre d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournie et livr\u00e9e parce que cette pierre n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e ni estim\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieurs du D\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics, et que, de ce chef, l'action \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e.\nA l'\u00e9gard de l'appelant, aucun d\u00e9lai n'\u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 dans le contrat, et l'attitude adopt\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9solutoire et absolue, mais seulement dilatoire. Les travaux du quai n'\u00e9taient pas abandonn\u00e9s, ils n'\u00e9taient que suspendus jusqu'au mois d'avril 1947, en sorte que, tant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du contrat lui-m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9clamation en dommages et \u00e0 la demande de paiement de la pierre livr\u00e9e, les conclusions de l'appelant \u00e9taient pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es.\nEn confirmant ce jugement, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) 3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que l'appelant s'\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 en pr\u00e9sence d'un contrat principal dont l'ex\u00e9cution impliquait des suspensions et des retards, et qu'en convenant de coop\u00e9rer comme il l'a fait, comme fournisseur de pierre pour l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat principal, il s'\u00e9tait assujetti d'avance aux d\u00e9lais et suspensions que comportait l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat principal.\nL'ordre du D\u00e9partement avait sanctionn\u00e9 cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un arr\u00eat, sans que l'on puisse dire qu'il y avait eu n\u00e9gligence ou faute de l'intim\u00e9. L'appelant avait, quant \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e et aux termes d'ex\u00e9cution de son contrat, accept\u00e9 ce que pour autant comportait et impliquait le contrat principal. Le sous-contrat d\u00e9pendait du contrat principal dont l'appelant connaissait l'ampleur et \u00e9tait au courant des conditions. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'il dit dans son t\u00e9moignage. Il s'\u00e9tait soumis d'avance aux donn\u00e9es de ce contrat principal.\nOr, il est acquis que la suspension des travaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue n\u00e9cessaire par une p\u00e9nurie du bois requis; et la preuve ne laisse aucun doute; elle est positive et bien claire que le bois qui devait venir de la Colombie-Britannique, par l'entremise du D\u00e9partement, n'avait pu arriver \u00e0 temps. En plus, l'arr\u00eat forc\u00e9 des travaux n'\u00e9tait que temporaire. Il ne s'agissait que d'une interruption jusqu'au mois d'avril suivant, ce qui \u00e9tait raisonnable eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 l'ampleur de l'entreprise.\nL'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas tenu d'accepter la pierre sur le quai. Cette stipulation dans le sous-contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au profit de l'intim\u00e9 qui pouvait en tirer ou non le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ; et, au surplus, d'apr\u00e8s le sous-contrat, la pierre devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9e \"\u00e0 la demande du dit Hector Bouchard\".\nDe l'avis de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, 4 l'action \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e en tant qu'il y allait du prix m\u00eame de la pierre d\u00e9j\u00e0 livr\u00e9e, puisque l'appelant avait poursuivi sans attendre que cette pierre fut mesur\u00e9e comme elle devait l'\u00eatre; et, quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation avec dommages, sa demande \u00e9tait non fond\u00e9e puisque l'appelant s'\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 en face d'une suspension temporaire \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait tenu et \u00e0 laquelle il s'\u00e9tait implicitement soumis.\nMessieurs les Juges Marchand et McDougall d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent qu'ils s'accordaient avec le Juge en Chef de la province pour l'admission des motifs ci-dessus de confirmer le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nM. le Juge Bissonnette interpr\u00e9ta la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9 comme reposant sur le cas fortuit ou la force majeure, de sorte que le litige devait se restreindre \u00e0 l'application de l'article 1202 du code civil:\n1202. Lorsque l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation de faire une chose est devenue impossible sans le fait ou la faute du d\u00e9biteur, et avant qu'il soit en demeure, l'obligation est \u00e9teinte, et les deux parties sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9es; mais si l'obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en partie au profit du cr\u00e9ancier, ce dernier est oblig\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence du profit qu'il en re\u00e7oit.\nIl consid\u00e9ra la lettre de l'intim\u00e9 en date du 28 septembre 1946 comme \"plus significative que n'aurait pu faire toute sommation ou notification.\" D\u00e8s lors, le droit de l'appelant \u00e0 demander l'annulation du contrat et le paiement du profit qu'en a retir\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait n\u00e9, actuel et recevable.\nD'apr\u00e8s lui, il \u00e9tait nettement prouv\u00e9 que l'ing\u00e9nieur du Minist\u00e8re des Travaux Publics avait estim\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 minimum de pierre charroy\u00e9e par le sous-traitant de l'appelant pour le compte de l'intim\u00e9; il avait fait deux mesurages: celui du 6 septembre 1946, indiquant environ 170 verges cubes, et, apr\u00e8s l'institution de l'action, il avait trouv\u00e9 au printemps de 1947, 182 verges cubes.\nLe savant juge estimait donc que l'appelant avait le droit de faire constater l'extinction de l'obligation et de recouvrer la partie du contrat qu'il avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9, en refusant les livraisons de pierre et en ajoutant qu'il ne les reprendrait qu'en avril 1947, rendait pour l'appelant l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat impossible, puisque les parties avaient admis, au cours de l'instruction, que nulle livraison ne pouvait, \u00e0 cause de l'intemp\u00e9rie de la saison, se faire durant les mois d'avril, mai et juin 1947.\nPar suite, il ne pouvait trouver aucune justification juridique quelconque pour s'opposer \u00e0 la demande d'annulation.\nPour M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9 \u00e9galement, la lettre du 28 septembre dispensait l'appelant de toute mise-en-demeure.\nIl se pourrait, dit-il, que la p\u00e9nurie du bois rendait impossible la construction des cages et leur placement \u00e0 l'endroit d\u00e9sign\u00e9, avant l'hiver, de sorte que les glaces les eussent emport\u00e9es, mais encore fallait-il qu'il prouve l'impossibilit\u00e9 de se procurer du bois en quantit\u00e9 suffisante. L'appelant ne s'en est nullement inform\u00e9 ni \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, ni \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, ni ailleurs. Il n'a nullement prouv\u00e9 qu'il ait fait la moindre d\u00e9marche pour obtenir ce bois, et rien ne laissait entendre dans la preuve que l'on ne pouvait se procurer, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de Douglas Fir, les autres sortes de bois (pine and spruce) pr\u00e9vus par le contrat.\nIl est vrai que l'on avait montr\u00e9 le contrat du Gouvernement \u00e0 l'appelant et qu'il reconnaissait avoir pris connaissance des clauses qui pouvaient l'int\u00e9resser; mais il ressort pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de ces clauses que si l'appelant ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 tranporter toute la pierre requise dans le cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l'automne de 1946, il se serait expos\u00e9 \u00e0 de graves responsabilit\u00e9s, car la preuve \u00e9tablit clairement qu'entre d\u00e9cembre et le mois de juin 1947, le charroyage de la pierre dans la r\u00e9gion \u00e9tait impossible.\nLa cause de la suspension des travaux que l'intim\u00e9 a invoqu\u00e9e: l'impossibilit\u00e9 de se procurer du bois, n'est nullement \u00e9tablie, et l'intervention du Ministre ou de l'autorit\u00e9 publique n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9e.\nMonsieur le Juge Gagn\u00e9 s'accorde donc avec Monsieur le Juge Bissonnette pour \u00eatre d'avis que l'appelant avait droit \u00e0 l'annulation du contrat par lequel il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir la pierre requise pour le quai de St-Sim\u00e9on.\nIl croit que l'appelant a \u00e9galement droit au paiement de la pierre livr\u00e9e. L'intim\u00e9 s'y opposait en invoquant la clause du sous-contrat que le paiement ne devait \u00eatre fait que suivant les estim\u00e9s des ing\u00e9nieurs; qu'il n'y avait pas eu d'estim\u00e9s avant l'action. Mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 Loignon avait mesur\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 de pierre livr\u00e9e d\u00e8s le mois de septembre, et il avait trouv\u00e9 170 verges. Au printemps suivant, il d\u00e9clarait avoir trouv\u00e9 182 verges dans les caissons. L'appelant aurait donc le droit de r\u00e9clamer le paiement qu'il en demandait, soit $318.50. Mais, d'autre part, il n'a pas \u00e9tabli les pr\u00e9tendus dommages qu'il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, et M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9 d\u00e9clare se dispenser d'exprimer une opinion sur l'existence en sa faveur d'un droit \u00e0 des dommages.\nLe sous-contrat entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentait sans doute quelques difficult\u00e9s d'interpr\u00e9tation, parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par deux parties qui n'\u00e9taient pas au courant de la loi et qui, par surcro\u00eet, n'avaient \u00e9videmment qu'une notion plut\u00f4t imparfaite de l'orthographe et de la r\u00e9daction. Je ne crois pas cependant que l'on puisse arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelant \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 toutes les conditions du contrat principal. L'on peut dire que cela \u00e9tait quant \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 de pierre qu'il devait livrer, \u00e9galement quant \u00e0 l'acceptation de cette pierre par les ing\u00e9nieurs du D\u00e9partement; \u00e9galement quant aux d\u00e9lais dans lesquels cette pierre devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne \"pas retarder les travaux\". Cela impliquait qu'il avait pris connaissance de la clause du contrat principal fixant la date de l'ach\u00e8vement de ces travaux du quai.\nLes mots: \"\u00e0 la demande du dit Hector Bouchard\" sont ceux qui pr\u00e9sentent le plus d'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, parce qu'ils n'indiquent pas d'une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s claire \u00e0 quelle partie du sous-contrat ils s'appliquent. L'interpr\u00e9tation la plus vraisemblable serait celle que la pierre devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne pas retarder les travaux, suivant la demande qu'en ferait l'intim\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 la clause qui fut ajout\u00e9e apr\u00e8s coup, il est difficile de ne pas en conclure que l'intim\u00e9 (\"contracteur du quai\") avait la libert\u00e9 de faire mettre une quantit\u00e9 de pierre \u00e0 terre sur le quai. Mais, comme le dit le Juge en Chef dans ses notes en Cour d'Appel, c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une clause en faveur de l'intim\u00e9. La seule cons\u00e9quence \u00e9tait que s'il demandait \u00e0 l'appelant de livrer une certaine quantit\u00e9 de pierre sur le quai, il lui incombait \u00e9galement de la placer dans les cages \u00e0 ses frais. En plus, l'admission de l'appelant qu'il prit connaissance du contrat principal avant de signer, est limit\u00e9e par la fa\u00e7on dont la question lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e.\nIl a r\u00e9pondu oui \u00e0 cette question qui \u00e9tait dans les termes suivants: \"Vous avez pris connaissance avant le 15 mai de ce contrat et des clauses, du moins celles qui vous int\u00e9ressent comme sous-contracteur?\" L'on ne peut en d\u00e9duire plus que la question comporte, et cela veut donc dire que l'appelant n'avait pris connaissance que des clauses qui pouvaient l'int\u00e9resser.\nCe serait sans doute exiger beaucoup de l'appelant, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 l'instruction sommaire que laisse entrevoir son t\u00e9moignage, ainsi que le sous-contrat qu'il a r\u00e9dig\u00e9, que de d\u00e9duire de sa r\u00e9ponse qu'il aurait pu comprendre toute la port\u00e9e du contrat principal, m\u00eame en en prenant une certaine connaissance. L'enqu\u00eate n'a pas pouss\u00e9 l'investigation plus loin. L'appelant s'est content\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre oui \u00e0 la question reproduite plus haut, et la preuve qu'on pourrait en tirer s'en est arr\u00eat\u00e9e l\u00e0. L'on ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 si, pour prendre connaissance de ce contrat, il s'\u00e9tait fait aider de quelqu'un. En plus, ce contrat est tr\u00e8s long; il occupe 38 pages du case et il est en anglais. Il doit forc\u00e9ment rester un doute s\u00e9rieux sur la question de savoir si, m\u00eame en en prenant connaissance, l'appelant a pu se rendre compte des obligations que comportait ce contrat.\nJe ne puis, pour ma part, en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il ait entendu se soumettre aux termes de ce contrat en connaissance de cause. Il a pu comprendre que la date de l'ach\u00e8vement du quai \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e et qu'il \u00e9tait tenu de fournir la pierre dont l'intim\u00e9 aurait besoin pour la construction de ce quai, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas retarder les travaux. Mais m\u00eame \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard il pouvait s'en rapporter \u00e0 la demande qu'en ferait l'intim\u00e9. Ce ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas trop \u00e9largir le sens du sous-contrat que de dire qu'il pouvait se fier \u00e0 cette demande de l'intim\u00e9, et que si, par suite du d\u00e9faut d'une demande, les livraisons de l'appelant eussent retard\u00e9 les travaux, il eut pu objecter qu'il s'\u00e9tait content\u00e9 d'attendre la demande de l'intim\u00e9.\nBref, je crois que ce serait voir la situation d'une fa\u00e7on beaucoup trop lourde pour l'appelant que de lui imposer le retard, le d\u00e9lai ou la suspension que le Ministre s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit d'accorder en vertu de l'article 47 du contrat principal.\nJe suis d'avis que l'on doit tenir pour acquis que l'appelant n'a pas eu connaissance de cette clause et que, cons\u00e9quemment, son sous-contrat n'y a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 subordonn\u00e9.\nIl reste en plus que, comme le fait remarquer M. le Juge Gagn\u00e9 dans ses notes, l'intervention du Ministre ou de l'autorit\u00e9 publique n'est pas invoqu\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9fense de l'intim\u00e9. Elle se contente, d'all\u00e9guer que le bois qu'il attendait, et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu de Vancouver par l'entremise du Ministre des Travaux Publics, n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 vers le 15 ao\u00fbt 1946, ni m\u00eame \u00e0 la date de l'institution de l'action, et qu'il s'en est suivi que les cages en bois n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 construites \u00e0 raison de cette cause qui \u00e9tait en dehors de son contr\u00f4le. Mais le D\u00e9partement des Travaux Publics qui avait bien offert ses bons offices pour obtenir ce bois pour l'appelant, n'y \u00e9tait pas tenu par le contrat principal; et, de plus, cette excuse de l'appelant ne s'adressait qu'au bois connu sous le nom de \"Douglas Fir\". Il se peut que ce dernier bois ne pouvait venir que de la Colombie-Britannique, mais le contrat stipulait que les travaux pouvaient \u00e9galement employer d'autres bois: \"pine or spruce\". Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en preuve que l'intim\u00e9 n'aurait pu se procurer ces deux autres bois. Il n'a fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour se les procurer. En les employant, il aurait pu satisfaire aux exigences de son contrat de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'en employant du Douglas Fir. Il s'en suit que l'excuse qu'il a donn\u00e9e pour expliquer la suspension de ses travaux n'\u00e9tait pas valable \u00e0 raison du contrat principal qu'il avait sign\u00e9. Il ne peut donc pas demander \u00e0 l'appelant d'accepter une pareille excuse pour lui-m\u00eame. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9tabli que l'ex\u00e9cution de son obligation \u00e9tait devenue impossible sans son fait ou sa faute.\nC'\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui qu'incombait la preuve que cette ex\u00e9cution \u00e9tait devenue impossible. Pour y r\u00e9ussir et invoquer l'article 1202 du code civil, il eut fallu qu'il prouv\u00e2t que, en plus, il n'avait pas pu se procurer du \"pine\" ou du \"spruce\". Il ne l'a pas fait. L'on ne peut donc en venir \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 satisfaire la Cour qu'il s'est trouv\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 absolue d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation. Or, c'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 ce qu'il devait prouver s'il voulait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'article 1202 du code civil. Sur ce point, la loi et la doctrine sont bien claires. Pour invoquer l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation, celui qui veut s'en pr\u00e9valoir est tenu d'\u00e9tablir l'existence d'une impossibilit\u00e9 absolue; et non seulement d'une impossibilit\u00e9 pour lui-m\u00eame, mais d'une impossibilit\u00e9 qui affecte toute autre personne.\nCette Cour en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ainsi dans la cause de Rivet v. La Corporation du Village de St-Joseph 5. Au cours de ce jugement elle a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la doctrine telle qu'elle est expos\u00e9e par Mourlon, Marcad\u00e9, Pothier et Laurent, et \u00e0 ce qu'exprime Mignault, vol. 5, p. 671. Une partie du jug\u00e9 du rapport re Rivet se lit comme suit:\nWhile articles 1200 and 1202 C.C. enact that, when the performance of an obligation to do has become impossible, the obligation is extinguished and both parties are liberated, in order that such a rule may be applied, it is not sufficient to establish that the performance would be extremely difficult, but it must be shown that it is absolutely impossible, i.e., that there exists an insurmontable obstacle which could not be foreseen.\nL'intim\u00e9 a donc failli dans la t\u00e2che qu'il avait de prouver l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cution requise en vertu de l'article 1202 du code civil pour se lib\u00e9rer de ses obligations envers l'appelant. Ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 d'accepter la condition que le contrat serait suspendu jusqu'au mois d'avril 1947 avec, en plus, tel qu'\u00e9tabli par la preuve, qu'en ce qui le concernait, cela reportait sa possibilit\u00e9 de charroyer la pierre au moins jusqu'au mois de juin 1947, vu que, avant cela, il \u00e9tait admis que ce charroyage \u00e9tait impossible durant les mois ant\u00e9rieurs. La lettre du 28 septembre 1946 disait clairement que l'intim\u00e9 ne continuerait pas ses travaux avant le printemps de 1947 et que, dans l'intervalle, il n'accepterait de pierre ni de lui ni de son sous-traitant Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay. Il n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 d'accepter ces conditions et l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il avait des raisons valables et l\u00e9gales pour se lib\u00e9rer des obligations qui r\u00e9sultaient du contrat qu'il avait pass\u00e9 avec l'appelant.\nL'appelant avait donc le droit de traiter le contrat comme enfreint par l'intim\u00e9; Dupr\u00e9 Quarries Ltd. v. Arthur Dupr\u00e9 6; il eut pu intenter son action imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre du 28 septembre 1946. Il ne l'a fait qu'au mois de mars 1947, mais l'on ne saurait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider que ce d\u00e9lai constituait un acquiescement \u00e0 la suspension des travaux que voulait lui imposer l'intim\u00e9. Son action devait donc \u00eatre maintenue et le contrat intervenu entre les parties le 16 mai 1946, devait \u00eatre annul\u00e9. Il avait \u00e9galement le droit de r\u00e9clamer le montant de $318.50 pour le prix de la pierre qu'il avait livr\u00e9e jusque-l\u00e0. Les deux juges dissidents en appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9tabli le montant de dommages qu'il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en plus, et je ne vois pas de raison d'en venir \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de la leur. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, l'appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il se r\u00e9servait \"tous ses recours ult\u00e9rieurs pour dommages lorsque ceux-ci pourront \u00eatre liquid\u00e9s\". Les juges dissidents dans la Cour du Banc du Roi ont pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 se dispenser d'exprimer une opinion sur l'existence en sa faveur d'un droit \u00e0 des dommages. Il est \u00e9vident que, comme eux, je n'entreprendrais pas non plus d'exprimer une opinion l\u00e0-dessus, mais l'appelant a demand\u00e9 que nous ins\u00e9rions dans notre jugement cette r\u00e9serve qu'il a exprim\u00e9e dans ses conclusions. Il a sembl\u00e9, \u00e0 l'audition, qu'il n'y aurait pas d'objection \u00e0 faire cette insertion pourvu qu'elle f\u00fbt r\u00e9dig\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les droits de l'intim\u00e9 sur ce point. Cette Cour a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu l'occasion de faire l'examen de cette question dans la cause de The City of Montreal v. McGee 7, o\u00f9 il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, dans une action de ce genre, o\u00f9 il n'y a qu'une cause d'action, les dommages doivent \u00eatre estim\u00e9s une fois pour toutes, et que, lorsque les dommages ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s, aucune nouvelle action ne peut \u00eatre maintenue pour des dommages ult\u00e9rieurs, m\u00eame r\u00e9sultant d'une fa\u00e7on impr\u00e9vue de la cause originaire.\nJe me contente pour le moment de signaler que la r\u00e9serve que nous a demand\u00e9e l'appelant ne peut d\u00e8s lors \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une admission qu'il peut encore r\u00e9clamer les dommages qu'il s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de demander plus tard. Dans les conclusions de son action, il est ins\u00e9r\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation pour certains dommages, que les juges dissidents en appel lui ont refus\u00e9s, et que le pr\u00e9sent jugement ne lui accorde pas. Il ne faudrait donc pas que la r\u00e9serve ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans notre jugement puisse \u00eatre regard\u00e9e comme une reconnaissance de ses droits sur ce point.\nLe jugement de cette Cour lui r\u00e9servant ce recours, doit, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00eatre entendu comme n'impliquant aucune opinion sur la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant qu'il a subi d'autres dommages que ceux qu'il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9s dans l'action actuelle, ou, apr\u00e8s avoir institu\u00e9 cette action, qu'il puisse encore r\u00e9clamer dans l'avenir des dommages qui, d'apr\u00e8s lui, n'\u00e9taient pas encore liquid\u00e9s au moment de l'institution de l'action. Dans cette r\u00e9serve, il devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, sous ce rapport, l'intim\u00e9 conserve absolument tous ses droits de d\u00e9fense.\nTaschereau, J. (dissenting) : Malgr\u00e9 une r\u00e9daction qui laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, les droits et obligations des deux parties, qui r\u00e9sultent du contrat intervenu le 15 mai 1946, me paraissent clairs. Le contrat se lit de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nLa Malbaie, 15 mai 1946.\nContrat:\nJe soussign\u00e9 m'engage \u00e0 faire pour Hector Bouchard \u00e0 savoir lui livrer une certaine quantit\u00e9 de pierre. Le dit John Tremblay s'engage \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 Hector Bouc hard toute la pierre qu'il aura besoin pour la construction du quai de St-Sim\u00e9on. Cette pierre sera rendu sur le quai en place. La pierre devra \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieurs du d\u00e9partement et elle devra \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne pas retarder les travaux. A la demande du dit Hector Bouchard. Le dit Hector Bouchard paiera au dit John Tremblay la somme de $1.75 la verge cube. Le paiement sera fait suivant les estim\u00e9s des ing\u00e9nieurs. Le dit John Tremblay fournira tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour ex\u00e9cuter le contrat.\nEt nous avons sign\u00e9s.\nIl est entendu que le contracteur du quai en fera mettre une cantit\u00e9e qui luis fodras a ter et il la rendras e sest frais.\nHector Bouchard\nJohn Tremblay.\nL'intim\u00e9 avait le 22 avril 1946, pass\u00e9 avec le Gouvernement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral un contrat en vertu duquel il s'engageait pour la somme de $182,368 \u00e0 faire certaines r\u00e9parations au quai de St-Sim\u00e9on, comt\u00e9 de Chalevoix (P.Q.). Les travaux devaient \u00eatre termin\u00e9s le 20 juin 1947, et c'est afin d'obtenir la pierre n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat que l'intim\u00e9 a sign\u00e9 avec l'appelant la convention ci-dessus.\nEn vertu des termes de cet \u00e9crit, l'appelant s'oblige \u00e0 d\u00e9livrer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 toute la pierre dont ce dernier aura besoin pour la construction du quai, et il s'oblige de la livrer \u00e0 la demande du contracteur principal, sur le quai \"en place\".\nL'intim\u00e9 devait fournir tout le bois n\u00e9cessaire, suivant les sp\u00e9cifications, mais il est arriv\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment qu'\u00e0 cause de la raret\u00e9 du bois, l'intim\u00e9, contracteur principal, a obtenu du Gouvernement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral un d\u00e9lai jusqu'au printemps suivant pour terminer ses travaux.\nL'appelant, press\u00e9 par un sous-contracteur du nom de Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, de qui il achetait la pierre en question, communiqua avec l'intim\u00e9 le 24 septembre 1946, pour lui demander d'accepter livraison d'une \"bonne quantit\u00e9 de pierre\" sur le quai. A cette date, les caissons o\u00f9 la pierre devait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e n'\u00e9taient pas construits, \u00e0 cause du manque de bois, et en cons\u00e9quence, l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas encore besoin de cette pierre. L'appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ces faits, il savait que le d\u00e9lai pour la confection des travaux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendu au mois d'avril 1948, et il en fut de nouveau avis\u00e9 par lettre en date du 28 septembre. Le 4 mars 1947, l'appelant institua une action contre le d\u00e9fendeur, dans laquelle il demande que le contrat du 16 mai 1946 soit annul\u00e9, et o\u00f9 il r\u00e9clame \u00e9galement la somme de $708.41. Cette action fut rejet\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel, 8 les honorables Juges Bissonnette et Gagn\u00e9 dissidents.\nJe suis d'opinion que ces jugements doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s et que l'action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nL'appelant connaissait les principaux termes du contrat entre l'intim\u00e9 et le Gouvernement F\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il savait en cons\u00e9quence que les travaux devaient \u00eatre termin\u00e9s le 20 juin 1947, mais la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e9galement qu'il savait aussi que ce terme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 au mois d'avril 1948, \u00e0 cause du manque de bois requis pour la construction des caissons. A la date de la mise en demeure du 24 septembre 1946, l'intim\u00e9 n'avait donc pas besoin de pierre sur le quai de St-Sim\u00e9on, et il avait le droit, en s'autorisant des termes m\u00eames du contrat, de refuser d'en accepter. C'est \"\u00e0 la demande dudit Hector Bouchard\", l'intim\u00e9, que la pierre doit \u00eatre livr\u00e9e, et non pas quand il pourrait plaire \u00e0 l'appelant de le faire. On comprend facilement pourquoi cette clause a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise dans le contrat. L'intim\u00e9, contracteur principal, pouvait \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 des \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s impr\u00e9visibles, \u00e0 des contingences sur lesquelles il ne pouvait exercer aucun contr\u00f4le; il est sage qu'il ait stipul\u00e9 que la pierre serait livr\u00e9e \u00e0 sa demande, c'est-\u00e0-dire quand il en aurait besoin. C'est ce droit qu'il a exerc\u00e9 dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, et je ne vois rien qui puisse me justifier de l'en emp\u00eacher. Il n'a pas refus\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement la pierre; il ne s'est pas object\u00e9 \u00e0 remplir les obligations que son contrat lui impose; il a simplement retard\u00e9 la date de la livraison, comme il s'en \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit.\n\u00c9videmment, il ne pourrait pas abuser de son droit, et retarder ind\u00e9finiment la livraison de la marchandise. La r\u00e8gle est bien \u00e9tablie que dans des cas semblables, l'acheteur doit signifier la date de la livraison dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances. Quelques autorit\u00e9s suffiront pour appuyer ce principe. Vide: Ford v. Cotesworth 9 :\nWhenever a party to a contract undertakes to do some particular act, the performance of which depends entirely on himself, so that he may choose his own mode of fulfilling his undertaking, and the contract is silent as to time, the law implies a contract to do it within a reasonable time under the circumstances.\nDans Ellis v. Thompson 10, Alderson, B. dit:\nThe correct mode of ascertaining what reasonable time is in such a case is by placing the Court and Jury in the same situation as the contracting parties themselves were in at the time they made the contract; that is to say, by placing before the jury all those circumstances which were known to both .parties at the time the contract was made and under which the contract toot place. By so doing you enable the Court and Jury to form a safer conclusion as to what is the reasonable time which the law implies and within which the contract is to be performed.\nLeake \"on contracts\" \u00e0 la page 200, s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nUnder a written contract for the sale of goods appointing the time for payment, but silent as to the time for delivery; and, therefore, presumptively importing delivery within a reasonable time upon credit, evidence was held admissible of a usage in the trade, that the delivery should be made concurrently with the payment and could not be demanded before. Et dans Chapman v. Larin 11, commentant les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus, l'honorable Juge Ritchie s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nAnd I can discover nothing in the law of the Province of Quebec at variance with these principles, which, after all, are only the principles of common law and common justice.\nJe suis clairement d'opinion que les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause justifiaient l'intim\u00e9 de retarder la date de la livraison de la pierre, et d'informer l'appelant comme il l'a fait dans sa lettre du 28 septembre: \"Quand je serai pr\u00eat \u00e0 la recevoir, je vous avertirai assez d'avance\". Il affirmait un droit que le contrat lui conf\u00e9rait. Je ne crois pas que l'article 1202 C.C. qui d\u00e9termine dans quelles circonstances les parties sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9es de leurs obligations respectives, quand il y a impossibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cution, trouve dans l'occurrence son application. L'intim\u00e9 doit r\u00e9ussir non pas parce qu'il y a impossibilit\u00e9 pour lui d'accepter livraison de la pierre, mais bien parce qu'il a le droit par les termes m\u00eames de son contrat, d'en retarder temporairement la livraison.\nPour cette raison, je suis d'avis que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKellock, J.: The action out of which this appeal arises was brought for the annulment of a contract for the supply by the appellant to the respondent of certain stone, required by the latter for the building of a dock under a contract with the Dominion government dated 22nd April, 1946. The government contract provided that:\u2014\nThe new cribs shall be built early enough so as to be in readiness to be sunk on the 1st of September and their construction to be continued without interruption as to have them completed on or before 1st December, 1946.\nThe sub-contract between the parties is dated the 15th of May, 1946, and is as follows:\u2014\nLa Malbaie, 15 mai 1946.\nContrat:\nJe soussign\u00e9 m'engage \u00e0 faire pour Hector Bouchard \u00e0 savoir \u00e0 lui livrer une certaine quantit\u00e9 de pierre. Le dit John Tremblay s'engage \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 Hector Bouchard tout la pierre qu'il aura besoin pour la construction du quai de St-Sim\u00e9on. Cette pierre sera rendu sur le quai en place. La pierre devra \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par les ing\u00e9nieurs du d\u00e9partement et elle devra \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne pas retarder les travaux. A la demande du dit Hector Bouchard. Le dit Hector Bouchard paiera au dit John Tremblay la somme de $1.75 la verge cube. Le paiement sera fait suivant les estim\u00e9s des ing\u00e9nieurs. Le dit John Tremblay fournira tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour ex\u00e9cuter le contrat.\nEt nous avons sign\u00e9s.\nIl est entendu que le contracteur du quai an fera mettre un cantit\u00e9e qui luis fodras a ter et il la rendras e sest frais.\nHector Bouchard\nJohn Tremblay.\nUnder the terms of the main contract the respondent was obliged to furnish all the material, including timber, required for its execution and it was by reason of the fact that sufficient timber was not forthcoming that the difficulty between the parties arose. With respect to the timber, although it appears that the government arranged for the purchase of some Douglas fir, the respondent in his factum says \"that at the time of the signing of the contract between himself and the appellant, i.e., on the 15th of May, 1946, although he hoped the Department would supply this wood on time to enable him to meet the schedule laid down in the main contract by the department, he had no assurance that this wood would be supplied on time to enable him to do so\". It is not suggested that this situation was explained to the appellant.\nSome time before the 15th of August the respondent realized that this arrangement for the supply of timber had fallen down and that he did not have and would not have the timber necessary for the cribs to enable him to have them built in the fall of 1946 as required by the government contract. He therefore approached the government and obtained a suspension of time for the completion of this work until the following spring. Provision was made in the terms of the government contract by which the Minister of Public Works might enlarge the time for the performance of any work called for by the contract.\nIn the meantime the appellant had arranged with one, Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, to supply the necessary stone and the appellant had gone to some outlay himself in preparation for the carrying out of his contract. When the respondent made his arrangement with the government for a suspension of the work, he advised Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay not to make any deliveries. Following this, on the 17th of August, Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay wrote the appellant advising him of this situation and stating that in default of receiving delivery instructions from the appellant, it would be probably impossible for him to carry out his contract and he would hold the appellant liable in damages.\nNothing further appears to have transpired until the 24th of September, 1946, when the appellant wrote the respondent. With this letter there was enclosed a copy of Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay's letter of the 17th of August. As something depends upon the construction of the appellant's letter I reproduce it in full:\nSt-Sim\u00e9on, 24 septembre 1946.\nM. Hector Bouchard, Conct.,\nLa Malbaie, P.Q.\nCher Monsieur:\nJe vous envoie sous ce pli une copie d'une mise-en-demeure par le sous-contracteur Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, alors comme vous savez cela ne fait pas mon affaire car j'ai fait une d\u00e9pense d'environ $600.00 pour l'organisation de l'ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat, pour le charroyage d'ici au mois de novembre prochain.\nDonc si c'est possible je pourrais faire charroyer une bonne quantit\u00e9 de cette pierre sur le quai, imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les bateaux arr\u00eatt\u00e8s.\nEsp\u00e9rant vous lire \u00e0 ce sujet par prochain courrier.\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\nJohn Tremblay,\nPar\nTo this the respondent replied on the 28th of September. The letter is as follows:\u2014\nMon. John Tremblay,\nContracteur,\nSt-Sim\u00e9on.\nCher Monsieur:\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre, je dois vous dire que vous n'\u00eates pas s\u00e9rieux quand vous me demandez s'il serait possible de mettre une bonne quantit\u00e9 de pierre sur le quai, quand vous savez qu'il faut l'espace du quai pour faire les travaux et comme vous savez que les travaux du quai sont suspendus, pour d'ici au mois d'avril, faute de manque de mat\u00e9riaux, je vous avais demand\u00e9 de me charroyer environ 60 vgs. et \u00e0 mon absence d'apr\u00e8s votre compte, vous en avez mis sur le quai 220 vgs. que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de mouver et j'ai pay\u00e9 pour cela M. Tremblay.\nPour aucune consid\u00e9ration je ne vous permettrai \u00e0 mettre une vge. de pierre \u00e0 terre ou sur le quai.\nQuand je serai pr\u00eat \u00e0 la recevoir je vous avertirai assez d'avance. Aux sujets des dommages que votre sous-contracteur et vos hommes sont \u00e0 lien faire, il y a trois semaines je lui ai offert et \u00e0 vous aussi le d\u00e9chargement de mon bois et vous et votre sous-contraeteur l'avez refus\u00e9, me disant que vous avez pas le temps. Je crois que vous n'\u00eates pas s\u00e9rieux. Encore.\nBien \u00e0 vous,\nHector Bouchard. The majority in the Court of Appeal 12 took the view that the appellant was bound by the terms of the government contract and, accordingly, was bound to acquiesce in the extension of the time granted by the government and to deliver the stone as required within the period so extended.\nThe appellant gave evidence that before executing the sub-contract he knew \"de ce contrat et des clauses, du moins celles qui vous int\u00e9ressent comme sous-contracteur\". He contends, however, that the contract between himself and the respondent did not bind him to extensions which might be granted by the government, and in any event, not to an extension brought about by the default of the respondent himself. Appellant contends accordingly that the letter of the 28th of September, 1946, was a repudiation of the obligations of the respondent under the contract which entitled him to sue for damages.\nIn my opinion the effect of the contract of May 15, 1946, was not to render the appellant liable to all the terms of the head contract. I think the effect of the sub-contract was to fix the quantity of stone to be delivered by the appellant, but that so far as time for performance was concerned, what was contemplated by the parties and accepted as the basis of the sub-contract, was the time fixed by the main contract for the completion of the cribs, namely, between the first of September and the first of December, 1946. In my opinion the wording of the contract that the stone \"devra \u00eatre livr\u00e9e pour ne pas retarder les travaux. A la demande du dit Hector Bouchard\" means that the stone was to be delivered within the period September first to December first, and that the appellant was to be at all times ready within that period to make delivery as and when required by the respondent so as not to delay the work in connection with the cribs during that period. I do not find anything in this language or anywhere else in the sub-contract which expressly or impliedly includes in it any term by which the appellant was bound, notwithstanding any suspension, however long, which might be arranged between the respondent and the government, to continue to hold himself liable to make delivery. I think therefore that, subject to the contention next to be men- tioned, the respondent was guilty of a breach of contract in taking the position that he would not permit the appellant to deliver until the respondent called for stone in the spring of 1947.\nIt is further contended on behalf of the respondent that in his letter of the 24th of September, 1946, the appellant did not take the position that the contract was at an end by reason of the communication made by the respondent to Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay, but that the letter proceeds upon the view that the sub-contract was still subsisting and that the appellant was acquiescing in the suspension. If this contention were sound, there would be much to be said for the view that when the respondent by his letter of the 28th of September, 1946, declined to accede to the appellant's request contained in the letter of the 24th of September, the respondent was entitled to assume that thereafter the appellant was acquiescing in the situation, as no reply was made by the appellant to the last mentioned letter. I think, however, that there is nothing in the letter of the 24th of September which bears out the respondent's contention, but on the contrary, the appellant expressly says in reference to the communication he had received from Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay that the situation, resulting from the respondent's refusal to allow Eug\u00e8ne Tremblay to deliver stone, did not suit him because he had gone to considerable expense to arrange for the transportation of the stone called for by the sub-contract in the period ending with the following November. I think therefore the letter indicates that the appellant was standing on his rights under his contract and that when the respondent reiterated his repudiation on the 28th of September by asserting that the work would not proceed until the following April, the appellant was entitled to sue for damages for breach after the expiration of the time of performance provided by the sub-contract. While the respondent may have been entitled subsequent to the 28th of September to change his mind and call for delivery of the stone, provided he did so within a reasonable time so as to permit of the stone being delivered within the period contemplated by the parties, he did not do so and I see nothing, even although it were alleged, and it is not alleged, upon which the respondent can rely to assert that the appellant led him to believe that he was acquiescing in any extension of time for the performance of the contract. In my opinion therefore, the appellant is entitled to succeed in his claim with respect to annulment.\nSome time prior to the 24th of September, 1946, stone to the value of $385.00 had been delivered and I think the appellant is entitled to this also. Counsel for the appellant indicated on the argument that with respect to damages by reason of the refusal of the respondent to accept delivery of any further stone he was not in a position to ask in the present proceedings to have those damages assessed as he did not know the quantity of stone required to complete the contract. He asked for a reserve of rights with respect to such damages. The respondent indicated that if a further action were taken to recover such damages he would desire to contend that the appellant ought to have had his right to damages determined once and for all in the present action. Both parties concur in the view that any reserve should not be framed so as to take away from the appellant rights, if any, which he may have outside the present action or, on the other hand, to take away from the respondent any defence to such an action. I think therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and that there should be a declaration that this judgment is without prejudice to such rights, if any, as the appellant may have to sue for damages for which he did not claim in this action, and without prejudice also, to any right which the respondent may have to contend that all rights of action on the part of the appellant by reason of the breach by the respondent of the contract between the parties were capable of being asserted only in the present action and are therefore barred by the present judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henri D'Auteuil.\nSolicitor for the respondent: St-Laurent, Taschereau, St-Laurent & No\u00ebl.\n1 Q.R.

These 1,800 Shares were then converted into 1,800 preferred shares of a par value of $40 each and 1,800 common shares of a par value of $4 each. The Minister of National Revenue, treating the readjustment as effecting a capitalization of income, assessed a tax on appellant, as shareholder of the company, in respect of his share of that income received through the capitalization.\nHeld, The Chief Justice and Kellock J. dissenting, that the readjustment of the company's capital stock resulted in the undistributed income being capitalized within the meaning of sec. 15 of the Income War Tax Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, O'Connor J., affirming the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming an assessment made under the Income War Tax Act.\nHazen Hansard K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn Ahem K.C. and T. Z. Boles K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014The appellant filed an Income Tax Return showing his income for the year ended 31st December, 1938. He received a Notice of Assessment upon that return on the 26th of October, 1942.\nHe lodged with the Minister of National Revenue a Notice of Appeal dated the 20th of November, 1942, in which objection was taken to the assessed tax for the reasons therein set forth.\nThe respondent affirmed the assessment on the ground that in 1938 the appellant owned 518 shares of Domestic Gas Appliances Limited which were reduced or redeemed in that year within the meaning of Subsection 1 of Section 16 of the Act, and therefore the appellant was deemed to have received a dividend according to the provisions of that subsection.\nNotice of the decision of the Minister was given to the appellant pursuant to Section 59 of the Act, wherein it was stated that the decision was based on the facts presently before the Minister.\nOn the 12th of February 1945, a Notice of Dissatisfaction was filed by the appellant through his solicitors, stating that the appellant desired his appeal to be set down for trial.\nThe effect of the decision of the Minister was that a tax in the sum of $6,887.64 should be levied upon the appellant in respect of his income for the year 1938, said sum including an additional tax of $2,288.06 and $587.78 for interest arising out of the addition made by the Notice of Assessment to the income of the appellant.\nIn the Notice of Dissatisfaction the reasons in support of the appeal are stated as being:\nThe appellant was the owner of 518 shares of the par value of $100 each of Domestic Gas Appliances Limited (hereinafter referred to as the \"Company\") of which 1,800 shares were outstanding and fully paid and non-assessable.\nBy Supplementary Letters Patent dated 3rd June, 1938, granted to the Company under the Dominion Companies' Act, all these outstanding shares were converted into 1,800 preferred shares of a par value of $40 each and 1,800 common shares of a par value of $4.00 each, and the remaining paid up capital of the Company, which was then lost or unrepresented by available assets, was cancelled. Accordingly the appellant became the owner of 518 preferred shares of the par value of $40 each and 518 common shares of the par value of $4.00 each. Subsequently all of the outstanding preferred shares of the Company were redeemed and the redemption price paid, namely: par plus a premium of 1 per cent, there being no dividends declared prior to the redemption date and then remaining unpaid. As an incident to the redemption of all of the preferred shares, the Company made application for Supplementary Letters Patent reducing the capital stock of the Company by the cancellation of all of the 1,800 preferred shares of the par value of $40 each, and these Supplementary Letters Patent decreasing the capital stock were issued on October 8, 1938. In the decision of the Minister, it is said that the 518 shares of the Company owned by the appellant in 1938 were reduced or redeemed within the meaning of Subsection 1 of Section 16 of the Act.\nThe appellant contended that the subsection in question does not contain any definition of the words \"reduce\" or \"redeem\", nor is any to be found in the Income War Tax Act.\nThe operation whereby the appellant became the holder of 518 preferred shares was, according to him, merely a conversion of the 518 shares theretofore held by him. Nothing was bought back or recovered by the Company. That \"reduce\" or \"redeem\" is something different from \"convert\" may be seen by the fact that Subsection 1 of Section 16 was amended by Section 15, Chapter 14 of the Statutes of 1943-44 by the insertion therein of the words \"or converts any class of the capital 'stock or shares thereof into any other class of capital stock, shares or other security therefor\".\nA perusal of the Supplementary Letters Patent dated June 3, 1938, will, it is contended, show that the preferred shares thereby created, on being reduced or redeemed, were not entitled to participate in the assets of the Company beyond the amount paid up thereon (i.e. $40 per share) plus a fixed premium of 1 per cent of the par value and a defined rate of dividend of 5 per cent per annum.\nIt is clear that the preferred shares were of a class coming within the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 16; and it was alleged accordingly that Subsection 1 of Section 16 did not apply to the redemption of the preferred shares which were held by the appellant after issue of the Supplementary Letters Patent, and that, the appellant, upon such redemption, could not be deemed to have received a dividend under such subsection.\nThe conclusions of the Notice of Dissatisfaction were therefore, for those reasons, that the additional tax assessed, namely $2,288.06, and $587.78 for interest, was unlawfully imposed and should be cancelled and the assessment set aside. After the reply of the Minister to the Notice of Appeal, it was ordered that formal pleadings be filed in this cause. It was upon these pleadings that the appellant was tried before the Exchequer Court of Canada 2.\nThe allegation of the statement of defence filed by the respondent was that on June 3, 1938, the Company had on hand undistributed income in the amount of $38,091.61 or $21.15 for each of the original common shares, which undistributed income, as a result of the reduction or redemption, was deemed to be received by the shareholders of the Company, including the appellant herein, and became properly taxable pursuant to Subsection 1 of Section 16 of the Income War Tax Act. In the alternative, if the shares of the Company were not reduced or redeemed as aforesaid, in any case, as a result of the re-adjustment of the capital stock of the Company, in accordance with the Supplementary Letters Patent, the whole of the said undistributed income was capitalized and is therefore properly taxable in the hands of the shareholders of the Company, pursuant to Section 15 of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe respondent claimed therefore that, as of June 3, 1938, the appellant received an amount of $10,055.70, by way of the undistributed income of the Company, and was properly taxable thereon in the year 1938; that the assessment should therefore be affirmed and the appeal from the Minister's decision dismissed.\nFor the purposes of this case, the appellant admitted that on the 3rd day of June, 1938, the Company had an undistributed income in the amount of $38,091.61 mentioned in the Statement of Defence of the respondent.\nThe authorized capital of the Company was $200,000 divided into 2,000 shares of a par value of $100 each, of which, as of the 3rd of June 1938, 1800 had been issued as fully paid up.\nIncluded in the capital assets was an item of good will of $180,000. Between 1921 and 1937 there were several write-offs of goodwill, totalling $140,000, and each in turn was charged to surplus. This resulted in a reduction of capital from $180,000 to $40,000 and changed a surplus of $38,091.61 into a deficit of $101,908.39.\nThe Company's return for the year 1938 and the appellant's return for the same year were made accordingly; but it was only, as we were told, in the year 1941 that these write-offs of good will were disallowed by the Department. These disallowances resulted, from a taxation view point in the Company having undistributed income of $38,091.61. As result of the Supplementary Letters Patent dated the 3rd of June 1938, the authorized capital was decreased from $200,000 to $79,200.\n(a) By cancelling the 200 unissued shares of a par value of $100 each and\n(b) by cancelling paid-up capital to the extent of $56 per share upon each of the said 1800 issued shares and thereby reducing the par value of the said 1800 issued shares from $100 per share to $44 per share.\nThe Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June 1938 further authorized the Company to convert the 1,800 issued shares of the capital stock of the par value of $44 each into 1,800 preferred shares of a par value of $40 each, and 1,800 common shares of a par value of $4 each. They added that the authorized capital stock of the Company should be $79,200 divided into the above mentioned shares, \"subject to the increase of such capital stock under the provisions of the Companies' Act.\"\nThen, the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June deal with the rights, permits, privileges, limitations, terms and conditions which the preferred shares shall carry and be subject to.\nSubsequent Supplementary Letters Patent were issued on the 8th of October 1938. They recite that the operations authorized by the Supplementary Letters Patent dated the 3rd of June 1938 had been carried out, that the original Letters Patent incorporating the Company (30th December 1918), as amended by Supplementary Letters Patent granted on the 7th of February 1929, were amended and varied by adding thereto the private Companies' clauses and thereby converting the Company from a public Company into a private Company. Accordingly, these later Supplementary Letters Patent (8th October 1938) decree that the authorized capital stock of the Company shall be $7,200 divided into 1,800 issued common shares of the par value of $4 each \"subject to the increase of such capital stock under the provisions of the Companies' Act.\" In view of that fact, the decrease to that amount of capital stock was effected by the cancellation of the paid-up capital represented by the 1,800 issued preferred shares at a par value of $40 each, which had been redeemed.\nThe relevant sections of the Act are as follows:\u2014\n(15). When, as a result of the reorganization of a corporation, or the readjustment of its capital stock, the whole or any cart of its undistributed income is capitalized, the amount capitalized shall be deemed to be distributed as a dividend during the year in which the reorganization or readjustment takes place and the shareholders of the said corporation shall be deemed to receive such dividend in proportion to their interest in the capital stock of the corporation or in the class of capital stock affected.\n(16). Where a corporation having undistributed income on hand reduces or redeems any class of the capital stock or shares thereof, the amount received by any 'shareholders by virtue of the reduction shall, to the extent to which such shareholder would be entitled to participate in such undistributed income on a total distribution thereof at the time of such reduction, be deemed to be a dividend and to be income received by such shareholder.\n16 (2). The provisions of this section shall not apply to any class of stock which, by the instrument authorizing the issue of such class, is not entitled on being reduced or redeemed to participate in the assets of the corporation beyond the amount paid up thereon plus any fixed premium and a defined rate of dividend nor to a reduction of capital effected before the sixteenth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six.\nThe evidence showed that the undistributed income ($38,091.61) did not appear in either of the annual statements of the Company, that nothing was done with the undistributed income on the reduction and conversion, that the net assets behind the stock of the Company, as disclosed by the audited statement as of December 31, 1937, amounted to $75,000; and that there was no material change in the net assets behind the stock of the Company after the reduction and conversion of the 3rd of June, 1938, and prior to the redemption which took place on the 30th July 1938; that there was no reduction in the number of shares, but there was a reduction in the face value of $100,800; that all the shareholders received on the 3rd day of June, 1938, was a certificate for one preferred share of the par value of $40, and a certificate for one common share of the par value of $4 in exchange for a certificate of one common share of the par value of $100; that the new shares were issued as fully paid up.\nNo amount in money was paid to or received by the shareholders. The Assistant Chief Auditor, Corporation Assessor in the Montreal office of the respondent, explained that as the Company had written off goodwill in the amount of $140,000 between 1922 and 1937, leaving $40,000 out of the original capital of $180,000, the write-offs of goodwill, from a taxation standpoint, reduced the surplus in the books of the Company; but, as the write-offs were disallowed, that resulted in an undistributed income of $38,000 and that, in his opinion, the share capital reduced to $79,200 consisted of $40,000 being the balance left of the original capital plus the undistributed income of $38,091.61.\nThat opinion of the Assistant Chief Auditor, in my humble view, takes no account of the fact that if the write-offs were disallowed, it follows that the amount of those write-offs ($140,000), in the result, no longer reduced the original capital of $180,000 to the balance of $40,000.\nAs consequence of the disallowance by the officers of the Department of the respondent, the original capital was reduced only to the extent of the write-offs which were allowed. And, as the write-offs allowed amounted to $100,000, what was left of the original capital was not $40,000 but $80,000 in round figures, or, to accept the figures of the Company, $79,200 which is precisely what the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June 1938 authorized, and what the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 8th of October 1938 recognized. The latter Supplementary Letters Patent, taking into consideration the r\u00e9demption of the preferred shares of the par value of $40 each, which had been issued in the meantime, consequent upon the authorization contained in the former Supplementary Letters Patent, decreed that the capital stock of the Company shall, in the future, be $7,200 divided into 1,800 issued common shares of the par value of $4 each.\nIt may be said, in passing, that, with respect, the learned trial judge in the Exchequer Court 3, wrongly assumed that the disallowance by the Department had been made in each of the years in which the write-offs of goodwill had been made. The evidence shows that it was only in 1941, or three years after the returns made by the Company and by the appellant, that the write-offs were disallowed. However, he recognizes that the sole date and transaction in issue is that of the 3rd of June 1938.\nThe learned judge therefore asks himself whether the appellant received \"an amount by virtue of the reduction\" which took place on the 3rd of June 1938, within the meaning of Section 16 (1). He comes to the conclusion that that subsection does not apply; but his view was that as the preferred shares were reduced on 31st July 1938, they then came within the class denned in Subsection 2 of Section 16, and he expressed the opinion that Subsection 2 refers to the shares issued on conversion and not to the original shares. The second question examined by the learned judge was whether the undistributed income was \"capitalized\" as a result of the reduction and conversion of June 3, 1938, within the meaning of Section 15.\nOn that point he says that the appellant contended first that if the undistributed income was capitalized, it was capitalized between 1922 and 1937, when the capital asset of goodwill was written-off.\nTo this the learned judge declares that the Company may add undistributed income to capital by increasing the paid-up capital in each share, thereby increasing the par value of each share. He also says that, in his opinion, \"using the undistributed income for the purpose of writing off goodwill did not capitalize it\".\nThe appellant's second contention was that the reduction and conversion did not capitalize the undistributed income. To this the learned judge begins by stating: \"it is correct that on the reduction the unissued shares were cancelled and no new additional shares were issued and the paid-up capital in each share was in part cancelled and not increased\". But, in his opinion, the reduction did result in the capitalizing of the undistributed income. It is there that I find myself unable to follow the reasoning contained in the judgment appealed from. In my view, the learned judge then confused assets with capital. The judgment is to the effect that if the Petition for the Supplementary Letters Patent had disclosed that $140,000 had been lost or was unrepresented by assets and the capital remaining was only $40,000, although the Company had in addition undistributed income of $38,091.61, the capital stock would have been decreased to $40,000 and not $79,200. And he goes on to say: \"this would have been accomplished by cancelling the 200 unissued shares and by cancelling paid-up capital of $77.15 per share of the 1,800 issued shares, thereby reducing the par value of each from $100 to approximately $22.85. If the Company then desired to convert the undistributed income into capital, the capital stock would then have been increased from $40,000 to $79,200 by increasing the paid-up capital to the extent of $21.15 per share upon each of the 1,800 shares, thereby increasing the par value from $28.25 to $44.00 per share of the said 1,800 shares.\"\nBut, as the learned judge himself says: \"that procedure did not take place\". And I regret that I can not follow the reasoning which the learned judge deduces from that finding of fact. He asserts that the Company represented that the loss was only $100,800 and not $140,000, and that $79,200 was represented by available assets \"whereas only $40,000 was represented by available assets.\" And he then comes on to say that, as a result, it was clear that the same position was reached as if the capital stock had first been decreased to $40,000 and then increased to $79,200 by first cancelling the paid-up capital in each of the issued 1,800 shares of $77.15 and then increasing the paid-up capital in each share by $21.15.\nBut, of course, to that reasoning it must first be observed that the Company, when it petitioned for the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June 1938, could not represent anything else than it did, since at that time the disallowance of write-offs had not yet taken place. It was made by the Department only in 1941. At the date of the petition and of the issue of the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June 1938, the Company represented the facts exactly as they then appeared in its books; and, upon that representation, it was authorized to decrease its capital stock from the sum of $200,000 to the sum of $79,200, by cancelling paid-up capital to the extent of $56 per share, it being stated that $100,800 had been lost or was unrepresented by available assets. The Company was further authorized to convert the 1,800 issued shares of the capital stock of the par value of $44 each into 1,800 preferred shares of the par value of $40 each, and 1,800 common shares of the par value of $4 each.\nThe Company did exactly what they had been authorized to do by the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 3rd of June 1938. And the representation it made to obtain that authorization was strictly in accordance with the facts and figures as they then appeared in its books.\nFurthermore, on the 31st of July 1938, the Company redeemed the preferred shares. The capital stock of the Company was thereby brought down to the $7,200 divided into 1,800 issued common shares of the par value of $4 each; and this was taken to be henceforth the authorized capital stock of the Company in accordance with the Supplementary Letters Patent of the 8th of October 1988.\nThe learned trial judge very properly recognized this by saying that under the Letters Patent the paid-up capital upon each share was $44, as a result of the cancellation of the paid-up capital to the extent of $56 upon each share. But it was exactly what the Company had been authorized to do by those Supplementary Letters Patent.\nIt would appear therefore, first that the learned judge, by his judgment, assumes a state of facts contrary to that which was recognized by the Supplementary Letters Patent, and to what actually took place.\nIn my view, he could not base the conclusions of his judgment on what he thinks that the Company should have done or might have done, instead of what the Company actually did, and did in accordance with the authorization granted to it by the Supplementary Letters Patent.\nIn other words, he can not declare that what is stated in these Supplementary Letters Patent, as the true capital resulting from the operations authorized thereby, was not in fact the true capital; and that if the Company had acted otherwise, the result would have been different.\nIt seems to me that we must truly accept the authorization contained in the Supplementary Letters Patent as they are stated therein. They decree that by the operation thus authorized, the capital of the Company would be and was reduced to $79,200; and it is not here nor there to say that only $40,000 was represented by available assets.\nThere is no evidence to establish that statement in the judgment appealed from and, moreover, that statement is directly contrary to what is stated in the Supplementary Letters Patent and what was authorized. It should be sufficient to add that, even if at that time the write-offs had already been disallowed, the disallowance only amounted to decreasing the write-offs by $40,000, which would mean that instead of having properly written off $140,000 of the goodwill asset, the Company should have written off $100,000; and the asset of goodwill back of the capital was therefore $79,200 instead of only $40,000. The result must then be as stated in the representations of the Company to the Secretary of State, and in the Supplementary Letters Patent consequently issued, that the capital remained at the figure of $79,200.\nBut the Department in 1941, when disallowing the write-offs, elected to treat the amount whereby they were disallowed not as a reduction in the capital, but as an amount representing undistributed income. Not to say anything of the arbitrary method whereby a sum of $40,000 re-added to the goodwill asset was transformed into an amount of undistributed income, even then accepting that method (as the Company did), whether you call it increased goodwill asset or undistributed income, still it can not be said that that amount did not represent available assets whereby the capital reduced to $79,200 was guaranteed.\nI confess my inability to follow the reasoning of the Department that a disallowance of the writing off of some part of the goodwill asset could result in the creation of that amount of undistributed income.\nThe capital, as authorized by the Supplementary Letters Patent, as a result of the disallowance of the writing off, was merely brought down to $79,200, and not to $40,000.\nHowever, the appellant also contended that if we are to admit that the $38,091.61 was undistributed income before the reduction, it remained undistributed income after the reduction and reconversion, and that it was not converted into capital by the reduction.\nThere again, if we are to accept that contention, it would not follow at all that such undistributed income was capitalized on the reduction, nor that the operation was thereby brought under Section 15 of the Act. There was no reorganization of the corporation. Even if we say that the operation amounted to a \"readjustment of the capital stock\", the undistributed income having remained so after the reduction and conversion, as is assumed in this argument, cannot be treated as having been converted into capital by the reduction or as having been \"capitalized\". Therefore, (Section 15 does not apply.\nAs to Section 16 (1) the judgment appealed from is to the effect that it does not apply to the facts of the present case, and I agree with that conclusion.\nIt is not perhaps decisive that in 1943 by Statute 7, Geo. VI, Ch. 14, Section 16 (1) was amended in order to insert the words: \"or converts any class of the capital stock or shares thereof into any other class of capital stock, shares or other security thereof, the amount or the value of any consideration or right\" etc.\nIt is apparent that the amendment was to cover exactly the situation that we have in the present case. It may be said that if the amendment was made, it was because the Section as it read previously did not cover the case sought to be met by the amendment. If that were so, cadit quaestio. If however it is argued that the amendment was made only to make the matter clearer or indisputable, my answer to that would be that as Section 16 (1) read previously, it did not cover the precise case that we have here. As for Section 16 (2), its purpose is only to exclude from the application of Section 16 (1) certain cases which are not the case now before us.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment appealed from, declare that the assessment made against the appellant was illegally imposed, and declare that in the return of the appellant nothing should be added in respect of the conversion of shares of the capital stock of Domestic Gas Appliances Limited, the whole with costs against the respondent both in this Court and in the lower Court. Kerwin J.:\u2014Mr. Carden S. Bagg appeals against a decision of the Exchequer Court 4 affirming the assessment against him under the Income War Tax Act in respect of his income for the year 1938. The first dispute involves-what the respondent contends was the capitalization of the undistributed income of Domestic Gas Appliances Limited (of which the appellant was a shareholder) as a result of the readjustment of its capital stock in 1938 and is based upon section 15 of the Act as it stood at the relevant time:\n15. When, as a result of the reorganization of a corporation or the readjustment of its capital stock, the whole or any part of its undistributed income is capitalized, the amount capitalized shall be deemed to be distributed as a dividend during the year in which the reorganization or readjustment takes place and the shareholders of the said corporation shall be deemed to receive such dividend in proportion to their interest in the capital stock of the corporation or in the class of capital stock affected.\nThe Company, incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act, had an authorized capital of $200,000 divided into 2,000 shares of $100 each, of which 1,800 had been issued and of which the appellant was the owner of 518. On June 3., 1938, supplementary letters patent were issued doing two things:\u2014\n1. The authorized capital was decreased from $200,000 to $79,200, such decrease being effected\n(a) by cancelling the 200 unissued shares of a par value of $100each and\n(b) by cancelling a paid-up capital to the extent of $56 per share upon each of the said 1,800 issued shares and thereby reducing the par value of the said 1,800 issued shares from $100 per share to $44 per share.\n2. The said 1,800 issued shares of the par value of $44 each were converted into 1,800 preferred shares of a par value of $40 each and 1,800 common shares of a par value of $4 each.\nIn accordance with the supplementary letters patent, the 518 shares owned by the appellant were converted in 1938 into 518 preferred shares of a par value of $40 each and 518 common shares of a par value of $4 each. Still later in the same year the preferred shares, and in 1941 the common shares, were redeemed. In the latter year, the Minister ascertained that while $140,000 for goodwill had been originally included in the company's capital assets, that sum had been entirely written off by the Company in various amounts between 1922 and 1937. He, thereupon, disallowed the various items making up the total. The result of this was that in 1938, immediately before the supplementary letters patent, the Company had a surplus of $38,091.61, which, as between the parties to these proceedings, was formally admitted to be undistributed income.'\nThe appellant does not deny that within the meaning of section 15 there was a readjustment of the Company's capital stock by the supplementary letters patent on June 3, 1938, but contends that the $38,091.61 undistributed income was not capitalized as a result of the readjustment. The Company's balance sheet as at December 31, 1938, which was filed as Exhibit 2, shows $9,100.31 of assets, made up of cash in bank, accounts receivable, and deferred charges. On the liability side is $1,097.43 for accounts payable, and provision for income taxes, and then, under the head \"Capital Stock\" appears the following:\u2014\nPreferred 5 per cent Non-cumulative Shares\u2014\nAuthorized and Issued\u2014\n1,800 Shares of $40 each\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 2,000\nLess\nRedeemed during year\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 72,000\nCommon\u2014\nAuthorized and Issued\u2014\n1,800 Shares of $4 each\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 7,200\nWe are not concerned with the redemption of the $72,000 preferred shares which occurred in the year 1938 some time after June 3rd, except to note that that redemption must have been carried out by paying the necessary sum in cash. A comparison of Exhibit 2 with Exhibit 1, which is the Company's balance sheet as of December 31, 1937, makes it apparent that if one had been prepared as of June 2, 1938, it would have shown $72,000 more on the assets side and on the liabilities side would have appeared preferred shares of the same amount without a deduction for the redemption. Making allowance for an operation of five months in place of twelve, the total assets would thus have been approximately $81,100.31. It is true that at that time, as a result of the various write offs, the Company showed on its books a substantial deficit and that the disallowance by the Minister had not then occurred, but the Company, itself, by the supplementary letters patent reduced its capital by approximately the amount of the deficit and, as I have already stated, for the purposes of this case the appellant admits that the Company had on hand $38,091.61 undistributed income. Under section 15, the two questions to be determined are whether that income was capitalized and, if so, was it as a result of the readjustment of the Company's capital stock. The answers to both depend upon what the Company did and the evidence of William Edward Johnson makes that matter clear. The charter of the Company was surrendered in 1941 but he had been an accountant with the Company and was called as a witness by the appellant to state that no payment was made by the Company to the shareholders as a result of the readjustment,\u2014apparently having in mind the provisions of section 16 of the Act. But the first two questions and the answers thereto on his cross-examination are as follows:\u2014\nQ. Can you tell us what happened to the undistributed. income of $38,091.61 which existed at the date when the change in the capital set-up of the Company took place?\nA.\" Could I 'have that question again? (Question read by reporter). Well, the effect of the letters patent which were issued was to reduce or write off the capital of the Company by $100,800, thereby reducing the capital to $79,000, or $77,000. I just do not recall the amount. Now, you asked me what happened to the $38,000. Well it is assumed then that $38,000 still remained in the Company and formed part of the $79,000.\nQ. That is right? the $38,000 formed part of the $79,000? A. That is right.\nIf the problem be treated as one of fact, the testimony of this witness is conclusive and, in so far as they are matters of law, upon the fact deposed to by him, that the Company changed the undistributed income into capital, the answer in law is that that change or capitalization was as a result of the readjustment of June 3, 1938.\nThe conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the provisions of section 16. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand, J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether the company in reducing its share capital brought about a capitalization of undistributed income within the meaning of section 15 of the Income Tax Act and the answer has been left by the parties to be drawn from the barest skeleton of fact.\nThe original capital of the company was $200,000 divided into 2,000 shares of $100 each. Of these, 1,800 were issued as paid up and the original capital assets as set forth on the balance sheet included an item of $140,000 for goodwill. From time to time between 1921 and 1937 this amount was written off, but the details do not appear. On June 3, 1938 following an application under section 61 of the Companies' Act supplementary letters patent effected a reduction of capital, first of the 200 unissued shares and then of the paid-up par value of the 1,800 shares from $100 to $44. This new capital of $79,200 was in turn converted into 1,800 shares of preferred stock of a par value of $40 and 1,800 shares of common stock of a par value of $4, all paid up. The letters empowered the company to redeem the preferred shares at a premium of 1 per cent and converted it from a public to a private company. On June 18, 1938 a resolution providing for the redemption of the preferred shares was passed, and following the redemption application was made and letters patent issued for a further and corresponding reduction of 'capital.\nSome time after the readjustment in 1938, the income authorities reviewing the accounts of the company found that on June 3, 1938 when the first supplementary letters issued there was $38,091.61 of undistributed income in the assets of the company; and treating the readjustment and conversion as effecting a capitalization of this income, which I take to mean profit, assessed a tax on the petitioner, a shareholder in the company, in respect of his share of that income received through the capitalization.\nAn increase of capital assets may be effected in several ways, but where the shares are of one class only with the same rights, I see no reason why the company by such action as was taken here, cannot appropriate profits to lost capital. Whether it does so is a question of intention, and it must appear that the appropriation was to be irrevocable.\nThe limited accounts before us indicate that there was no profit reserve and that all the assets were treated as a blended mass. The accumulated income was part of those assets and it represents the difference between the $140,000 of goodwill apparently written off and the debit balance in assets and liabilities of $101,908.39 shown as of June 30, 1938. Whether from these facts an actual intention to make a provisional or temporary appropriation to capital can be inferred is doubtful: certainly it was not specific and nothing binding on the company took place: and the power to revoke would remain until an act has made the appropriation definitive; Stanley v. Read 5. The admission of the appellant confirms that view. All we have up to this point is, therefore, the disappearance of the goodwill item and the absence of a profit reserve.\nBut the petition for reduction contained certain representations. It was represented as the ground for reduction that capital \"had been lost or was no longer represented by available assets\". The loss was stated to be $100,800 The original resolution to reduce was passed on May 6, 1938 and the debit balance on June 30, 1938 as mentioned was $101,108.39. No doubt the actual amount represented as loss was dictated by its being the amount that would permit the nearest approximation to the value of the actual assets by a reduced capital with a par value in whole dollars.\nBut the implication of the petition is that the remaining capital is intact, and that the new share capital of $79,200 is represented by that value of existing capital assets: that what was stated to be lost was all that was lost. Such a representation necessarily involves the final commitment of the undistributed profits, or, as the matters appeared to the shareholders at the time, of all the then existing assets of the company, to capital; and the company cannot now be heard to say the contrary.\nThat this was the result intended seems to be confirmed by what followed. Between June 18 and September 20, 1938 the preferred shares with premium, amounting in all to $72,720, were redeemed. By new supplementary letters patent the share capital on October 8, 1938 was further reduced to $7,200, consisting of the 1,800 shares of common stock. This amount again was the approximate value of the then total assets and the implied representation is again that they are capital assets. The question my be raised whether the effect of the petition was not merely to destroy a power to change an existing state of things, namely, a de facto capitalization indicated by the form of the balance sheet which must be taken as confirmed in time. But section 15 strikes at a final and conclusive appropriation which the readjustment brings about. Until the moment of the new letters that clearly did not take place; at that moment it did; and to treat the effect as suggested would, in my opinion, be to make too subtle a distinction as to the nature of the so-called power to revoke, which, in other situations involving special and conflicting interests in relation to profits, might prove embarrassing: to treat, in other words, the loss of the continuing right to deal with the profits as such, where there has been no specific application to capital, as effecting a piecemeal appropriation at the times of the various balance sheets over a period of many years.\nIn these circumstances the evidence is conclusive that the reduction of June 3rd involved the irrevocable appropriation of the undistributed profits to capital and was, therefore, a capitalization within the meaning of section 15.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock, J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant, prior to the 3rd of June, 1938, was the owner of 518 shares of a par value of $100 each, of the capital stock of a Dominion company whose authorized capital was 2,000 shares, of which 1,800 had been issued. On the last mentioned date, by supplementary letters patent, the authorized capital was decreased from $200,000 to $79,200, such decrease being effected, (a) by cancelling the 200 unissued shares; (b) by cancelling paid up capital to the extent of $56 per share on each of the outstanding 1,800 issued shares, thus reducing the par value of each share to $44 per share; and (c), by converting the 1,800 issued shares of the par value of $44 into 1,800 preferred shares of the par value of $40 and 1,800 common shares of the par value of $4. These letters were issued upon it having been made to appear to the Secretary of State that paid up capital to the extent of the reduction in the paid up issued shares was \"lost or unrepresented by available assets\" pursuant to 24-25 Geo. V, cap. 33, sec. 49 (1) (6).\nSubsequently, in 1941, the respondent, in determining the net income of the appellant for income tax purposes, ' for the year 1938, added a sum of $10,955.70, being $21.15 in respect of each of the original 518 shares of stock held by the appellant. The company, over a period of years, commencing in 1922, had written off capital to the extent of $140,000 represented by good-will, and $38,091.61 of the above amount had been written off against undistributed profits. The income tax assessors took the stand that the obsorption of these profits against good-will would not be recognized by the Crown. The result of this ruling was that the company, so far as the tax on income of the appellant as a shareholder was concerned, had on hand at the date of the letters patent this sum of $38,091.61 of undistributed profits.\nThe claim of the respondent, on this set of facts, was that this last mentioned sum had been \"capitalized\", 'within the meaning of section 15 of the Income War Tax Act, as the result of the readjustment brought about by the supplementary letters patent and this contention was sustained by the Exchequer Court 6. The court held however, that section 16, upon which the Crown had at first relied, had no application. For the purposes of the proceedings,' the appellant accepted the ruling of the assessors.\nSections 15 and 16 above mentioned are as follows:\n15. When, as a result of the reorganization of a corporation or the readjustment of its capital stock, the whole or any part of its undistributed income is capitalized, the amount capitalized Shall be deemed to be distributed as a dividend during the year in which the reorganization or readjustment takes place and the shareholders of the said corporation shall be deemed to receive such dividend in proportion to their interest in the capital stock of the corporation or in the class of capital stock affected.\n16. When a corporation having undistributed income on hand reduces or redeems any class of the capital stock or shares thereof, the amount received by any shareholder by virtue of the reduction shall, to the extent to which such shareholder would be entitled to participate in such undistributed income on a total distribution thereof at the time of such reduction, be deemed to be dividend and to be income received by such shareholder.\n16 (2). The provisions of this section shall not apply to any class of stock which, by the instrument authorizing the issue of such class, is not entitled on being reduced or redeemed to participate in the assets of the corporation beyond the amount paid up thereon plus any fixed premium and a defined rate of dividend nor to a reduction of capital effected before the sixteenth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six.\nWith respect to section 15, the appellant does not contend that there had not been a \"readjustment\" of the capital stock of the company by reason of the supplementary letters patent, but he denies that any part of the undistributed income, if capitalized, had been capitalized as a result of the readjustment.\nThere is, perhaps, some difficulty in arriving at the exact facts, but in my view the case was fought out below upon the basis that, to the extent of the $38,091.61 here in question, the write-offs of good-will totalling $140,000 had been made against earned income. That the figure of $38,091.61 of undistributed income was produced by the action of the income tax authorities in disallowing these write-offs of good-will is established by the evidence of the only witness called on behalf of the respondent. He testified as follows:\nQ. And that is what, you say, produced an undistributed income of $38,000? A. No; I say that by disallowing these write-offs, then we arrive at $38,000.\nQ. And you say that is undistributed income? A. That is right.\nThat it was common ground that the write-offs above referred to were made, pro tanto, out of earned income appears firstly, in the argument of counsel for the respondent at trial and, secondly, in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge 7. In his argument counsel for the Crown said:\nNotwithstanding the apparent disappearance of the $140,000 in capital by the writing off of an equal amount, there must have been some other items in the company's set-up to compensate for part of this loss, the difference between $40,000 and the new capital of $79,200. There must have been something there. What is it? Mr. Gregory told us that it was this undistributed income of $38,000; and he was not contradicted on that point by Mr. Johnson of the company. I think it is common ground that the new capital of $79,200 was made up by the balance remaining of the. original capital, $40,000 and this undistributed income of $38,000. Therefore this $38,000 became capitalized. Instead of appearing in the books of the company as an earned surplus or undistributed income, it was transferred to the capital account. It was capitalized. I shall deal later with that part of the above contention which refers to the composition of the \"new capital\".\nThat nothing was done so far as the company was concerned, on or after the 3rd of June, 1938, in the way of capitalization of the sum in question is expressly dealt with in the evidence of the company's auditor, who, in speaking with respect to the period commencing on that date, gave the following evidence:\nQ. And you are familiar with the statements and the books of the Company, are you not? A. Yes.\nQ. From those statements and those books can you tell the Court whether or not there was anything done on the books or in the statements which in any way represented a 'capitalization' of any part of that undistributed income at that time? A. There was nothing done that -I know of.\nAs to the understanding of the learned trial judge 8 that he was called upon to deal with the case on the above basis, I quote the following extracts from his reasons:\nThe appellant contends first that if the undistributed income was capitalized, it was capitalized between 1922 and 1937. That is, that it was capitalized when the earned surplus was used for the purpose of writing off the capital asset of good-will.\nAgain:\nIn my opinion using the undistributed income for the purpose of writing off good-will did mot capitalize it.\nFurther, in referring to the supplementary letters patent, the learned trial judge said:\nBut in fact the good-will had been written off in the sum of 1140,000. And the capital stock was to be decreased to $79,200 on the basis that this sum had not been lost, but on the contrary was represented by assets. Now that arose from the fact that the company regarded the sum of $38,091.61 as capital and \"used\" it as capital and represented it to be capital in the Petition to the Secretary of State. And that position is quite in accordance with the first contention of the appellant that it was capitalized when it was used for the purpose of writing off good-will.\nThese facts as thus stated by the learned trial judge 9 are expressly adopted by the respondent in its factum, which states:\nThe facts are set out in detail in the reasons for judgment.\nIt thus appears that so far as the company was concerned it had, over the years, in fact written off capital of $140,000, of which $38,091.61 had been written off against income, thus producing a deficit in capital account of $101,908.39. The refusal on the part of the income tax authorities to recognize this use of the $38,091.61 was with relation to the appellant's income for the year 1938. It is not shown that the company itself acquiesced, or indeed, that this ruling; was one with which it was in any way concerned, and it is, in my opinion, important to bear in mind that the situation which is to 'be taken as fact as between the parties to these proceedings, was not at all the actual facts upon which either the company or the Secretary of State acted, the one in applying for, and the other in issuing the supplementary letters patent.\nThis being the position, what is it upon which the respondent relies as establishing that this sum of $38,091.61, which it insists was undistributed income immediately before the issue of the letters patent, became capital immediately thereafter? It is undoubted that the letters patent reduced the amount paid up on the outstanding shares but how did the letters produce a metamorphosis in the character of the $38,091.61? According to the evidence quoted above, the company did nothing.\nSuch a change must, in the first place, depend upon some act of the company with the intention of appropriating income to capital. The only act of the company in appropriating this sum to capital took place in the years before June 3, 1938, and this is the very thing the respondent refuses to recognize. How then can the respondent take the position that an act of the company before June 3, 1938, which, in order to clothe the sum in question with the character of income it will not recognize, can be used on or after that date to constitute an appropriation to capital? It is not shown that if the company had applied for the supplementary letters patent on the basis of the state of facts the Crown now insists upon, the company, on its part, or the Secretary of State, would have demanded that the write-offs of the $140,000 of good-will should, to the extent of the undistributed income on hand, be made good out of income. Such an appropriation will not invariably be insisted on; Poole v. National Bank of China 10; Re Rowland and Marwood's Steamship Co.11. If the Crown had come into court on the theory that, while the company had in fact written off the amount in question out of profits, it could at any time reverse this action, but had lost that right by an express or implied representation on the grant of the supplementary letters that it would not do so, it would have been open to the appellant to show, if he could, that the original appropriation had been irrevocable or became so before June 3, 1938. This, however, was not the issue and, in my opinion, such an issue is not to be disposed of on the evidence adduced.\nI think therefore, the Crown's contention with respect to section 15, as applied to the facts which it insists upon, cannot prevail. The issue of the letters patent reduced the amount paid up on the issued capital stock but, in my opinion, it did nothing more.\nIn fact the only argument addressed to this court on behalf of the Crown in support of its contention under section 15 is thus expressed in its factum:\n19. The original authorized capital of the company was $200,000 divided into 2,000 shares of the par value of $100 each, of which, as of the 3rd day of June, 1938, 1,800 shares had been issued as fully paid up.\n20. Included in the capital assets was an item of good-will in the amount of $140,000. Between the years 1921 and 1937 there were several write-offs of the good-will of the company totalling $140,000. This resulted in a reduction of capital from $180,000 to $40,000. However, by the above mentioned Supplementary Letters Patent the capital stock of the Company was reduced to only $79,200.\n21. It is submitted therefore that the difference between the above mentioned amounts of $40,000 and $79,200 must be represented by the undistributed income admitted by the company to be in its hands as of 3rd June, 1938, with the result that such undistributed income was capitalized within- the meaning -of section 15 of the Income War Tax Act.\nIf it is taken to be the fact, as the Crown insists, that immediately before the letters patent the assets of the company included $38,091.61 of undistributed income, the reduction in the par value of the capital stock had nothing to do with capitalizing those profits. They were assets but it is, in my opinion, a complete non-sequitur to say that merely by the writing down of the par value of the shares, that which was a revenue asset became a capital asset.\nThe argument, in my opinion, begs the question in dispute.\nWith respect to section 16, it may be questioned whether the language \"reduces \u2026 any class of the capital stock or shares thereof\" contemplates a reduction in the par value of the shares outstanding. Assuming, however, that the subsection would extend so far, I do not think it can be said that the appellant received anything \"by virtue of the reduction\" in question in this case. As already pointed out, it is not shown as a matter of evidence that these undivided profits did not in fact remain as a fund to which resort might be made by the company for dividends. If that be so, the fund might become the subject of a dividend or dividends in the future, but that had not taken place at any time material to these proceedings.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and below.\nEstey, J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment in the Exchequer Court 12 affirming a decision of the Minister of National Revenue requiring the appellant to pay income tax on the sum of $10,955.70, being the sum of $21.15 on each of 518 shares of capital stock which the appellant held in Domestic Gas Appliances Limited.\nThe Domestic Gas Appliances Limited, hereafter called \"the company\" was formed in 1919 with an authorized capital of 2,000 shares at a par value of $100, of which 1,800 shares had been issued and were outstanding on June 3, 1938. When formed the company included in its assets an item of $140,000 as good-will which during the period from 1921 to 1937 had been written off and as of June 3, 1938, the company had tangible assets to the value of $79,200. In its balance sheet of December 31, 1937, the assets are listed under three headings, cash in bank, accounts receivable and an amount owing from a trust company.\nAs of June 3, 1938, Supplementary Letters Patent were issued confirming the cancellation of the 200 unissued shares and a reduction of the 1,800 to $44 per share ($79,200) on the basis that the $56 per share \"has been lost or is unrepresented by available assets.\" These Supplementary Letters Patent also confirmed the conversion of these 1,800 shares into 1,800 preferred shares at a par value of $40 and 1,800 common shares at a par value of $4 each. The company by this operation reduced its outstanding share capital to the amount of $79,200 'being the equivalent of the actual value of its assets.\nIt was also provided in these Supplementary Letters Patent that the company might on resolution of the direc- tors redeem all or any of the preferred shares outstanding on payment of $40 plus a premium of one per cent and an amount equal to dividends declared prior to the redemption date and then remaining unpaid. In fact in 1938 these preferred shares were redeemed and the common shares taken up in the course of its liquidation in 1941.\nThe appellant prior to June 3, 1938, had 518 shares at a par value of $100 each and after the issue of the Supplementary Letters Patent had 518 preferred shares at a par value of $40 each and 518 common shares at a par value of $4 each.\nIn 1941 the auditors of the Department of National Revenue examined the books of the company, disallowed certain items as written off and determined that as of June 3, 1938, the company had $38,091.61 undistributed income. The Department of National Revenue takes the position that this sum of $38,091.61 was capitalized by virtue of the steps taken and confirmed by the Supplementary Letters Patent and that within the meaning of sec. 15 of the Income War Tax Act the appellant must be deemed to have received his share thereof through the allotment to him of the new shares of stock. The judgment 13 here appealed from confirms that view.\nThe foregoing steps confirmed by the Supplementary Letters Patent effected a change in the capital structure of the company that constituted a readjustment of its capital stock within the meaning of sec. 15.\n15. When, as a result of the reorganization of a corporation or the readjustment of its capital stock, the whole or any part of its undistributed income is capitalized, the amount capitalized shall be deemed to be distributed as a dividend during the year in which the reorganization or readjustment takes place and the shareholders of the said corporation shall be deemed to receive such dividend in proportion to their interest in the capital stock of the corporation or in the class of capital stock affected.\nIf the amount of $38,091.61 undistributed income by virtue of the same steps was capitalized then within the meaning of the foregoing sec. 15 this amount \"shall be deemed to be distributed as a dividend\" and the appellant as a shareholder of the said company \"shall be deemed\" to have received his proportion of such dividend. The respondent submits that the sole effect of the steps confirmed by the Supplementary Letters Patent was to reduce the par value of the outstanding shares in the company from $100 to $44 per original unit in recognition of the fact that $56 par value thus cancelled had \"been lost\" or was \"unrepresented by available assets.\" Under this submission the $38,091.61 must be regarded either as having been capitalized in the course of the write-offs or that it remained as undistributed income after the issue of the Supplementary Letters Patent.\nThe chief assistant auditor of the Department of National Revenue explained that the company in writing off the $140,000 good-will had turned the surplus of undistributed income into a deficit of $101,908.39 and that the undistributed income disappeared in the write-off of good-will. The auditor of the company stated, when his attention was directed to the item of $38,091.61, that it was \"not reflected\" on the company's balance sheet of December 31, 1937. He also stated, \"In my opinion, as a result of the Supplementary Letters Patent no amount was capitalized as of that time\" and that he entertained this opinion because \"if any amount was capitalized it had been capitalized prior to the date of the Supplementary Letters Patent.\" This is the evidence relative to previous capitalization. It is not supported by any formal action on the part of the company other than what may be assumed to have taken place at directors' and shareholders' meetings where the accounts are passed. It rather suggests that in the books of the company some change had been made that effected in that sense a capitalization. Any change so effected does not prevent the company taking such action with respect to the assets so dealt with as it may deem desirable. In this case the appellant was a substantial shareholder and has formally admitted, for the purposes of this case \"that on the 3rd day of June, 1938, Domestic Gas Appliances Limited had an undistributed income in the amount of $38,091.61.\" Under all these circumstances, it cannot be held that the item had been capitalized in a manner binding upon the company prior to the 3rd of June, 1938.\nThe petition to the Secretary of State praying the issue of these Letters Patent was not placed in evidence. The letters disclose, however, an intent and purpose on the part of the company to adjust its outstanding and fully-paid share capital to the value of the \"available assets.\" These assets as disclosed 'by its balance sheet on December 31, 1937, consisted of cash in bank, accounts receivable and an amount owing from a trust company. As the auditor stated, the amount of $38,091.61 was \"not reflected\" on the balance sheet. It is, however, not suggested that the amount was not there as an asset. He further intimated that no change material to the issues here under consideration was effected between December 31, 1937, and June 3, 1938.\nIt is the value of the \"available assets\" that constitutes the sum of $79,200. The company possesses no other assets and while this sum is not specifically referred to as capital or income in the Supplementary Letters Patent, it is clear that it alone is the total asset behind the stock. The undistributed income in the sum of $38,091.61 is part of this fund which in the readjustment as confirmed by the Supplementary Letters Patent has become the total capital asset of the company. This conclusion seems unavoidable unless you import back into the capital account some fictitious item or items which would then restore the condition removed by the steps confirmed by the Letters Patent.\nIn this adjustment the shareholders have received no money, but what in substance has taken place is the elimination of all fictitious items in the capital structure, first by replacing them with the undistributed income, and when that was exhausted by a readjustment of the capital stock to an amount equal to the actual value of its total assets.\nFurther, these Supplementary Letters Patent read as a whole, and particularly that portion stating that the reduction of $100,800 in the capital stock was made upon the basis that it \"has been lost or is unrepresented by available assets,\" indicate that the company was readjusting its capital structure in a manner that in a commercial sense left no part of its available assets as a potential fund of income for the payment of dividends but rather as a capital fund upon which dividends as earned might be paid. This view is confirmed by the accountant of the company. He stated that the capital of the company was reduced to $79,000 or $77,000, he could not remember which, and that he assumed the $38,000 still remained in the company and formed part of the $79,000. If, therefore, the $79,000 was capital and the $38,000 was part of it, the accountant believed the company had capitalized the $38,000.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Montgomery, McMichael, Common, Howard, Forsyth & Ker.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

Nickel, [1949] S.C.R. 601\nDate: 1949-06-24\nPaul Fuller (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJohn Nickel, Robert Moore And Bertha Moore (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1949: April 28, 29; 1949: June 24.\nPresent: The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Collision at night between truck and car\u2014 Truck without required clearance lights and of illegal width\u2014Duty to keep to right of center line\u2014Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 275, s. 47(1).\nIn a collision at night between appellant's truck and a car driven by respondent, the whole left side of the car was practically ripped off by contact with the overhanging box of the truck. The truck was not equipped with the clearance lights required by bylaw and was 3\u00bd inches wider than the legal width. The trial judge found that the respondent had not discharged the onus of showing that the infractions of the law contributed to the accident or that the appellant was otherwise guilty of negligence which was a causa causans. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and found that the probable cause of the accident was the absence of clearance lights, a fact well known to the appellant, coupled with the illegal width of the truck. Held: Taschereau J. dissenting, that the absence of clearance lights on the truck was not the causa causans, but that the accident would not have happened if respondent had complied with sec. 47(1) of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act to keep to the right of the center line.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, reversing the decision of McLaurin J. dismissing the action for damages.\nR. L. Fenerty for the appellant.\nC. E. Smith K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I agree with my brother Estey and would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014The respondent John Nickel with several persons, including the respondents Mr. and Mrs. Moore, as passengers at about 1.30 on the morning of July 3, 1945, was driving a 1938 Plymouth Sedan westward toward Acme in the Province of Alberta when he collided with an International 1939 1\u00bd-ton truck owned and driven eastward by the appellant.\nThe gravelled portion of the road was about 25 feet in width and at this point straight. There were no other vehicles in the immediate vicinity and a slight shower shortly before the collision left the gravel damp.\nThe respondent Nickel, as a consequence of his serious injuries, was unconscious for some time after the accident and at the trial had no recollection of any of the events immediately preceding or at the time of the collision. The respondents Mr. and Mrs. Moore were seated in the back seat of the automobile behind the driver and observed neither the on-coming truck nor the precise course of the automobile. Klassen, who owned the automobile, was sitting in the front seat on the north side. He deposed that he saw headlights of what he thought was another automobile and aside from observing that the speedometer of his automobile indicated a speed of 28 m.p.h. and that Nickel was driving within a foot or so from the north shoulder \"didn't give it much of a thought.\" Buist, who was in the back seat just behind Klassen, saw the headlights a half mile away and corroborated Klassen that his automobile was close to the north shoulder of the road.\nThe appellant had two passengers in his truck and was proceeding at a speed of 25 m.p.h. He knew his clearance lights were not working and for that reason, as he said, upon seeing the lights of the on-coming automobile half a mile away he switched his lights on low beam and kept over close to the south shoulder. He concluded that the automobile had lots of room to pass but, he says, \"the car kept coming on and it crashed into me.\" Evidence that after the accident certain tracks were identified as made by the truck near the edge of the gravel for a distance of 20-30 feet was not accepted by the learned trial Judge. Appellant had gone into Calgary in the morning with a load of hogs and was returning with ten head of cattle. The measurements of the rack of his truck disclosed that it was 3\u00bd inches wider than that permitted by law (without a permit and no permit had been obtained).\nSec. 47(1) of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act (R.S.A. 1942, c. 275) provides:\n47. (1) Any person acting as the driver of a vehicle shall When meeting another vehicle keep his vehicle at all times to the right of the centre line of the highway.\nThe witnesses from the respective vehicles deposed that 'both drivers had complied with the foregoing statutory provision and that each, at the time of the accident, was well over on its own side of the road. If these witnesses were correct, having regard to the width of the road, the collision could not have taken place. That it did take place is conclusive of the fact that one or both of these groups of witnesses were mistaken. It is clear, however, that the automobile touched and slightly dented the north front fender of the truck and knocked the hub cap off the north front wheel, and that the box of the truck stripped the south side of the automobile and the latter turned a semi-circle and stopped facing south-east on the road while the truck went on a distance of 20 feet to the north shoulder of the road.\nConstable Ross of the R.C.M.P. arrived about an hour after the accident. There had in the meantime been a good deal of traffic and many of the marks made by these vehicles had been obliterated. He did, however, find a few feet of truck tire marks 5 feet 9 inches from the south shoulder of the road that corresponded with those of the truck. Upon the assumption that these might be the marks of the south tires of the truck the evidence disclosed that the northern-most edge of the truck would still be 1 foot 11\u00bd inches south of the centre of the highway. If, on the other hand, these were the north tire marks of the truck then the truck was proceeding even further south of the centre, but if, of course, they were not the marks of the truck they are of no assistance in determining the issue in this case. Constable Ross also found skid marks upon the gravelled portion showing that the automobile as a consequence of the impact had made a semi-circle and stopped facing south-east, that approximately 9 feet of the northern portion of the road as one passed through the area of the collision showed no automobile marks whatever. He also found the door of the automobile and to the west of it two gouge marks in the road to the north of the centre. His impression was that the door made at least one of these gouges.\nThe fact that no tire marks were found on the north side, and the skid marks of the automobile tend rather to contradict the evidence on behalf of the respondents as to the position of their automobile. It was in all of these circumstances that the learned trial Judge found:\nI find myself after consideration unable to choose between the conflicting evidence of the parties and as the onus is on the plaintiffs to establish negligence on the part of the defendant, I am obliged to dismiss the action with costs \u2026\nThe Appellate Court 2 reversed the judgment at trial, directed judgment for respondents and a reference back to the learned trial Judge to assess the damages and, for that purpose, with liberty to hear further evidence. Mr. Justice O'Connor 3, who wrote the judgment in the Appellate Court, stated:\nHaving regard to the character of the evidence and the fact that the plaintiff was unable to give any assistance, I find myself unable to hold that the trial Judge was wrong in his conclusion, namely, a finding of inability to determine which or that either of the vehicles was on its wrong side of the road, but I am clearly of opinion that he was wrong in discarding the fact of negligence on the part of the defendant in respect to the condition of his truck. This reference to the condition of the truck is in regard to the excess of 3\u00bd inches in the width of the rack and particularly to the absence of clearance lights.\nThe learned trial Judge stated:\nThere is no way of ascertaining whether Nickel was confused or affected by these infractions by the defendant. As far as the evidence of his passengers goes, it might be inferred that he was not.\nIn the Appellate Court, after referring to Klassen's statement, \"I had no other inclination except it was a car which just had two lights on,\" and to Buist's somewhat similar evidence, the reasons for judgment continued:\nAny inference would be that Nickel had the same opinion whereas if he had seen by clearance lights that it was not an ordinary automobile but was a large truck he would be likely to assure himself that he was far enough away to avoid it, and the absence of clearance lights which was well known to the defendant, would seem to be a very probable contributing cause to the collision.\nIt may be assumed that the absence of clearance lights justified Klassen and Buist in concluding appellant's vehicle was an automobile rather than a truck, but it is significant that they did not determine the position of the automobile either from the position of the truck or the absence of clearance lights. It was from their observation of the automobile in relation to the shoulder of the road that led them to conclude that Nickel was driving so close to the north shoulder that the possibility of a collision never occurred to them. They do not suggest that the appellant's truck was on the north or wrong side of the road. Neither is such suggested by any measurements, marks or debris found upon the highway after the collision. In fact the debris and marks found and the measurements made by Constable Ross tend rather to support the conclusion that the truck was on its own or south side of the road. With great respect, there does not appear to be anything in the evidence of Klassen or Buist upon which an inference might be supported that Nickel had determined his course upon the absence of the clearance lights. He probably did conclude it was an automobile and in that event it was his duty under sec. 47(1) \"to keep his vehicle at all times to the right of the centre line of the highway.\" If Nickel had complied with sec. 47(1) no collision would have occurred, as there is no evidence to suggest that the truck was ever on the north or wrong side of the road, while in this connection the evidence of Constable Ross is significant that a space of 9 feet from the north shoulder of the gravelled portion of the road indicated no traffic marks although the condition of the road was such that it would have disclosed them had they been made.\nThe appellant's infractions of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, both in failing to display clearance lights and having upon his truck a rack 3\u00bd inches too wide, may justify the imposition of penalties, but in fixing the responsibility for a collision in an action between parties they are important only if they constitute a direct cause of that collision. The City of Vancouver v. Burchill 4; Forbes v. Coca-Cola Co. of Canada and Guiteau 5; affirmed without discussion of this point in Coca-Cola Co. of Canada and Guiteau v. Forbes 6.\nThe burden of proof rested upon the respondents to establish that the negligence of the appellant was a direct cause of the collision. In view of the contradictory character of the evidence and the conclusions of the learned trial Judge, the observations of Lord Macmillan in Jones v. G.W. Ry.7, are appropriate:\nIf the evidence established only that the accident was possibly due to the negligence to which the plaintiffs seek to assign it, their case is not proved. To justify the verdict which they have obtained the evidence must be such that the attribution of the accident to that cause may reasonably be inferred. If a case such as this is left in the position that nothing has been proved to render more probable any one of two or more theories of the accident, then the plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof incumbent upon him. He has left the case in equilibrium, and the Court is not entitled to incline the balance one way or the other.\nThe issues in this case are entirely questions of fact. Even though the learned trial Judge did not pass upon credibility except as to the 'brother and father of the appellant, he had an opportunity to observe the witnesses which gave him an advantage in determining the value of the evidence, which is denied to an Appellate Court.\nAs stated by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline in Clarke v. Edinburgh and District Tramways Co.8:\n\u2026 witnesses without any conscious bias towards a conclusion may have in their demeanour, in their manner, in their hesitation, in the nuance of their expressions, in even the turns of the eyelid, left an impression upon the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed page.\nIn Kinloch v. Young 9 Lord Loreburn, L.C., stated at p. 4:\nBut this House and other Courts of appeal have always to remember that the Judge of first instance has had the opportunity of watching the demeanour of witnesses\u2014that he observes, as we cannot observe, the drift and conduct of the case; and also that he has impressed upon him by hearing every word the scope and nature of the evidence in a way that is denied to any Court of appeal. Even the most minute study by a Court of appeal fails to produce the same vivid appreciation of what the witnesses say or what they omit to say.\nThe contention of the respondents that even if the automobile was not upon its own side of the road the appellant, having seen the lights of the automobile half a mile away, should have avoided the collision is not established. The essential question again is just where were these vehicles, which upon the evidence cannot be determined. Moreover, one possibility supported by some evidence is that the truck was proceeding at a moderate rate close to the south edge of the gravelled portion of the road. If that were correct the only other step the appellant might have taken was to stop\u2014even that might not have avoided a collision unless the automobile stopped or turned further to the north. It cannot be said upon the evidence that the appellant did not reasonably anticipate that the automobile would turn to the north in compliance with the statutory requirement of sec. 47(1). This particular point does not appear to have been canvassed in the evidence and upon the whole there is no evidence that justifies the conclusion that the appellant's conduct was a direct cause of the collision.\nCounsel for both parties cited The King v. Deniers 10. That case, as so many of this type, depends upon its own facts. There an automobile collided with that portion of a scraper extending beyond the red lights displayed upon a truck owned and operated by the Department of Highways. The learned trial Judge found both parties at fault and apportioned the liability. The Crown appealed and both in the Appellate Court and in this Court the judgment at trial was affirmed on the basis that the evidence supported it. In the Nickel case the learned trial Judge was of the opinion that the evidence was so contradictory he could not conclude the respondents (plaintiffs) had proved a case.\nThe judgment of the learned trial Judge should be restored and this appeal allowed with costs.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal arises out of an automobile accident which occurred on the highway one and one-half miles east of the Village of Acme, in the Province of Alberta. At about 1:30 a.m. one of the respondents, John Nickel, driving east-west on a twenty-five feet wide highway, collided with a motor truck coming from the opposite direction, and owned and operated by the appellant. John Nickel and the two other respondents who were with him in the automobile, were seriously injured.\nThe trial judge found himself unable to choose between. the conflicting evidence of the parties, and as the onus was on the plaintiffs to establish negligence, he dismissed the action with costs. The Court of Appeal 11 unanimously allowed the appeal, and referred the case back to the trial judge for assessment of damages.\nThe evidence is contradictory. Nickel, the driver, sustained a fractured skull. He suffered a loss of memory and has no recollection of anything that happened. But three of his passengers testified that he was driving on the right side of the road. The defendant Fuller and his brother who was sitting with him in the front seat of the truck, and their father who was following in his own car, swore that the truck was being driven on the right side. Nickel's car was going at a speed of twenty-eight miles an hour, and the truck at approximately twenty-five miles. The learned trial judge disregarded any suggestion that Nickel was not sober and unable to drive an automobile.\nIt is common ground that the truck had its headlights on, and that the total width between the outside edges of these head-lamps was forty-eight inches, while the width between the inside edges was thirty-two inches. It is also common ground that the total width of the box of the truck was ninety-nine and one-half inches, and that there were no clearance lamps, one on each side of the front and one on each side of the rear, placed as near the top as practicable. The truck was therefore being driven on the highway in violation of the two following regulations:\nIt shall be illegal for any person to drive without permission of the Board upon any public highway, any vehicle which with the load carried thereon exceeds ninety-six (96) inches in width or one hundred and fifty (150) inches in height from the pavement or road surface; or any vehicle, including tractors with semi-trailer units exceeding the wheelbase length of thirty-five (35) feet, or any other combination of vehicles coupled together exceeding a total length of fifty (50) feet.\nClearance Lamps. Every Public Service Vehicle or Commercial Vehicle having a width, including the road thereon, in excess of eighty (80) inches at any part, shall carry four clearance lamps in a conspicuous position as near the top as practicable, one on each side of the front which shall cast a green light only, and one on each side of the rear which shall cast a red light only. The lights so used shall be visible in normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of at least five hundred (500) feet and during the period between sunset and sunrise or at any time when the atmospheric conditions are such that objects on the public highway are not plainly visible at a distance of three hundred (300) feet, the same clearance lamps shall be alight.\nThe appeallant was driving his truck on a public highway, and it is not disputed that the truck exceeded the allowed width of ninety-six inches, by three and one-half inches.\nCounsel for the appellant strongly urged that the marks seen on the south side of the road were a sure indication that the truck was being driven entirely on the right of the centre line of the highway. These marks which were only eight to ten feet long are not however as revealing as suggested by the appellant. The truck which came to a stop on the north side of the road, travelled approximately seventy-five yards or more after the accident, and there is nothing to show that the place where they were seen, is opposite the place where the accident happened. Moreover, there was a heavy traffic on that particular highway that same night, and the evidence does not disclose that they are the marks of the truck. The trial judge himself does not seem to believe that the evidence on this point is conclusive. He says in his reasons for judgment:\u2014\nIf the marks observed by Ross represent the position of the right dual wheels of the truck, then the extreme left side of the truck was to the right of the centre line. Exhibit 5 contains the measurements necessary to make this calculation, and Ross' figure of 5 ft. 9 inches from the south shoulder should probably be reduced because a foot or two of this distance could not be regarded as a travelable portion of the road.\nIf the learned trial judge had thought that these marks had really been made by the truck, he would surely not have said that the evidence was so conflicting, that it was impossible to choose. Moreover, they have been observed at a distance of five feet nine inches from the extreme south shoulder of the road. The distance between the outer edges of the outer hind wheels is eighty-two inches. That would mean that the left hind wheels were at a distance of twelve feet and seven inches from the south shoulder, and therefore, over the centre line. To this must be added more than ten inches being the overhanging portion of the box over the rear wheels. But an attempt has been made to show that Ross took his measurements from a point which was not on the travelling portion of the road. I have come to the conclusion that this evidence is unsatisfactory and cannot help the Court to reach a conclusion.\nAs already stated, the respondent John Nickel was unfortunately unable, on account of his injury, to give his version of the accident, but from the known facts, I think it is possible to draw the logical inference to reach a proper conclusion.\nCharlesworth, The Law of Negligence, 2nd ed., says at page 22:\nThere is evidence of negligence if the facts proved and the inferences to be drawn from them are more consistent with negligence on the part of the Defendant than with other causes.\nAnd at page 22 also (footnote (e)) he adds:\u2014\nIt is necessary for the plaintiff to establish by evidence circumstances from which it may fairly be inferred that there is reasonable probability that the accident resulted from the want of some precaution which the defendant might and ought to have resorted to.\nIn Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada v. Griffith 12, Mr. Justice Duff as he then was says:\nI will not put in my own words the second observation; but will quote the words of the Lord Chancellor in Richard Evans & Co. v. Astley (3):\n\"It is, of course, impossible to lay down in words any scale or standard by which you can measure the degree of proof which will suffice to support a particular conclusion of fact. The applicant must prove his case. This does not mean that he must demonstrate his case. If the more probable conclusion is that for which he contends, and there is anything pointing to it, then there is evidence for a court to act upon. Any conclusion Short of certainty may be miscalled conjecture or surmise, but courts, like individuals, habitually act upon a balance of probabilities.\u201d In a more recent case, New York Life Ins. Co. v. Schlitt 13, it was said at page 300:\u2014\nAll the circumstances of the case, as revealed by the evidence, lead me to the conclusion that the respondent has brought himself within the provisions of the double indemnity clause of the policy. In Jerome v. Prudential Insurance Company of America (1939, 6 Ins. L.R. 59), Rose C.J. said: \"Nothing, practically, can be proved to a demonstration, and courts act daily, and must act, upon a balancing of probabilities.\"\nThe appellant was driving a truck having a width of ninety-nine and one-half inches, or eight feet nine and one-half inches. At the least the left side of his truck was very-near the centre line, if not overhanging, he was driving without clearance lights, a truck wider than the width authorized by the regulations, and in view of the absence of clearance lights, it is fair to assume that the driver of the passenger car was deceived as to the exact location of the truck on the highway. The two head-lights of the truck between which there was only a distance of thirty-two inches, would rather indicate to an oncoming motorist, that he would meet an ordinary passenger car, having a normal width. There was nothing to warn an ordinary prudent man, that the vehicle that was coming, had a width of nearly nine feet, and that he had to take additional precautions. This violation of the regulations constituted a menace on the highway, and Nickel had the right to assume that the law was being observed. As it has been said by Lord Atkinson in Toronto Railway Company v. The King 14 :\nBut why not assume these things? It was the driver's duty to do them all, and traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less upon the assumption that the drivers of all the other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets.\nIn Baldwin v. Bell 15, Mr. Justice Cannon speaking for the majority of the Court, dealt with a case where some of the circumstances were quite similar to those with which we have to deal. At page 5, he says:\u2014\nWe agree with the trial judge that the real cause of the accident was the overhanging rack which occupied more space than would an ordinary motor car. We also believe that in the parallel position which the two cars occupied at the time of the accident, the plaintiff would have suffered no injury, had it not been for the overhanging of the rack on the respondent's truck. The appellant drove his car in such a manner as to pass safely the vehicle coming in the opposite direction, if it had been of ordinary, and not of abnormal width.\nAt the foot of page 5, Mr. Justice Cannon adds:\u2014\nThe care to foe exercised must depend on the nature of the vehicle, the character of the highway and the general circumstances of the case.\nAt the foot of page 6, he further says:\nWe therefore reach the conclusion that the defendant Hay owed a special duty under the circumstances of the case, on a foggy night, to the appellant, on account of the wide vehicle under his control.\nIn the case of His Majesty The King v. Demers 16, the statement of facts at the same page is the following:\u2014\nOn the evening of the 18th July, 1929, the respondent's late husband, Lucien Robillard, while driving his automobile on the Sherbrooke-Magog highway, and approaching Magog, met a tractor belonging to the Department of Roads, which was towing a scraper designed to level the surface of the road. One part of the scraper extended about ten or twelve inches farther to the left than the side of the tractor, and it is assumed that the deceased collided with that part of the scraper, as a result of which he lost control of his machine, which turned over three times and did not come to a stop until it had reached a distance of 200 feet behind the tractor. The driver, the late Robillard, was almost instantly killed.\nAnd at page 486, Sir Lyman Duff says:\u2014\nI agree with the learned trial judge that the arrangement of the lights upon the vehicle that Bolduc, the Servant of the Roads Department, was driving, when the mishap occurred in which the husband of the respondent lost his life, was calculated to mislead the drivers of automobiles met with on the road; and that the servants of the Road Department were guilty of actionable negligence in proceeding along the road in such circumstances.\nI have come to the conclusion that under the circumstances of this case, taking into account the width of the truck, the determining cause of this accident is the failure by the appellant to have clearance lights as provided for by the regulations, which are obviously enacted to prevent accidents on the highways. If the appellant had complied with the regulations, the driver of the passenger car would have seen the overhanging edges of this truck, and the accident would have been avoided.\nI agree with the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smith, Egbert & Smith.\n1 (1949) 1 W.W.R. 62.\n2 (1949) 1 W.W.R. 62.\n3 (1949) 1 W.W.R. 62.\n4 [1932] S.C.R. 620.\n5 (1941) 3 W.W.R. 909.\n6 [1942] S.C.R. 366.\n7 (1930) 47 T.L.R. 39 at 45.\n8 (1919) S.C.

This will involve an examination of the prior art to determine the value of the advance made by the patent in question.\nHeld: further, that the Commissioner in determining compensation based his award on a wrong principle, therefore the case should be returned to him to continue his inquiry applying thereto the principles set out in the judgment of this Court.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, 1, allowing an appeal to that Court from a report of the Commissioner of Patents.\nThe facts of the case and the questions in issue are stated in the judgment now reported.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. and Gordon F. Henderson for the appellant.\nChristopher Robinson and Eric L. Medcalf for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The respondent was the owner of five Canadian patents. It petitioned the Commissioner of Patents to report a reasonable compensation payable to it pursuant to the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 6982 of the 4th of December, 1940, by reason of the use by His Majesty and Switlik Canadian Parachute, Limited, of inventions covered by the five patents. The latter company had received a letter of idemnity from His Majesty under such Order in Council whereby His Majesty became responsible to pay to the patentee reasonable compensation for the use of the inventions.\nThe Order in Council provided that His Majesty shall pay to the owner of any patent, used in the manner above mentioned, such compensation as the Commissioner of Patents reports to be reasonable for the use aforesaid of the invention or design covered by such patent or registered industrial design, and that any decision hereunder of the Commissioner of Patents shall be subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nThe Order in Council refers to Section 19 of the Patent Act, 1935. It will be convenient to reproduce that section now.\n19. The Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, 'paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner report\u00ae to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the Commissioner, under this section shall be subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nThe Commissioner of Patents reported that a reasonable royalty for the use of the inventions would be $2 per parachute pack, comprising the body harness and container, and a royalty of 25 cents for container replacements and $1.75 for harness replacements.\nThe royalty per unit was fixed on the finding of the Commissioner that a royalty rate of five per cent on the first five thousand parachutes and 3.75 per cent on those in excess of five thousand was a reasonable royalty in the circumstances, and that the base upon which rate should be calculated to achieve a reasonable royalty per unit was $52, representing the cost of the harness and the container. He excluded from the base the cost of certain items shown by the prior art.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court allowed the appeal and fixed a royalty per unit of $8 2. In fixing such amount, the learned President affirmed the report of the Commissioner that a royalty rate of 5 per cent on the first five thousand parachutes and 3.75 per cent on those produced in excess of five thousand was a reasonable royalty rate in the circumstances. He held, however, that the royalty rate should be based upon the selling price of the parachute, including the canopy and other items rejected by the Commissioner, namely $200. The President declined to consider the prior art in determining the scope of the claims.\nThe evidence adduced by the respondent before the Commissioner of Patents consisted of an affidavit of the president of the respondent company and seven exhibits thereto. The affidavit and exhibits sought to establish a royalty rate of 10 per cent with a reduction to 7\u00bd per cent for parachutes in excess of ten thousand based on the selling price of parachutes. Exhibit 1 to the affidavit related to the countries in which the respondent had corresponding patents. Exhibits 2 to 6 were royalty agreements made by the respondent under peace-time conditions with proposed manufacturers of parachutes in various countries.\nThe appellant submitted in evidence a binder of prior art applicable to each of the five patents relied upon by the respondent. Evidence was given by an employee of the Department of Finance on the cost of producing parachutes.\nThe number of parachutes ordered by the appellant up to the commencement of the proceedings was 55,682. Compensation is payable up to the date of the institution of these proceedings for the use of 47,720 parachutes.\nThe parties agreed as to certain facts and admissions introduced at the hearing before the Commissioner.\nIt will be observed that P.C. 6982 does not prescribe any fixed procedure before the Commissioner.\nThe appellant asked leave to introduce further evidence before the Exchequer Court. The motion was rejected except that two further prior art patents were admitted. The President held that the Exchequer Court, being a Court of Appeal, should not consider the matter de novo.\nIn its answer to the petition the appellant admitted the validity of the patents and use by His Majesty for the purpose of the hearing. The grounds for appeal to this Court are based on the following alleged errors in the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court:\u2014\n1. The learned President refused to consider the prior art in ascertaining the inventions for which reasonable compensation is payable with the result that compensation was fixed with respect to the art as a whole rather than on the contribution to the art [made by the inventors.\n2. Compensation was fixed on the value of parachutes rather than the inventions.\n3. The learned President held that the breadth or narrowness of the claims in the patents in issue could not be relevant.\n4. The learned President failed to appreciate that a claim in a patent is an instrument of limitation.\n5. The learned President failed to distinguish the authorities applicable to the determination of the validity of claims from cases relating to the fixing of compensation.\n6. The learned President gave undue weight to authorities relating to the payment of damages for infringement in determining compensation for a statutory right to use an invention.\n7. The learned President failed to appreciate the significance of s. 33 of The Patent Act, 1935.\n8. The learned President based compensation on the selling price of the parachute rather than on cost price as based by the Commissioner.\nIn its petition the respondent relied on five patents covering inventions used by the Crown.\nPatent No. 255,164 was issued to the respondent for a period of eighteen years from the 3rd of November, 1925, on an invention entitled \"Body Harness for Aviators\". The basis of the invention is a relationship of straps constituting a body harness, the straps consisting of a U-shaped main supporting strap. This patent expired on the 3rd of November, 1943.\nPatent No. 273,872 also issued to the respondent for a period of eighteen years from the 13th of September, 1927, was on an invention entitled \"Parachute Pack\", and expired on the 13th of September, 1945.\nPatent No. 304,445 was issued to the respondent on an invention for a period of eighteen years from the 30th of September, 1930. The invention relates particularly to a parachute apparatus having a coupling means in the pack enabling ready attachment between pack and harness. The coupling means constitutes an improvement in detachable packs. The patent expired on the 30th September, 1948.\nPatent No. 355,200 issued to the respondent for a period of eighteen years from the 7th of January, 1936, was on an invention which relates particularly to an adapter and adjusting means and to an improvement in the strap means to which a connector may be attached. A second feature is the provision of a strap means to fit into the quick release. This patent is still in force and will not expire until the 7th of January, 1954.\nPatent No. 355,647 was issued to the respondent on an invention for a period of eighteen years from the 28th of January, 1936. The invention consists of a keeper or coupling device. The coupling means consists of a metallic portion holding the snap fastener in position. The keeper means consists of a metallic spring-like gripping socket and holds the snap fasteners of the harness in a fixed position. This patent is still in force and will not expire until the 28th of January, 1954.\nI do not find it necessary to go into the details of the several claims in these five patents. There is no doubt that the true nature of the claim is that it should be considered as an instrument of limitation. In Electric and Musical Industries, Ld. et al v. Lissen, Ld. 3, Lord Russell of Killowen at p. 39 stated:\u2014\nThe function of the claim is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed, so that others may know the exact boundaries of the area within which they will be trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not claimed is disclaimed.\nand at p. 41:\nThe office of a claim is to define and limit with precision what it is which is claimed to have been invented and therefore patented.\nUnquestionably in considering the report which he must make to the Government of Canada and in order to arrive at a reasonable compensation for the use of the patented invention, the Commissioner must give due regard to the real invention\u2014the contribution or step in advance which the patentee has made\u2014and the due effect of this consideration should not be obscured by the language in which the claim is clothed. (Herman v. Youngstown Car Mfg. Co. 216 Fed., 604).\nMoreover, the ambit of the invention must be circumscribed by the claims at the end of the specification. It is to these claims that the public are entitled to look in order to ascertain the limits of the monopoly granted. Smith Incubator Co. v. Selling 4, per Duff, C.J. See also the quotations from authorities in The B.V.D. Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Celanese, Ltd. 5.\nIn this case it is unnecessary to examine the patents from the point of view of their validity, because the latter has been admitted by the appellant and the respondent accepted that admission and acted upon it in the case.\nNow, it should be said that in combination patents the novelty, or the advance, for which the patent is granted, is the combination itself, quite independent of the elements which compose it. (See Harrison et al v. The Anderston Foundry Co.) 6.\nIt follows that the Commissioner, in basing his award upon rates representing only the cost of the harness and the container, and excluding from the basis the cost of certain items shown by the prior art, established the amount of the compensation to be paid to the respondent on a wrong principle. The patents were issued for the complete article represented by the combination and not solely for the harness and the container. This would follow the principle set forth in Meters, Ld. v. Metropolitan Gas Meters, Ld. 7 and in this Court in Colonial Fastener Co. Ltd. et al v. Lightning Fasterner Co. Ltd. 8.\nThe respondent was entitled to compensation on the basis of the complete parachute equipment, as such was the article for which the patents were granted and not solely the harness and the container.\nI would think, therefore, that by calculating the royalty per unit limited to the harness and the container and not calculated on the complete parachute, the Commissioner acted upon a wrong principle. This gave the respondent the necessary justification for appealing to the Exchequer Court by force of Section 19 of the Patent Act. If, therefore, the learned President in his judgment had proceeded on the ground that the Commissioner's report was based on such wrong principle, I would think that his judgment should be upheld; but, in allowing the appeal, the learned President himself proceeded on what I think, with respect, were other wrong principles. After all, all that he did in his judgment was to apply the rates already adopted by the Commissioner to the whole article instead of only to some component parts of it and, as a result, to fix a royalty per unit of $8, stating that such an amount per parachute equipment unit would, having regard to the circumstances, including wartime conditions, be reasonable compensation to the respondent for the use by Switlik of the inventions covered by the patents.\nBut, not only did the learned President increase the royalty per unit and fix the rate at $8\u2014he applied it to the amount of the selling price of the parachute equipment instead of to the cost price, which was the basis adopted by the Commissioner. In doing so, the President had absolutely no other evidence than Mr. Waite's affidavit already referred to, and which also was the only evidence of value placed before the Commissioner. Indeed, a motion was made on behalf of the appellant for leave to introduce, on the hearing of the appeal before the learned President, evidence that the devices disclosed in certain patents are practical and useful devices, and also for leave to introduce, on the said hearing, certain patents as part of the prior art relating to other patents. This application for leave was made under Rule 30 of the General Rules and Orders of the Exchequer Court which provides that the Court in any appeal shall have full discretionary power to receive and hear further evidence.\nFrom the affidavit of Gordon Fripp Henderson filed by him in support of the application on behalf of the appellant, it appears that leave was sought to bring expert opinion before the Court in order to meet certain statements made by counsel for the petitioner (respondent) in the course of his argument before the Commissioner of Patents.\nIn a written judgment dated the 9th of February, 1944, the learned President stated that, as he understood the matter, the statements made by counsel for the petitioner merely drew counsel's own inferences from the material that was before the Commissioner. The President saw no good reason why the respondent (the appellant in the Supreme Court of Canada) should have the right, on an appeal, to meet such inferences by expert evidence which could have been called before the Commissioner. He was of the opinion that there was not sufficient ground shown by the Crown to support that part of the application and it was accordingly refused. In my opinion the learned President acted properly in that respect.\nThe learned President went on to say that the Court , reserved its right to require further evidence if on the hearing of the appeal it should deem such further evidence necessary.\nAs to the second part of the application requesting leave to introduce, on the hearing of the appeal, certain patents, which were not before the Commissioner, Mr. Henderson's affidavit showed that these patents had been brought to his attention since the date of the hearing before the Commissioner. As no objection was raised by counsel for the appellant in the Exchequer Court (respondent in the Supreme Court of Canada) to the introduction of these patents, the learned President, in the circumstances, granted that part of the application.\nTherefore, the only other evidence placed before the Exchequer Court consisted of these additional patents, introduced to show the status of the prior art. But when the learned President came to consider the judgment he should render he arrived at the conclusion that the Commissioner had erred and had applied the wrong principle by referring at all to the prior art and also upon that ground he allowed the appeal. With respect, I am unable to agree. Evidently, in the circumstances, the prior art was not to be looked at for the purpose of discovering whether the patents had been anticipated and were therefore invalid. This became unnecessary from the moment the Crown admitted the validity of the patents. But, to my mind, the Commissioner very properly referred to the prior art in order to ascertain the importance of the advances made by the patents owned by the respondent company. That was an element in fixing the value of the patents and the compensation to which the respondent was entitled. In that respect my opinion is, therefore, that the judgment a quo is wrong when it said that in considering the prior art for the limited purpose above mentioned the Commissioner acted upon a wrong principle.\nIt would follow, therefore, that the Commissioner erred when, in estimating the compensation to be paid to the respondent, he applied the rate to be adopted by him only to the harness and the container. He should have applied it to the value of the whole parachute equipment.\nOn the other hand the learned President erred in deciding that the Commissioner should not have referred to the prior art, which, of course, the Commissioner considered not for the purpose of reaching a conclusion that the patents were invalid, but for the purpose of ascertaining the importance of the advance made by the patents of the respondent. The result is that the jugment of the learned President cannot be upheld on this latter ground.\nBut, with due respect, the learned President made another fundamental error. Having come to the conclusion that the report of the Commissioner was based on a wrong principle, he himself proceeded to fix what he considered a reasonable compensation for the use of the respondent's patents. This, in my view, he could not do, 'both on the factual material before him and on legal grounds. By Section 19 of the Patent Act the Commissioner of Patents is the persona designata to report to the Government of Canada the reasonable compensation for the use of any patented invention used by the Government. That section ascribes the power and duty to fix a reasonable compensation to the Commissioner alone. True, it adds that the decision of the Commissioner \"shall be subject to the appeal to the Exchequer Court\"; but these words are not in any way different from the right of appeal from an arbitrator's award in, let us say, railway matters. There is a right of appeal in those matters, but it has always been considered that such right is limited to the question whether the arbitrator proceeded on a wrong principle, or whether there had been irregularities or illegalities in the course of the arbitrator's proceedings. I do not see any distinction that can be made in the material sense between the report of the Commissioner of Patents and the award of a railway arbitrator.\nIn Canadian National Railway Co. v. Harricana Gold Mine, Inc. 9 Kerwin J., delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, at p. 393 said:\u2014\nThere is no doubt that this Court will not interfere on a mere question of quantum unless it is satisfied that the amount allowed is clearly excessive or just as clearly too small. The King v. Trudel 10 (from which decision leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused). In my opinion the allowance in the present case is clearly excessive. What is more important, however, is that in fixing the value of the lands expropriated as if they had been subdivided into lots, the trial judge proceeded upon a wrong principle and that is always a ground upon which this Court will set aside an award.\nIn many cases the matter would be remitted to the Exchequer Court of Canada but in order to save the parties that expense, I have examined the record and, by piecing together certain bits of evidence, I have concluded that sufficient appears to warrant an allowance of $250 per acre.\nIn The King v. Northumberland Ferries, Ltd. 11, the procedure outlined by Kerwin J. as being the one usually followed, was adopted by the full Court. It having been found that the trial judge had erred in applying a wrong principle in reaching his award, the case was returned to the Exchequer Court for the purpose of ascertaining the value on the proper basis. It is true that one of the grounds for so acting was that the evidence in the record was insufficient to enable the Court to ascertain the value; but I think it can be stated that in expropriation cases such as the Northumberland case and such as the present case, the rule is that once the appellate court conies to the conclusion that the arbitrator has based his award on a wrong principle, the court will not, of itself, proceed to determine the true amount upon the principles which should have been adopted, but will return the case to the arbitrator (in the present instance, the Commissioner of Patents) so that he may ascertain the value on the proper basis as directed by the appellate court. Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v Lacoste et al 12.\nIn addition to the question of law there is the further point against the procedure adopted by the learned President that he had not before him sufficient evidence to enable him to modify the amount of compensation fixed by the Commissioner.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed and the case returned to the Commissioner of Patents in order to enable him to report to the Government the proper compensation which it should pay for the use of the respondent's patents in accordance with the present judgment. The appellant should have no costs throughout.\nTaschereau, J.\u2014I would allow the appeal without costs, and refer the case back to the Commissioner of Patents. Rand, J.\u2014Section 19 of the Patent Act, 1935 provides:\u2014\nThe Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the Commissioner under this section shall be subject to the appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nThe function of the Commissioner, in such a case, is administrative with judicial features: he is to report: he does not sit as an umpire between litigants: he is to conduct an inquiry in the course of which he may resort to any source of information relevant to his purpose. There is no question then of onus on any party interested, whether Crown or patentees; but obviously they will have the right to present to the Commissioner whatever may be pertinent to the object in view. The extent of the matter on which the report is based is primarily for the Commissioner; the report is his and so in general must be the strength of its justification; but the provision of appeal necessarily implies a superintendence in the courts to ensure the observance of fundamental requirements in the determination of the property rights of the subject against the State.\nThe principle applied in the course of administering a similar provision of the Patents Act of Great Britain is that reasonable compensation means such price or consideration \"as would foe arrived at between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms\": First Report of Commission printed in Awards to Inventors, Graham, p. 114. It is one that has long been applied in certain cases of expropriation and ultimately rests on the judgment of the tribunal drawn from all of the surrounding circumstances.\nWhere, as here, the patents are held independently of any governmental relation and are for a safety means in public transportation where danger risks are high, there has been presumably a commercial judgment of the money value of the improvements covered by the patents which would be of cardinal importance to the adjudication. The Crown, in answer to the details of contracts between the respondent and various third persons containing terms including royalties payable by licensees for manufacture and sale with exclusive privileges, brought before the Commissioner the specifications of over sixty-five patents dealing with parachutes and issued between 1912 and 1934; and it was oh the footing of such material that the award of the Commissioner was made.\nMr. Gowling contends that the compensation is to represent the fair value of the real inventions in the combinations presented here, and that unless the advance in the art which they have made is ascertained that value cannot be estimated. I think this contention sound, but I cannot agree that the mode of establishing it adopted before the Commissioner is sufficient. There is no evidence beyond the specifications that any one of these invention's ever saw actual use; and from that paper foundation to ask a tribunal not only to deduce the new benefits conferred by them but also to determine their value is in the absence of evidence that no other source of assistance is available, to place upon it a task which the statute does not contemplate.\nWhere, as here, there is commercial competition in patented instrumentalities, the whole field of commercial result is open. The competitive prices, their relation to the function of the particular devices and to the efficiency of competing devices, their market demand, and in short the entire commercial data of the business, would be direct\" and realistic evidence of relative values and consequently of related royalties. Such a survey would furnish authoritative information of the value of ideas which have survived the tests of use and practicality. After all, demonstrated utility remains the arbiter of commercial value; neither technical skill nor subtle solution can of itself furnish that measure.\nThere is another aspect to be taken into account. The parties are to deal with each other on equal terms. Considering that, in the absence of a statutory provision, the granted monopoly would not apply against the Crown, the compensation is a recognition that the inventor should receive fair compensation for his own creation even when the Crown is making use of it for public purposes. But it would be incompatible with that conception to allow him to exploit the emergencies of that public. On the other hand, the same principle will not exact from an inventor a greater relative contribution to the country's necessities than from any other citizen. The terms, there- fore, should disregard national exigencies and 'be ascertained as if in normal conditions and as if the State like an individual were at liberty to bargain or not as it might see fit.\nThere is also the consideration that the inventions with which we are concerned are related primarily to human safety, to the elimination of all possible risks to which persons using airplanes may be exposed. The commercial judgment of preference for one contrivance as against another may be based upon a relatively small difference in dependability or in risks met; but because of the objective sought, that difference may take on marked significance and importance and become associated with the entire means employed. Such a judgment will reflect also those practical insights which emerge in experience as well as the relation of the necessities of safety to those of cost. Such a working and balanced understanding would seem to me to be a most reliable source from which to draw the conclusion which the statute requires.\nI am unable to follow either the Commissioner or the President of' the Exchequer Court in the preliminary ascertainment of a rate or percentage as something in some degree absolute which will thereafter be applied to a subsequently ascertained base money value. What the inventor is to receive is a sum of money related to the invention used; and the base value, whether cost or selling price of either the whole or part of the apparatus embodying the invention, is obviously bound up with the rate or percentage to be used. Base values as in practice adopted are limited in number and can be accurately ascertained; and being fixed upon, the important question, to which the evidential matters are relevant, becomes that of the highly variable percentage.\nThe foregoing conception of the function of the Commissioner and of the considerations which should guide him in estimating the compensation was not, I think, fully applied in what was an inquiry of some difficulty. I think, therefore, it should be referred back to the Commissioner to take such further evidence of the nature indicated as he may consider necessary. There will be no costs in this Court or in the Exchequer Court. Estey, J.\u2014The Government of Canada in September 1940 under sec. 19 of the Patent Act, S. of C. 1935, c. 32, and Order in Council P.C. 6982\/40, authorized the Switlik Canadian Parachute Limited in manufacturing parachutes for war purposes to use five inventions patented in Canada and owned by the respondent. These inventions were in relation to the body harness, the pack or container of parachutes.\nNeither the Government's authority nor the validity of the patents is questioned in these proceedings. The only issue is the amount of compensation the Government must pay for having authorized the use of these inventions under Order in Council P.C. 6982, which in part provides:\n* * * but His Majesty shall pay to the owner of any such patent\n* * * such compensation as the Commissioner of Patents reports to be reasonable for the use aforesaid of the invention or design * * *\nThe report of the Commissioner of Patents under the foregoing was varied upon an appeal to the Exchequer Court.\nThe Switlik Canadian Parachute Limited used these inventions in the manufacture of 55,682 parachutes but as 7,962 were purchased at an agreed price including the royalty, only the balance of 47,720 are concerned in this litigation.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court confirmed the finding of the Commissioner of Patents that the appellant should pay a rate of 5 per cent on the first 5,000 parachutes produced and 3.75 per cent on those in excess of 5,000. While, however, the Commissioner held these rates should be computed on the cost of the harness and container, which he found to be $52, the learned President held that they should be computed on the selling price of the entire parachute, which he stated to be approximately $200. In the result the Commissioner of Patents fixed a flat rate of $2 per parachute while the learned President fixed the rate at $8 per parachute.\nI am in agreement with the learned President that the Commissioner erred in applying the provisions of sec. 33 of the Patent Act. This section provides that one who obtains an improvement patent acquires thereby no right to make, sell or use the original invention. No such question is raised in these proceedings and this section has no relevancy.\nThe patentee himself may grant to another a license to make, sell or use his patented inventions. In the circumstances of this case the Crown in exercising its authority under sec. 19 and Order in Council P.C. 6982 may with propriety be described as a statutory licensee. The position of the Crown as such was commented upon by the Royal Commission in Great Britain charged with fixing terms for the use by the Government of inventions under sec. 29 of the Patent & Designs Act, 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 29 as amended): Graham, Awards to Inventors, p. 114. The positions of the compulsory licensee and the Government exercising its authority under sec. 29 while not identical are sufficiently alike in regard to the ascertainment of the compensation as to make the decisions under the former helpful. Consolidated Wafer Co. Ltd. v. International Cone Co. Ltd., 13; Celotex Corp. et al v. Donnacona Paper Co. 14; In the Matter of Applications by Brownie Wireless Co. Ld. ,15; National Electric Signalling Co. et al v. U.S. 16.\nThese authorities, and others that might be cited, make it clear that the royalty may be upon the cost price or the selling price. It may be so much per unit or, indeed, a fixed amount. These are but methods of assessing or expressing the compensation as determined. Mr. Justice Luxmoore in the Brownie Case, supra, would fix the compensation by determining \"how much are manufacturers who are anxious to make and deal with the patented article on commercial lines ready and willing to pay.\" The Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors at p. 114 stated:\nBut, when and so far as the Crown had admittedly decided to avail itself of this statutory license, and the only remaining question is as to the terms of user, the proper interpretation of the section would seem to be that such a fair and reasonable price or consideration should be fixed for the user as would be arrived at between a willing licensor and willing licensee bargaining on equal terms.\nThe Royal Commission fixes the terms of user upon the basis of a fair and reasonable price or consideration. It will be observed in Canada that under Order in Council P.C. 6982 the Commissioner of Patents is asked to fix \"such compensation.\" It may well be that when some specific item is in question the precise construction of the word \"compensation\" must as here used be determined, but such is not here raised nor does it detract from the fact that in general the same items would be included under both statutes.\nThe foregoing tests indicate both what the amount should be and, where a competitive market exists, the method by which it might be determined. Under the circumstances of war there was no such market but the Government in effect asks the Commissioner to reconstruct a market by selecting and giving consideration to all the items that the willing licensee and willing licensor bargaining in that market would take into account. The amount so computed is at least contemplated by the foregoing Order in Council.\nThe Commissioner of Patents in fixing the royalty of 5 per cent and 3.75 per cent considered the terms of the many agreements the respondent had made with foreign governments and companies. These agreements were exhibited to the affidavit of the president of the respondent company, the last paragraph of which stated:\nTHAT from my experience in negotiating the above mentioned royalty contracts and other negotiations with 'manufacturers in the United States I am able to say that in the industry of manufacturing parachutes a royalty of 10 per cent of the selling price is regarded as a reasonable royalty, subject to a reduction to 7\u00bd per cent on any parachutes in excess of 10,000 per year.\nThese agreements were made prior to the war when production was relatively small and at least some of which were negotiated under such commercial relationships as to largely eliminate the competitive factor. The Commissioner of Patents concluded that the patentees were satisfied with the annual revenue derived from parachutes prior to the war and accepted that annual revenue as a fair index in computing the new royalty. He then took into consideration the increased number of parachutes under the circumstances of war and determined the royalty of 5 per cent on the first 5,000 parachutes and 3.75 per cent on the cost price of the harness and container. This would not appear to be a determination of the royalty upon a basis of the foregoing tests suggested in either the Brownie Case or the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. The terms of these contracts might well be considered but only as one item along with the others.\nThat which is regarded as the most important factor in determining the compensation under the circumstances that here obtain is the value of the inventions as used in the parachutes. This must depend upon what advantage the incorporation of these inventions in a parachute gives over those parachutes in which they are not embodied. The value of that advantage would be determined under normal conditions in the market \"between a willing licensor and willing licensee bargaining on equal terms.\" It here cannot be determined by a mere perusal of the specifications of earlier patents. Such a perusal may be useful in determining the extent and nature of the difference between that which existed prior to and that which existed after the inventions in question, but the commercial usefulness and the value of the one over the other is a matter of evidence directed to the use and utility of the inventions in question over those which existed prior thereto. This involves an examination of the prior art not to determine what advance had been made in the art but the value of the utility of that advance made by the patents in question.\nThe Commissioner, proceeding as he did without regard to the tests above-mentioned, proceeded upon a wrong principle. The learned President, while recognizing the importance of use and utility, sought to determine compensation by adopting the royalty as fixed by the Commissioner and then computing the compensation on the basis of the selling price; in doing so he did not subject the relevant facts to the tests above suggested. Indeed, as I view the principle that underlies the determination of the compensation, the main consideration is the value of the inventions as essential parts of the completed parachute as compared with parachutes without them. This, as already intimated, involves a question of evidence that was not before either the Commissioner or the learned President.\nIt is essential that the inventions be accurately defined. This definition is found in the claim. The Commissioner treated all as improvement patents. The learned President held at least three to be combination patents. These three were Nos. 255,164, 273,872 and 304,455. On this issue I am in agreement with the learned President. I am also in agreement with the view that the whole matter should be remitted to the Commissioner for the purpose of determining the compensation.\nThe appeal should be allowed without costs.\nLocke J.\u2014The record of the proceedings held before the Commissioner of Patents does not disclose the nature of the arrangements under which Switlick Canadian Parachute Limited manufactured the body harness, parachute packs and other parachute apparatus which gives rise to the claim. Under sec. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935, the Government of Canada may at any time use any patented invention and is required to pay to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a reasonable compensation for the use thereof. In the award of the Commissioner he refers to Order-in-Council P.C. 6982 made on December 4, 1940, as amended by P.C. 11081 on December 8, 1942, whereby it was provided, inter alia, that if the Minister of Munitions and Supply on behalf of His Majesty should agree to indemnify any person, firm or corporation against any claims or proceedings for the infringement of any patent, no claim should be instituted by the patentee for infringement, but His Majesty is required to pay to the owner of the patent such compensation as the Commissioner of Patents reports to be reasonable for the use of the invention. This Order-in-Council was passed under the powers granted by the War Measures Act and provided in like manner as does s. 19 that the decision of the Commissioner should be subject to appeal to the Exchequer Court. In the absence of any evidence in the record, I assume it to be the case that the Switlick Company as the nominee of the Crown manufactured the equipment and that the matter is to be treated as an inquiry under s. 19.\nBy s. 4 of the Patent Act, 1935, the Commissioner of Patents in the discharge of his duties under the Act is vested with all the powers that may be given by the Inquiries Act to a commissioner appointed under Part 2 thereof. There were apparently at the time this inquiry was made in 1943 no rules prescribing the procedure to be followed. In the absence of any such regulations, the Irving Air Chute Company Inc. filed a petition in which, after asserting that it was the owner of the five Canadian patents hereafter more particularly referred to, it was alleged that His Majesty had purchased large numbers of articles covered by the said patents from the Switlick Company and had agreed to indemnify that company against any claim for infringement and had thus become liable to the petitioner under the Order-in-Council to pay such compensation as the Commissioner might report to be reasonable for the use of the inventions. The petition alleged further that His Majesty had also purchased large numbers of articles covered by the patents from the petitioner and had by contract agreed to pay for such articles an amount specified and, in addition, such amount by way of royalty as should be determined to be payable in respect of the articles manufactured by Switlick. This document was not in the nature of a pleading and in the absence of any applicable rules no answer was required on behalf of His Majesty, though the situation would now be otherwise under the Patent Rules, 1948. However, a document in the nature of an answer was filed admitting the validity of the patents and that the inventions claimed had been used by His Majesty and stating certain other matters relevant to a consideration of the value of the inventions covered by the patents in question. S. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935, in my opinion, contemplates an inquiry by the Commissioner of the nature of those usually conducted by commissioners appointed under the Inquiries Act. In such an inquiry, in the absence of regulations to the contrary, its scope and the extent of the disclosure required should be determined by the Commissioner. The present proceeding appears to have been conducted as if it was in the nature of an ordinary action where the petitioner assumed the position of a plaintiff and the Crown that of a defendant and, in the result, the inquiry has been far from complete and did not, in my opinion, provide the Commissioner with the information requisite to enable him to properly discharge his duties.\nThe petitioning company is incorporated in the United States and has its principal office at Buffalo, N.Y. In support of its claim an affidavit of George Waite was filed which disclosed, inter alia, that free type parachutes and harness embodying what were designated as basic inventions covered by two of the patents in question are standard equipment in the Air Forces and commercial air services in at least thirty-six countries and for many years were the only free type parachutes used or issued there and that in all of the said countries, except the United States, the improvements covered by what were called the subsequent patents are embodied in the standard free type parachutes so used. The affidavit further stated that the company had \"effective contracts\" made with concerns in Austria, Canada, Sweden and Finland, France, Spain, Yugoslavia and Great Britain calling for royalties computed as a percentage of the selling price of the parachute equipment varying from 7\u00bd per cent to 12\u00bd per cent in the case of all of these countries other than Spain, where the existing contract provided for a royalty of $30 per unit. All of the contracts referred to were made prior to the outbreak of the war in 1939. In the case of the Canadian and British contracts, the former was made by the petitioner with Irving Air Chute Ltd., a Canadian corporation having its principal office at Fort Erie, Ont., which, it is perhaps fair to assume, was a subsidiary of the petitioner; and in the case of the latter with a subsidiary, by name Irving Air Chute Company of Great Britain, which company in turn contracted with the British Government. In the case of the French contract which was said to have been executed in 1935, the identity of the licensee is not disclosed by the affidavit. Whether the licensees in France, Austria, Sweden or Finland, Spain or Yugoslavia, or any of them, were subsidiaries of the petitioning company is not stated. Evidence of existing royalty agreements, assuming that the patents which the licensees were permitted to utilize were for the inventions covered by the five Canadian patents in question or some of them, was relevant but, in the absence of more information than was given by the affidavit of Mr. Waite and by the documents produced, its weight was very slight. Where the arrangements were made with wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries of the petitioning company, the disclosure of the stipulated royalties might not afford any accurate indication of what could be realized for the use of the inventions in the market. The British contract made by the petitioner was admittedly with its subsidiary and while the nature of the arrangement between the British subsidiary and the British Government for the supply of this equipment, in anticipation of the outbreak of the war and during its progress, would have been of material assistance this information was not given. These are matters which, in my opinion, should have been fully inquired into to enable the Commissioner to properly discharge his duties. In addition to producing these contracts, Mr. Waite stated in his affidavit that in the industry of manufacturing parachutes a royalty of ten per cent of the selling price was regarded as a reasonable royalty, subject to a reduction of 7\u00bd per cent on parachutes produced in excess of 10,000 a year.\nIn addition to this material, written admissions made by the parties were filed with the Commissioner which included a statement that the price of a parachute before the war was about $325, and that in the contract of September 18, 1940, made between the petitioner and the Crown the price was $175 plus sales tax and royalty. In addition, the petitioner admitted that prior to the date of any of the patents in question harnesses of various kinds for parachute packs were known, that various forms of packs for parachutes were known and canopies of various forms and that none of the claims of the patents in question contained claims to the canopy itself, but asserted that they did contain claims to the canopy in certain designated combinations. It was also shown, as might be expected, that there had been a tremendous increase in production of parachutes for the Air Force after 1939. Between 1935 and 1939, 1,138 parachutes of all types had been purchased while between October 1939 and September 1943, 55,682 had been ordered.\nOn behalf of the Crown the material submitted to the Commissioner consisted of the admissions above referred to, the evidence of an accountant as to the manufacturing costs of both the Switlick Company and the Fort Erie Company and the production and filing of copies of a large number of patents issued in Canada and elsewhere to other patentees of parachutes and parachute equipment. As to these, no inquiry was made as to their practical utility or whether any of the equipment was being or had been manufactured under the patents, or as to the price at which the equipment could be produced, or the terms upon which licenses could be obtained to use any of the patents produced. In my opinion, the inquiry made in this matter was quite inadequate. I think the rule adopted by the Royal Commission appointed in England to determine the nature of the awards to be made to inventors of whose inventions the Crown had made use during the period of hostilities is the proper one to be followed by the Commissioner in discharging his duties under sec. 19. According to the first report of that Commission which is contained in Mr. J. P. Graham's work Awards to Inventors, the principle upon which the Commissioners proceeded was that a fair and reasonable consideration for such user should be such an amount of money as would be arrived at between a willing licensor and a willing licensee bargaining on equal terms. The burden of obtaining the information necessary to enable the Commissioner to come to a sound conclusion lay upon him, in the absence of regulations to the contrary, and not upon the parties to the dispute.\nThe proceedings before the Commissioner are not in the nature of claims for infringement. The five Canadian patents in question were all issued and have remained subject to the right of user reserved to the Crown on terms that reasonable compensation for any such use should be paid. The petitioner, judging from the material filed, considered that such compensation should be computed as a percentage of the selling price of the complete parachute for the reason that it is said that in commercial practice royalties computed in this manner are paid. Other than the statement of Mr. Waite, information as to this is entirely lacking. Since the Commissioner is charged with the duty of seeing that the petitioner receives fair treatment, full information as to this should be obtained. I find difficulty in appreciating why the compensation payable by the Crown under circumstances such as these should be determined in this manner. The petitioner claims no patent right in the main parachute, the pilot parachute or the kit bag and these, in so far as the petitioner was concerned, might have been manufactured for the Crown by some other contractor with impunity. An examination of the cost figures submitted shows that a large proportion of the cost of manufacturing the complete parachute lies in these three items and presumably a like proportion of the selling price would be attributable to them. If the quantum of the compensation is to be fixed as a percentage of the selling price, it is presumably that portion of the selling price attributable to that portion of the equipment, the manufacture of which would in the case of a commercial manufacturer amount to an infringement of the patent, and if it is computed upon this basis substantially the same result is produced as the award of the Commissioner.\nI think, however, without expressing any opinion as to quantum, that to restrict the compensation to the percentage awarded by the Commissioner on either the cost or the selling price of the body harness, accessories and container only, may well result in an inadequate award. There is no principle of law which required the Commissioner to determine the amount of the compensation as a percentage of either the cost or the selling price of the entire parachute apparatus or of any part of it. The cost of producing an improvement to a patented article or producing a part of a machine, the use of which may amount in combination with other known equipment to a patentable invention, is not necessarily a factor in determining its worth. In the Royal Commission's first report to the British Government, mention is made of a claim dealt with before it for the use of an attachment to the Vicker's gun which in practice enable the rate of firing to be at least doubled, and so was of the utmost value in the short bursts of fire between fighting aeroplanes and which was adopted as standard equipment. The cost of the attachment averaged about 10 s. 6 d. and any ordinary percentage of the rate allowed in commercial practice would have been grossly inadequate. The award made was the sum of \u00a310,000. As to such of the patents in question here as were admittedly for improvements only, the result of their use, for all the evidence indicates, may have been to convert a dangerous and cumbrous piece of equipment into one of the very highest value and, if that were so, I do not consider that the cost of manufacturing such improvement or the price at which it was purchased by the Crown should be used as a yardstick to determine what was fair compensation for its use.\nThe Commissioner was, in my opinion, entitled to examine the other patents filed with him but the inquiry should have extended to ascertaining whether the parachutes and parachute equipment referred to had proven practical in use, whether they were available or might have been made available at the outset of the war and, if so, upon what terms. Assuming there was other available satisfactory equipment, a comparison of it with the parachute equipment using the inventions of the petitioner would be of assistance in estimating the value of the petitioner's patent in use. While under s. 29 of The Patents and Designs Acts, 1907-1939, which provides in part that a patent shall have to all intents the like effect as against His Majesty the King as it has against a subject, it might be arguable that a claim for loss of profits or other damages might lie in England, there can be nothing of that kind here, in my opinion, under s. 19 of the Patent Act, 1935. The claim of the petitioner in the present matter is not for damages for infringement but to settle the amount of the reasonable compensation for the user of the inventions by the Crown in the exercise of the right reserved. In determining the compensation the Commissioner of Patents is at liberty, in my opinion, to make either a lump sum award, as was done in the case of the invention for the improvement of the Vicker's machine gun, or a fixed sum per unit of the parachute equipment in question, or a percentage of either the cost or the selling price of either the entire equipment or of the body harness, accessories and container only, provided the Commissioner is of the opinion that this method would result in the payment of reasonable compensation for the use of the patents upon the basis above indicated. In the award of the Commissioner the following passage appears:\nThe annual revenue derived from parachutes prior to the war was apparently acceptable to the patentees and that annual revenue may be taken as a fair index in computing the-new royalty.\nand this view appears to have affected the quantum of the award. The amount of the annual revenue realized (presumably by the appellant before the war) was irrelevant to the inquiry, in my opinion.\nI would allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and refer the matter back to the Commissioner of Patents to continue his inquiry for the purpose of obtaining whatever information he considers necessary to determine the difficult question which has been referred to him, upon the principle above indicated. Under the circumstances there should be no costs either of this appeal or in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed without costs and case referred back to Commissioner of Patents in accordance with the reasons of the members of the Court.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Watt, Osborne & Henderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n1 1947 Ex.

Gilliham, [1949] S.C.R. 637\nDate: 1949-06-24\nWare's Taxi Limited And Elizabeth Doets (Defendants) Appellants\nand\nCarol Ann Gilliham Et Al (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1949: April 26; 1949: June 24.\nPresent: The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nMotor vehicles\u2014School Taxi\u2014Negligence\u2014Degree of care required\u2014 Child failing through opened door\u2014Safety devices\u2014Supervision\u2014 Allurement.\nThe five year old respondent fell out of appellant's taxi, when the door opened, as she was being transported from school in pursuance of a contract between the school and the appellant taxi company. The taxi was a 4 door sedan, the door had the standard push button lock and there was no evidence of any defect in it or in the door. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that the infant plaintiff or one of the other children in the car must have played with the plunger and opened the door. There was evidence that the plaintiff had on previous occasions fiddled with the push button. On the day of the accident, while the car was stopped, the driver had noticed the plaintiff playing with the button and had ordered her to cease and to stand back from the door. The child obeyed and the driver made sure that the button was down and the door securely locked and fastened. The trial judge dismissed the action and the Appellate Division reversed his decision and ordered a new trial limited to an assessment of damages. Held, affirming the Appellate Division (Rand and Locke JJ. dissenting), that the appellant was negligent in conveying these children in this 4 door sedan without safety devices and no greater degree of supervision than could be exercised under the circumstances by the driver, as the push button and the handle constituted an allurement to the children and a reasonable man should have anticipated this attraction and the resulting danger.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the (Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, reversing the dismissal of the action by McLaurin J. and ordering a new trial limited to the assessment of damages.\nL. R. Fenerty for the appellants.\nA. W. Hobbs for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I agree with my brother Estey and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an action for damages arising out of an injury suffered by Carol Ann Gilliham, daughter of the respondent Ernest James Gilliham, when she fell out of a taxi owned by the appellant Ware's Taxi Limited while it was proceeding on Centre Street near 2nd Avenue in the City of Calgary at about 5.15 p.m. on the 17th of June, 1946.\nCarol, about five years of age, was attending the Christopher Robin Kindergarten and Preparatory School in Calgary. Fees charged by this school covered the cost and thereby it assumed the responsibility of conveying the children to and from the school and their respective homes. In February 1946 in discharge of that responsibility the school entered into a contract with Ware's Taxi Limited to convey the children in the morning, at noon and after school. The school is not a party to this action and therefore any question as to its liability or the terms of the contract between it and the appellant Ware's Taxi Limited is not in issue. The appellants, therefore, accepted these children, from about three to six years of age (with possibly a few up to eight), as passengers and were thereby under a duty to exercise reasonable care in their conveyance. The appellant Ware's Taxi Limited employed in this work some four or five taxis about four and a half hours per school day. At other times these taxis were used in their regular taxi service.\nThe taxi in question was a 1942 4-door Dodge Sedan. Each of the doors was equipped with the usual handle for opening as well as a push button which when down locked the door in a manner that prevented it being opened from either the inside or the outside. Miss Doets, an experienced driver who had been transporting the children since the contract was made in February, deposed that she was always careful to see that the push button was down before starting the automobile.\nIt was under the terms of the above contract that on the afternoon in question the appellant Elizabeth Doets, employed by appellant Ware's Taxi Limited, was driving the taxi. She left the school with some seven or eight children in the taxi. Two or three had already been left at their respective homes leaving about five in the taxi when proceeding along Centre Street Miss Doets noticed Carol playing with the push button on the right rear door. She \"told her to stand away from the door and she did.\" Miss Doets at that time made certain the push button was down and continued. When she had gone about a block that door opened and Carol fell out suffering the injuries for which damages are here claimed.\nIn both the Trial and Appellate Court 2 it has been accepted as a fact that Carol or one of the other girls had raised the push button and operated the handle permitting the door to open. The push button, the handle and locking device on the door, so far as the evidence discloses, were in good condition. When, therefore, the doors were closed and the push button down the children were safe but if the push button was raised and the handle moved the door would open.\nThe question is therefore whether the push button and handle constituted an allurement to these children and should a reasonable man anticipate both that they would attract children, who, if they meddled therewith, would be in a position of peril. As stated by Lord Macnaghten in Cooke's Case 3, is the push button and the handle \"attractive to children and dangerous as a plaything?\" Every person must be taken to know that children are likely to meddle with what comes within their reach, and this knowledge may ' impose a relatively higher degree of duty to take care on any one who leaves that which may be dangerous, if meddled with, in a place where it is probable that children will reach it, than if there was no such probability.\nHalsbury, Vol. 23, p. 584.\nIt must therefore toe assumed that Ware's Taxi Limited and its employees were aware of the natural curiosity of children which would lead them to investigate whatever might attract and was within their reach in the automobile.\nHamilton, L.J., later Lord Sumner, in Latham v. R. Johnson & Nephew Ltd. 4, stated:\nWhat property must the chattel possess to make the consideration of its attractiveness to children relevant? It must be something which, from its nature or state, will draw children to it and induce them heedlessly to put it into operation.\nThis push button was within easy reach of every child in the rear seat of the automobile. Moreover, that it could be raised up and pushed down was made evident to each child every time the driver of the automobile opened or closed that door. The operation of the push button and the handle were being constantly brought to their attention. In these circumstances it would toe expected that the children would be drawn toward them and \"heedlessly to put them in operation.\"\nMoreover, that there is a danger or a circumstance of peril when children are placed in the rear seat of a 4-door sedan is supported by the evidence. Some parents take the precaution to purchase the 2-door type. Other parents, however, equip their 4-door sedans with safety devices and prior to the war and again at least in 1947 some of these devices were upon the market. Three of them were before the Court at the trial. An automobile could be equipped with the most expensive of these for about $10. Moreover, these devices were not complicated and anyone with mechanical ability could place a workable device upon an automobile which would insure the door remaining closed even if the children should meddle or play with the push button and the handle.\nA representative of another taxi company called as a witness said, \"we have at times transported children\" from two other kindergartens without either a safety device upon the rear doors or any supervision. A taxi owner called as a witness stated that he had transported children for two organizations in Calgary, one for a period of two years and the other four months, using eight cars and making four trips per day. He had only the push buttons without any safety device upon the rear doors. The children, however, that he transported were of ages from four to ten years. He stated that the younger children were placed in the front seat with the driver, and then, \"we do make a point to have the old children look after the doors,\" or as he again stated, \"we put a couple of the older kiddies to watch it.\" The appellants took the precaution of placing the younger children in the front seat but this left children usually up to six years of age entirely by themselves in the back seat with only such supervision as the driver in the circumstances might find it possible to exercise.\nThe foregoing indicates that parents and at least one taxi owner appreciate the need for either safety devices or supervision when young children are being conveyed in a 4-door sedan. That these devices have been developed and placed upon the market would suggest that the apprehension of danger is generally recognized.\nThe possibility of an automobile rear door opening without being meddled with is very remote. The precautions suggested above are taken because of the propensity of small children to meddle with that which attracts them. It would, therefore, appear that a reasonable man, assuming an obligation to transport children from the ages of about three to six years in a 4-door sedan equipped with push button and door handle, as in this case, would foresee the possibility of these small children meddling or playing with the push button and the handle and foresee the danger or peril consequent upon their doing so and would take such precautions as would either prevent them playing with the push button and the handle, or if they did so, remove the possibility of dangerous consequences ensuing.\nThe conduct of Carol in meddling with the push button while the automobile was en route on the day in question, and upon previous occasions when she had reached her destination and was anxious to get out to play, was important only in so far as it may have drawn the attention of appellants to this possible danger and to indicate the natural propensity of children. She being a child of about five years of age her conduct would not be accepted as constituting in law contributory negligence. Merritt v. Hepenstal 5; Beven on Negligence, 4th ed., p. 196.\nThe appellants also submitted that they were using taxi cabs with standard or approved equipment which would negative the negligence here alleged on their part. That they were using the standard or approved equipment for the transportation of other than young children is not here in issue. Counsel on appellants' behalf cited MacLeod v. Roe 6, where the provision of standard equipment for customers was held under the circumstances to be sufficient. In that case the principle applied in McDaniel v. Vancouver General Hospital 7 was followed. In the latter the defendant acted in accord with the \"general approved practice.\" The appellant Ware's Taxi Limited had been operating under this contract from February to June. A representative of another taxi company deposed that they transported children \"at times,\" while a taxi owner who had the longest experience in transporting children did provide some supervision. This evidence does not establish either that there is any \"general approved practice\" or that there is what may be properly described as standard equipment for the transportation of young children in 4-door sedan automobiles, and therefore it cannot be contended that the appellant Ware's Taxi Limited was acting within the scope of either of the foregoing cases.\nNeither can the appellants' submission that they were acting in accord with the custom among taxi companies in using this 4-door sedan in the transportation of these children be accepted. It is true that evidence of established practice or custom may be adduced for the purpose of rebutting an allegation of negligence but in order to establish such it must have been a practice over a long period of years. In the case cited by appellants of Rothschild v. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. 8, Pollock, C.B., referred to the particular mode of conveyance \"for a great number of years,\" and in Hart v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry Co. 9, the period was twenty years. The evidence here does not establish any such custom or practice.\nIt would appear that Shrimpton v. Hertfordshire County Council 10 is more in point. There a child was injured while being transported in a school conveyance. The jury found that it was negligence not to provide supervision other than that of the driver. The Lord Chancellor (Loreburn) stated at p. 147:\nThey (the jury) have found that it was not a reasonable and proper way for the county council to convey children to school in this vehicle without a conductor or some adult person to take care of them. It is said that there is no evidence in support of this finding. To my mind it is a question which any man of the world can answer by the exercise of his own common sense and his knowledge of life.\nIt would therefore appear that the appellants in conveying the children in the above described 4-door sedan, without safety devices and no greater degree of supervision than could be exercised under the circumstances by the driver, were negligent.\nIn reversing the judgment at trial dismissing respondents' action the Appellate Court ordered a new trial limited to an assessment of damages. In my opinion the judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nThe dissenting judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal 11 arises have been stated, and I will not repeat them. It is, I think, unquestioned that from the standpoint of the actual undertaking of the appellant there was no failure in performance. Both the school authorities and the parents of the respondent, as well, I have no doubt, as all the other parents, were fully aware that the children were being carried in a taxicab with ordinary safety devices, though under the care and oversight of a selected chauffeur. This had continued for over six months during which the automobile would be at each home and at the school four times on every school day.\nThe serious question then is whether the standard of care imposed by law on such a relation called for further mechanical or other devices or an attendant. If the terms of the actual undertaking were inadequate, the safety of a child could not be jeopardized even with the consent of his guardians. The test is what the reasonable and prudent person, if his mind was directed to the matter, would accept as being all that could fairly be required in the circumstances. That judgment, of course, would take into account the potential dangers from speed and movement in the traffic conditions in which the automobile moved and the means of safety by which the child was protected against them.\nOrdinarily a reasonably intelligent parent can be taken to foresee all risks likely or remotely possible to his young child in any situation more sensitively than another and if we find parents uniformly, freely and voluntarily accepting a course of conduct in others involving risks to their young children, could there be a better test of the reasonableness or sufficiency of the actual care in the particular case? That principle was applied by this Court in the case of Ouellet v. Cloutier 12. There, a young boy had gone to a neighbouring farm where threshing was in progress. He was standing on the floor of a shed in the presence of the owner, the defendant, a few feet from the machinery as it was slowing down at the end of the day. In a moment of wilfulness he darted to the moving belt and in endeavouring to slow it down caught his hand on the wheel and was injured. The defendant was acquitted of negligence because he had acted as the boy's father in the same situation would have done. Similarly here: the act of the child was not the expectable or likely act: it was a conceivable act, no doubt, but as done it was wilful and impulsive and in the circumstances beyond the range of reasonable anticipation that called for added safeguard.\nNow, although the acquiescence by the parents in the carriage of their children in the manner adopted here may not be conclusive of that standard, yet when associated as it is with the acceptance of similar services both in Calgary and other places in Canada and in the absence of a syllable of evidence gainst it, I feel bound to find its security to be reasonable: it was adequate to the risks.\nIf it had been feasible by adding a convenient device that had become generally used as an additional precaution, a new element in the realized standard would have been added; hut although two or three mechanisms have appeared on the market, which were claimed not to have been available during the time in question, the public have not taken them up. The door, of course, might be locked with a key, but there are flaws in all perfection of one dimension, and in that case there would be not only intolerable inconvenience but also new dangers in case of accident.\nIt is an everyday occurrence in Canada and the United States that parents set off in their automobiles with young children in the rear seat. It is frequent that little ones \"pile in\" for a short pleasure trip. The doors uniformly, as in this case, have double catches and safety lock and within that protection they enjoy the ride. It would confound a neighbour who with the consent of a parent had taken a young child along with his own for a short run to find himself the victim of a crippling lawsuit because in a moment of wantonness the young child had opened a car door and fallen out. And the duty of care toward such a child in that case would in this respect be the same as in this. Settled over this physical security of lock and catches is the presence of the adult who exercises the authority and oversight of the parent. That was the case here. But the most assiduous surveillance is not absolute insurance against impulse or perversity; there is always an irreducible margin. With insignificant exceptions, children are sufficiently within control by what was furnished here just as they are within their own home, and no other accident of this nature, so far as known, had ever before happened in Alberta; and the searches of counsel have not revealed a similar reported instance in the many services of this sort carried on in the United States.\nThe injury to the child may be a permanent scar upon a young life, but unfortunately in the multiplying risks and perils of this age these misfortunes occasionally happen as their inevitable result. But I can imagine no sounder or more realistic appraisal of reasonable safety than the long continued acceptance by parents of protective conditions against hazards into which they allow their children to be taken by strangers. Even hindsight supports that here because for some time after the accident the child continued to be carried under the same conditions in the taxi.\nIn the reasons of Ford, J.A. in the Court of Appeal 13, the principle of allurement as applied in Cooke v. Midland Railway 14 is invoked, but I am bound to say that I cannot see that it is appropriate to the facts. In Latham v. Johnson 15, Hamilton, L.J. enquires into the qualities or characteristics of the thing or article which give to it the incriminating attractiveness. On p. 419 he says that the chattel \"must be something highly dangerous in itself, inherently or from the state in which its owner suffers it to be;\" and later that \"it must be something which, from its nature or state, will draw children to it and induce them heedlessly to put it into operation.\" There is nothing of that sort here. The safety catch is merely the small button which is pressed down to prevent the handle of the door from being used and pulled up to release it: in itself it is quite harmless. What opened the door was the pressing down of the handle. I think it quite out of the question to speak of these ordinary and familiar bits of mechanism, with which certainly the child here was thoroughly well acquainted, as \"fascinating and fatal.\" The principle is aimed against setting a trap for children, treating them in this respect as governed by an irresistible curiosity or desire or impulse, quite analogous to the holding out of bait to an animal.\nI agree, therefore, with McLaurin, J. who tried the case. The appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cairns & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Patterson, Hobbs & Patterson.\n1 (1948) 2 W.W.R. 991.\n2 (1948) 2 W.W.R. 991.\n3 [1909] A.C. 229.\n4 (1913) 1 K.B. 398 at 419.\n5 (1896) 25 S.C.R. 150.\n6 [1947] S.C.R. 420.\n7 (1934) 3 W.W.R. 619.\n8 (1852) 18 L.T.R. 334.\n9 (1869) 21 L.T.R. 261.\n10 (1911) 104 L.T.R. 145.\n11 (1942) 2 W.W.R. 991.\n12 [1947] S.C.R. 521.\n13 (1948) 2 W.W.R. 991.\n14 [1909] A.C. 229.\n15 (1913) 1 K.B. 398.\n",

The King, [1949] S.C.R. 647\nDate: 1949-04-12\nWalter Grant Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1949: March 23; 1949: April 12.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Kellock JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION.\nCriminal Law\u2014Accused charged with manslaughter arising out of operation of motor vehicle\u2014Trial judge directed jury to return verdict of not guilty of manslaughter and to consider if reckless driving proven\u2014Whether jury satisfied itself that accused was not guilty of manslaughter, and since this a condition precedent, whether it had jurisdiction to consider offence of reckless driving\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 285 (6), 951 (3).\nSection 951 (3) of the Criminal Code provides that, upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, the jury if satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under s. 285 (6), may find him guilty of that offence.\nThe appellant was charged with manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge in charging the jury told them there was no evidence to support the manslaughter charge and directed that they bring in a verdict of not guilty on that count but left with them to determine whether or not the appellant was guilty of reckless driving.\nHeld: that the jury in returning a verdict of not guilty of manslaughter, followed the judge's direction on a question of law as it was their duty to do; therefore the terms of the statute were met and their verdict meant that, although acting in conformity with the judge's direction and their duty, the jury was satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division 1 which dismissed his appeal, (Richards C.J. dissenting), from a conviction and sentence for reckless driving.\nR. V. Limerick for the appellant.\nH. W. Hickman for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I have had the privilege of reading the reasons of my brother Kerwin, and I fully agree with them. The appellant contends that the words \"if they are satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter\", as applied to the jury in subsection (3) of section 951 of the Criminal Code, should be construed as introducing into the Code an entirely different procedure from that which obtains in respect of any other offence dealt with in the Code.\nIt is too clear for words that upon the trial of an indictable offence the law is the province of the presiding judge and the findings of fact are the province of the jury. Indeed the jury has no other jurisdiction but to decide the facts, and in matters of law they must follow the directions of the judge.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant herein would have this court decide that the use in subsection (3) of section 951 of the words \"if\" (they the jury are) \"satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter\" brought into the Code an entirely different intention of Parliament, and that these words should be held to mean that the jury alone is to announce its decision that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter and the trial judge, in the instance, is deprived of any right to pronounce upon the law and to direct the jury in accordance with the law.\nIn the present case, the learned judge charged the jury to the effect that there was no evidence to support the charge of manslaughter and directed the jury to find a verdict of not guilty on that charge. Counsel for the appellant accordingly contends that that was contrary to the provisions of subsection (3) of section 951, and for that reason the trial was abortive.\nIn doing what he did the learned judge followed the practice outlined by this Court in Walker v. The King 2, where it was decided that \"the proper practice is for the trial judge to direct the jury to acquit\" insofar as the charge of manslaughter was concerned. See also The King v. Comba 3.\nThe contention of the appellant's counsel would really lead to the conclusion that subsection (3) of section 951 should be treated as a law by itself and should not be governed by the other sections of the Criminal Code. But, although subsection (3) is new law, adopted by Parliament in 1938, it is, nevertheless, a part of the Criminal Code; and, of course, standing by itself, it would not be workable, unless all the sections of the Code are considered to be applicable to it and to the method and procedure whereby it is to be operated.\nAs was pointed out in The Queen v. Morris 4, at p. 95:\nIt must foe remembered that it is a sound rule to construe a statute in conformity with the common law, rather than against it, except where\nor so far as the statute is plainly intended to alter the course of the common law.\nAnd in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edition, p. 112, it is stated that \"to alter any clearly established principle of law a distinct and positive legislative enactment is necessary.\" Such a rule was applied in this Court in the case of La Banque Canadienne Nationale v. Carette 5.\nIt is quite clear, therefore, that there is nothing in subsection (3) of section 951 indicating the intention of the legislator to submit charges within that subsection to be dealt with in the criminal machinery in a way different from that which obtains in all other criminal cases.\nIn returning a verdict of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter, of course, the jury in the present case was following the direction of the presiding judge on a question of law, to wit, on his statement that there was no evidence adduced in the case to support a charge of manslaughter, but in doing so they were acting in accordance with their duty, as it has always been understood, in the application of the Criminal Code in this country; and their verdict that the appellant was not guilty of manslaughter meant that they were satisfied with that result within the meaning of subsection (3).\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Kellock, JJ. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.: The appellant was charged with manslaughter by wilful misconduct while driving an automobile on the public highway. There had been a previous trial, at which there was a disagreement of the jury. On the second trial, the appellant called no evidence and in his address to the jury, counsel for the Crown stated that there was no evidence sufficient to justify a verdict of manslaughter but suggested that the appellant might be found guilty under subsection 6 of section 285 of driving recklessly or in a manner dangerous to the public. The trial judge agreed with the statement of Crown counsel and while it is argued that in his charge he withdrew manslaughter from the jury, what he actually did was to direct the jury that they must bring in a verdict of not guilty. In so doing, he was following the proper practice, where he decides there is no evidence to go to the jury: Walker v. The King 6.\nThe only point in the appeal may be put thus. Since the trial judge removed from the jury any consideration of the evidence on the manslaughter charge, it cannot be said, in the words of subsection 3 of section 951, that the jury were \"satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter.\" It is true that in returning a verdict of not guilty of that charge, the jury were only obeying the directions of the judge on a question of law but as it was their duty to follow those directions, the terms of the statute are met; that is, although acting in conformity with the judge's directions and their duty, the jury were satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nTaschereau J.: Section 951(3) of the Criminal Code reads as follows:\n(3) Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury, and in the province of Alberta a judge having jurisdiction and sitting without a jury, if satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection six of section two hundred and eighty-five may find him guilty of that offence and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.\nThe \"included offence\" in the above section is the following:\n285(6) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an offence and liable\n(a) upon indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine; or\n(b) on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine.\nThe appellant was charged with manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, and he was tried before Mr. Justice Leblanc and jury, in September, 1948.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution, the learned trial judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury the charge of manslaughter, and directed them to find the accused \"not guilty\" of manslaughter. He further added: \"There is no more charge of manslaughter for you to consider\". The jury retired and the appellant was found guilty of \"reckless driving\", which is the offence described in section 285(6) Cr. C. This conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Richards dissenting 7.\nIt is submitted on behalf of the appellant, that the jury had no jurisdiction to render such a verdict, because before reaching such a conclusion, the jury must satisfy themselves that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter, and as the consideration of a finding on the manslaughter charge had been withdrawn from the jury, there was no jurisdiction to consider \"reckless driving\".\nI am of the opinion that this contention fails. It is the duty of the trial judge, when the evidence does not disclose an offence, to withdraw the charge from the jury, and it is also the duty of the jury to accept the direction of the judge. The words found in section 951(3) that \"the jury * * * if satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection (6) of section 285 etc.\" do not mean only that the jury may be satisfied that the facts do not reveal a crime of manslaughter; these words also mean that the jury may be satisfied that in law there is no manslaughter, and the trial judge is the only competent authority to advise them on that matter. This is what happened in the present case, and the jury having been satisfied that in law there was no offence of manslaughter, could properly bring in a verdict of reckless driving.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Limerick & Limerick.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Subsection (c) is divided into two parts. The first part applies to a person who conducts or manages any scheme for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of what tickets are, the winners of any property so proposed to be disposed of. The second part applies to every person who conducts or manages any scheme by which any person upon payment of any sum of money shall become entitled under such scheme to receive from the person conducting or managing such scheme a larger sum of money than the sum paid by reason of the fact that other persons have paid any sum under such scheme.\nIn construing subsection (c), it must be read with the preceding subsections and therefore the words \"so * * * disposed of\" in the first part refer to the scheme indicated in the preceding subsections, that is, \"by some mode of chance\". The second part of subsection (c) however, stands alone. It does not refer to chance, or to mixed skill and chance, and the receiving of money is not subordinate to any of these elements. The rule of ejusdem generis therefor does not apply to it.\nSince in the charge, preferred under the first part of subsection (c), there was mixed skill and chance, there was no offence, and the appeal as to it should be allowed.\nAs to the charge preferred under the second part of the subsection, the admission of the appellant that winning estimators will receive a larger sum of money than that paid for their tickets because the non-winning estimators have contributed to the scheme, brings it within the prohibition of the Statute and the appeal as to it should therefore be dismissed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 which allowed an appeal by the Crown against the dismissal by a magistrate of two charges laid against the appellant for conducting a lottery in violation of s. 236 (1) (c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as enacted by 1943\u201344, c. 23, s. 8. (Dysart and Richards JJ.A., dissenting in part, would have dismissed the appeal as to the first charge.)\nW. B. Scarth for the appellant.\nW. J. Johnston for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The appellant was acquitted by Magistrate D.G. Potter in the Provincial Police Court at Winnipeg, in Manitoba, of the two following charges under section 236 (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nFirst charge: That John Herbert Roe, between the first day of March, 1948, and the eighth day of March, 1948, at the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, unlawfully did manage a certain scheme, to wit The Canadian Tourist Club Red River (Barrel) Derby, for the purpose of determining which holders of what tickets are the winners of certain property, to wit money proposed to be disposed of by mode of chance, contrary to section 236 (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nSecond charge: That John Herbert Roe, between the first day of March, 1948, and the eighth day of March, 1948, at the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, unlawfully did manage a scheme by which a person upon payment of a sum of money becomes entitled, under such scheme, to receive from the said John Herbert Roe, the person managing such scheme, a larger sum of money than the sum paid by reason of the fact that other persons have paid a sum of money under such scheme, contrary to section 236 (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.\nThe learned magistrate reached the conclusion, that as the scheme managed and conducted by The Canadian Tourist Club, of which the appellant was the secretary, involved a certain degree of skill, there were no offences, and he dismissed both charges.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed both appeals and fined the appellant $25 on each, or in default of payment, 30 days imprisonment. On the first charge, however, Dysart and Richards JJ. would have dismissed the appeal. The appellant now appeals to this Court. (Criminal Code 1023 (2)).\nThe scheme which gave rise to the present proceedings is fully explained in the statement filed at the trial by the appellant himself.\nThe appellant manages a club in Room 26, Marlborough Hotel, in the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, which is known as The Canadian Tourist Club Red River (Barrel) Derby. At the time the ice was to leave the Red River, approximately on the 10th of April, 1948, an oaken barrel of 45 gallon capacity, with 300 pounds of ballast, was to be placed in the Red River at the International Boundary at Emerson, then, carried by the river current to Norwood Bridge in the City of Winnipeg, and during its entire route it was to be convoyed by a party in a canoe or boat, to guard it against becoming beached on the shore or snagged or caught in bushes or other obstacles. The exact period of time taken by the barrel in its journey was to be recorded by the promoters of the scheme and their engineers. Tickets were then being sold at fifty cents each, and the purchaser of a ticket was entitled to make one estimate as to the time the barrel would take to make its journey. Attached to each ticket was a coupon which constituted Class \"B\" membership in The Canadian Tourist Club for 1948, and each coupon bore a serial number identical to the serial number on the ticket to which it was attached. This membership entitled the member to attend Club meetings and functions and take part therein, but did not entitle him to vote. The name and address of the purchaser were recorded on the stub of the ticket, and the purchase price, the sum of fifty cents, was forwarded by the particular vendor of that ticket to the scheme headquarters in Winnipeg, the copy and ticket being retained by the ticket purchaser. The purchaser was then at liberty to fill in on the ticket, his estimate of the time the barrel would take to make its journey, and was asked to forward such estimate to The Canadian Tourist Club, before 6 P.M. April 7, 1948.\nBefore the charges were laid against the appellant, quite a number of these tickets had already been sold, and it was understood that the sale of these tickets would cease prior to the day the barrel was to be released on its journey. After the barrel had completed its journey, and the exact travelling time ascertained, the ticket holder who had made the closest estimate of the time taken, was to be declared the winner, and awarded first prize, the next nearest second prize, and so on as set out on the back of the ticket. It was also admitted by Mr. Roe that the winners would receive from the scheme, a larger sum of money than that paid for their tickets, by reason of the fact that other non-winning ticket holders contributed to the scheme.\nDealing with the first charge, there can be no doubt, I think, that there is an element of chance in determining the exact period of time that the barrel would take to cover the 105 miles, which is the approximate distance between the International Boundary at Emerson, and Norwood Bridge in the City of Winnipeg.\nIt is of course obvious that on its journey, the barrel may wander from bank to bank of the river, depending on the wind and the current, and it is therefore impossible to calculate in advance the exact distance which the barrel will cover, and a participant in that scheme has therefore to resort to guess work. But, there is also an element of skill. The evidence reveals that with the information as to the distance of the course, namely 105 miles, and the average speed of the current, namely 1.92 miles per hour, an experienced Red River navigator would be in a much better position to estimate the number of hours it would take to cover the course than one entirely unacquainted with the Red River. A person capable of computing figures and putting his experience into figures would have a great advantage over the ordinary individual. Mr. Walter M. Scott, a professional engineer, testified that a 45 gallon capacity barrel, containing 300 pounds of water would be two-thirds full, and that if he were asked to make an estimate of the time such a barrel would take to float down the Red River from the point already mentioned to Norwood Bridge, he would take into consideration the distance, the average velocity of the current, the wind effect and the effect of eddies or cross currents. It is also his opinion and I believe it to be sound, that a Red River navigator would have a much better chance of making a correct estimate than one unaccustomed to the River. I believe that a man who has a reasonable knowledge of mathematics to allow him to compute and put on paper his own considerations, might make a reasonable estimation of the time the barrel would take to cover the course. There is, therefore, in my opinion a mixed element of chance and skill involved in this scheme. The first charge is based on the first part of section 236(c) of the Criminal Code, but this section must be read with sections 236, 236(a) and 236(b) and 236(bb). Section 236 is to the effect that every one who does any of the things described in the six subsections of that section, is guilty of an indictable offence. Subsection 236(a) deals with the making of any scheme for disposing of any property * * * \"by any mode of chance\". Subsections 236(b) and 236(bb) deal respectively with the selling and transmitting of tickets for any such scheme. Section 236(c) under which the accused was prosecuted is divided into two parts. The first part has been in the Code for many years and the second was added in 1935. The first part applies to a person who \"conducts or manages any scheme * * * for the purpose of determining who, or the holders of what * * * tickets * * * are the winners of any property so proposed to be * * * disposed of\".\nIt is clear to me that the words \"so * * * disposed of\" refer to the scheme indicated in the preceding subsections, that is, \"by some mode of chance\". If there is merely skill or a mixed element of skill and chance, there is no offence.\nIn Rex v. Regina Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition 2 Mr. Justice Martin said at page 135:\nUnder sec. 236 (a) and under similar provisions contained in early statutes in Canada dealing with similar matters, and under the lottery Acts of England, it has been held that \"a mode of chance\" involves the absence of any skill; in other words, if it is found that skill enters into the estimates or guesses, there cannot be a conviction under the section.\nAt page 138, Mr. Justice Martin further says:\nOnce it is admitted that a person of better judgment and better powers of observation might make a closer estimate, it is at once plain that skill plays a part, and the matter cannot be a \"mode of chance\".\nThe case of Bailey v. The King 3 has been cited, but for the following reasons given by Mr. Justice Dysart 4 I do not think that it applies:\nAnd in Bailey v. The King, 1938 SCR. 427, the Supreme Court of Canada, confirming a decision of the Appeal Court of Ontario, upheld a conviction of a drug store keeper for operating a \"skill puzzle board\". The board offered prizes for all correct answers to listed questions on obscure points of fact\u2014which questions could have been answered with unfailing accuracy if the player would make adequate research. The Court, applying its \"knowledge of the usual everyday custom of mankind\", held that \"the ordinary person entering the store would pay \"ten cents\" \"for the chance of winning a prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later with a correct answer or answers\" to one or more of them, and that therefore the price was paid not for skill, but for chance, or at least for mixed chance and skill. In that case, it is to be noted the issue was different from the issue in the present case. There the question was whether or not the accused was guilty under s. 986 (2) of having on his premises \"a means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting\"; here the issue under s. 236 (1) (c) is whether or not the accused was guilty of conducting a scheme, not of mixed chance and skill, but of chance solely. By upholding that conviction, the Supreme Court did not even pretend to say that the \"skill puzzle board\" was not a game involving some skill.\nI agree with the above observations and I, therefore, come to the conclusion that as to the first charge, the appeal should be allowed.\nThe second charge is laid under the second part of subsection (c) which, as already stated, was introduced in the Code in 1935. It applies to every person who conducts or manages any scheme, by which any person, upon payment of any sum of money, shall become entitled under such scheme to receive from the person conducting or managing such scheme, a larger sum of money than the sum paid, by reason of the fact that other persons have paid any sum of money under such scheme. This part of section 236 (c) which stands alone, does not refer to chance, or to mixed chance and skill. The receiving of money is not subordinated to any of these elements. The larger sum of money is paid to the winner by reason of the fact that other persons have paid money under the scheme.\nTo my mind, the rule of \"ejusdem generis\" does not apply. The admission signed by the appellant that the winning estimators will receive a larger sum of money than that paid for their tickets, because other non-winning estimators have contributed to the scheme, brings the case within the prohibition of the Statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal on the second charge.\nAppeal allowed as to the first charge and conviction quashed. Appeal as to second charge dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Thompson & Scarth.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. O. McLenaghen.\n1 [1948] 2.

The Attorney General of Ontario as provided by s. 1013 (4) of the Code (supra) appealed, and the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict, and ordered a new trial. On appeal to this Court\u2014\nHeld: (Rand J. dissenting), that the proper rule to be followed by an appellate court upon an appeal by an attorney general under s. 1013 (4) from a verdict of acquittal is that the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if there had been no error in law in the trial judge\u2019s charge, and that here such onus had been discharged.\nHeld: also, that there is no rule of law nor of practice that failure of counsel, whether for an accused or for the Crown, to object to a charge to a jury on the grounds of misdirection is of necessity a bar to the right of appeal. No such rule applicable in all circumstances exists, and in the circumstances of the present case, such failure by Crown counsel did not affect the right of appeal.\nPer: Rand J., (dissenting), \u201cAny ground of appeal\u201d, referred to in s. 1013 (4) of the Code, must be limited to matters in which the course of the Crown is thwarted or impeded unwarrantably by the Court. It does not arise from misdirection or non-direction where no objection was taken by Crown Counsel at the trial and there are no circumstances implicating the accused in that action.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal by the Attorney General for Ontario against the accused\u2019s acquittal by a jury on charges under ss. 276 (a) and 292 (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, a 36.\nWilfred Judson K.C. and John W. Graham for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014The charges against the appellant were laid under secs. 276 (a) and 292 (a) of the Criminal Code and the evidence adduced by the Crown, if believed, proved the commission of both offences. The girl, Doreen McMunn, aged seventeen, gave evidence that she had been induced by the appellant to go with him to a room in a hotel in Perth and that there he had beaten her severely, choked her into a state of unconsciousness, attempted to rape her and indecently assaulted her. Doctor Hagyard, a physician practising in Perth, had examined the girl on the day following the assault and found a lot of bruising on the right side of her face, her right lip cut, her neck badly swollen and her chest so badly bruised and swollen that he expected that some of the ribs or the breast bone might have been fractured. In addition to these injuries, the upper part of her arms was swollen and bruised and there was a great deal of bruising on the right side of her neck and, in the opinion of the Doctor, the force applied to her neck must have been so severe as to cause unconsciousness. Further evidence as to her injuries was given by the witness Nagle who came to the hotel room in response to the girl\u2019s cry for help and found her with a cut on her lip and on one of her eyes and the room in a state of disorder. The Chief of Police who came to the room shortly thereafter and saw the girl observed the cut on her lip and red welts on both sides of her neck. In addition to this evidence, a statement made by the appellant to the Chief of Police was put in evidence: this was to the effect that he had come to Perth that day, that he had been drinking and that while he remembered that Doreen McMunn had been in his room he did not remember what had happened or seeing the Police or leaving the hotel. He made no statement regarding the alleged offences. In the charge to the jury the learned trial judge instructed them in part as follows:\u2014\nNow as I understand the defence to both these charges, it is that the girl consented and secondly, the accused\u2019s condition from drinking, that he was drunk and so drunk that he did not know what he was doing.\nand again:\u2014\nNow, counsel for the defence has referred to several things substantiating, as he presents the defence that there was consent\u2014oh yes, there is also this, that he mentioned there is no corroboration of the essentials to this offence and it is my duty, I think, to charge you that it is unsafe\u2014I don\u2019t know there is any statute that says you must have corroboration in connection with either of these two charges, but speaking as a matter of common sense and common experience and observation and practice in the courts, it is the duty of the judge to tell you that it is dangerous, it is unsafe, to convict on the evidence of the girl alone, unless it is corroborated by other evidence implicating the accused as to the offence charged. That doesn\u2019t mean that everything, that all the essentials must be corroborated but there must be corroboration to the extent that you feel, you find there is indication of implication of his guilt of the offence charged. Now, as to both these charges, I think as to both of them, if the girl consented that is a defence with the exception I think, and my attention will be drawn to what I am saying later if it is thought I am wrong, as to the first charge, that is the one with intent to commit rape choking so as to render unconscious or incapable of resistance, that if the consent there is brought about by threats and fear so that you find, you feel you should find, it is not a real consent, then it isn\u2019t consent. Now, in this matter of consent, the mere fact the girl puts up some resistance it seems to me doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that she has not consented. She might make a mild sort of physical protest not wanting to indicate too readily a surrender of her virtue and still be willing enough that the action occur. The point for you to decide is whether or not in fact on the evidence you believe there was or was not consent, on the conduct and evidence otherwise pertinent to that.\nWhile the learned trial judge thus informed the jury that one of the defences was that the accused was so drunk he did not know what he was doing, the only evidence on the point was that of the Chief of Police who said that it was evident that the man had been drinking but that he was quite steady on his feet, his speech was quite normal and, in the officer\u2019s opinion, he was not intoxicated. As to those portions of the charge dealing with the necessity for corroboration, the learned trial judge was clearly in error. There was in law no necessity for corroboration but, had there been, there was ample corroboration in the evidence of the doctor and of Nagle and the Chief of Police of material parts of the girl\u2019s story implicating the accused. This the trial judge failed to point out to the jury. As to the instructions on the question of consent, I agree with Mr. Justice Hogg that consent would not be a defence to either charge. There were other material defects in the charge mentioned in the Notice of Appeal given by the Attorney-General but it appears to me to be unnecessary to consider them.\nAt the conclusion of the judge\u2019s charge, counsel for the Crown made no objection to it and the case went to the jury who acquitted the appellant on both charges. The important question to be determined upon this appeal is as to whether the failure to object to the charge bars the right of appeal given to the Attorney-General under sec. 1013 (4) of the Code.\nThe right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal in a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone was first given by s. 28, c. 11, Statutes of Canada 1930. As to the manner of the exercise of the right thus given to the Attorney-General, subsection 5, enacted at the same time, provided that the procedure upon such an appeal and the powers of the Court of Appeal, including the power to grant a new trial, should mutatis mutandis, in so far as the same are applicable to appeals upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed and the powers given by ss. 1012 to 1021 of the Code and to the rules of court passed pursuant thereto and to s. 576. The powers of the court on an appeal by the Attorney\u2011General are thus clearly defined as co-extensive with its powers in dealing with a question of law on an appeal from conviction. In the case of an appeal by a convicted person, a failure on the part of his counsel to object to the admissibility of material evidence was held not to prejudice his right of appeal from a conviction in Rex v. William Stirland[2]. The rule in civil matters was stated by Duff J. as he then was, in delivering the judgment of the full Court of British Columbia in Scott v. Fernie[3]. In that action which was to recover damages for negligence, questions apparently approved by counsel for both parties were submitted to a jury and a verdict found for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed, asserting as one of the grounds that a further issue of fact should have been submitted. Duff J. there said:\nIt is, perhaps, needless to say that in these circumstances, but for the legislation hereinafter referred to (i.e. s. 66 of the Supreme Court Act of British Columbia, 1904), the rule long established, which holds a litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his counsel at the trial, would preclude in this Court any discussion of the sufficiency of the findings to support the judgment. The rule is no mere technicality of practice; but the particular application of a sound and all-important maxim\u2014that litigants shall not play fast and loose with the course of litigation\u2014finding a place one should expect, in any enlightened system of forensic procedure.\nIn Spencer v. Field[4], the judgment of Davis J. with which Duff C.J.C. and Hudson J. concurred, expressly approved what had been said in Scott v. Fernie and referred to \u201cthe long established rule which holds a litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his counsel at the trial.\u201d In Wexler v. The King[5], the application of sec. 1013(4) of the Code was considered by this Court. The appellant had been tried on a charge of murder and the case presented by the Crown against him was that he had intentionally shot a woman with the intention of killing her. The contention of the defence was that the shooting was the result of an accident and the trial judge instructed the jury that if they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be acquitted, and this instruction was accepted by both counsel as correctly stating the single issue of fact which was to be put before the jury. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty but on an appeal the verdict was set aside and a new trial directed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in omitting to instruct the jury first, that from certain facts disclosed by the evidence of the appellant the jury might have convicted the accused of murder under s. 259(c) and (d) of the Code, and secondly, that the accused having in. his charge a loaded firearm and being bound to take reasonable precautions to avoid danger to human life, the jury might have convicted the accused of manslaughter under ss. 247 and 252(2). Counsel for the Crown in this Court stated that the only issue which counsel for the Crown intended to put before the jury was that in fact put before them. Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in delivering judgment allowing the appeal said that the point was not merely that the Crown did not take exception to the learned judge\u2019s charge, but that the conduct of the trial with respect to the single issue of fact which was raised by the case put forward by the Crown was admittedly unimpeachable and that the jury had been told by the Crown that the determination of that issue in favour of the accused would entitle him to an acquittal. Kerwin J. who delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court, and with whose reasons the Chief Justice also agreed, said that the real point to be determined was whether the Crown was entitled to an order for a new trial in order to present an entirely new case against the accused and pointed out that during the course of the trial nothing of the nature then sought for the first time to be advanced had been submitted for the consideration of the jury.\nIn Rex v. Munroe[6], the Attorney-General appealed from the acquittal of Munroe, who had been charged with arson, on the ground of misdirection, although no objection was taken by the Crown to the charge at the trial. Sloan J.A., now Chief Justice of British Columbia, was of the opinion that, while the failure of counsel for an accused to object to a charge was not necessarily fatal to the right of the convicted appellant to raise the issue on appeal, this did not apply in favour of the Crown on an appeal from an acquittal, saying in part:\nWhether the prisoner is defended or undefended when Crown counsel elects to go to the jury without objection to the charge, then he is, in my opinion, bound by the resultant verdict.\nand referred to the decision of this Court in Wexler\u2019s case[7]. Martin C.J.B.C. agreed with Sloan J.A. and said that the practical and grave consequences of allowing such an appeal for misdirection where no objection had been made would be that the Crown \u201cwill get a new trial because of its own oversight at the expense of the accused\u201d and said further that, in his opinion, the Court should decline to entertain the appeal because to do so would be to violate a long and well established principle of fundamental justice. MacDonald J.A. said that he preferred not to join in the view expressed by the Chief Justice that failure to object was fatal to the Crown\u2019s case and McQuarrie J.A. and O\u2019Halloran J.A. agreed with him. However, in Rex v. Fleming[8], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that the failure of Crown counsel to object to the judge\u2019s charge was a fatal objection to an appeal from an acquittal on the ground of misdirection and expressly approved the judgments of Martin C.J.B.C. and Sloan J.A. in Munroe\u2019s case. In Rex v. Rasmussen[9], Barry C.J.K.B. expressed the opinion that the failure to object to a charge on the ground of non-direction did not affect the right of appeal, though no objection was made at the time.\nThere is no rule of law nor, in my opinion, of practice that failure of counsel, either for an accused or for the Crown or in civil matters for a litigant, to object to a charge to the jury on the ground of misdirection, is of necessity a bar to the right of appeal. No such general rule applicable in all circumstances exists. In civil matters the true principle has been stated in Scott v. Fernie and Spencer v. Field. I do not think it can be said that in all criminal proceedings the principle applied in civil matters must be followed. The right of appeal given to the Attorney-General by the amendment of 1930 introduced a new principle into the administration of criminal justice, that is, that a man might under certain circumstances be tried again upon a criminal charge after having been acquitted. It would be, in my opinion, inadvisable to attempt to lay down a general rule in a matter of this nature. In the present case, the accused did not give evidence and called no witnesses and, from the terms of the charge, it is clear that it was the address of counsel for the accused that led the learned trial judge into giving the erroneous instructions on the questions of consent and corroboration. There is nothing to indicate what the nature of the supposed consent was. It can scarcely have been contended that this young girl had given her consent to being beaten, choked and indecently assaulted with violence, even if her consent would have been an answer to the charge. The Crown has discharged the onus cast upon it of satisfying the Court of Appeal that had the jury been properly instructed the verdict would not necessarily have been the same, a conclusion with which I entirely agree. The principle followed in the cases of Wexler, supra and of Savard and Lizotte[10] has here no application. Under these circumstances, I think the failure to object to the judge\u2019s charge does not affect the right of appeal.\nThis appeal should be dismissed.\nKERWIN J.:\u2014I would dismiss the appeal. I adhere to the view expressed by me in White v. The King[11], that the proper rule to be followed by an Appellate Court upon an appeal by an attorney general from an acquittal, even when such acquittal is by a jury, is that the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if there had been no error in law in the trial judge\u2019s charge.\nAs to the point that the Crown is deprived of an appeal where counsel for the Crown at the trial does not object to the judge\u2019s charge (as was the case here), I am of opinion that this result cannot follow in all cases. There may be circumstances where the result of such a failure on the part of Crown counsel would be fatal but not here.\nRAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant was charged under section 276(a) of the Criminal Code with having attempted to render a young woman of 17\u00bd years unconscious or incapable of resistance by choking her with intent to enable him to commit rape upon her. On the evidence presented by the prosecution he was acquitted. The Attorney-General thereupon appealed and a new trial was ordered.\nThe point of law on which the case comes to this Court is very simple. The acquittal was set aside because of what was considered serious misdirection and non-direction to the jury, as to which, however, there was no objection or request on the part of counsel representing the Crown; and the question is whether the Attorney-General in such a case can bring himself within the intendment of section 1013(4).\nThe right of appeal given to the Crown by that section is an innovation in the procedure of criminal law, and I have been unable to discover that it exists, certainly in the form in which the Code provides, in any other common law jurisdiction. It is such a striking departure from fundamental principles of security for the individual that I find it necessary to examine the language of the statute in the background in which it ought I think to be interpreted.\nThe subsection reads:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the Attorney-General shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\nWhat then is \u201cany ground of appeal\u201d? What are the considerations necessary to a \u201cground of appeal\u201d generally in the administration of law? That it is not equivalent to error in law simpliciter occurring in the course of proceedings, is, I should say, undoubted, but to come to any clear or definite answer to the question we must, I think, recall to mind the basic character of proceedings in judicature.\nIn the common pleas presented to courts, contests between individuals over conflicting claims, the theory of the common law is that the court resolves the dispute according to the law of the land, but in the role of an impartial arbiter: it is not of itself concerned in the merits of the conflict though it may be said to be so in the settlement of it. Either party may deal with or dispose of his private right by any of the modes recognized, including abandonment, as he pleases; he is likewise in command of his case before the tribunal, and he is bound by the presentation which he makes. He is presumed to know his legal rights, and if he stands by when he can and should object or protest against what is a disregard of prescribed rules, he is not, in general, permitted thereafter to complain of what he could then and there have had corrected or have protested. In other words, a ground of complaint must be based upon the denial of what in law he is entitled to and endeavours to assert: but being able to deal with his rights as he sees fit he will not be permitted to play fast and loose with the serious conduct of a tribunal exercising a vital function of government: Lord Halsbury in Nevill v. Fine Art Co.[12], at p. 76; Scott v. Fernie[13]. In the administration of the criminal law, the pleas of the crown, however, the underlying conception is in some respects different. The King symbolizes the \u201cfountain of justice\u201d, \u2018but at the same time there is committed to him in his executive capacity the functions of enforcing the public law against offenders. All prosecutions are in his name, i.e. they are \u201cat the suit\u201d of the King; and in a solemn proceeding it is determined by the \u201ccountry\u201d in the form of twelve fellow citizens, almost invariably representing the community in which the act has been committed and generally to which the accused belongs, whether or not the latter is guilty as charged. In that formal process the notion of an issue of \u201crights\u201d in a civil sense is out of place.\nThe characterizing feature is the scope of executive discretion. Arising from the same source as the abrogated historical power of dispensation is the right of nolle prosequi preserved in effect by section 962 of the Code, by which the Attorney-General may, at any point up to judgment, stay proceedings; and notwithstanding the right of the subject to initiate prosecutions, this power obviously puts the Crown in command of all indictments: Rex v. Edwards[14]. Then either before or after judgment the prerogative of pardon can be exercised. Finally there is the unchallengeable discretion to determine what evidence shall be presented and what not, what the form of the case put to the jury shall be and what not, what course of action shall be taken at any stage of the prosecution and what not, and just as clearly, what objections to the charge to the jury, either for what has been improperly stated or notstated at all, shall be taken or omitted. It is the matter and the form of fact which the Crown exhibits to the jury, either by way of evidence or address or of any other participation in the proceedings, including objection to or acquiescence in any act of the court, from which in the aspect of the prosecution the guilt or innocence of the accused is to be determined; and the Crown will not be held to have a ground of appeal where the matter complained of was that the trial judge had not put to the jury a case on the facts not asked for by the Crown and different from that to which the Crown limited itself: Wexler v. The King[15], followed in Savard and Lizotte v. The King[16], in which the conviction on the case put by the Crown and found by the jury could not be supported.\nAt the foundation of criminal law lies the cardinal principle that no man shall be placed in jeopardy twice for the same matter and the reasons underlying that principle are grounded in deep social instincts. It is the supreme invasion of the rights of an individual to subject him by the physical power of the community to a test which may mean the loss of his liberty or his life; and there is a basic repugnance against the repeated exercise of that power on the same facts unless for strong reasons of public policy. The position of the accused is in sharp contrast to that of the prosecution. He is charged with a violation of public law; but he is entitled to remain passive, and to have the charge proved if it can be proved only in accordance with those observances which the law for his protection has prescribed. The setting aside of a conviction or the granting of a new trial to a person who has been found guilty in circumstances in which there has been a failure in those essential requirements seems to me to be a necessary corollary of that right unless no substantial wrong has been done or unless by affirmative conduct on his part he can be said to have implicated himself in the impropriety later objected to.\nBut the abstention of the Crown in similar circumstances is quite another matter. Section 1013(4) does indeed give a right of appeal, but \u201cany ground of appeal\u201d must I think be limited to matters in which the course of the Crown is thwarted or impeded unwarrantably by the court. A failure on the part of crown counsel to object to improper or insufficient directions must arise either from a lack of appreciation of their objectionable character, or a deliberate decision for various reasons to allow matters to stand as they are. Are we then to say that that lack of appreciation is a \u201cground of appeal\u201d sufficient to supersede such a fundamental rule as that against second jeopardy? And if the omission is deliberate, have we not immediately, in an appeal, what has been termed \u201cplaying fast and loose\u201d with the court? If the ground of allowance of an appeal goes to the degree of failure on the part of the court, to the point say of apparent miscarriage, there is of course a corresponding delinquency on the part of crown counsel; and can that justify such an intolerable burden on the accused as necessarily follows? An innocent person may thus be subjected to a most crippling expense, to say nothing of the pain or humiliation. Criminal proceedings have not yet become a species of semi-respectable contests in which effects are in dollars and cents only. A prosecution is still too serious a matter to be assimilated with party litigation. The ruling which confirms the order of the court below in this case places the appeal of the Attorney-General on the same footing as that of the accused, and virtually identifies criminal with civil appeal. I quite agree that should the accused be involved with improper action by crown counsel wholly different considerations arise; but it is following a will-o-the-wisp justice, in cases in which, from a written record, the action of a jury seems inexplicable, to depart from principles long verified in experience. There is to be avoided, also, the danger of treating a case of this sort as being an adjudication between the victim and the accused. It is not that. What is being asserted is the paramount interest of the state in maintaining order and personal security. The safeguarding of that interest has been committed to public officers, and we must leave with them the manner in which it is to be vindicated. If they fail, they may call upon themselves public condemnation; but on the soundest considerations of policy, the course of judicial action should not be grounded on the court\u2019s reaction to the individual case. Surely an accused, as a condition of a definitive acquittal, is not to be forced to see that the charge is in order as against himself. He is entitled to say that he can be convicted only in accordance with the requirements of law; is he to be told that he can be acquitted only if the Attorney-General or his representative has done his duty as a court of appeal may conceive it?\nIn Rex v. Munroe[17], Sloan J.A., the present Chief Justice of British Columbia, came to the conclusion to which I am driven and with him Martin C.J. agreed. Their view was later followed unanimously by the Court of Appeal of that province in Rex v. Fleming[18].\nFor the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the right of appeal given to the Attorney\u2011General does not arise for misdirection or non-direction where no objection was taken by crown counsel at the trial and there are no circumstances implicating the accused in that action. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Daly, Thistle, Judson & McTaggart.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.B.

Only one of the actions was proceeded with and the jury's verdict, after assessing the damages, was that it was impossible to say that appellant was 100 per cent responsible. The trial judge did not render judgment on that verdict and eventually appellant settled the three claims out of court. Then appellant, by Petition of Right, claimed from respondent the amounts it had paid in these settlements together with the damages to the fire pump, alleging that respondent's employee was solely responsible for the collision. The Exchequer Court found that respondent was the only one responsible but that appellant's claim was prescribed under Art. 2262 C.C. except as to the damages to the pump. Held: As there was no legal obligation for the appellant to indemnify the victims of the accident, since the respondent alone was responsible for the collision, the moneys paid by the appellant to the victims could not be recovered from the respondent.\nHeld, also that the prescription of an action based on Art. 1118 C.C. does not begin to run until the judgment liquidating the damages or, if no judgment, until payment of the debt by one of the codebtors, as it is only then that the codebtor can recover the share and portion due by his codebtor.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., dismissing appellant's petition of right except as to damages to the fire pump on the ground that the appellant's claim was prescribed under Art. 2262 C.C.\nD.

Charbonneau, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014Le 12 avril 1944, une voiture \u00e0 incendie, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, est venue en collision avec un camion appartenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et conduit par Mlle Marguerite Thibault, qui \u00e9tait alors dans l'exercice de ses fonctions. Cette derni\u00e8re conduisait b\u00e9n\u00e9volement trois passagers, Shirley Harris, John Fleming et Eric Lawrence Brueton. Comme cons\u00e9quence de cette collision, ces derniers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9s, et ont r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al une compensation pour les blessures corporelles dont ils furent les victimes. Ils ont respectivement \u00e9valu\u00e9 leurs dommages \u00e0 $14,284.96; $12,715.44 et $3,513.50.\nSeule, l'action de Harris a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al. Le jury qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de cette cause, en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le demandeur avait souffert des dommages estim\u00e9s \u00e0 $8,699.96, mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de dire que la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e9tait responsable de cet accident dans une proportion de 100 p. 100. Le juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s n'a rendu aucun jugement pour confirmer ce verdict, et il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 qu'un r\u00e8glement est intervenu entre Harris et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al pour la somme de $4,250.00. Les deux autres r\u00e9clamations ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es pour $3,250.00 et $2,750.00. La Ville de Montr\u00e9al, dans les trois cas, a pay\u00e9 les frais. Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 ces paiements, l'appelante a produit devant la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier une r\u00e9clamation contre Sa Majest\u00e9, au montant de $13,090.58, repr\u00e9sentant les montants pay\u00e9s en satisfaction des r\u00e8glements intervenus.

M. le Juge Angers de la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que toute la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce malheureux accident reposait sur l'intim\u00e9e, mais que la r\u00e9clamation de la Ville, en remboursement des montants qu'elle avait pay\u00e9s \u00e9tait prescrite en vertu de l'article 2262 du Code. Civil. Il n'a maintenu les conclusions de la P\u00e9tition de Droit que pour la somme de $369.53, car dans ce cas, ce ne serait pas la prescription d'une ann\u00e9e, mais bien celle de deux ann\u00e9es qui s'appliquerait.\nIl importe d'abord d'examiner cette question de prescription.\nL'action institu\u00e9e par Harris contre la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, est bien, pour employer l'expression du Code Civil, article 2262 (2), \"une action pour injures corporelles\", et elle se prescrit par un an. Comme cons\u00e9quence des dommages qu'il a subis, Harris devait instituer son action contre la Ville, dans une ann\u00e9e du fait dommageable. L'accident \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 le 12 avril 1944, il \u00e9tait encore en cons\u00e9quence dans les d\u00e9lais voulus, quand il a fait signifier son action \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, dans le cours du mois d'octobre 1944. Il a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de ne pas exercer son recours contre Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi, qui serait conjointement et solidairement responsable avec la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, si les deux \u00e9taient co-auteurs du d\u00e9lit dont les victimes ont souffert (Code Civil, art. 1106). Mais il n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi; seul le recours contre la Ville a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9. La Ville a r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et a pay\u00e9 les trois r\u00e9clamations, entre mai et juillet 1945, et aujourd'hui, son action contre Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi ne peut \u00eatre autre qu'une action r\u00e9cursoire, bas\u00e9e sur les dispositions de l'article 1118 du Code Civil, qui se lit ainsi:\n1118. Le cod\u00e9biteur d'une dette solidaire qui l'a pay\u00e9e en entier, ne peut r\u00e9p\u00e9ter contre les autres que les parts et portions de chacun d'eux, encore qu'il soit sp\u00e9cialement subrog\u00e9 aux droits du cr\u00e9ancier.\nSi l'un d'eux se trouve insolvable, la perte qu'occasionne son insolvabilit\u00e9 se r\u00e9partit par contribution entre tous les autres cod\u00e9biteurs solvables et celui qui a fait le paiement.\nAll\u00e9guant que Sa Majest\u00e9 est seule responsable de l'accident, la Ville r\u00e9clame la totalit\u00e9 des montants qu'elle a pay\u00e9s en r\u00e8glement. Je suis clairement d'opinion que cette action ne se prescrit pas par une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de la date du fait dommageable ou du d\u00e9lit. La prescription ne commence \u00e0 courir qu'\u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 la Ville pouvait exercer son recours contre l'intim\u00e9e. Si le verdict du jury avait \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par un jugement, c'est \u00e0 cette date que la prescription commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 courir. Admettant que la Ville puisse exercer une r\u00e9clamation, comme il n'y a pas eu de jugement, le jour a quo de la prescription est la date des paiements vers\u00e9s aux victimes. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qui arrive dans les provinces de droit commun, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le juge adjugeant sur la r\u00e9clamation d'une victime contre des co-auteurs d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, ne d\u00e9termine pas la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9fendeurs. Il d\u00e9clare s'il y a responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe et solidaire, et c'est \u00e0 partir de ce moment que l'article 1118 du Code Civil trouve son application. Il appartient alors \u00e0 celui qui a pay\u00e9 la dette en totalit\u00e9 d'exercer son recours contre le co-d\u00e9biteur de la dette solidaire. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par cette Cour dans la cause r\u00e9cente de Th\u00e9riault v. Huctwith 1, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\nThe litigation here is merely to find if there is a joint and several liability between the tort feasors, and when this has been determined, it may not be raised again in the second action between Miss Th\u00e9riault and Brandon and Huctwith, where only the apportionment of the liability will have to be established.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il n'y a pas de jugement d\u00e9clarant la solidarit\u00e9 entre les co-auteurs du quasi-d\u00e9lit, mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les tribunaux interviennent pour que la solidarit\u00e9 existe. Du moment que les parties sont tenues solidairement, par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi, l'une des parties ainsi solidairement oblig\u00e9e, et de qui le paiement est r\u00e9clam\u00e9, peut payer volontairement, et exercer contre son co-d\u00e9biteur, les droits que lui conf\u00e8re l'article 1118 du Code Civil. C'est \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 elle effectue ce paiement que na\u00eet son droit d'agir et qu'elle peut validement exercer son recours contre ceux qui sont solidairement tenus avec elle. Avant cela, le droit de l'un des co-d\u00e9biteurs contre l'autre est plus qu'incertain. Il ne peut donc pas \u00eatre susceptible de prescription.\nDans une cause de Montreal Tramways v. Eversfield 2, la Cour d'Appel de Qu\u00e9bec a justement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nLa prescription d'une action r\u00e9cursoire, par laquelle la compagnie des tramways de Montr\u00e9al r\u00e9clame au d\u00e9fendeur des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la victime d'une collision, a son point de d\u00e9part l\u00e0 compter du jugement qui alloue les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 la victime et non \u00e0 compter de la collision.\nEt \u00e0 la page 556, M. le Juge Pratte s'exprime dans les termes suivants:\nIl me semble que le plus s\u00fbr moyen de v\u00e9rifier si la pr\u00e9tention du d\u00e9fendeur est fond\u00e9e ou non est de pr\u00e9ciser la cause juridique de l'obligation que l'appelante demande au d\u00e9fendeur d'ex\u00e9cuter. Pourquoi ce dernier serait-il tenu de payer le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9? Serait-ce parce qu'il est responsable de l'accident all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la demanderesse? Il me para\u00eet bien que non, puisque la seule all\u00e9gation de cet accident et de la faute du d\u00e9fendeur ne suffirait pas \u00e0 justifier la conclusion de la demande. Si la demande peut \u00eatre accueillie, c'est uniquement \u00e0 raison de l'obligation de payer all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la demanderesse. C'est cette obligation de payer une dette que la demanderesse pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre celle du d\u00e9fendeur, qui serait la cause juridique de l'obligation du d\u00e9fendeur. Il est bien certain que le quasi-d\u00e9lit imput\u00e9 au d\u00e9fendeur a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le n\u00e9cessaire dans la naissance de la cr\u00e9ance de la demanderesse, mais ce n'est pas lui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause juridique du droit que cette derni\u00e8re entend exercer.\nCeci doit \u00eatre, je crois, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme la v\u00e9ritable jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, si l'on tient compte surtout des remarques des autres coll\u00e8gues de M. le Juge Pratte dans la m\u00eame cause. D'ailleurs, en France, la th\u00e9orie est la m\u00eame. Planiol et Ripert (Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil, Vol. 7, page 685) s'expriment ainsi:\nLe point de d\u00e9part exact du d\u00e9lai est en principe le jour o\u00f9 est ouverte l'action en justice et o\u00f9 le cr\u00e9ancier a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pouvoir l'intenter. Un auteur plus ancien, parmi plusieurs autres, entretient la m\u00eame opinion. Vide Vazeille, Trait\u00e9 de prescription, Vol. 2, page 221:\nCelui qui, par l'effet de la solidarit\u00e9, paye pour d'autres, ne change pas la nature de leur dette. Sa reconnaissance interrompt la prescription, suivant l'article 2249; mais en payant il n'est que subrog\u00e9 au droit des cr\u00e9anciers, pour la part de ses co-d\u00e9biteurs, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1251; et si la prescription ne date plus contre eux que du jour de ce paiement, dans son nouveau cours, au moins elle n'est pas en termes diff\u00e9rents; elle est toujours, comme pour le cr\u00e9ancier primitif, de trente ans, pour le capital, et de cinq ans, pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la cause juridique de l'obligation de Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi, n'est pas le quasi-d\u00e9lit qu'on lui impute, mais l'obligation que lui impose la loi, de rembourser \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al un montant proportionn\u00e9 au degr\u00e9 de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\nJe suis d'opinion que le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de La Congr\u00e9gation des Fr\u00e8res Maristes v. Regent Taxi 3, ne s'applique pas. Dans cette cause, il n'\u00e9tait pas question de solidarit\u00e9. Seul le Regent Taxi \u00e9tait l'auteur d'un unique d\u00e9lit, o\u00f9 il y avait deux victimes: Le fr\u00e8re bless\u00e9, et la Congr\u00e9gation qui en souffrait des dommages. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'action des deux, \u00e9tant de m\u00eame nature, \u00e9tait sujette \u00e0 la prescription d'une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du fait dommageable. Le recours exerc\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas par action r\u00e9cursoire. Ici, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Il n'y a qu'une victime d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit dont il y aurait deux co-auteurs. Il ne s'agit pas de d\u00e9terminer la relation juridique entre la victime et ceux qui lui ont caus\u00e9 des dommages, mais bien les droits que peuvent exercer l'un contre l'autre les auteurs solidaires du quasi-d\u00e9lit.\nJ'en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que l'action de l'appelante n'est pas prescrite. Son droit de poursuivre Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi devant la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier est n\u00e9 non pas le jour de l'accident, soit le 12 avril 1944, mais bien dans le cours des mois de mai et juin 1945, date des paiements effectu\u00e9s. Or, comme la P\u00e9tition de Droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e le 23 juillet 1945, il en r\u00e9sulte que la prescription n'est pas acquise.\nVient ensuite la question de savoir si la Ville de Montr\u00e9al est dans les conditions voulues pour exercer l'action r\u00e9cursoire qu'elle a intent\u00e9e, et que dans sa P\u00e9tition de Droit elle appelle une action en garantie. Le verdict qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le jury n'a fait qu'\u00e9valuer les dommages subis par Harris, mais \u00e0 cause de son ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e9vidente, il ne pouvait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 par un jugement de la Cour. La Ville n'a donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer quoi que ce soit \u00e0 Harris, ni aux deux autres r\u00e9clamants, dont les actions ne sont pas venues devant les tribunaux. Le seul jugement qui d\u00e9termine la responsabilit\u00e9 de cet accident, est le jugement de M. le Juge Angers, de la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier, qui la fait reposer enti\u00e8rement sur Sa Hajest\u00e9 le Roi.\nEn assumant qu'en vertu de la loi de la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier, semblable action puisse \u00eatre institu\u00e9e, comment la Ville non responsable de cet accident, peut-elle exercer un recours en garantie, ou instituer un action r\u00e9cursoire contre l'intim\u00e9e? Le recours en garantie n'existe que pour se faire rembourser que ce que l'on est l\u00e9galement tenu de payer (Archibald v. Delisle 4), et l'action r\u00e9cursoire que l'on pr\u00e9tend exercer, ne serait ouverte \u00e0 la demanderesse que si elle avait pay\u00e9 une dette \u00e0 laquelle elle \u00e9tait tenue solidairement avec d'autres. Rien de cela n'existe dans le pr\u00e9sent cas. Seule l'intim\u00e9e est responsable de cet accident, et la Ville, absoute de toute faute par M. le Juge Angers, n'aurait d\u00fb rien payer. Elle ne peut pas demander \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le remboursement d'un paiement qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de faire. Son action ne repose sur aucun principe juridique. Son obligation l\u00e9gale d'indemniser les victimes \u00e9tait un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel pour justifier sa r\u00e9clamation, et les versements b\u00e9n\u00e9voles qu'elle a faits, ne donnent pas ouverture aux conclusions de sa P\u00e9tition de Droit.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Pierre, Choquette, Berthiaume, \u00c9mard, Martineau, McDonald & S\u00e9guin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Respondent applied to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan for a writ of certiorari to quash the order and that Court held 1, that s. 5 (e), which purported to empower the Board to issue the order was ultra vires since it purported to confer upon the Board judicial powers exercisable by the courts named in the British North America Act. In view of this finding the Court did not deal with other grounds raised in the application, namely, the alleged error in law on the part of the Board in fixing the monetary loss of the employee, and the alleged disqualification of the chairman of the Board on the ground of bias, in relation to the proceedings. On appeal to the Privy Council, 2, it was held that the Act was not ultra vires but the case was remitted to the Court of Appeal for a rehearing on the other grounds raised by respondent. On the rehearing the Court of Appeal held, 3, that the order of the Board should be quashed without the actual issue of the writ of certiorari. An application by the Board to appeal from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused, (4), and the motion for special leave to appeal, now reported, was then made.\nMOTION for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 4.\nF.

The appellant appealed from a judgment of the Exchequer Court which dismissed its motion to expunge from the Register of Trade Marks the trade mark \"Fronenaire\" as applied to electric refrigerators and refrigeration on the ground that such trade mark was similar to the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" previously registered by appellant in respect of refrigeration apparatus. It further appealed from a judgment of that Court whereby a motion of the respondent to expunge from the Register the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" on the ground that it was descriptive, was allowed.\nHeld: (Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J. dissenting), that \"Frigidaire\" is not an invented word but a combination of \"frigid\" and \"air\". It is not distinctive per se but is descriptive of the \"character\" of the article and the mark, without proof under r. 10 of the Trade Mark and Design Act that it had become distinctive by use, should have been rejected.\nHeld: also, that the evidence submitted in support of the application under The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, s. 29, that the mark had in fact become distinctive at the time of application for registration, was insufficient.\nPer Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J., dissenting,\u2014Applying the principles laid down in Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Goodrich Co. Ltd. 1 to the evidence adduced in the present case, it should be held that \"Frigidaire\" was not descriptive within the meaning of the Trade Mark and Design Act and that the alternative application under The Unfair Competition Act should be dismissed with costs.\nHeld: further that the trade mark \"Frozenaire\" was not similar to the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" within the meaning of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, s. 2 (k). Aristoc Ld. v. Rysta Ld. 2 applied.\nKellock J. was of opinion that \"Frozenaire\" was not properly registered under The Unfair Competition Act because of its descriptiveness in connection with the goods to which it was applied, and applying the principle laid down in Paine v. Daniels 3 would have directed that it be expunged from the Register.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada, the first of which 4 dismissed the appellant's motion to expunge from the Register of Trade Marks the trade mark \"Frozenaire\"; the second of which allowed the respondent's motion to expunge from the said Register the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" 5.\nC. Robinson for the appellant.\nH. G. Fox, K.C., and G. F. Henderson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Kerwin, J. (dissenting in part): These are appeals from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada. One judgment 6, rendered on the 30th of August, 1947, dismissed the appellant's motion of December 19, 1946, to expunge from the Register of Trade Marks the trade mark \"Frozenaire\" (registration Number NS68\/17883, as applied to electric refrigerators and refrigeration, which motion was made on the sole ground that such trade mark is similar to the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" registered by the appellant on January 24, 1933, in respect of refrigeration apparatus. The other judgment 7 was rendered on January 22, 1948. It allowed a motion of the respondent to expunge from the Register the above-mentioned registration of the trade mark \"Frigidaire\" on the ground that the said trade mark was descriptive of the character or the quality of the wares in association with which it has been used and registered, and then allowed an alternative motion by General Motors Corporation under section 29 of The Unfair Competition Act. General Motors Corporation appeals from the Order expunging \"Frigidaire\", but no appeal is taken by Bellows from the Order made on the alternative motion.\nDealing first with the judgment in respect of the trade mark \"Frozenaire\", on the strength of the judgment in this Court in Battle Pharmaceuticals v. The British Drug Houses, Ltd. 8, and on the principle laid down by the House of Lords in Aristoc, Ld. v. Rysta, Ld. 9, we think the appeal of the General Motors Corporation from that judgment should be dismissed with costs. According to those judgments the question of similarity must be determined as a matter of first impression, and the learned trial judge has dealt with that case by applying the principles laid down in the two judgments above mentioned.\nWe now turn to the appeal from the Order obtained by \"Frozenaire\" expunging the registration of the trade mark \"Frigidaire\". The allegations state that the word \"Frigidaire\" is descriptive of the wares in connection with which it is used, that it lacks distinctiveness and, therefore, should not have been registered. The learned trial judge observed that the Trade Mark and Design Act, under which \"Frigidaire\" was registered, did not define what are \"the essentials necessary to constitute a trade mark properly speaking\", but that it was settled by the Judicial Com- mittee of the Privy Council in Standard Ideal Company v. Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company 10, that \"distinctiveness is the very essence of a trade mark\". In that case Lord Macnaghten, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said at p. 84:\u2014\nNow the word \"standard\" is a common English word. It seems to be used not infrequently by manufacturers and merchants in connection with the goods they put upon the market. So used it has no very precise or definite meaning * * *\nIt seems to their Lordships perfectly clear that a common English word having reference to the character and quality of the goods in connection with which it is used and having no reference to anything else cannot be an apt or appropriate instrument for distinguishing the goods of one trader from those of another. Distinctiveness is the very essence of a trade mark * * * The result is in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Partlo v. Todd 11, that the word though registered is not a valid trade mark.\nIt might be added that in The Canadian Shredded Wheat Co. Ld. v. The Kellogg Co. of Canada, Ld. 12, Lord Russell of Killowen, speaking for the Judicial Committee, at p. 142, pointed out that the effect of section 11 (e) of The Trade Mark and Design Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 201, under which Act \"Frigidaire\" was registered, is that a word is not registrable under that Act as a trade mark which is merely descriptive of the character and quality of the goods in connection with which it is used, citing the Standard case supra and Channell v. Rombough 13.\nIn the present case the learned judge found that the word \"Frigidaire\" was not a registrable mark under the general provisions of the Act, that it was not per se a distinctive word; that, on the contrary, it was at the time of registration merely a descriptive word, lacking that distinctiveness which is necessary to constitute a trade mark properly speaking, and that it should not have been registered under the general provisions of the Act. He noted that the respondent's predecessor in title had applied for registration of the mark in the United States under the Act of 1905, but the application was refused, it is said, on the ground that the word was descriptive, although subsequently it was registered under the Act of 1920 which forbids registration of any mark that could have been registered under the Act of 1905. The learned judge also came to the conclusion that an invalid registration cannot become valid because of the acquisition of a secondary meaning after registration, thus becoming distinctive, and retain its registration. He pointed out that the new section 52 (1) changed the law as declared in the case of The Bayer Company v. American Druggists Syndicate 14, in which it was held that the authority to expunge (under the then section 42 of The Trade Mark and Design Act) \"any entry made without sufficient cause\" meant \"without sufficient cause at the time of registration\". The present section 52 (1) gives jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court to order that \"any entry in the Register be struck out or amended on the ground that at the date of such application, (to wit on the application of the Registrar or any person interested) the entry as it appears on the Register does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark.\"\nThe learned judge expressed the opinion that no evidence that a secondary meaning had been acquired subsequent to the registration can affect the question as to whether or not the mark, at the time of registration, was distinctive. He said:\u2014\nIf the registration was invalid, it remains invalid * * * Insofar, therefore, as the question of registrability arises, the inquiry must be directed to the time of the application for registration.\nHe accordingly granted the application to expunge the trade mark \"Frigidaire\".\nThe appellant suggested in the Exchequer Court that \"Frigidaire\" was an invented word; that appears in the judgment of that Court. The learned trial judge rejected that contention and referred to Astbury J. in the application by the Y aiding Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 15, where it was said that the mere fact that a new word, or a word which has not been included in the dictionaries, is produced, is not sufficient to make it an invented word within the meaning of the Statute. And Lord Halsbury's remarks in the Solio case 16, are quoted as follows:\u2014\nI can quite understand suggesting other words\u2014compound words or foreign words\u2014as to which it would be impossible to say that they were invented words, although, perhaps, never seen before, or that they did not indicate the character or quality of the goods, although as words of the English tongue they had never been seen before. And Lord Herschell is quoted at p. 485:\u2014\nI do not think the combination of two English words is an invented word, even although the combination may not have been in use before, nor do I think that a mere variation of the orthography or termination of a word would be sufficient to constitute an invented word, if to the eye or ear the same idea would be conveyed as by the word in its ordinary form.\nAnd Lord Macnaghten at p. 486:\u2014\nThe word must be really an invented word; nothing short of invention will do. On the other hand nothing more seems to be required * * * If it is \"new and freshly coined\" (to adopt an: old and familiar quotation), it seems to me that it is no objection that it may be traced to a foreign source, or that it may contain a covert and skilful allusion to the character or quality of the goods.\nAnd Lord Shand at p. 487:\u2014\nThere must be invention, and not the appearance of invention only. It is not possible to define the extent of invention required, but the words I think should be clearly and substantially different from any word in ordinary and common use. The employment of a word in such use, with a diminutive or a short and meaningless syllable added to it, or a mere combination) of two known words, would not be an \"invented\" word; and a word would not be \"invented\" which, with some trifling addition or very trifling variation, still leaves the word one which is well-known or in ordinary use, and which would be quite understood as intended to convey the meaning of such a word.\nAstbury J. concluded his remarks in the Yalding Manufacturing Co. Ltd. application supra by saying:\u2014\nThose passages show clearly that the mere fact that a word is previosuly unknown, or that it has not got into any technical Dictionary, is not sufficient to make it an invented word within the meaning of the Act.\nSeeking to apply the principle established in that case, and also as a result of a judgment of the Court of Appeal by Smith L.J. in Farbenfabriken Vormals Fried. Bayer and Co's. Application 17, the learned trial judge concluded that the word \"Frigidaire\" was clearly not an invented word, but a combination of two well-known English words long in use; and to the eye and ear the same idea is conveyed, he says, by the composite word \"Frigidaire\" as by its two component parts\u2014\"frigid\" and \"aire (e)\". He added:\u2014\nThe respondent manufactures refrigerators and refrigeration apparatus, articles which by their nature are intended to produce frigid or cooled air to preserve perishable articles placed within the apparatus. I think that the word \"Frigidaire\", used in connection with such goods, was used originally to describe and did, in fact, describe that character or quality of the respondent's goods and the purpose to which such goods were to be applied. It was, therefore, not a registrable mark under the general provisions of the Act.\" The learned judge accordingly held that the word \"Frigidaire\" was not per se a distinctive word; that, on the contrary, it was at the time of registration merely a descriptive word, lacking that distinctiveness which is necessary to constitute a trade mark properly speaking, and that it should never have been registered.\nWith due respect, we cannot read the judgments of Lord Halsbury, Lord Herschell, Lord Macnaghten and Lord Shand in the Solio case supra as having the meaning ascribed to them by the learned judge. They do say that it would be impossible to hold that words were invented, although, perhaps, they were never seen before; that a mere variation of the orthography or termination of a word would not be sufficient to constitute an invented word; and that it must be clearly and substantially different from any word in ordinary and common use\u2014a mere combination of two known words would not be an \"invented\" word. But, in our opinion, these statements do not exclude the registrability of the word \"Frigidaire\" in the circumstances shown in the evidence. Moreover, special attention should be directed to the judgment of Lord Macnaghten, who says that nothing more than invention seems to be required and that, if it is \"new and freshly coined\", it seems that it is no objection that it may be traced to a foreign source, or that it may contain a covert and skilful allusion to the character or quality of the goods.\nWe, therefore, are forced to disagree with the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge when he says that, on the principle established in the Solio case, \" 'Frigidaire' is clearly not an invented word.\" We can hardly come to the conclusion that it is clearly not so, and, as precisely pointed out by Astbury J. in the Yalding Manufacturing Co. Ltd. case, we would at least say that it is frequently a difficult matter to determine whether or not a word is an invented word, as it is a matter on which different minds may reach different conclusions. Personally, applying the principles established by their Lordships in the Solio case to the word \"Frigidaire\", we reach a different conclusion from that arrived at by the learned trial judge in the present case.\nWe have it in evidence that the word \"Frigidaire\" was not in the dictionaries when it was adopted by the appel- lant and up to that time it had never been used by the public and had never been seen before. We concede that, as a result of the decision in the Solio case, these two circumstances would not be sufficient to hold that \"Frigidaire\" was an invented word. We concede also that the word is a combination of two well-known English words, although the combination had not been used before; and that the mere variation of the orthography of the word \"air\" (\"aire\") is also not sufficient to constitute an invented word. But, on the other hand, as said by Lord Macnaghten, although the word \"Frigidaire\" may be traced to a foreign source, to wit, in fact that it may have been inspired by the \"frigidarium\" of the Romans\u2014as to which no evidence can be found in the record\u2014there has been no explanation offered as to how the predecessors of the appellant came to choose that word.\nThere remains the observation that the noble Lord makes in his judgment that a word may be none the less an invented word although \"it may contain a covert and skilful allusion to the character or quality of the goods.\" And why should we say that \"Frigidaire\" describes the quality or character of the goods? We realize, of course, that it describes the air and it says that it is frigid, but, in our opinion, it does not describe the article, or the quality of the goods in connection with which it is used. It does not necessarily apply to a refrigerator. Up to the time when it was adopted by the predecessor of the appellant, the article or the goods in question were exclusively known as refrigerators. Nobody was using the word \"Frigidaire\"; and it is only since the word was invented by the owners of the mark that people started calling refrigerators \"Frigidaires\".\nIn Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Goodrich Co. Ltd. 18, at 197, it is stated:\u2014\nBut, in order to deny registration of a word on the ground that it is descriptive, it must be shown that, at the date of the application (which is the date to be taken into consideration), the word was a descriptive name in current use, descriptive of the article itself as distinguished from a name exclusively distinctive of the merchandise of a particular dealer or manufacturer.\nBy the application of our decision in that case and upon the evidence adduced in the present, it should be held that the word \"Frigidaire\" was not descriptive within the meaning of The Trade Mark and Design Act and that it should be allowed to remain on the Register.\nThe application of the appellant under section 29 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, was granted only as an alternative if the trial judge decided in favour of the respondent that the word \"Frigidaire\" was not registrable at the time when the registration of the mark took place on the 24th of January, 1933, under The Trade Mark and Design Act. The learned judge granted the latter application, because he came to the conclusion that \"Frigidaire\" should be expunged from the Register. As we come to a different conclusion, and as we are of opinion that on that point the appeal of the General Motors Corporation should be allowed, it follows that the order granting the application under section 29 disappears; it should be set aside and the second appeal of the General Motors Corporation should be allowed, with costs, and the respondent's application should be dismissed with costs. The alternative application under section 29 should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of three applications between the parties in the Exchequer Court. The first was a motion by the appellant to expunge the word \"Frozenaire\", the trade mark of the respondent, from the register, as being similar to its own previously registered mark \"Frigidaire\"; the respondent countered with a motion to remove the latter as being descriptive; whereupon the appellant applied under section 29 of the Unfair Competition Act for a declaration in the terms of that section. In the consolidated proceedings before Cameron J. the first motion was rejected; the word \"Frigidaire\" was held to be descriptive and was ordered to be struck off; and the declaration requested under section 29 was made. From this latter no appeal has been taken; but the appellant seeks a reversal of the other two orders.\nThe word \"Frigidaire\" as applied to mechanically operated refrigerators and refrigerating equipment of a wide variety was originally adopted in the United States about the year 1918 by the Frigidaire Corporation, the appellant's predecessor in title. The word from then on was used in elaborate advertising, some of which was contained in magazines circulating in Canada, and the business developed to very large proportions. An application to register the mark in that country under the Act of 1905 was refused, a fact mentioned in Frigidaire v. Carp 19; but registration was later allowed under the Act of 1920. The significance of this, as stated in the case of Albany Packing Co. Inc. v. Registrar of Trade Marks 20 at 267, and not challenged here lies in the fact that the Act of 1905 did not permit registration of descriptive words and only marks not registrable under that statute were within the 1920 legislation. From at least the early 'twenties, considerable local advertising was done in Canada, the volume of the business grew steadily, and on September 19, 1929, application for registration was made. After some delay of no materiality here, the entry was allowed on January 24, 1933; and from that time the products have become increasingly well-known throughout the Dominion.\nThe respondent's mark was registered for the same class of goods as of April 23, 1940, the date of application; but it is stated that the mark had been used by the respondent for several years before that time.\nThe Unfair Competition Act came into force in 1932, and by its terms the validity of the original entry of \"Frigidaire\" must be determined under the preceding enactment, the Trade Marks Act. The pertinent provision of the latter was section 11 which, among other things, provided that the Minister might refuse registration \"(e) if the so-called trade mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade mark, properly speaking.\" Under a power to make regulations, rule 10 was promulgated:\u2014\n10. A Trade Mark consisting either of * * * a word having a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods in connection with which it is used, may be registered * * * upon furnishing the Commissioner with satisfactory evidence, * * * that the mark in question has, through long continued and extensive use thereof in Canada acquired a, secondary meaning, and become adapted to distinguish the goods of the applicant.\nThis rule as specifying \"essential particulars\" of a trade mark was held by Sir Lyman Duff, speaking for himself and Hudson J., to be within the power conferred: Magazine Repeating Razor Company v. Schick 21. In Canadian Shredded Wheat v. Kellogg 22, at p. 142 Lord Russell referring to s. 11 observes: \"The effect of this provision is that a word is not registrable under the Act as a trade mark which is merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods in connection with which it is used\"; citing Standard Ideal Co. v. Standard Sanitary Co. 23.\nThe first question is, then, whether the word \"Frigidaire\" was properly placed on the register in 1933. The rule quoted illustrates the conflict early recognized by the courts before the subject matter came under legislation, i.e. between the appropriation by a trader of a word within the range of language that would ordinarily be used by traders to describe particular goods, and the right of other traders in the normal carrying on of their business to employ the same or similar words. In the technique of advertising, the more complex and expensive the goods are, the greater the imaginative seeking by those producing them for attractive and arresting words; but in fixing the limits of legislative protection the courts must balance the conflicting interests and avoid placing legitimate competition at an undue disadvantage in relation to language that is common to all.\nNow, \"Frigidaire\" may be viewed either as a single word or a combination of words, but for the present purpose I cannot see that it makes any difference which is taken. The former might claim descent from the Latin \"frigidarium\", meaning the cooling room in a Roman bath, and the Oxford dictionary shows an English use in 1706: but such an employment would be confined to classicists. That it is not an invented word is clear from the language of Lord Hershell in the Solio case 24, at p. 485. As a combination of \"frigid\" and \"air\", and not being distinctive per se, it is not only within the scope of the well-used vocabulary but particularly, I should say, within the immediate and inevitable, if not exclusive, category of terms that would first occur to the mind of an alert manufacturer of refrigerators bent on announcing his goods by means of suggestive words invitingly set up. Mr. Robinson argued that \"Frigidaire\" in this sense is not descriptive of the \"character\" of the article, but I must say I can imagine no term more so. In our mastery of environment we have devoted a great deal of attention to foods, a most important treatment of which has been their preservation against high temperatures. What is the essence of the idea of a refrigerator? Unquestionably, that of cold air for preservation; not the precise mode of operation by which the conserving effect is achieved but the effect itself, which is the functional property of the article itself; all the rest is implied. The air must obviously be held within a container, but the result, however brought about, is what is looked at. If evidence of that were needed, it is furnished by the material filed in the case. Forty-five names are shown to have appeared in the trade of which the following are examples: \"Iced-Aire\", \"Frigice\", \"North-Eaire\", \"Frostair\", \"Airgard\", \"Sanidaire\", \"Coolair\" and \"Friguator\". These indicate that both words of the combination have some degree of effectiveness, and that would seem to follow from their commonness. The claim goes apparently to the monopoly of the word \"aire\". The affidavit of Shannon asserts that the company has taken successful proceedings against the use of \"Ideal-Aire\", \"Filtaire\", \"Governaire\"; and with a similar exclusiveness of adjectives signifying coldness in combinations, the company would have successfully withdrawn from use virtually the entire group of the most apt and descriptive words for this class of goods. The case contains a number of letters to third persons which make it evident that the appellant deems itself to have the equivalent of a copyright in the word mark and in each component; but that is not so; the trade mark monopoly is to protect the business of the appellant, not a proprietorship of the word itself. The mark, therefore, without proof under rule 10 that it had become distinctive by use, should have been rejected.\nMr. Robinson points out that if the Registrar had taken such a stand, the owner could at the time have attempted at least to bring the application within that rule, and that it is unfair at this time to permit the question to be raised. He cites Lord Dunedin in re Reddaway & Co. Ltd., 25 at 36, to the effect that the Registrar's decision should not now be interfered with unless he has clearly gone wrong. But that, I think, is precisely what has happened here; and the applicant must be taken to have assumed the risk involved in it.\nIt is next urged that the evidence submitted in support of the application under section 29 shows at the same time that the mark had in fact become distinctive at the time of the application in 1929, but I am unable to find it so. Between 1926 and 1929 these new units were being introduced into Canada; and keeping in mind the cost and the likely number of persons then interested in purchasing them, where natural ice was then and had always been the only means of domestic refrigeration, and commercial refrigeration, with the same means, in its early stages, the material is quite insufficient.\nMr. Robinson finally contended that as a declaration has been made under section 29 the original entry is preserved by the effect of section 52(1) which reads:\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada shall have jurisdiction, on the application of the Registrar or of any person interested, to order that any entry in the register be struck out or amended on the ground that at the date of such application the entry as it appears on the register does not accurately express or define the existing rights of the person appearing to be the registered owner of the mark.\nBut I cannot interpret this language to do more than to allow the Court to deal with a properly registered mark as the exigencies of time may have affected it. In the other view, a retroactive validation would be given without restriction. A word mark may lose distinctiveness through, for instance, becoming the common name of the goods or from disuse or abandonment; and it is these changes leading to residual rights which the section envisages.\nThe question remains whether \"Frozenaire\" is objectionable as being similar to \"Frigidaire\". Clause (k) of section 2 thus defines \"similar\":\n\"Similar,\" in relation to trade marks, trade names or distinguishing guises, describes marks, names or guises so resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers in and\/or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced, or for their place of origin;\nWith the elimination of the original entry \"Frigidaire\" the immediate question of similarity disappears; but the point has been dealt with on its merits by Cameron J. and was argued fully and ably by both counsel before this Court. It would, I think, be both unfair to the parties and unsatisfactory generally not to deal with it here in a like manner, and I do so.\nMr. Fox submitted this basic consideration: that where a party has reached inside the common trade vocabulary for a word mark and seeks to prevent competitors from doing the same thing, the range of protection to be given him should be more limited than in the case of an invented or unique or non-descriptive word; and he has strong judicial support for that proposition: Office Cleaning Services Ld. v. Westminster Window & General Cleaners Ld., 26, at 135; 27; British Vacuum Co. Ltd. v. New Vacuum Company Co. Ltd., 28, at 321; Aerators Limited v. Tollitt, 29. In Office Cleaning Services, supra, Lord Simonds used this language:\nIt comes in the end, I think, to no more than this, that where a trader adopts words in common use for his trade name, some risk of confusion is inevitable. But that risk must be run unless the first user is allowed unfairly to monopolize the words. The Court will accept comparatively small differences as sufficient to avert confusion. A greater degree of discrimination may fairly be expected from the public where a trade name consists wholly or in part of words descriptive of the articles to be sold or the services to be rendered.\nNo doubt there is a public interest against confusion of these marks, but on the other hand there is a like interest in the freedom of the individual trader in ordinary trade practices and in particular in using the main stock of the language. If the latter interest is disregarded, a single word might effect a wholesale appropriation of the only apt language available. Section 2(k) does not, as argued, exclude the consideration just mentioned; the language is, \"so resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other\" that the contemporaneous use would mislead as to the person responsible for their character or quality. If that is taken to exclude a competing mark by which the same idea simpliciter is suggested, then no other trader could use words indicating the essential idea of a refrigerator. But the idea must not only be similar; it must also be of a nature as to link the article with the person who assumes the responsibility mentioned. How in this case could the idea conveyed by \"Frozenaire\" of itself lead a person of ordinary understanding to infer a common responsibility for the goods of both marks? The idea of each is that conveyed by the common name \"refrigerator\" itself. If there is any confusion, it arises from resemblance in the sound or appearance of the words. But in determining that we must take into account the entire circumstances of the trade, including the prices, the class of people purchasing, and the ordinary manner in which they do that. As Cameron J. has pointed out, prospective purchasers deliberate before buying this somewhat high class apparatus; refrigerators are not hurriedly picked off a shelf; they represent a substantial purchase and to each transaction some degree of attention and consideration are given.\nDo the words then in that situation lend themselves to the errors of faint impression or recollection of the average person who goes to their market? In this I agree with Cameron J. that they do not. The word \"frigid\" in the one case and \"frozen\" in the other colour the perceptive effect of the combinations. The former, although familiar in meaning, cannot be said to be of wide and frequent use; both as seen and heard, it is a term of more precise application from a more extended vocabulary. But \"frozen\" is a word of daily speech among the entire population and in the combination it is intimate and general. \"Frigidaire\" seems also to possess a slight degree of inherent aptness for the combination which tends to blend the two words and weaken the descriptiveness; while in \"Frozenaire\" the adjective loses none of its robust meaning and effect, if both are not, in fact, accentuated.\nSimilarity is to be dealt with, of course, on the assumption that \"Frigidaire\" has acquired a distinctive signification; but that circumstance here seems only to enhance the dissimilarity by weakening still further the conveyance of its primary meaning. In contrast to that, a certain ruggedness and familiarity in appearance, sound and idea of the components of \"Frozenaire\" rules out, in my opinion, any reasonable likelihood of the objectionable association.\nMr. Fox raised a further point that the mark \"Frigidaire\" was by virtue of section 23(5) a design mark and as the word in that view must be treated as \"emptied of all meaning\" (the Schick case, supra) there can be no question of similarity; but I am unable so to construe the original registration. There is nothing to indicate any special form of lettering and that is all that could be suggested. Certainly to the public it was, at the beginning, a word conveying only its ordinary meaning and that would seem to be the best evidence that it is not accompanied by any feature of design.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock, J. (dissenting in part): I agree that the appeal from the judgment expunging the mark \"Frigidaire\" should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Rand.\nWith respect to the appeal from the judgment dismissing the appellant's motion to expunge the mark \"Frozenaire\", that motion was based on the contention that the two marks were similar within the meaning of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932. However that may be, I think the law applicable is to be found in the judgment of Bowen L.J., in Paine v. Daniells, 30, at 584:\nThe purity of the register of trade marks\u2014if one may use the expression\u2014is of much importance to trade in general, quite apart from the merits or demerits of particular litigants. If on a motion like the present the attention of the Court is called to an entry on the register of a trade-mark which cannot in law be justified as a trade-mark, it seems to me that the Court's duty may well be, whatever the demerits of the applicant, to purify the register and to expunge the illegal entry in the interests of trade, as was done in the Stone Ale case. As a rule, the Court on being seised of the matter would doubtless put an end to the existence of a trade-mark which could not possibly be justified by law.\nIf, as in my view, is the case, the word \"Frigidaire\" was not properly registered under the Act of 1906 because of its descriptiveness in connection with the goods to which it was applied, the same is even more true with respect to the word \"Frozenaire\" under the Act of 1932 and Mr. Fox, for the respondent, does not contend that in this view the jurisdiction to expunge does not exist, notwithstanding that the appellant did not base its application to expunge on that ground. No doubt the appellant did not do so because to have done so would have invited the attention of the court to the descriptiveness of his own client's mark. That circumstance, however, ought not to affect the duty to expunge. I would theprefore allow the appeal and direct that the word \"Frozenaire\" be expunged, but without costs here or below.\nAppeal from the judgment dismissing appellant's application to expunge \"Frozenaire\" from the Register of Trade Marks, dismissed with costs.

Ils all\u00e8guent dans leur action que les intim\u00e9s ont l'obligation l\u00e9gale de leur fournir un compte, parce que ces derniers auraient administr\u00e9 un fonds commun, auquel tous auraient contribu\u00e9; ils concluent \u00e0 ce que faute par les intim\u00e9s de fournir le compte requis, ils soient condamn\u00e9s conjointement \u00e0 payer aux demandeurs la somme de $12,000, dont $8,000 au demandeur Albert Cousineau, et $4,000 au demandeur Joseph Cousineau.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 l'action contre Napol\u00e9on Cousineau, parce qu'il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que ce dernier n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 administrateur de biens pour les demandeurs-appelants, mais il a ordonn\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fendeurs Pierre Cousineau et Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Cousineau de rendre un compte, dans un d\u00e9lai de trente jours. A d\u00e9faut par eux de se conformer \u00e0 cette ordonnance, le juge les a condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement, \u00e0 payer \u00e0 chacun des appelants la somme de $8,000.\n\u00c9videmment, il y avait erreur dans le dispositif de ce jugement en ce qui concerne la condamnation solidaire pour la somme de $8,000, et Joseph Cousineau a alors produit au dossier un \"retraxit\" afin de r\u00e9duire le montant du jugement quant \u00e0 lui, \u00e0 $4,000, le maximum r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\nLa Cour d'Appel en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que si, en mati\u00e8re de reddition de compte, la r\u00e8gle est \u00e0 l'effet que le jugement doit se borner \u00e0 ordonner la reddition de compte, cette r\u00e8gle toutefois doit subir un temp\u00e9rament lorsque les parties ont transform\u00e9 l'action en un v\u00e9ritable d\u00e9bat de comptes, et qu'elles ont mis devant le tribunal toutes les pi\u00e8ces justificatives. La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il n'existait aucun reliquat, et que l'obligation ult\u00e9rieure de rendre compte devenait inutile vu que par le d\u00e9bat engag\u00e9, par le consentement des parties, on en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une solution imm\u00e9diate et d\u00e9finitive. La Cour statue cependant que les demandeurs-appelants \u00e9taient justifiables d'insti- tuer leur action suivant la forme et les exigences que la loi prescrit, et que les intim\u00e9s ayant obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande apr\u00e8s le commencement des proc\u00e9dures, l'action des appelants est fond\u00e9 dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour le recouvrement de leurs d\u00e9pens. La Cour d'Appel en cons\u00e9quence a infirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a accueilli l'action des intim\u00e9s pour les d\u00e9pens seulement, tout en refusant d'accorder les conclusions solidaires.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent \u00e0 l'appui de leur motion, que cette Cour n'a pas juridiction pour adjuger sur le pr\u00e9sent appel, parce qu'il n'y aurait pas de montant en jeu. Leur procureur cite \u00e0 l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, la cause de Mathieu v. Mathieu (1). Dans cette cause, M. le Juge Mercier de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avait maintenu l'action de la demanderesse avec d\u00e9pens et avait condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur, ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire d'une succession, \u00e0 rendre un compte en justice de son administration. La Cour d'Appel avait confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, et l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire qui avait port\u00e9 sa cause devant la Cour Supr\u00eame, a vu son appel rejet\u00e9 sur motion, parce que cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas juridiction.\nCette cause ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour d\u00e9terminer le sort du pr\u00e9sent appel. Dans cette cause de Mathieu v. Mathieu 1, le d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre compte de son administration, et il est clair que devant cette Cour, alors que les comptes n'avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9battus, et qu'aucun reliquat n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, il n'y avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire en jeu. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, comme la Cour d'Appel, n'avaient eu \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer que le droit pour le demandeur d'exiger un compte, et l'obligation pour le d\u00e9fendeur de le rendre.\nMais dans le cas qui nous occupe, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Sur r\u00e9ception de l'action, la question d\u00e9battue n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 de savoir, comme la chose se d\u00e9cide g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, si les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient dans l'obligation l\u00e9gale de fournir un compte ou non, mais ils ont produit des pi\u00e8ces justificatives, indiquant par l\u00e0 leur volont\u00e9 de rendre compte, et ils ont, d'apr\u00e8s le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, \u00e9tabli qu'il n'y avait aucun reliquat qui appartenait aux demandeurs.\nQuand la cause sera entendue au m\u00e9rite devant cette Cour, il ne s'agira pas, comme dans le cas de Mathieu v. Mathieu 2, de d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non, les d\u00e9fendeurs doivent un compte, ce qui n'entra\u00eenerait \u00e9videmment aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire. Mais le compte avec pi\u00e8ces justificatives ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 produits d\u00e9j\u00e0, il s'agira uniquement de d\u00e9terminer si oui ou non, il y a reliquat, que les deman-deurs-appelants dans leur action estiment \u00e0 $12,000. Comme ce sera la seule question qu'il faudra juger, il s'ensuit qu'il y a un montant en jeu suffisant, pour donner juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour.\nUne autre question se pr\u00e9sente. C'est celle de savoir si l'appelant Joseph Cousineau a personnellement l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour justifier son appel. Il n'y a pas de doute qu'Albert Cousineau qui r\u00e9clame contre les d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement, un reliquat de $8,000, a l'int\u00e9r\u00eat voulu, mais Joseph Cousineau ne r\u00e9clame que la somme de $4,000 conjointement contre les deux d\u00e9fendeurs. Cette r\u00e9clamation doit \u00eatre divis\u00e9e \u00e9galement entre les deux d\u00e9fendeurs, de sorte que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de Joseph Cousineau ne serait que de $2,000, et n'exc\u00e9derait pas le montant requis par les dispositions de l'article 39, de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame, pour donner juridiction \u00e0 cette Cour.\nJe crois que cette pr\u00e9tention des d\u00e9fendeurs n'est pas fond\u00e9e, car s'il est vrai que le capital r\u00e9clam\u00e9 comme reliquat par Joseph Cousineau contre les d\u00e9fendeurs individuellement, n'exc\u00e8de pas $2,000, il faut tenir compte des dispositions de l'article 40, qui permet d'inclure dans le montant de la r\u00e9clamation, non seulement le capital, mais aussi l'int\u00e9r\u00eat accru ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la date du prononc\u00e9 du jugement dont il y a appel (Tremblay v. Beaumont 3). Or, comme l'int\u00e9r\u00eat doit courir jusqu'\u00e0 la date du jugement de la Cour d'Appel, et comme il faut l'ajouter au capital r\u00e9clam\u00e9, il s'ensuit que le montant total qui fait l'objet du litige, en ce qui concerne Joseph Cousineau, est sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $2,000.\nLa motion doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n1 (1925) Q.R. 39 K.B. 235; [1926] S.C.R. 598.\n2 [1926] S.C.R. 598.\n3 [1946] S.C.R. 448.\n",

(Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1948: June 13, 14; 1949: October 4.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nWaters and Watercourses\u2014Rights of Riparian Owners\u2014New trial, discovery of new evidence as ground for\u2014Jurisdiction to award damages in lieu of Injunction\u2014The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 68\u2014Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 100, s. 17.\nThe plaintiffs, lower riparian owners on the Spanish River, sued the defendant, the operator of a pulp and paper mill situate up the river at Espanola, Ontario, for pollution of the waters of the river by discharges from its mill. They secured a judgment in damages and an injunction restraining the defendant from depositing foreign substances in the river waters which alter the character or quality of the water to the injury of the plaintiffs. The Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, subject to a variation in the form of the injunction granted.\nThe defendant appealed to this Court alleging error in the granting of the injunction when damages would have been an adequate remedy and prayed that a new trial be granted upon terms, limited to the issue as to whether an injunction should go.\nHeld: A new trial could not be granted as it had not been shown that new evidence had been found which the defendant could not have found by the exercise of reasonable diligence prior to the trial, and that if adduced, would be practically conclusive. Varette v. Sainsbury[1] applied.\nHeld: Also, that the provisions of the Ontario Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, even if it purported to do so, would not enable this Court to give a judgment that was impossible in law at the time of the decision of the Court of Appeal, and that the amendment to s. 68 of the Supreme Court Act refers only to further evidence upon a question of fact. Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux[2].\nHeld: Further, that although under s. 17 of the Ontario Judicature Act, the Court has jurisdiction to award damages in lieu of an injunction, its discretion is governed by the consideration of whether the granting of damages would be a complete and adequate remedy, and since pollution has been shown to exist, it would not be, and the injunction should therefore, go. Leeds Industrial Co-Operative Society Ltd. v. Slack[3]\u2014referred to.\nInjunction ordered stayed for period of six months. Stollmeyer v. Petroleum Development Co. Ltd.[4] and Stollmeyer v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co. Ltd.[5] referred to. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,[6] affirming with a variation as to the form of injunction granted, the judgment of McRuer, Chief Justice of the High Court of Ontario[7].\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. and J.J. Robinette K.C. for the appellant.\nA.W. Roebuck K.C. and D.R. Walkinshaw for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nKERWIN, J.: The K.V.P. Company Limited appeals from five judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[8] affirming, with a variation, the judgments of the Chief Justice of the High Court[9] granting the plaintiffs in each action damages for the pollution of the Spanish River, and an injunction. The variation is merely in the form of the injunction granted and counsel admitted that the form adopted by the Court of Appeal was taken from the order made in Lingwood v. Stowmarket Co.[10]\nThe respondents (plaintiffs) are owners of lands on the Spanish River, which flows into Lake Huron, and the appellant operates a pulp and paper mill higher up the river. While the respondents\u2019 lands are not particularly suitable for agriculture, some are farmed and are used to grow vegetables. The respondent in one action has a summer residence on his property; another has a grant of a water lot on the river so that in his case the injunction applies to the water flowing over his lands; and the lands of the others have cabins erected on them which, together with the house in some cases, are used for roomers and boarders in the tourist industry.\nThe trial judge found that the appellant had polluted the waters of the river and awarded the respondents damages of $450, $1,250, $300, $2,100, $1,000 and $500. The Court of Appeal agreed with these findings and the appellant does not now attack them. The sole point argued before us was as to the injunction.\nThe suggestion that there should be a new trial upon any terms that the Court might see fit to impose, limited to the issue as to whether an injunction should be granted, cannot be entertained as it is not shown in any way that new evidence had been found which could not have been discovered by the appellant by the exercise of reasonable diligence and that, if adduced, it would be practically conclusive: Varette v. Sainsbury[11]. It was then argued that by section 30 of the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 45, as enacted by section 6 of chapter 48 of the Statutes of 1949, this Court is empowered to refuse to grant an injunction against the owner or occupier of a mill under certain named conditions, or to grant an injunction to take effect after such lapse of time or upon such terms and conditions or subject to such limitations or restrictions as may be deemed proper, or, in lieu of granting an injunction, to direct that the owner or occupant of the mill take such measures or perform such acts to prevent, avoid, lessen or diminish the injury, damage or interference complained of as may be deemed proper. Other provisions are made as to damages already suffered and as to subsequent damages. Reliance is placed upon subsection 2 by which it is provided that subsection 1, re-enacting section 30 of the original Act, shall apply to every action or proceeding in which an injunction is claimed in respect of any of the matters mentioned including every pending action and proceeding and including every action or proceeding in which an injunction has been granted and in which any appeal is \u201cpending\u201d. The amended Act came into force on the day it received the Royal Assent, April 1, 1949, and while the judgment of the Court of Appeal was given November 22, 1948, it is contended that the appeal to this Court is \u201cpending\u201d within the meaning of the enactment.\nIt has been decided in Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux[12], that since section 46 of the Supreme Court Act provides that this Court may dismiss an appeal or give the judgment which the Court whose decision is appealed should have given, and since a provincial legislature may not extend the jurisdiction of this Court as conferred by Parliament, such a provision as the one here in question would not, even if it purported so to do, enable this Court to give a judgment that was impossible in law at the time of the decision of the Court of Appeal. The 1949 Act is not an enactment declaratory of what the law was deemed to be. Mr. Cartwright sought to overcome this difficulty by pointing to the amendment to the Supreme Court Act in 1928 by which the following proviso was added to section 68:\nProvided that the Court may, in its discretion, on special grounds, and by special leave, receive further evidence upon any question of fact, such evidence to be taken in the manner authorized by this Act, either by oral examination in Court, by affidavit, or by deposition, as the Court may direct.\nIt is apparent that this refers only to further evidence upon any question of fact, and the decision in the Boulevard Heights Case therefore applies. Leave was asked to file an affidavit of Ralph A. Hayward under this proviso but leave has never yet been given thereunder and the circumstances are not such as to warrant making an order on this occasion.\nIt was next contended that on the evidence in the record and even without the 1949 amendment to the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, this Court should, in the circumstances, decline to grant an injunction and should confine the respondents to damages. The damages are those assessed by the trial judge and those to be fixed by the local master at Sudbury upon a reference directed to him to ascertain the damages sustained by the respondents from the date of trial \u201cto the date that the injunction becomes effective\u201d, which date was fixed as the expiration of six months from the date of the trial judgment, April 15, 1948. Following the notice of appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court, the appellant obtained an order staying the operation of the injunction until the final determination of the appeal.\nThe rights of riparian owners have always been zealously guarded by the Court. It is unnecessary to discuss all the decisions referred to by Mr. Cartwright and it suffices to quote the remarks of Lord Sumner, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in Stollmeyer v. Petroleum Development Company Limited[13] at 499:\nThe grant of an injunction is the proper remedy for a violation of right according to a current of authority, which is of many years\u2019 standing and is practically unbroken: Imperial Gas Light and Coke Co. v. Broadbent[14]; Pennington v. Brinsop Hall Coal Co.[15] In English v. Metropolitan Water Board[16], there is a mere dictum to the contrary. The discretion of the Court in the grant of such injunctions is regularly exercised in this sense.\nSection 17 of the Ontario Judicature Act provides:\nWhere the Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for an injunction against a breach of a covenant, contract or agreement or against the commission or continuance of a wrongful act, or for the specific performance of a covenant, contract or agreement, the Court may award damages to the party injured either in addition to or in substitution for such injunction or specific performance, and such damages may be ascertained in such manner as the Court may direct, or the Court may grant such other relief as may be deemed just.\nUnder the precursor of this section, Lord Cairns\u2019 Act, 1858, the House of Lords decided in Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society Limited v. Slack[17], that jurisdiction was thereby conferred to award damages in lieu of an injunction in the case of a threatened injury, but Viscount Finlay, with whom Lord Birkenhead expressly agreed, and of whose judgment Lord Dunedin stated that \u201che has exactly expressed my views\u201d, pointed out at page 860 that the Courts have on more than one occasion expressed their determination to prevent any abuse of the Act by legalizing the commission of torts by any defendant who was able and willing to pay damages. He said it was sufficient to quote two passages from the reports, the first of which occurs in the judgment of Lord Justice Lindley in Shelfer v. City of London Electric Co.[18], and the second of which occurs in the judgment of Buckley J. in Cowper v. Laidler[19].\nIn Canada Paper Co. v. Brown[20], Duff J., in an obiter at page 252, stated that he was far from accepting a contention that considerations touching the effect of granting the injunction upon residents of the neighbourhood, and indeed upon the interests of the appellant company, were not considerations properly to be taken into account in deciding the question whether or not the remedy by injunction should be accorded the plaintiff under the law of Quebec. He continued, however, by pointing out that it is a judicial discretion that is exercised, that is, one regulated in accordance with judicial principles as illustrated by the practice of the Courts in giving and withholding the remedy. In the subsequent case of Gross v. Wright[21], that same learned judge, in a case from the Province of British Columbia, stated that he had no doubt, as laid down by the Lord Justices in Kennard v. Cory[22], that the primary point for consideration in every case where the question is injunction or no injunction is whether or not the wrong complained of is a wrong \u201cfor which damages are the proper remedy\u201d to use the phrase of Lindley L.J. in London & Blackwall Ry. Co. v. Cross[23], that is to say, a complete and adequate remedy.\nPollution has been shown to exist, damages would not be a complete and adequate remedy, and the Courts discretion should not be exercised against the \u201ccurrent of authority which is of many years\u2019 standing\u201d.\nAn injunction should, therefore, go but it is argued that this Court should adopt the course followed by the Judicial Committee in the Stollmeyer Case, referred to above. Before considering that case attention should be directed to the decision of the Judicial Committee immediately preceding in the case of Stollmeyer v. Trinidad Lake Petroleum Co. Ltd.[24] There it was held that an owner of land upon a stream flowing in a permanent defined channel, although fed exclusively by rain water running off the surface of the land in certain seasons, was entitled to have the natural flow of the water without sensible diminution or increase (subject to the lawful rights of upper riparian owners) and without sensible alteration in its character or quality. A stream of the above description flowed through lands, the whole of which belonged to the respondents with the exception of a plot situated at its mouth, which belonged to the appellants. The latter\u2019s land was unsuitable for agriculture and it was not used for any purpose. The respondents carried on upon their land the business of boring for oil, which was the sole industry of the locality, and diverted part of the water of the stream in order to supply water to other property, thereby sensibly diminishing the flow past appellants\u2019 land. They also, without negligence, caused a sensible pollution of the water by oil and salt. The appellants had suffered no pecuniary damage and the Trinidad Courts dismissed an action for damages and an injunction. The Judicial Committee decided that the appellant had suffered an injuria and was entitled to an injunction. The Judicial Committee made certain declarations as to the use of the water by the respondents and as to the pollution of the River Vessigny, and then gave leave to the appellants to apply for an injunction to the Court of first instance after a period of two years. In that case it will be noted that (1) the lands of the appellants were unsuited for agriculture; (2) the lands were not being used for anything; (3) the appellants had suffered no damage; (4) the Courts below had refused the injunction.\nWhen we come to the subsequent case, we find that the respondent and the appellant were respectively upper and lower riparian owners upon the banks of a river in Trinidad and carried on upon their respective lands the business of boring for oil. The trial judge found that the respondents had polluted the water with both oil and salt, and awarded the appellant \u00a350 damages but refused to grant an injunction. An appeal to the full Court against the refusal to grant an injunction was dismissed upon an equal division of opinion between the two members of the Court. The Judicial Committee reversed that decision and it was in the course of delivering the judgment of their Lordships that Lord Sumner used the language quoted above. At the conclusion he pointed out that the loss to the respondents would be out of all proportion to the appellant\u2019s gain and that, the respondents undertaking to pay from time to time such pecuniary damages as their work may be found to have caused to the appellant on inquiry before the Court of first instance, the operation of the injunction should be suspended for two years to give an ample opportunity to the respondents to carry out any works necessary to remove the causes of complaint with liberty to apply to the Court of first instance for a further suspension if special grounds could be shown.\nThe writs in the actions before us were issued in May and June, 1947, complaining of damages since May 1, 1946. The actions were tried in December 1947 and judgment was given by the Chief Justice of the High Court on April 15, 1948. The judgment of the Court of Appeal was given November 22, 1948, and the appeals before us were argued on June 13 and 14, 1949. The lands of the respondents are being used; considerable damages have been awarded and the appellant has had before it the fact of the injunction since April 15, 1948. The two cases decided by the Judicial Committee are quite distinguishable but, under all the circumstances, we have concluded that the operation of the injunction should be stayed for a period of six months.\nSubject to this variation, the appeal and the appellant\u2019s motion to introduce new evidence should be dismissed with costs. Notice of a motion had been given by the respondents for leave to file an affidavit of Maurice Adelman but the matter was not mentioned at the argument, and that motion should, therefore, be dismissed without costs.\nSubject to a variation whereby the operation of the injunction is stayed for a period of six months, the appeal and the appellant\u2019s motion to introduce new evidence are dismissed with costs. The respondent\u2019s motion is dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McGuire, Boles & Worrall.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bagwell & Walkinshaw.\nReporter\u2019s Note: On November 21, 1949 the appellant moved before the Court for an Order to vary the judgment to allow it to apply to the High Court of Justice for a further suspension of the injunction in the event of the appellant being able to show special grounds. The Court, without calling on the respondent, dismissed the motion with costs.\nCartwright K.C. for the Motion.\nC.F. Scott, contra.\n[1] [1928] S.C.R. 72.\n[2] (1916) 52 Can.

After the outbreak of war in September 1939 an abnormal demand for refined sugar arose and the appellant, in common with other Canadian refiners, and pursuant to the Government's request, undertook, to meet the demand out of its stocks of refined sugar. As a result, its normal stocks of raw sugar were depleted, and to reestablish its position it purchased raw sugar for immediate delivery at a considerable advance on pre-war prices. A ceiling having been fixed on refined sugar prices, the appellant was faced with a prospective loss and to offset this, speculated in raw sugar futures on the stock exchange and made a profit of some $71,000. In its income return it treated the sum as a capital gain. The respondent however assessed it as taxable income under the War Income Tax Act and from that assessment the present appeal arose.\nHeld: That, even if it were the only transaction of that character, in the light of all the evidence, it was a part of the appellant's business and therefore a profit from its business or calling within the meaning of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act.\nImperial Tobacco Co. v.

Hayden K.C. and J. W. Blain for the appellant.\nJ. Ross Tolmie and J. D. Boland for the respondent. The Chief Justice:\u2014I agree with my brother Kerwin and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal toy Atlantic Sugar Refineries Limited against a judgment of the Exchequer Court 2 affirming an assessment of appellant to income tax for the year 1939, and the point in issue is whether a profit admittedly made by the company from sales and purchases of raw sugar futures on the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange comes within the words \"profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling\" in s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe company was incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act in 1932. It buys raw cane sugar in order to refine it and sell the product. As a rule it did not buy futures, the only two occasions being in 1937 and in 1939. While the circumstances of these two cases are entirely different, the intention in each, as stated by Mr. Seidensticker, the company's president and manager, was the same, i.e., to offset losses either actual or feared. His intention, and therefore the intention of the appellant, was to do something as part of the latter's business and to secure a profit.\nThe Court of Appeal in England decided in Imperial Tobacco Co. v. Kelly 3, that the intention with which a transaction was entered into is a feature that should be considered under the British Income Tax Act. That is an important matter under our Act but the whole sum of the circumstances must be taken into account in determining whether a profit arose as part of the taxpayer's business. A number of cases are referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Court below and they, with others, were discussed fully in argument before us. Some are on the point whether the individual or company concerned was carrying on any business and, as has been pointed out several times, a company comes into existence for some particular purpose and, therefore, different considerations apply to it than would apply to an individual. Other decisions consider what bearing upon the issue has the circumstance that it was an isolated transaction, and it is settled that the mere fact that that was so does not dispose of the matter. The present appeal, however, may be decided by applying the principles set forth in the decisions now mentioned.\nIn Anderson Logging Co. v. The King 4 Duff J., as he then was, at page 48, in delivering the judgment of this Court upon a question arising under the British Columbia Income and Personal Property Taxation Act (1921) 2nd sess., c. 48, stated that he assumed the tests which had been applied in the decisions of the Courts upon controversies arising under the Income Tax Acts of the United Kingdom were those by which the liability of the Anderson Logging Co. was to be determined. He continues:\u2014\nThe principle of these decisions can best be stated for our present purpose in the language of Lord Dunedin in his judgment delivered on behalf of the Judicial Committee, in Commissioner of Taxes v. The Melbourne Trust, Ltd. 5.\nIt is common ground that a company, if a trading company and making profit, is assessable to income tax for that profit * * * The principle is correctly stated in the Scottish case quoted, California Copper Syndicate v. Harris 6. It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of income tax that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to income tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realization or conversion of securities may be so assessable where what is done is not merely a realization or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business;\nor, in the language of the judgment from which this quotation is made, which follows in sequence after the passage cited:\nWhat is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined being\u2014Is the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realizing a security, or is it a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making?\nor, in the form adopted by Sankey J.\u2014in Beynon v. Ogg 7 \u2014from the argument of the Attorney General\u2014was the profit in question\na profit made in the operation of the appellant company's business? The decision of this Court was affirmed by the Judicial Committee 8. In Ducker v. Rees, Roturbo Development Syndicate 9, the House of Lords unanimously stated (and adopted) the test in the California Copper Syndicate Case as being whether the amount in dispute was \"a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making\".\nBearing in mind the principles set forth in these decisions, what do we find in the present case? In 1939 the company found, as a result of the outbreak of war and the tendency of the public to buy more sugar, that there was a greater demand than would be expected for seasonable requirements. At the request of an administrative Committee set up by the Canadian Government, or of the Sugar Controller when finally appointed, the appellant, as well as others in the sugar refinery business, endeavoured to secure more raw sugar than they ordinarily would at that particular time. The appellant purchased a considerable quantity over and above what its usual requirements would be and it was because of the loss that Mr. Seidensticker feared, that he decided on behalf of the Company to speculate in sugar futures on the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange. As to these speculations, he testified: \"I think it is difficult to disassociate them from what took place in the first instance,\" i.e. in 1937, and I agree with the view of the trial judge that it is impossible to do so. At page 32 of the record, Mr. Seidensticker stated:\u2014\nThe raw sugars were allocated to them at a definite price fixed by the Sugar Administrator. In the interval between this initial control and commercial control the necessity of the Atlantic Sugar Refinery responding to this demand to supply raw sugar and the need therefore of buying raw sugars to overcome the deficiencies which normally and naturally occurred resulted in my attempting to, in some fashion, recoup what I feared might be a consequent loss.\nThe company finding itself in an abnormal situation because of the various factors mentioned, Mr. Seidensticker decided to protect the appellant's financial interests by the operations on the Exchange. The company was not investing idle capital funds nor was it disposing of a capital asset. In no sense may it be said that the operations were unconnected with the appellant's business and it is at least an added circumstance that the speculation was made in raw sugar. Even if it were the only transaction of that character, it should be held, in the light of all the evidence, that it was part of the appellant's business or calling and therefore a profit from its business within section 3 of the Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nLocke J.:\u2014The matter to be determined is whether the profits earned on the short sale transactions in September and October 1939 were profits or gains from a trade, within the meaning of s. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, or from a speculation divorced from the ordinary trade or business of the company which should be classified as a capital gain.\nWhile it was undoubtedly within the corporate powers of the appellant to buy and sell raw sugar, the evidence disclosed that its business was the purchase of this commodity, refining it and selling refined sugar, and that it was not its custome to hedge its purchases by transactions in the future market. On September 7th, 8th and 9th, 1939, the appellant made cash purchases of 15,515 tons of raw sugar for future delivery at prices considerably in excess of those theretofore paid. The necessity for these very large purchases was occasioned by the appellant company, together with other sugar refiners in Canada, complying with the request of the Canadian Government to supply out of their stocks the altogether abnormal demands for refined sugar consequent upon the anticipation of and the outbreak of the war. The resulting drain upon the raw sugar stocks of the refineries created the demand which caused the great increase in the price of raw sugar. On September 11th the appellant made its first short sales upon the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange, and between that date and October the 9th it sold some 3,500 tons short. In giving evidence as to these transactions, Mr. Lewis Seidensticker, the president and manager of the company, said that these sales were not in the nature of hedges but speculative transactions entered into in the hope of recouping part at least of an anticipated loss in the purchases made at such high figures. Explaining the circumstances under which the sales were made, the witness said that, expecting an operating loss, he consulted a broker in New York and on his advice \"those transactions which have been submitted as descriptive of what took place on the New York Sugar Exchange were entered into and what would in any wise be termed a hedging transaction was defeated by the control which fixed the conditions and the price situation here while it in no wise influenced or affected the listing and movement of quotations on the raw sugar exchange.\" Later, being asked by the learned trial judge to explain this statement, the witness said that \"anything that would have led us to continue to function in the market towards hedging was defeated by the control,\" but added that the transactions were really speculations and not intended as hedging operations.\nThe control referred to was that imposed by the Government under the War Measures Act: on October 2nd the Sugar Administrator first fixed the price of refined sugar and thereafter required the refiners to purchase raw sugars through him and the first of such purchases was made in this manner by the appellant on October 6th. According to Mr. Seidensticker, after October 2nd the refineries no longer acted as free agents. Of the short sales in question transactions aggregating 3,100 tons were made in September: those made after October 2nd aggregated only 400 tons and of these there was but one sale of a 50 ton lot after October 6th. According to the witness, in the ordinary case of a hedge, the selling for future delivery synchronizes with the purchase of the commodity while, in the present case, the short sales were made over the period of a month following the cash purchases. I think that this circumstance does not affect the matter to be determined. While not carried out contemporaneously with the purchases, the short sales were in effect a hedge by the company against a possible loss on the purchases made and it was only the imposition of control on October 2nd that rendered further hedging operations inadvisable. In trades where natural products are purchased in large quantities, hedging is a common, and in some cases, a necessary practice, and the cost of such operations in trades of this nature is properly allowable as an operating expense of the business. Where, as in the present case, the trader elects to close out his short sales and take a profit, this is, in my opinion, properly classified as profit from carrying on the trade. Mr. Hayden contended that this was simply a speculation in raw sugar resulting in a capital profit such as might have resulted from a speculation in shares or some other commodity but, upon the evidence in this case, that position cannot, in my opinion, be supported. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. A. McGrory.\n1 [1948] Ex.

(dissenting): An allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking is not a matter of right and can only be justified as a part of the valuation and in the circumstances of this case should not be allowed.

The King, [1946] S.C.R. 551 referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Thorson J., awarding to the appellant the sum of $120,000 in full compensation for the property expropriated by the Crown under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64. The Crown had offered $99,670, while appellant had claimed $232,165.34. The appellant appealed to this Court for an increase of the award granted by the Court below.\nJ. A. Byers for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe, K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): I agree with the reasons of my brother Locke and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.: In the case of Irving Oil Company v. The King 1, it was held that while an allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking is not a matter of right, in circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values, such as were found there, the practice of making that allowance applied. Similar circumstances are present here; in fact in the general character of the two situations there is no difference whatever. For that reason, I think the allowance should be made. The value of the land has not been specifically found by the President of the Exchequer Court, but a consideration of his reasons satisfies me that he had in mind something in the neighbourhood of $100,000. I would, therefore, add $10,000 to the amount awarded by him.\nIn the course of the trial and in his reasons, the President expressed certain views on that rule for determining compensation which defines it as the value of the land to the owner. This formulation not only contrasts the value to the owner as distinguished from the value to the taker, but embodies another sense; i.e. the content of value to the owner as against other possible owners. In Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister 2, Lord Moulton stated it in the latter aspect in these words:\nProbably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they (the owners) were entitled to that which a prudent man in their position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nThe question arises here in connection with the claim for disturbance of possession, including expenses of moving, damages to or loss of fixtures, and for interruption of business generally. The debate is whether these are to be taken as elements of the value of the land to the owner or items of an independent claim for damages. There is no serious dispute that they should be allowed; that they must be such as can be brought within the scope of the \"value of the land to the owner\" has not been questioned; and what is at issue in the particular items is in reality a conceptual refinement which is devoid of practical significance.\nIn Vyricherla Narayana v. The Revenue Officer 3, Lord Romer observed that the statement, \"value to the owner\" was not, in strictness, accurate. The land, for instance, he said, may have for the vendor a sentimental value far in excess of its market value. Accepting this as a proper correction in verbal accuracy, it does not affect the rule as adopted in this country, because value of that sort has never been taken to be within it. But I should remark that the precise question before Lord Romer was the basis of compensation when the only possible purchaser was the expropriating authority.\nIt would seem, however, that the meaning of Lord Moulton's language has been somewhat misconceived by the President. In the present case these questions were asked:\nQ. Are you able to express an opinion as to whether a purchaser would be willing to pay more than $98,670 for the property in view of the fact that the defendant would suffer some loss or disturbance rather than fail to get the property?\nA. No, I think that would be\u2014the defendant might not then be a willing vendor.\nQ. How much do you think a prospective purchaser who is anxious to get the property might be prepared to pay to the vendor in view of the disturbance factors that are present?\nA. Yes, I think he would pay more for it.. And in the reasons there is the following:\nIn arriving at this valuation, Mr. Winslow did not take any disturbance to the defendant into account, but expressed the opinion that an anxious purchaser might be willing to meet the owner's disturbance claims by paying from $10,000 to $20,000 more than the amount of his valuation sooner than fail to obtain the property.\nIt is obvious that the purchaser will pay according to the strength or value of his interest or his \"anxiety\" to obtain the property and to nothing else. He is not concerned with the consequences of disturbance to the owner. The statement means, as Mr. Varcoe on the argument frankly conceded, that the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it. It is assumed, in the situation here, that he is to continue in business. In this we have no need of an imaginary market, purchase, or interest; we have the real interest of the owner, and its measurement in value is the task for the Court. The rule applies to cases such as this where the possibilities of the land for which the claim is made are actually realized by the owner in the use to which he has put it: Irving Oil Company v. The King (supra). A compensation statute should not be approached with the attitude that Parliament intended an individual to be victimized in loss because of the accident that his land rather than his neighbour's should be required for public purposes; and this Court in the case mentioned was confirmed in its conception of the rule by the fact that in the definition of the word \"land\" in the Expropriation Act the word \"damages\" is included, a word which does not appear in the definition clause of the English Act. But all such subsidiary items involved in the disturbance of possession and the direct result of the forcible taking become embraced within the actual value of the land to the owner as fully as any other feature of it. I do not mean to imply that this rule is a formula for all cases. There are so many different situations to be met in the use of lands, that in some of them, as for example, those calling for reinstatement, or that dealt with in The Prince's Street Gardens Arbitration, reported in Cripps on Compensation, 8th Ed., at p. 916, in both of which values other than commercial or economic are present, its application would be difficult if not impossible.\nSection 47 of the Exchequer Court Act has been drawn into the question. In Toronto v. Brown 4, Duff, J. in a review of characteristic authority, treats a right to compensation as the necessary implication and assumption of the Expropriation Act, in which, if I may say so, I think him entirely right. Section 47 is a procedural provision which, likewise assuming that right, fixes the time as of which the compensation is to be ascertained; but that it is intended to constitute the provision from which alone the right arises and that it contains a precise and restrictive definition of the compensation to be made is an interpretation for which neither in its history nor in its language is there any warrant.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and vary the judgment below by adding to it the sum of $10,000.\nEstey J.: His Majesty The King in the right of the Dominion of Canada under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64, as of February 18, 1946, expropriated lots 1599, 1600, 1601 and 1602 in the City of Victoria.\nThe appellant owned these lots and thereon conducted a wholesale and retail business in books, stationery, business supplies, office furniture, a lending library, and also operated printing presses and equipment for catering to many types of printing requirements.\nSection 23 of the Expropriation Act provides:\n23. The compensation money agreed upon or adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for or injuriously affected by the construction of any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property.\nSection 2(d) of the Expropriation Act defines \"land\" as follows:\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires:\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n(d) \"land\" includes all granted or ungranted, wild or cleared, public or private lands, and all real property, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments of any tenure, and all real rights, easements, servitudes and damages, and all other things done in pursuance of this Act, for which compensation is to be paid by His Majesty under this Act. When the parties failed to agree as to the compensation the Attorney-General for Canada commenced these proceedings under sec. 19(a) of the Exchequer Court Act:\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(a) Every claim against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose.\nThen sec. 47 of the Exchequer Court Act specifies that the value shall be determined as of the date the property was taken.\nThe decision in Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King 5 determines the issues in this case. There, as here, a business was operated on the premises and it was held, in accord with the established principles, that the compensation awarded included the value of the land, the cost of moving and other expenses and damages (as this word is used in 2(d)) and 10 per cent for compulsory taking. Kerwin, J., with whom the Chief Justice agreed stated at p. 556:\n\u2026 the principle in this class of case is that the displaced owner should be left as nearly as possible in the same position financially as he was prior to the taking, provided that the damage, loss or expense for which compensation was claimed was directly attributable to the taking of the lands.\nRand J., at p. 561:\nThe clause \"shall stand in the stead of such land or property\" can only mean that, with the compensation money in the hands of the owner, he is in, the equivalent position of holding his land or property instead of the money. He is, therefore, under that section, in the sense indicated, to be made economically whole.\nThe well-known cases of Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste 6 and Pastoral Finance Assoc. Ltd. v. The Minister 7 were cited and followed. It is the value to the owner and not the market value or value to the purchaser that must be determined. In the determination of that value to the owner various items may be considered and these will vary according to the circumstances of particular cases. The total of the items that may properly be taken into account determines the value to the owner. Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Glasgow and S.W. Ry. 8. There the land was acquired under statutory authority and the jury in assessing the compensation made the award under three headings. The precise question there determined was that the \u00a39499 8s. 3d., being the compensation for loss of business, should be regarded as part of the consideration in determining the stamp duty. Lord Halsbury at p. 321 stated:\nNow the language of the legislature is this\u2014that what the jury have to ascertain is the value of the land. In treating of that value, the value under the circumstances to the person who is compelled to sell (because the statute compels him to do so) may be naturally and properly and justly taken into account; and when such phrases as \"damages for loss of business\" or \"compensation for the goodwill\" taken from the person are used in a loose and general sense, they are not inaccurate for the purpose of giving verbal expression to what everybody understands as a matter of business; but in strictness the thing which is to be ascertained is the price to be paid for the land\u2014that land with all the potentialities of it, with all the actual use of it by the person who holds it, is to be considered by those who have to assess the compensation.\nThe learned President with respect to the property accepted the evidence of Mr. Winslow. There was a substantial difference in the values expressed but Mr. Winslow was not at great variance with some others. In any event, the learned President heard the witnesses and had the benefit of a view of the premises, and I think his conclusion with respect to the value of the property should be accepted:\nI was very favourably impressed by the evidence given by Mr. Winslow on behalf of the defendant. He made a valuation of the property as a whole of $98,670.\n. . . . . . . . . . .\nHaving regard to the evidence given, the opinions of the experts, the view taken by the Court and the arguments of counsel, and having taken into account the various factors and elements of value that have been brought to the attention of the Court, including the defendant's claims for disturbance, I have come to the conclusion that if I were to award the defendant the sum of $120,000 for the expropriated property this would adequately cover every element of value that could properly be taken into account, and at the same time meet the tests of value that the governing cases lay down. I think that a prudent purchaser, anxious to obtain the property, might well have been willing to pay that amount rather than fail to obtain it.\nThe learned President considered the losses and expenses under the heading of \"Disturbance Allowance\" and stated he would not fix the amount thereof higher than $20,000. The items claimed under this heading by the appellant totalled $99,714. The first of $4,000 covered surveys, plans and appraisals and executive time searching for suitable premises. The evidence disclosed that much of this work was undertaken in order to effect improvements in the general conduct of the business quite apart from any question of expropriation. Even if in an appropriate case some such an allowance might have been made, the evidence here does not establish the actual work and the cost thereof in that connection. In fact the appellant's witness admitted that only a minor part thereof was claimed and suggested the amount of $850 but did not in any way indicate what this covered or how it was computed. I am therefore in agreement with the learned President's refusal to allow this amount.\nThe balance of $95,714 included actual moving expenses and increased cost resulting from moving. Since the hearing before the learned President the appellant has altered its plans with the result that counsel reduced many and abandoned certain of the items that were pressed before the learned President, until the items, apart from those to be immediately discussed, totalled between $20,000 and $25,000.\nThe other items making up the total of $95,714 consisted mainly of claims based upon an estimated loss of sales and consequent loss of profits over a period of five years. A perusal of the evidence submitted to establish this loss is not convincing apart from that incurred in the actual moving and allowed for under a separate heading. In fact the secretary-treasurer of the appellant when asked: \"The move might be beneficial?\" replied: \"I admit that possibility also but I put in a figure because there is a possibility of a loss.\" Moreover, counsel for the appellant informed us that since the hearing other premises have been obtained which it may be assumed are more satisfactory. Quite apart from this latter factor, however, I am in agreement with the learned President that upon the evidence the items are not established and cannot be allowed.\nThe learned President made no allowance for compulsory taking. He apparently adopted a valuation of the property at about $100,000 and stated that he could not fix the disturbance allowance higher than $20,000 and allowed as a total compensation $120,000.\nThe allowance for compulsory taking is founded upon a long established practice in the Courts and is granted as part of the compensation. It is a factor in the compensation separate and apart from what would be included as disturbance allowance. So well established was the practice in Great Britain that as early as 1890 when it was deemed undesirable to make this allowance in connection with certain properties a statute was enacted to that effect (s. 21, of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, 53 & 54 Vict., c. 70). It was there provided that when land was taken in an unhealthy area no \"additional allowance in respect of compulsory purchase\" shall be made. The distinction between the allowance for disturbance and that for compulsory taking was emphasized in Great Britain in 1919 with the passage of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation Act, 1919) where in sec. 2(1) it is specifically provided that an allowance for compulsory taking is not permitted under that Act while in sec. 2(6) it is specifically provided that rule 2 should not affect the allowance for disturbance. This provision is dealt with in Horn v. Sunderland Corp. 9. In this Court the allowance for compulsory taking was granted in Irving Oil Co. Ltd. v. The King 10 and prior thereto in The King v. Trudel 11; The King v. Hunting, et al 12; The King v. Hearn 13.\nThe amount allowed may be varied and there are cases where, having regard to the circumstances, no allowance should be made, but, with great respect, the circumstances in this case do not distinguish it from these cases in which an amount for compulsory taking was allowed. This amount is computed on a percentage of the value of the land, and therefore the sum of $120,000 should be altered by adding thereto the sum of $10,000 for compulsory taking.\nThe judgment appealed from should be so varied and the appellant should have its costs of this appeal.\nLocke J. (dissenting): This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court whereby it was found that the amount of compensation to which the appellant was entitled for its property in the City of Victoria, expropriated by the Crown under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, cap. 64, was the sum of $120,000. The lands taken consisted of Lots 1599, 1600, 1601 and 1602, constituting a rectangular block having a sixty foot frontage on Government Street and a like frontage on Langley Street. Upon this property there was a two-story building wherein the appellant has carried on since 1919 the business of a wholesale and retail dealer in books, stationery, office furniture and other like supplies, and has operated a printing establishment. The information filed by the Crown alleged that a sum of $99,670 was sufficient to compensate for the taking of the said lands and premises and for the loss and damage alleged to have been caused by such taking. The appellant by its defence asserted that it was entitled to the sum of $232,165.34 and interest. Particulars of this claim furnished by the appellant were as follows:\n1. Value to the owner of the said lands and\npremises and compulsory dispossession of\nthe same \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $132,451.00\n2. Surveys, plans and search for new and sui-\ntable premises \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 4,000.00\n3.

Increased costs of operations resulting from\nthe removal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 54,004.03\n__________\n$232,165.34\nAs to the value to be assigned to the land, the buildings and certain fixtures forming part of the freehold which the appellant would be unable to remove and as to the value of which there was no conflict, there was the usual wide divergence of opinion among the expert witnesses called. For the owners, Mr. George A. Okell, a former city assessor for the City of Victoria, was of the opinion that if $10,000 to $15,000 was spent upon the building the revenue returns from rental would justify a valuation of from $180,000 to $185,000, while admitting that at the time of expropriation in 1946, when business rentals were subject to the Rental Regulations, he did not think it could have been sold for that amount. The building on the property was a composite of three buildings erected on Lots 1599, 1600 and 1601 some forty or fifty years ago, and a structure erected on Lot 1602 in 1932 at a cost of $8,000. As to these buildings, Mr. Charles F. Dawson, District Resident Architect at Victoria of the Department of Public Works for Canada, was of the opinion that they had outlived their usefulness. He had examined them and estimated that in 1946, at the time of the expropriation, it would have cost $54,349 to replace them with similar new construction and considered that from that figure there should be a deduction of 40 per cent for depreciation In addition, the witness estimated the value of the boiler room on the property, which was of more recent construction, at $5,000 and the value of the fixtures which would be left by the appellant when vacating at $10,750. Mr. James G. Watts, an employee of an appraisal company, estimated the depreciated value of the buildings as approximately $52,000. Of the witnesses called for the Crown, Mr. F. E. Winslow, the local manager of the Royal Trust Company and who had occupied that position for something more than thirty years, considered the market value of the property, including the fixtures, to have been $98,750 as of the date of the expropriation. He further expressed the opinion that a purchaser anxious to obtain the property might have paid from $10,000 to $20,000 in excess of that amount for vacant possession. Mr. F. B. J. Stephenson, the manager of a company engaged in the real estate business in Victoria and who had been engaged in that occupation for some thirty years, valued the property at $102,970, including his own valuation of the fixtures of $7,500, and expressed the opinion that he could have sold the property for that amount in February, 1946. Mr. H. C. Holmes who had had a long experience in real estate in Victoria, arrived at a valuation of $110,000 basing this on what he considered would be the net rental return from the property, which he considered would be roughly 4 per cent of the figure mentioned. In addition to this evidence, it was shown that the property was assessed by the City of Victoria at $38,870 and that upon the books of the appellant company the land was carried at $15,805.14 and the building at $30,784.22, a total of $46,589.36, against which depreciation had been taken over the years in the amount of $7,728.11, showing a net book value of $38,861.25. In the particulars of the appellant's claim to the amount claimed for the lands and premises there was added an amount for compulsory dispossession, the total being $132,451. The remainder of the claim consisted of three items, the first being for surveys, plans and expenditures in searching for new and suitable premises in the sum of $4,000. Under a general heading purporting to show actual moving costs, in addition to estimated cartage of $1,200, there were large items such as a prospective lag in sales in the appellant's new premises during the first year of $25,000, an estimated loss of gross income on sales during a period of from five to ten days while moving in the sum of $5,809.15 and an estimated loss of 10 per cent on five years advertising in the sum of $2,500. It was shown that in anticipation of the expropriation the appellant had been able to acquire other premises on the east side of Government Street within a block of its present location known as the Five Sisters Block where all of its activities other than the operation of the printing plant could be properly accommodated, and that nearby it had been able to acquire a suitable building for the printing establishment. The third item designated \"Increased Costs resulting from Moving\" claimed at $54,004.03 consisted of an estimate of the additional costs of operation in the new premises for five years.\nThe learned trial judge, while finding that the appellant would undoubtedly suffer some loss through the disturbance resulting from having to move its business, considered that the claims made were excessive. As to the item of $4,000 for surveys, plans and search for new and suitable premises, he considered that the claim was not proven, except in respect of certain items which might be taxable as part of the costs of the proceedings. As to the claim under the heading \"Actual Moving Costs\", he considered the items for loss of fixtures in moving, for a 10 per cent loss on five years advertising, and the claim for loss of sales during the first year should be excluded, and that the item of $5,809.15 for loss of gross sales during moving was excessive. As to the item for loss of fixtures in moving in the amount of $1,424.53, the claim was abandoned in the argument before this Court and no evidence was given as to the net loss which would result from the anticipated lag in sales or as to the net profit lost by reason of the anticipated loss of gross income on sales during the period of moving. As to the claim for increased costs of operation resulting from the removal, the learned trial judge found that no such claim had been substantiated and that, while there would be some loss through moving and some increased cost of operation due to the fact that the printing plant would be operated in a different building from the retail store and at a distance from it, against such loss and increased expenses there would be several offsetting advantages. The evidence established, in his opinion, that the Five Sisters property was more valuable for the appellant's purposes than its old location and he thought it probable that the losses from disturbance and the increased cost of operation would be more than offset by the resulting advantages of better premises and a better location. While considering that in determining the compensation he was not required to fix the amount of the defendant's claim for disturbance under the various headings separately, he said that, if he were, he could not fairly fix the amount higher than $20,000.\nThe principle to be followed in determining the compensation to be paid to an owner whose property is compulsorily taken cannot be more briefly or clearly expressed than in the judgments of the Judicial Committee in Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company v. Lacoste 14 and in Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister 15. It is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking and not the value to the taker which is to be determined. That value consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, and it is their present value that is to be determined. As stated by Lord Moulton in the Pastoral Finance case 15, probably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that the owner is entitled to be paid what a prudent man in his position would have been willing to pay for the land sooner than fail to obtain it. This formula was applied by Duff J. in Lake Erie and Northern Railway Company v. Bradford and Galt Golf and Country Club 16, and has been consistently followed in the decisions of this Court. It is a thing of value capable of being expressed in money for the owner to be permitted to continue in possession in the operation of his business and to avoid the cost of moving and such disruption as might be caused by having to do so. That value is clearly to be included in determining what the property is worth to the owner (Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Glasgow and South Western Railway Company 17; Home v. Sunderland 18). In addition, if a business location is a particularly favourable one in which to carry on operations for the owner and another equally satisfactory location is unobtainable, the lands have an added value to him, the present worth of which should be calculated. In the present matter, the claimant sought to establish by evidence that the property expropriated was a more favourable place for the carrying on of its business than the Five Sisters property situated on the opposite side of Government about a block away, but there was evidence on the point indicating that the contrary was the case, which the learned trial judge has seen fit to accept. The claim that the value of the expropriated premises should be increased on the ground that it was a more profitable location for the operation of the appellant's business than other available property failed. Admittedly, moving costs would be incurred and while no evidence was given as to what loss of profit would be suffered during the five- or ten-day period of moving, the evidence merely being that of the estimated loss of gross income on sales during the period, undoubtedly some loss would be caused. It has been made clear in the reasons for judgment that a substantial allowance has been made for what may be called disturbance, in determining the value of the property to the owner. Whether the learned trial judge intended to indicate by the statement that, if he were required to fix the amount of the claim for disturbance separately he could not fairly fix the amount higher than $20,000, this amount formed part of the value assigned to the property is not clear. I agree that it was unnecessary to itemize the various amounts the sum of which totalled the amount awarded. It is clear that consideration has been given to the various factors which might be relevant in determining the value of this property to the owner and I think no case has been made for interference with the amount of the award. In the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it is said, inter alia, that the standard by which the right to compensation for property expropriated is to be measured is prescribed by section 47 of the Exchequer Court Act. In my opinion, this is error. The section which is one of a group falling under the heading \"Rules for Adjudicating upon Claims\" does nothing more than to declare the date as of which the value of the land taken is to be determined. It had its origin in sec. 17 of the Government Railways Act 1881 which read:\nThe arbitrators, in estimating and awarding the amount to be paid to any claimant for injury done to any land or property and in estimating the amount to be paid for lands taken by the Minister under this Act, or taken by the proper authority under any former Act, shall estimate or assess the value thereof at the time when the injury complained of was occasioned, and not the value of the adjoining lands at the time of making their award.\nIn the Official Arbitrators Act, cap. 40, R.S.C. 1886 (with minor changes which did not affect its meaning), the section was reenacted as sec. 16. When the latter statute was repealed by the Supreme and Exchequer Court Acts, cap. 16, Statutes of 1887, these provisions were reenacted in sec. 32, omitting the words \"and not according to the value of the adjoining lands at the time of making their award\", which were apparently regarded as redundant, and in this form are continued in sec. 47 of the present Act. The terms of the section, as originally enacted, indicate clearly the purpose of the section and its meaning has not been affected, in my opinion, by the omission of the above mentioned words. If I were of the opinion that the learned trial judge in determining the quantum of the compensation awarded had considered that this was limited in any manner by anything in sec. 47, I would consider that the award should be set aside and that there should be a rehearing, but I think it is clear from the context that this is not so. While indicating his opinion that sec. 47 limited the amount of the compensation, the learned trial judge proceeded to say that under its terms it was the value to the owner which was to be determined and while I disagree with his opinion that the matter is affected by sec. 47 except in the manner indicated, in the result it is clear that this has not affected the quantum of the award. As to the claim for an allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking, this is not a matter of right (The King v. Lariv\u00e9e) and can only be justified as a part of the valuation (Cripps on Compensation, 8th Ed. p. 213) and in the circumstances of this case there should be, in my opinion, no such addition to the award.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Moresby, Farr, Byers & Moresby.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Straith, Pringle, Ruttan & Gouge.\n1 [1946] S.C.R. 551.\n2 [1914] A.C. 1083.\n3 [1939] A.C. 302.\n4 (1917) 55 S.C.R. 153 at 189.\n5 [1946] S.C.R. 551.\n6 [1914] A.C. 569.\n7 [1914] A.C. 1083.\n8 (1887) 12 A.C. 315.\n9 (1941) 2 K.B. 26.\n10 [1946] S.C.R. 551.\n11 (1914) 49 S.C.R. 501.\n12 (1917) 32 D.L.R. 331.\n13 (1917) 55 S.C.R. 562.\n14 [1914] A.C. 569.\n15 [1914] A.C. 1083.\n15 [1914] A.C. 1083.\n16 (1917) 32 D.L.R. 219, 229.\n17 (1887) 12 A.C. 315, 323.\n18 (1941) 2 K.B. 26, 32.\n",

VI, c. 14, ss. 2(m), 3(1) (j), 8(2) (a).\nBy antenuptial contract made in 1916, the husband obligated himself during the existence of his intended marriage, to pay his wife $20,000, in consideration of her renunciation of community and dower. This sum remained unpaid at the husband's death in 1943. His executors claimed to deduct this from the value of his estate for the purpose of the Succession Duty Act of the Dominion. The deduction was disallowed by the Minister but restored by the Exchequer Court.\nHeld, (Kerwin J. dissenting), that the agreement did not fall within the definition of \"succession\" in s. 2(m) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act. Held, further, (Kerwin J. dissenting), that property transferred or agreed to be transferred in consideration of marriage, prior to April 29, 1941, is not deemed to be a \"succession\" under s. 3(1) (j) of the Act.\nPer The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.: The renunciation of community and dower is a \"consideration in money or money's worth\" within the meaning of s. 8(2) (a).\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): As the widow became entitled upon the husband's death, it is a \"succession\" within s. 2(m) of the Act. It is not a debt under s. 8(2) (a), because it was not created \"for full consideration in money or money's worth\".\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, Cameron J., reversing the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming an assessment made under the Dominion Succession Duty Act.\nJ. G. McEntyre and R. G. Decary for the appellant.\nC. A. Hale, K.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014The Minister of National Revenue appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada 2 rendered on the 28th of October, 1947, maintaining the respondents' appeal from an assessment of succession duties upon the estate of the late Doctor George. Alexander Fleet, in his lifetime of the City of Montreal.\nDoctor Fleet died on the 23rd of April, 1943, and in his Will, appointed the Royal Trust Company and his wife, Helena Ada Dawes as executors of his estate, valued at $115,562.81. Doctor Fleet and his wife, both domiciled in the City of Montreal in the Province of Quebec, were married on June 1st, 1916, and on May 25th of the same year, they executed before John F. Reddy of Montreal, N.P., a marriage contract which stipulated separation of property and an obligation by Doctor Fleet to pay to his wife during their marriage, the sum of $20,000. It was further provided that in the event of such sum not having been paid during the marriage, and in the event of his wife surviving him, she would immediately upon his death have the right to receive from his estate, payment of the said sum with interest at the rate of six per centum from the date of the death. The executors filed with the Minister of National Revenue, as provided for by the Dominion Succession Duty Act, a statement showing the assets and liabilities of the estate, and in which the sum of $20,000, which had not been paid during the lifetime of the deceased, appeared as a liability. The Minister disallowed this sum as a debt of the estate, and Mr. Justice Cameron 3 allowed the appeal of the respondents, holding that the sum of $20,000 did not form part of the succession, was not a part of the taxable estate and not subject therefore to duty. It is from the setting aside of this assessment that the Minister of National Revenue now appeals.\nThe marriage contract stipulates that no community of property shall at any time exist between the parties, that there shall be no dower, and that in consideration of the renunciation by the wife to community and dower, the husband promised and obliged himself to pay to his wife during the existence of the marriage, a sum of $20,000. The marriage contract also contained the following paragraph:\u2014\nAnd provided that in the event of the said obligation not being paid or satisfied during the existence of said marriage and that the said party of the second part should survive the said party of the first part, she, the said party of the second part, shall immediately upon the decease of the said party of the first part have the right to demand, collect and receive from the Estate of the said party of the first part payment of the said sum of Twenty Thousand dollars, which, in such case, shall bear interest from the date of the decease of the said party of the first part at the rate of six per centum per annum.\nThe relevant sections of the Dominion Succession Duty Act are the following:\u2014\n2. (m) \"succession\" means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person, to any other person in possession or expectancy, and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession;\n3. (1) A \"succession\" shall be deemed to include the following dispositions of property and the beneficiary and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \"successor\" and \"predecessor\" respectively in relation to such property: (j) property transferred to or settled on or agreed to be transferred to or settled on any person or persons whatsoever on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years of the death, by the deceased person, in consideration of marriage;\n8. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding subsection allowance shall not be made,\n(a) for any debt incurred by the deceased or encumbrance created by a disposition made by him unless such debt or encumbrance was created bona fide for full consideration in money or money's worth wholly for the deceased's own use and benefit and to be paid out of his estate;\nDealing first with the claim of the executors that the promise of the husband to pay $20,000 was \"a debt incurred by the deceased created bona fide for full consideration in money or money's worth wholly for the deceased's own use and benefit\" was subject to an allowance, the learned trial judge held that it was not. He came to the conclusion that at the time of the marriage contract, neither party possessed any assets of any real value, and that Mrs. Fleet in surrendering her rights to community and to dower, did not give to her husband, nor did he receive, full consideration in money or money's worth in return for the obligation to pay $20,000. He held that in order to determine that full consideration had been received reference must be made to the facts as they existed at the time of the contract, and not to the facts existing twenty-seven years later.\nIn renouncing community of property, the wife abandoned one-half ownership in the earnings of her husband, as a physician and surgeon, and therefore gave up her potential rights to one-half ownership in the entire estate, which at the time of her husband's death amounted to $115,562.81. In renouncing the customary dower, she also abandoned a potential right to the usufruct of one-half of the immovables which belonged to her husband at the time of the marriage, and of one-half of those which might have accrued to him during the marriage, from his father, mother, or other ascendants. (C.C. 1434.)\nIn consideration of these renunciations, Mrs. Fleet was promised $20,000. I find it impossible to say that the obligation of the husband to pay this $20,000 is a mere debt contracted by him without consideration. It is admitted by all parties that this obligation was created bona fide, and I am quite satisfied that there was ample consideration. The husband promised to pay $20,000, and the wife agreed not to claim an amount which eventually proved to be much larger than what the estate now owes her. She also waived her right to dispose by Will of half of her husband's property, if she had predeceased him, which would have meant a partition of Doctor Fleet's whole assets during his lifetime.\nMarriage contracts often contain gratuitous provisions, which of course in certain cases may be taxable, but they also very frequently contain covenants which are not of the same character. In the present case, the agreement entered into was bilateral, onerous, and I find that the essential element of gratuitousness necessary to constitute a gift, is absent. The jurisprudence and the teachings of the authors are unanimous on this point. Vide Turgeon v. Shannon 4; Simpson v. Thomas 5; Filion v. Beaujeu 6; Huot v. Bienvenue 7; Lapointe v. Larochelle 8; Royal Trust Company v. The King 9.\nIn Sabourin v. P\u00e9riard (1), it was held:\u2014\nWhere a wife sues the testamentary executor of her husband claiming $2,000 under the marriage contract and the payment is refused on the ground that the marriage contract was never registered, the action should be maintained if it appears that the wife in renouncing her dower renounced to more than she would have received otherwise and the obligation to pay the amount claimed became an onerous one and consequently did not require to be registered.\nAt page 43, Mr. Justice Mackinnon says:\u2014\nAlthough the word \"donation\" is found in the clause of the marriage contract stipulating the payment to the plaintiff of an amount of $2,000 this in no way changes the nature of the contract. The plaintiff in renouncing her dower renounced to more than she was to receive and the obligation undertaken by her husband in the marriage contract became an onerous one.\nAt pages 44 and 45, Mr. Justice Bissonnette expresses his views as follows:\u2014\nComme M. le juge Mackinnon le d\u00e9montre \u00e0 mon enti\u00e8re satisfaction, la convention particuli\u00e8re et inusit\u00e9e que contient le contrat de mariage est bilat\u00e9rale et on\u00e9reuse, de sorte qu'elle \u00e9chappe aux exigences ordinaires de l'enregistrement des donations. Au surplus, la preuve que le dossier nous apporte \u00e9carte davantage tout doute, puisqu'elle r\u00e9v\u00e8le la remise de prestations synallagmatiques, apparemment plus lourdes pour la donataire que pour le donateur. Par cette preuve, toute pr\u00e9somption de gratuit\u00e9 qui s'attache aux clauses habituelles des conventions matrimoniales est non seulement d\u00e9truite, mais cette stipulation, bien que qualifi\u00e9e de donation, devient une convention \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux, parce que l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 ne s'y retrouve pas.\nIt will also be interesting to consult the following authors:\u2014\nDalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique (1912, Vol. Donation, t. 4, pages 519 and 520) where the learned author says:\u2014\n3. La donation est un acte essentiellement gratuit; n\u00e9anmoins, elle peut \u00eatre faite avec stipulation de certaines charges. Dans ce cas m\u00eame, la donation ne cesse pas d'\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une transmission \u00e0 titre gratuit, et est soumise, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e8gles des donations entre vifs.\nCependant, si la charge impos\u00e9e au donataire \u00e9gale l'avantage qu'il retire de la donation, il n'y a plus de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, et l'acte, bien que qualifi\u00e9 de donation, constitue une convention \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux, sans, d'ailleurs, qu'il y ait \u00e0 distinguer suivant que les charges sont impos\u00e9es au profit du donateur ou au profit d'un tiers,\u2014Jug\u00e9, en ce sens, que l'acte qualifi\u00e9 donation, qui impose au donataire des charges ou des services d'une valeur \u00e9quivalente ou sensiblement \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle des biens donn\u00e9s, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme constituant, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, un contrat \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux.\nPlaniol, Droit Civil, (8th ed., p. 491, para. 2505) says:\u2014\n2505. Donations on\u00e9reused\u2014Une donation n'est pas toujours enti\u00e8rement gratuite; souvent des charges diverses sont impos\u00e9es au donataire; on a alors une donation avec charges ou donation sub modo. L'existence de ces charges peut diminuer ou m\u00eame d\u00e9truire compl\u00e8tement le caract\u00e8re gratuit de l'acte. Voyez ce qui en est dit ci-dessous, nos. 3009 et suiv.\nI, therefore, have to come to the conclusion that in 1916, Doctor Fleet contracted \"a debt in good faith, for full consideration in money or money's worth for his own use or benefit\", and that the second part of section 8 (2) (a) of the Act applies. With deference I cannot agree on this point with the trial judge, although I fully concur with him in the other reasons that he gives in his judgment.\nI have cited supra the definition given in the Act, in section 2 (m), of the word \"succession\". The last words of this definition are the following: \"and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession\". Section 3 enumerates several dispositions of property deemed to be included in a succession, and subsection (j) says that \"property transferred to or settled on or agreed to be transferred to or settled on any person or persons whatsoever on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years of the death, by the deceased person, in consideration of marriage\" is deemed to be included in a succession. It follows that if, in consideration of marriage, property is transferred after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years of the death, the amount of the property thus transferred is taxable. It is also logical to say that if the property is transferred in consideration of marriage, before the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, the property transferred is not subject to duty; and nobody could successfully argue that if Doctor Fleet had paid to his wife before the above mentioned date, the $20,000 that he had promised in his marriage contract to pay her, the Minister of National Revenue would be entitled to claim succession duties at the death of Doctor Fleet. But, section 3(1) (j) does not apply only to property which is actually transferred; it applies also to property settled on or agreed to be transferred in consideration of marriage. It seems therefore clear to me that Doctor Fleet having, before the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and obviously within three years prior to his death, agreed to transfer $20,000 to his wife in consideration of marriage, this amount is excluded from duty. The agreement made between the parties is by law, put on the same footing as a complete transfer. In virtue of this section 3 (1) (j), the amount thus agreed to be transferred is property which is not deemed to be included in the succession.\nIt has been further argued that the agreement falls within the definition of \"succession\" contained in section 2 (m). The mere reading of 2 (m) will show that this contention cannot prevail. As the learned trial judge said, this sum of $20,000 is not payable to Mrs. Fleet by devolution by law, nor did she become beneficially entitled thereto upon the death of Doctor Fleet. The agreement was made in 1916 and she became beneficially entitled thereto on that date or, in any event, during the lifetime of Doctor Fleet as the contract provided. It was not by reason of Doctor Fleet's death that the money was payable to her. It has also been contended that alternatively the disposition here made falls within the dispositions deemed to be included in a succession, by subsections (a), (b) or (d) of section 3. These subsections read as follows:\u2014\n(a) Property and income therefrom voluntarily transferred by grant, bargain or gift, or by any form or manner of transfer made in general contemplation of the death of the grantor, bargainor or donor, and with or without regard to the imminence of such death, or made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after such death to any person in trust or otherwise, or the effect of which is that any person becomes beneficially entitled in possession or expectancy to such property or income;\n(b) property taken as a donatio mortis causa;\n(d) property taken under a gift whenever ade of which actual and bona fide possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee or by a trustee for the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him, whether voluntary or by contract or otherwise;\nThese sections have no application. Under (a), in order that the property may be deemed a succession, it has to be voluntarily transferred by grant, bargain or gift, or made in general contemplation of the death of the grantor. Here, no property was transferred; there was merely an agreement to pay later. The agreement was not entered in general contemplation of death, it was made in contemplation of marriage. It cannot be said either that it falls under subsection (b) as being property taken as a \"donatio mortis causa.\" The elements which are necessary to constitute a donation mortis causa have been dealt with by the learned trial judge, and none of these elements can be found in the agreement that has been entered into. As to (d), it is clear that it cannot apply.\nI, therefore, come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue against a judgment of the Exchequer Court 10 allowing the respondents' appeal from an assessment of succession duties upon the estate of the late Dr. George Alexander Fleet. The respondents are the executors of Dr. Fleet who was domiciled and resident at the City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, and who died April 23rd, 1943. The point to be determined depends upon the construction of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, chapter 14 of the Statutes of 1940-1941, which came into force June 14th, 1941, and of a marriage contract executed May 25th, 1916, between Dr. Fleet and Helena A. Dawes, the parties to which were married on June 1st of the same year.\nAt the time of the execution of the contract and of the marriage, both parties were without any substantial assets. The contract stipulated separation of property. Miss Dawes possessed certain personal effects and jewellery, and it was agreed that all goods, chattels, household furniture, moveables and effects at any time found in and garnishing the parties' common domicile should belong to the wife, and there was a covenant by the husband to pay his wife during the existence of the marriage the sum of $10,000 for the purpose of purchasing such goods. The right to dower was renounced. Clause 5 of the contract provided in part as follows:\u2014\nIn consideration of the stipulation that no community of property ia to exist between said parties and further in consideration of the renunciation to dower hereinabove made by the said party of the second part, the said party of the first part doth hereby promise and oblige himself to pay to the said party of the second part during the existence of said intended marriage, the sum of Twenty Thousand dollars, but as an obligation on the part of the said party of the first part purely and solely in favour of the said Miss Helena Ada Dawes said party of the second part.\nAnd provided that in the event of the said obligation not being paid or satisfied during the existence of said marriage and that the said party of the second part should survive the said party of the first part, she, the said party of the second part, shall immediately upon the decease of the said party of the first part have the right to demand, collect and receive from the Estate of the said party of the first part payment of the said sum of Twenty Thousand dollars, which, in such case, shall bear interest from the date of the decease of the said party of the first part at the rate of six per centum per annum.\nIt was also agreed that the obligation on the part of Dr. Fleet to pay the sum of $10,000 was purely personal to and exclusively in favour of the wife and that, in the event of her predeceasing her husband before the sum should have been paid her, her representatives should have no claim in respect thereto.\nBy his Will, Dr. Fleet directed his executors to pay his debts, including such indebtedness, if any, as might remain unpaid under the contract. No part having been paid in his lifetime, his executors, in filing a return under the Act, claimed that the total amount should be deducted from the value of his estate which, due to the doctor's own efforts since his marriage, amounted to about $130,000. This deduction was disallowed by the Minister but was restored by the Exchequer Court 11.\nUnder section 6 of the Act, subject to the exemptions mentioned in section 7 (with which we are not concerned), there is to be assessed, levied and paid, at the rates provided for in the first schedule, duties (inter alia) upon or in respect of the succession to all real or immoveable property situated in Canada, and all personal property where-ever situated, of a deceased domiciled in a province of Canada. By section 2 (d) \"deceased\" means a person dying after the coming into force of the Act, and by section 2 (m):\u2014\n(m) \"succession\" means every past or future disposition of property, by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property or the income thereof upon the death of any deceased person, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any such deceased person to any other person in possession or expectancy, and also includes any disposition of property deemed by this Act to be included in a succession;\nThe trial judge decided that the widow did not \"become beneficially entitled\" to the $20,000 \"upon the death\" of Dr. Fleet. \"The agreement\" he states \"was made in 1916 and she became beneficially entitled thereto on that date or in any event during the lifetime of Dr. Fleet as the contract provided. It was not by reason of his death that the money was payable to her.\"\nWith respect, I am unable to agree. Upon the husband's death, \"the event has occurred upon which (her) title accrued\", per Jessel M.R., in Attorney General v. Noyes 12 and, as it is put by Lord Justice Brett in the same case, at 141:\u2014\"The condition which has not happened is not to be regarded.\" Lord Justice Cotton, the third member of the Court of Appeal, expressed a similar opinion. The point there decided was that as the succession under a certain settlement actually took effect on the death of the settlor, succession duty was payable upon the whole of the fund and not merely on the income of it for the period between the death of the settlor and the end of a term when the beneficiaries would have become entitled, in any event, to the corpus. The circumstances were quite different from those before us but the same reasoning should be applied.\nSection 2 (m) corresponds sufficiently to section 2 of the British Succession Duty Act, 1853, to make opposite the remarks of Lord Macnaghten in Northumberland v. Attorney General 13 :\u2014\"It is clear the terms \"disposition\" and \"devolution\" must have been intended to comprehend and exhaust every conceivable mode by which property can pass, whether by act of parties or by act of law.\" Leaving aside the question of sales, section 2 (m) of our Act is wide enough to cover dispositions made for value.\nSection 2 (m) states that \"succession\" means certain things and also includes any disposition of property deemed by the Act to be included in a succession, thereby referring to section 3:\u2014\n3. (1) A \"succession\" shall be deemed to include the following dispositions of property and the beneficiary and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \"successor\" and \"predecessor\" respectively in relation to such property:\u2014\nHere follow certain provisions which enlarge the definition of \"succession\" in section 2 (m) so as to bring into the revenue cases not covered by 2 (m). While I am conscious of the warning given by the Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ontario v. Perry 14 in considering the Ontario Succession Duty Act, to proceed with caution in applying decisions upon British taxing statutes as amended from time to time to enactments elsewhere that appear full grown, the proper relationship of section 2 (m) and section 3 is that pointed out by Lord Macnaghten in Earl Cowley v. Inland Revenue Commissioners 15. After referring to the principle on which the Finance Act of 1894 was founded, he proceeds:\u2014\nSect. 1 gives effect to that principle. Subject to certain exceptions or savings, it imposes a duty called estate duty upon the principal value of all property \"settled or not settled\" which passes on death. Sect. 2 is merely subsidiary and supplemental. It was intended apparently to sweep in a few cases which were thought perhaps to be within the spirit though not within the letter of the proposed enactment, or else were supposed likely to lead to evasion if not made equally subject to estate duty. Sect. 2 therefore declares that the expression \"property passing on the death of the deceased\" shall be \"deemed to include\" property classified under four different heads, to no one of which rightly understood is that expression literally applicable.\nLord Davey, at page 128, agreed, although whether the case fell within the first or second section, he arrived at the same result. The Earl of Halsbury was of the same opinion (p. 207).\nIn this view, it is unnecessary to consider whether the marriage contract falls within section 3 (j):\u2014\n(j) property transferred to or settled on or agreed to be transferred to or settled on any person or persons whatsoever on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years of the death, by the deceased person, in consideration of marriage;\nHowever, arguments have been advanced as to the meaning of this provision and it is advisable that they should be dealt with. Contrary to the submission of the appellant, my view is that the date, April 29th, 1941, applies not only to transfers and settlements but also to agreements therefor. But I am unable to agree with the respondent's contention that 3 (j) is a special category, applying to all transfers and agreements therefor made in consideration of marriage, and that unless such an agreement falls within 3 (j), it must be taken out of 2 (m). It is to be recollected that the Act came into force June 14th, 1941; that it applies only to the death of a deceased occurring thereafter; and that April 29th, 1941, is the date on which the Budget of that year was introduced in the House of Commons. It had been held by the Judicial Committee in. A.G. for Ontario v. Perry (supra) that marriage was a good and valuable consideration for the transfer of property, and that such a transfer did not constitute a gift within a section of the Ontario Succession Duty Act. In the Dominion Act, the main provision as to successions upon which duties are levied is found in section 2 (m), which, however, requires the beneficiary to become beneficially entitled to property upon the death of the deceased. A transfer made in consideration of marriage, presumably not being a gift under one of the earlier paragraphs of section 3, Parliament decided in 3 (j) to make provision as to such transfers. Any property actually transferred in consideration of marriage before April 29th, 1941, and property so transferred after that date but more than three years prior to the death, is not covered. Neither of these cases falls within 2 (m) because the beneficiary did not become entitled upon a deceased's death and they are not touched by 3 (j) which requires a transfer after April 29th, 1941, and within three years of the death.\nParliament also dealt in section 3 (j) with agreements to transfer or settle in consideration of marriage. As I have already stated, to me, the natural reading of the clause applies the date April 29th, 1941, to these agreements. If A agreed to transfer in consideration of marriage and, as in the case before us, the beneficiary becomes entitled upon A's death, section 2 (m) applies. However, there would be no succession within 2 (m) if the agreement was to transfer, not at A's death but at some date which turned out to be after such death, as, for instance, if the agreement were to transfer at the expiration of ten years and A died before that time arrived. Parliament provided for such a situation by 3 (j).\nWhile Dr. Fleet's marriage contract falls within section 2 (m), the $20,000 would be a debt for which an allowance should be made pursuant to subsection 1 of section 8:\u2014\nIn determining the aggregate net value and dutiable value respectively, an allowance shall be made for debts and encumbrances \u2026\nunless it falls within the terms of subsection 2 (a) of section 8, which reads as follows:\u2014\n(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding subsection allowance shall not be made,\u2014\n(a) for any debt incurred by the deceased or encumbrance created by a disposition made by him unless such debt or encumbrance was created bona fide for full consideration in money or money's worth wholly for the deceased's own use and benefit and to be paid out of his estate;\nThe words \"for full consideration in money or money's worth\" appear in section 17 of the British Succession Duty Act, and in a consideration of them in Floyer v. Bankes 16, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Westbury, at page 312, points out:\u2014\"Marriage is by the law of England a valuable consideration for a contract and that of the highest kind; but property arising under a contract in consideration of marriage is not excepted even in favour of persons coming directly within that consideration.\" Accordingly, a marriage contract or settlement being a \"disposition\" within section 2 of the British Act, it has been held that money payable thereunder upon death is subject to succession duty since the contract or settlement was not made for valuable consideration in money or money's worth. This has been held to be so in respect of (a) a sum which a father covenanted in his daughter's marriage contract to pay at the first term after his death to her trustees: Lord Advocate v. Roberts' Trustees 17; (b) a sum which a bridegroom bound himself in his ante-nuptial contract to pay after his death to his children: Lord Advocate v. Maiklam's Trustees (1878) Court of Session, not reported but referred to in Green's Death Duties, 2nd edition, at page 420, and in Hanson's Death Duties, 9th edition, at 578.\nThese decisions should be followed in the present case under our Act and none the less although the marriage contract was executed in Quebec. It may be taken that the jurisprudence and doctrine in that province are that such a contract is bilateral and onerous, and not gratuitous; but granting all that and admittting that the $20,000 was a debt created bona fide, it should be held that it was not created \"for full consideration in money or money's worth\". The appeal should be allowed with costs in both Courts and the decision of the Minister affirmed.\nThe judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand, J.:\u2014The Crown claims succession duty in respect of the sum of $20,000 which accrued to the respondent, Dawes, on the death of her husband in the following circumstances. They were married June 1st, 1916. On May 25th, a week before, they had entered into a marriage contract by which, among other things, it was agreed (a) that community of property should not exist between them, (b) that they should be separate as to property, (c) that there should be no dower for either wife or children, and (d), in consideration of the stipulation that community should not exist and the renunciation of dower, the husband obliged himself to pay to the wife during marriage the sum of $20,000. If payment should not have been so made, the wife, surviving the husband, would be entitled to collect from his estate, with interest from that date until payment; but should the wife predecease the husband, the obligation would thereupon become void. The husband died on April 23rd, 1943, without having paid over any part of the money.\nThat Article 1257 of the Civil Code permits such a provision in a marriage contract is undoubted:\u2014\n\u2026 toutes sortes de conventions, m\u00eame celles qui seraient nulles dans tout autre acte entrevifs;\nand specifically:\u2014\n\u2026 la donation de biens futurs.\nThen section 777 by the last paragraph provides:\u2014\n\u2026la donation \u2026d'une somme d'argent ou autre chose non d\u00e9termin\u00e9e que le donateur promet payer ou livrer, dessaisit le donateur en ce sens qu'il devient d\u00e9biteur du donataire.\nThe contract, therefore, creates an obligation which, apart from any question of registration, is a cr\u00e9ance against the husband and his estate in favour of his wife, and which, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, as in the case of the Bankruptcy Act, ranks the wife as a creditor; in re Denis B. Viger, insolvent 18: in re Morin, ex parte Hamil 19: in re Cameron, ex parte Hebert 20. The obligation must, however, be distinguished from the legal result where a community exists but a special sum is agreed upon as the value of the wife's share. In that case, upon dissolution of the community the property right becomes realized, subject only to the limitation; the community is preserved for all purposes except the quantum. Here we have separation of goods, the right of the wife to prove with other creditors of her husband, and the termination of the obligation should she predecease him.\nThat being its nature, is it a \"disposition\" within the meaning of that word in s. 2 (m) of the Dominion Succession Act?\nThe decisive consideration is the meaning to be attributed to s. 3 (1) (j) of that Act. The paragraph is as follows:\u2014\n(j) property transferred to or settled on or agreed to be (transferred to or settled on any person or persons whatsoever on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, and within three years of the death, by the deceased person, in consideration of marriage;\nand the crucial language, \"or agreed to be transferred, etc.\". The Crown's contention is that s. 3 must be taken to be an enlargement of the definition of \"succession\" in s. 2 (m) and that I think is so; but so far as it assumes that if transfers dealt with in s. 3 had become effective \"on the death\" of the deceased they would be within the definition, it is not fully warranted. For instance, paragraph (h) is a benefit accruing upon a death, but it must, I should say, be taken as outside the definition: Fryer v. Morland 21.\nIf paragraph (j) by itself is capable of a clear and rational meaning, I must first examine its effect before assuming any particular scope to s. 2 (m). The opening-language \"all transfers or settlements\", taking the latter to mean an immediate beneficial vesting, in relation to the periods specified, presents no initial difficulty. The draftsman has not been precise in the language \"within three years of the death\" if he intended \"prior to\" as in paragraph (c) or \"before\" in (d); but I take it that he did. Then come the words \"or agrees to transfer, etc.\". Counsel protests that these cannot mean that the agreement itself is to be made after April 29th, 1941, and within the three years of death; but I have not been able to gather just what he thought they did mean. The whole clause was no doubt drawn without an adequate conception of what was intended. For instance, is there to be any distinction in transfers between cases where the marriage contract was made before 1941 and those made afterwards? Without suggesting or examining other possible situations, I think the reasons behind the paragraph and its meaning can be deduced from the purpose and indicated considerations of the statute. Elderly men not infrequently marry but to permit them to withdraw their property from the taxation by transfers of it to their wives is against the policy of the Act. To prevent that subtraction, Parliament has closed the opportunity to make it within three years before death. Certainly the agreement, the marriage and the transfer may and in many cases do take place virtually as one event; in other cases the last may remain unexecuted at death: but both classes are brought under the condemnation. The property may or may not have been agreed to pass on death, but that fact would not be material. The necessary implication from this is that property so passing on death would not come within any other section. It is not sufficient to say there is overlapping between ss. 2 (to) and 3; this is a precise description of property of a special category and it cannot be taken as ex abundantia cautela, nor the words treated as being so absurdly superfluous. I construe the paragraph then to deal only with agreements made after April 29th, 1941, and within three years before the death of the deceased person, regardless of whether the transfer is made before or after the death, and that only transfers made pursuant to such agreements are intended to be deemed successions. From that, under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, it follows that an agreement made prior to 1941, though becoming effective on death, is not a succession and not subject to the taxation.\nIt is argued that prima facie the obligation comes within the language of 2 (m) and it must be taken to be taxable unless shown to be excluded by some other provision. No doubt there is force in this contention. But we must bear in mind, as Jessel, M.R. remarked in Fryer v. Morland, (supra), that underlying the Act is the conception that it provides for a tax on successions by gratuitous title: \"that a man gets something on the death of the prior owner either by way of settlement or by way of gift or descent and thereby gets a profit\" upon a death. He adds: \"the only exception I can find to that principle is that a marriage consideration is treated as if it were a gratuitous title for this purpose.\" It is pertinent also that the terms \"predecessor\" and \"successor\" apply to s. 3 but not expressly to 2 (m) in which the word \"death\" is not restricted to the person from whom the property is derived; and in the same case the view of Jessel, M.R. was that property transferred for valuable consideration could not be said to be \"derived\" from the owner.\nIt is argued also that s. 8 (2) (a) brings all such transmissions within 2 (to) as not being for a consideration in money or money's worth. I agres that although marriage is a valuable consideration it is not consideration in money or money's worth. But s. 8 (2) (a) has nothing whatever to do with successions; it provides merely for certain deductions from gross value to ascertain aggregate net value and dutiable value for the purpose of determining the rates of tax on successions. There is no warrant for the inference that all aggregate value is represented by succession, and of course dutiable value is that of succession already found. An obligation might be payable out of assets in priority to bequests even though not deductible for the purpose of determining rates of taxation or successions.\nEnglish decisions must be applied to this Act with caution: Attorney-General of Ontario v. Perry 22. For example, in Floyer v. Bankes 23, in which Lord Westbury used the oft-quoted language of distinction between valuable consideration and that for money or money's worth, what was being considered was s. 17 of the Act of 1853, in which the latter words were used in relation to obligations payable on death; they defined exemptions from successions and, with other language of the statute, implied that all transmissions, unless for consideration of money or money's worth, were intended to be subject to the tax. This is the section to which Jessel, M.R. doubtless had reference when he made the remark quoted on marriage consideration. The draftsman of the Dominion statute has refashioned the provisions of the English Acts, and we must take, it as we find it. Section 8 (2) (a) has its analogue in s. 7 of the Finance Act, 1894, which deals not with successions, but with aggregate value for the purposes of an estate tax. There is nothing in the Canadian Act that expressly exempts bona fide sales, as in s. 7 of the Act of 1853; nor does the definition of \"predecessor\" help except as already considered: but the implication of s. 3 (1) (k) and the object of the Act are sufficient for that purpose. The implication of paragraph (j) does, I think, the like office for marriage consideration; and the juxtaposition of these two provisions seems to me to strengthen that conclusion.\nBut this strife with interpretation by itself is significant support for the respondent. A taxing statute must make reasonably clear the intention to impose the tax; but apart conceivably from the mind of the draftsman, I cannot find that it has been made so in this case.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Bell, [1949] S.C.R. 745\nDate: 1949-10-04\nGeorge Kent (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nCharlotte Bell and Archibald Bell (Defendants) Respondents.\n1949: June 14; 1949: October 4.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMaster and Servant\u2014Tenant injured assisting landlord\u2019s husband with repairs\u2014No agreement for wages\u2014Liability of landlord\u2014Of landlord\u2019s husband\u2014Whether tenant a servant\u2014Invitee\u2014Volunteer or volunteer with interest.\nThe appellant was a tenant of premises owned by the respondent wife. The latter, to meet the needs of the tenant, had undertaken to enlarge the upper part of the house. The husband respondent, acting for his wife, commenced the work, and asked the tenant to assist him. The tenant, although regularly employed, replied he \u201cguessed he would have to help\u201d. While descending from the roof at the direction of the husband, he placed his weight on a facia board that was insecurely nailed to the end of the joists; it gave way and he fell to the ground, sustaining serious and permanent injuries.\nHeld: That the tenant was not a volunteer. The work was entirely that of the landlord. The tenant approached it as an independent party conferring a benefit that had been sought; he was giving his services but not surrendering himself as an employee, the landlord therefore became liable to the tenant for the negligence of her agent, the husband.\nHayward v. Drury Lane Theatre [1917] 2 K.B. 899, followed.\nHeld: Also, that the finding of the trial judge that the husband had been negligent in creating a trap, reversed by the Court of Appeal, was amply supported by the evidence and nothing had been shown to warrant its reversal.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Henderson, Roach and Hogg JJ. A., Roach J. A., dissenting)[1], which set aside the judgment of the trial judge, Wilson J. by which it was adjudged that the plaintiff recover from the defendants the sum of $5,271.75.\nJ.J. Robinette, K.C., for the appellant.\nJ.R. Cartwright, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The facts of this case are simple. The appellant was a tenant of premises owned by the respondent wife. The latter, to meet the needs of the tenant, had undertaken to enlarge the upper part of the house. The husband, acting for his wife, with two helpers commenced the work and had been at it a day when he asked the tenant to assist him on the next afternoon, Saturday, in order to have as much work as possible done for the weekend. Although the tenant had a regular employment at which he would have worked that afternoon, his reply was that he \u201cguessed he would have to help\u201d. Accordingly he presented himself and entered upon the work. While descending from the roof, at the direction of the husband, he placed his weight on a facia board that was insecurely nailed to the ends of the joists; it gave way and in the fall he was badly injured.\nThe trial judge found the husband to have been negligent in creating a trap, and this finding was reversed by the Court of Appeal[2], Roach, J.A. dissenting. With the greatest respect for the majority opinion, I agree with the finding at the trial; the evidence was ample to support it, and nothing has been shown to warrant its reversal. The judgment against the husband must, therefore, be restored.\nA more involved question is raised in the claim against the wife. I am unable to find a contract of employment between the parties. There was an interest in both the tenant and the landlord in having the addition made; and the tenant\u2019s consent to \u201chelp\u201d excludes, in the circumstances, an implied promise on the part of the wife through the husband to remunerate him.\nThe question, then, is, on what terms did the appellant engage in the work? Mr. Cartwright contends that he is a mere volunteer and as such is in no better position than a fellow servant, on which footing his claim would fail. Whether taking the appellant to have assumed the relation of an employee, the negligence could be viewed as a failure on the part of the master to furnish and maintain reasonably safe plant and working conditions within the rule laid down in Marchment v. Borgstrom[3], it is unnecessary to determine, because that is not, in my opinion, the true interpretation of the circumstances. A volunteer does no doubt submit himself to the risks of the work he enters upon to the extent at least accepted by an actual employee, but the tenant here was not a volunteer. He had acquiesced with some reluctance in the request that he give the afternoon to the work. But he was under no obligation either to enter upon it or to continue at it, and conversely the respondents were free to dispense with his assistance at any time they saw fit. It was, therefore, a situation in which the tenant, having an interest in the completion of the work, gratuitously gave his services to the landlord on the latter\u2019s request, and the inquiry is, what legal incidents attached to the relation so entered upon?\nThe assumption of certain risks by the workman, including that of the negligence of fellow servants, is deemed to result from the presumed intention of the parties; and as the question here is that of such assumption, it must be determined in the same manner. Being free to continue or not as he pleased, and being concerned with his own interest, it is, I think, impossible to presume that he can be taken to have agreed to accept the risk of the negligence of the others engaged on the work. If the terms had been spelled out in detail, can we imagine the tenant; in such a position, doing so? I think not. The work was entirely that of the landlord; the tenant approached it as an independent party conferring a benefit that had been sought; he was giving his service but not surrendering himself as an employee. His own interest led him to do the first, but it held him from the second.\nThat was the view taken by the Court of Appeal in Hayward v. Drury Lane Theatre[4]. In that case, a dancer willing to be employed and the company interested in her ability, but neither being under any obligation, entered into and took part in a rehearsal. In the course of it, she was told to stand on a staircase. It was defective and fell and she was injured. The Court reviewing the cases of Degg v. Midland Railway[5], in which the person injured was a volunteer; Holmes v. Northeastern Railway Company[6], where the victim was a consignee who undertook to help to move the car containing his goods to a place of delivery; and Johnson v. Lindsay[7]; held her not to be a volunteer and found that her participation had not involved an acceptance of the risk of negligence of the employees with whom she was associated. In Johnson v. Lindsay, Lord Herschel stated the position of volunteers thus:\u2014\u201cThese authorities are sufficient to establish the proposition that unless the person sought to be rendered liable for the negligence of his servant can show that the person so seeking to make him liable was himself in his service, the definition of common employment is not open to him. Such service need not, of course, be permanent or for any defined term. The general servant of A may for a time or on a particular occasion be the servant of B, and a person who is not under any paid contract of service may nevertheless have put himself under the control of an employer to act in the capacity of servant, so as to be regarded as such. This, as has been pointed out, is the position of a volunteer. * * * The exemption can never be applicable when there is no relation between the parties from which such an undertaking can be implied. * * * I do not see how such an obligation can arise otherwise than from some contractual relation.\u201d Applying the principles of these cases to the circumstances here, the landlord becomes liable to the tenant for the negligence of her agent, the husband.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the judgment at trial restored with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Kerr and Kerr.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Clunis and Kee.\n[1] [1946] O.R. 743; [1947] 1 D.L.R. 115.\n[2] [1946] O.R. 743; [1947] 1 D.L.R. 115.\n[3] [1942] S.C.R. 374.\n[4] [1917] 2 K.B. 899.\n[5] (1857) 1 H. & N. 773.\n[6] (1869) L.R. 4 Ex. 254, and (1871) 6 Ex. 123.\n[7] [1891] A.C. 371 at 377.\n",

On such an application, an applicant should not be deprived of any right to appeal be may possess.\nMOTION by appellant for leave to renew application to have security approved by Court of Appeal, to stay execution on the bill of costs of the respondents before the Court of Appeal, and for an order that the respondents pay the costs of some motions.\nFurther MOTION to excuse the appellant from complying with any or all of the provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, and, in particular, to dispense him from filing the Certificate of Security referred to in Rule 10, and to have the arguments on behalf of both parties heard on the day the Motion is heard.\nGeorge W. Morley, in person, for the motion,\nG. T. Walsh, K.C., contra.\nThe Court having heard the appellant, without calling on Walsh K.C., reserved judgment.\nThe Court:\u2014Upon motion by the appellant on October 17th of this year for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, this Court, on the assumption that leave was necessary, refused the application. The appellant now moves to excuse him from filing the certificate of security referred to in Rule 10 of the Rules of this Court and for leave to renew his application to have the security approved by the Court of Appeal for Ontario or a judge thereof, or for approval of the security by this Court. We have no power so to order and the applications must be dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant insists that the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds two thousand dollars. Even if we had jurisdiction, it would be impossible on the material before us to make a pronouncement upon that question. It was pointed out that the appellant applied some time ago to a judge of the Court of Appeal for Ontario for approval of security and that that application was refused because, as it is stated in the formal order, \"it appearing that leave to appeal is necessary\". We are now told that the circumstances were not made clear to the learned judge who heard the application. In any event, under section 70 of the Supreme Court Act, the function of the Court from whose judgment the appellant is about to appeal, or of this Court, or a judge of either Court, on such an application is to inquire as to the sufficiency of the security tendered. In view of the appellant's contention that the necessary amount is in controversy in the appeal, he may yet be able to find means to bring the matter before the Court of Appeal for Ontario or a judge thereof with the view of the granting of an application for approval of the security tendered by him.\nWhile we have already refused leave to appeal, if the appellant is entitled as of right to appeal, he should not be deprived of that right on a motion to approve the security. If security is approved, it is still open to the respondents to move to quash for lack of jurisdiction.\n",

A New York Surrogate Court named his widow Administratrix with will annexed of his estate and she, as widow and sole beneficiary, was subsequently by praecipe order under Ontario rule of Practice 301 named as a party plaintiff. The defendant applied to the Master to rescind the order but on being refused did not appeal therefrom and at the trial upon the New York Letters of Administration with will annexed being tendered in evidence accepted the position that he was bound by the order. On argument before the Court of Appeal it appeared that the notes at the date of death were in Ontario and were subsequently transmitted to the widow in New York State.\nHeld: per Kerwin, Taschereau and Locke JJ., that the defendant having acquiesced in the order of the Master and the trial having proceeded upon the basis of such order being correct, the defendant should not now be allowed to change position. On the merits no ground had been shown for setting aside the trial judge\u2019s finding against the defendant and therefore since a grant in Ontario of letters of administration with the will annexed would have appointed some one who could have been added as a party to represent the Estate, an opportunity should be given the plaintiff to take such steps. Upon filing of the Ontario grant of letters of administration and an order adding the grantee as a party, judgment should go allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment at trial.\nPer: Rand and Kellock JJ.: In view of the provisions of s. 18(3) of the Succession Duty Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 26, the Ontario Court of Appeal, upon the true facts being made to appear, of its own motion was entitled and should have stayed the action until ancillary administration had been taken out in Ontario and such administrator made a party. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario,[1] setting aside the judgment of Wilson J.,[2] after a trial without a jury, in favour of the plaintiff.\nE.C. Fetzer, K.C. and A.C. Fleming, K.C. for the appellant.\nW.J. Anderson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.: This action was commenced by George Wellington Lunn on September 2, 1930, against the respondent, Barber, on two promissory notes, each bearing date August 19, 1927. The statement of claim and statement of defence were delivered in May and June 1931, in the latter of which it is alleged that the plaintiff was a Canadian citizen. Nothing further was done during the lifetime of the plaintiff, who died October 28, 1934. On January 5, 1938, the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Essex County, in the State of New York, granted letters of administration with the will annexed to the deceased\u2019s widow, Williamina D. Lunn, in which grant the deceased is stated to have been a resident of Schroon Lake in the County of Essex. The next step in the action was on December 14, 1946, when, upon the application of the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, Williamina D. Lunn, the widow and sole beneficiary of the deceased under his will was named as party plaintiff by praecipe order to proceed in accordance with rule 301 of the Ontario Rules of Practice. The plaintiff\u2019s reply and defence to the counter-claim was filed October 31, 1947. On February 3, 1948, the defendant applied to the Master to rescind the praecipe order of December 14, 1946, and at the same time, the plaintiff applied to vary such order by adding after the name or style of the plaintiff the words \u201cand administratrix with the will annexed of the said George Wellington Lunn.\u201d\nThe second application was granted while the first was refused, the Master stating:\u2014\nThe evidence before the Court as to the manner in which Williamina D. Lunn now holds the notes is not conclusive but I think it is reasonable to assume and may properly be assumed for the purpose of the present application that the notes came into her possession as administratrix with the Will annexed in the ordinary course of administration in the State of New York.\nNo appeal was taken from the order of the Master and while the defendant took the position at the trial that the plaintiff should \u201cproduce her evidence as to her right to bring this action\u201d, upon the letters of administration with the will annexed being tendered in evidence and the trial judge asking counsel for the defendant with reference to the Master\u2019s order \u201cAm I not bound by that?\u201d, the reply was \u201cWell I am afraid so.\u201d The letters of administration were thereupon filed and also an authenticated copy of the will.\nUpon the argument before the Court of Appeal, counsel for the plaintiff, without any question being addressed to him, volunteered the information that the notes had been in his possession at the time of the death of George Wellington Lunn and that sometime thereafter he had sent them to the widow in New York State. The Court decided that the question as to the right of the administratrix to maintain the action was not one for decision by the Master and, upon counsel\u2019s statement, allowed the appeal and dismissed the action on the basis of the decision of this Court in Crosby v. Prescott[3].\nThe proceedings have been set out in some detail in order to make it clear that no opinion is expressed upon the points decided by the Court of Appeal but the appeal should be allowed on the grounds that the defendant not only acquiesced in the order of the Master but that the trial proceeded upon the basis of that order being correct and that the defendant should not now be allowed to take a different position. Nor should it be presumed that the Master\u2019s order was correct in law. The ordinary rule is that the situs of simple contract debts is where the debtor resides. An exception has been made in the case of negotiable instruments if they were at the time of the death of the payee in the jurisdiction where the latter resides: Crosby v. Prescott supra. In Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba v. Bennett[4], the exception was declared to include a certain deposit receipt issued by a bank in the Province of Manitoba but found in the possession of the holder at the time of his death in Minnesota. This Court has not had occasion to consider the case where a negotiable instrument, although outside the jurisdiction of the residence of the holder at the time of his death, was later sent to the personal representative of the deceased within that jurisdiction and it is unnecessary to determine that point at the present time.\nThis is not like a case where an action is allowed to proceed upon an undertaking by the plaintiff that letters probate would be produced at the trial because that assumes the appointment by a deceased of an executor whose title flows from the will but who cannot prove his title except by the production of a grant. However, a grant in Ontario of letters of administration with the will annexed would have appointed someone who could have been added as a party to represent the estate of the deceased since there is no question that the cause of action survived. Even at this late date an opportunity should be given the plaintiff to take such steps. On the merits of the action, the trial judge found against the defendant and no ground has been shown for setting aside that finding.\nThe principal amount of each note sued upon is $1,841.96 but because of the accrued interest the judgment at the trial was for $8,283.71 and costs. As the trial judge pointed out, the defendant might have moved to dismiss the action for want of prosecution but this was not done. On the other hand, this Court did not have the benefit of any real argument on any of the points and I gather that the Court of Appeal was in the same position. For that reason and because an indulgence is being granted, the proper order appears to be that upon the filing in this Court of an Ontario grant of letters of administration with the will annexed and upon an order being made adding the grantee as a party (all at the plaintiff\u2019s expense), judgment should go allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment at the trial. The plaintiff may have her costs in the Court of Appeal but only one-third of the costs of the appeal to this Court.\nRAND J.:\u2014Under No. 300 of the rules of practice of the Supreme Court of Ontario, an action does not abate on the death of a sole plaintiff unless the cause of action is one which ceases with his death; No. 301 provides for the continuance of the action by the person to whom the interest or title to the matter in question has been transmitted. In the case of a transmission outside of Ontario, the principle of Crosby v. Prescott[5], would apply, and the foreign administrator would be entitled to revive the proceedings.\nIn this case, as a result of the order of the Master based upon a finding of fact, the defendant acquiesced in the revived proceedings as then constituted, and the trial was proceeded with on that basis. This is concluded by counsel\u2019s answer to the question of the trial judge whether he was not bound by the order of the Master, from which no appeal had been taken: \u201cWell, I am afraid so. There is a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada\u201d meaning that in the Crosby action. From the standpoint of the parties, the defendant would not thereafter be permitted to change his position.\nBut the Court of Appeal of its own motion raised the question not of the jurisdictional fact in particular but of the presence in the action as plaintiff of the foreign administratrix. It then appeared by admission of counsel that at the moment of the death of the original plaintiff the promissory notes were in Toronto in the solicitor\u2019s custody. They were afterwards sent by him to the administratrix for the State of New York, the residence and place of death of the deceased and the place of the principal administration; and at some time later were returned to Toronto and made exhibits at the trial. Whether the possession of these notes in New York by the administratrix so obtained, would vest in her the contractual obligation which they embodied, and whether in the circumstances the principle of Crosby would apply, I do not decide; as between the parties, for the reasons stated, the question could not be raised. But if from the facts disclosed an overriding law or consideration of public policy is brought to the notice of the Court, then the matter is no longer between the parties only.\nThat paramount consideration is found in section 18(3) of the Succession Duty Act of the Province, which reads:\u2014\nUnless the consent in writing of the Treasurer is obtained, no person (whether or not acting in any fiduciary capacity) shall deliver, transfer, assign or pay, or permit any delivery, transfer, assignment or payment of any chattel mortgages, book debts, promissory notes, moneys, shares of stock, bonds or other securities whatsoever (whether registered or unregistered) belonging to a deceased person, or in which such deceased person had any beneficial interest whatsoever, and which may be liable to duty in Ontario, or with respect to which there is a transmission within Ontario, whether such deceased person died domiciled in Ontario or elsewhere; provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall apply to any person when acting solely in the capacity of executor.\nFrom this it appears that in sending the notes out of Ontario as he did, the solicitor unwittingly violated the section. If the notes had remained in Ontario, ancillary administration would have been necessary, and that result cannot be avoided by an act done contrary to the law of the province.\nThe Court could, then, act of its own motion, but the question arises whether what was done, i.e. the dismissal of the action, was in the circumstances the proper disposal of the appeal. The action as originally constituted remained in good standing until the death of the plaintiff and thereafter until steps had been taken either to proceed or to dismiss. The invalidity of the revivor cannot affect its standing up to that point, and the subsequent stages, including trial, cannot be challenged by the respondent. The proceedings should, therefore, have been stayed until an administrator with the will annexed for Ontario had been made a party: Rylands v. Latouche[6].\nOn the point of merits, the contest at the trial depended upon the credibility of the witnesses; the trial judge has found in favour of the claim and nothing has been suggested on the argument before us to call in any serious question that finding.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored, but, subject to the rules of the Supreme Court, all proceedings should be stayed until an administrator under ancillary letters of administration has been made plaintiff. When that is done, the present appellant may be dismissed from the action without costs. The judgment will thereupon come into full operation. The appellant should have costs as proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nKELLOCK J.: The notes here in question were not in the State of New York at the time of the death of the payee but in Ontario. Assuming, without deciding, that the appellant, by the subsequent receipt of the notes, acquired a good title so as to sue the maker in any jurisdiction without taking out administration elsewhere than in New York, that result cannot obtain in this action in view of the provisions of section 18, subsection 3, of the Succession Duty Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 26.\nBy reason of this legislation, the courts of Ontario cannot give any assistance to the appellant which would enable the latter to avoid its effect and upon the true facts being made to appear in the Court of Appeal, the court of its own motion was entitled and obliged to stay the action until ancillary administration were taken out in Ontario. I think, therefore, that such an order should now be made but, in the circumstances of this case, the judgment at the trial on the facts should stand. I therefore concur in the order proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nUpon the filing in this Court of an Ontario grant of letters of Administration with the will of George Wellington Lunn annexed and upon an order being made adding the grantee as a party, all at the plaintiff\u2019s expense, judgment will go allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment at the trial. The plaintiff shall have her costs in the Court of Appeal and one third of the costs of the appeal to this Court.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Ernest C.

Up to 1942, he had been paid $400 monthly and annual bonuses. A new arrangement confirmed in writing as follows was then made: \"Your remuneration, including bonus, for the fiscal year 1942 will not be less than $7,500.\" The approval of the Salaries Controller for the increase, required by the Wartime Salaries Order P.C. 1549 amended by P.C. 4356, was sought but was obtained only as from January 1, 1943. In 1942, he received $400 a month and was given $2,700 for the year and similarly in 1943. The lump sum at the end of 1944 was only $2,000. And for 1945, he received nothing above his monthly $400 and was notified towards the end of that year that his position was abolished.\nHeld: That, this being a contract of general employment, the increase sum became a term of the contract and could not be altered until the contract was validly altered.\nHeld also: That, as there was no evidence that the contract was intended to be put into effect without the permission required by the Wartime Salaries Order, although the increase was agreed between the parties before this permission was sought, it must be assumed that the parties intended to comply with the law.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 1 affirming, Coyne and Adamson JJ.

Fillmore, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice, Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The memorandum which accompanied the application by the company in April, 1943, for approval of an increased salary for the appellant confirms beyond doubt the substance of the latter's evidence. What it shows is that in order to retain his services it was willing to guarantee that his earnings would be $7,500.00 a year, a figure which he accepted, although the offer from the Rubber Company which he disclosed was for permanent employment at $8,500.00 per annum. The manner in which the $7,500.00 was to be treated in the accounts of the company appears likewise from the memorandum. In 1940 the company had, in addition to the basic wage of $4,800.00, distributed a bonus to the appellant of $1,000.00. For 1941 it had given him $1,700.00, but the Income Department, in view of the salary order effective from November 1, 1941, reduced this item to $1,00.00 as being the maximum allowable. The application specified $6,500.00 as salary but contemplated the continuance of the $1,000.00 as a guaranteed bonus. Although asked for as of January 1, 1941, the approval ran only from January 1, 1943.\nThe appellant's employment was general. What was sought was an increase in salary; but once the salary was increased it became a term of the contract until in a valid manner the contract in that respect was altered. It is said that because the consensus for an increase had been reached in June, 1942, and was to be retroactive to January 1 of that year, the contract was illegal. I must confess to great difficulty in appreciating the grounds for that view. It was illegal only on the assumption that it was intended to be put into effect and carried out without relation to approval. There is no evidence of this one way or another, and in its absence I assume that these parties intended to comply with the law of the country. That this is so is fully confirmed by the fact of the company's application. There was some delay, it is true, but no point is made of it and a sufficient explanation seems to appear by inference from matters which were mentioned in the evidence. The fact that the increased sum had been paid for 1942 although not authorized for that year is, apparently, thought to have invalidated everything that followed from the date of approval. But the payment of salary was here a distributive provision accompanying the employment as from month to month subject to a reasonable notice of termination. The intention of both parties was continuously and currently speaking in affirmation of its terms. When, therefore, January 1, 1943, appeared, the terms of increase became valid and the subsequent payment to the appellant for 1943, according to the approval, furnished conclusive evidence that as from the beginning of that year and thereafter until validly modified the remuneration had become $7,500.00.\nIt was not until January of 1945 that any intimation was given of a change in that arrangement. The employee had been paid throughout all the period in instalments of $400.00 a month and in that month the balance of $2,700.00 became payable. That amount had been paid in January, 1944, but in January, 1945, only $2,000.00 was forthcoming. It was attempted to be justified on the ground that the entire increase over $4,800.00 was to be supplied out of bonus determinable by the company. This, of course, would have been an illegality and would have contradicted the express representation of the company and its request in its application, and, as well, the approval. Although it does not appear in evidence, its accounts for 1943 and 1944 properly prepared would show the basic rate of $6,500.00 as salary paid, and the sum of $1,000.00 in the one case and $300.00 in the other as bonus.\nThe appellant protested the reduction from $2,700.00 to $2,000.00, but continued to work throughout 1945 and to the middle of February, 1946. From December 1, 1945, until termination, he was paid $315.00 a month. The intimation in January, 1945, that the $2,700.00 would be reduced to $2,000.00 meant that the company would thereafter pay him at the rate of $6,800.00 a year rather than $7,500.00, and I think, in the circumstances, it must be implied that if he was not prepared to accept that reduction he could take the intimation as a notice of ending his engagement. As he kept on working, it must be presumed to have been on the footing of that reduced remuneration.\nThe result is that there is owing to him for 1944, $700.00, for 1945, $2,085.00, and for 1946, $377.49. He is therefore entitled to recover a total of $3,162.49.\nThe appeal must be allowed and judgment entered for that sum with costs in all courts.\nLocke J.:\u2014The appellant was employed by the defendant company in the year 1934 as manager of its Mining and Contracting Machinery Department and acted as such until the year 1938, when he was appointed sales manager, and his remuneration which had formerly been by way of a salary and commission was changed to a straight salary of $400.00 a month. After the commencement of the war in September, 1939, the defendant company undertook certain war work for the Government and for the years 1940 and 1941 the appellant was paid in addition bonuses of $1,000.00 and $1,700.00 respectively. Apparently the term of the employment was not specified between the parties. These added payments were apparently simple gratuities and were authorized by resolutions of the directors passed at meetings held on February 5, 1941, and February 6, 1942. No new arrangement was made between the parties at the end of the year 1941 but the appellant remained in the defendant's employ and was paid salary at the same rate as that paid to him in the previous year. In June 1942, according to the appellant, he received an offer of permanent employment with the Dominion Rubber Company at $700.00 a month and communicated this fact to two of the directors of the company by name Condy and Waldon. He says that Condy then offered on behalf of the defendant to pay him a fixed salary of $7,500.00 a year if he would stay with the company, this to be made retroactive to January 1, 1942, an offer which he then accepted. Condy denies making this offer and says that what he had offered was for the year 1942 only and this was \"a remuneration including bonuses of not less than $7,500.\" At the trial the plaintiff put in evidence the minutes of a meeting of the directors held on June 30, 1942, at which Condy, Waldon and J. D. McDonald, the president, were present, when a resolution proposed by Waldon and seconded by Condy was passed to the effect that the appellant's \"remuneration, including bonus for the fiscal year 1942, be not less than $7,500.\" and on September 5, 1942, a letter signed on behalf of the defendant by McDonald was sent to the appellant reading: \"Your remuneration, including bonus for the fiscal year of 1942 will not be less than $7,500.00 and this has been confirmed by the directors.\"\nNo explanation has been advanced as to why, since the respondent had by the verbal agreement made in June obligated itself on its own showing to pay the appellant remuneration of not less than $7,500.00 for the year 1942, the expression \"bonus\" was used. In the ordinary sense of the word, it means a gift or gratuity. The Oxford Dictionary defines it \"a boon or gift over and above what is normally due as remuneration to the receiver and which is therefore something wholly 'to the good',\" which is, I think, the sense in which it is commonly used. However, apart from the question of the alleged illegality of the contract to which I will refer later, I think in the result the matter is not important since upon the respondent's own showing it was obligated by agreement to pay the appellant remuneration of $7,500.00 for the year 1942. At the expiration of that year the respondent paid to the appellant the sum of $2,700.00 which, with the $400.00 monthly payments that had been made, brought his remuneration to the amount agreed upon, and there was no discussion between the parties as to the terms of the employment at the commencement of, or indeed at any time during, the following year. During that year the appellant received monthly cheques of $400.00 and in January 1944 was again paid a sum of $2,700.00 as the balance of his remuneration for 1943. It is to be noted that while the gratuities paid to the appellant in respect of the years 1940 and 1941 had been dealt with by resolution of the directors and the amount of his remuneration for the year 1942 approved by the resolution of June 30 in that year, no such resolution was passed in respect of any part of the $7,500.00 paid him in the year 1943. By an application dated April 14, 1943, the respondent applied to the Salaries Controller appointed under the provisions of the Wartime Salaries Order for permission to pay the appellant an. increased rate of salary and in a memorandum submitted with the document the following appears: \"As indicated on the W.S. 2 Form recently submitted by us, Mr. Paoli has been offered a position in the east for (sic) $8,500.00 a year and he will only agree to stay with our company provided his salary is adjusted to $7,500.00.\" The application was signed on behalf of the company by Harold O. Jones, the acting secretary-treasurer. According to the president of the company, he knew of the application being made, read it over before it was filed and approved of it in his capacity as president and a director. Jones says in explanation of the terms of the balance of the memorandum that as submitted by him to the Department the application was to approve an increase as from the 1st of January, 1941, and that it was for this reason that he referred to the disallowance by the Inspector of Income Tax of $700 of the bonus paid to the appellant in 1941 and to the further fact that he asked that approval be given to Paoli's salary for the year 1941 at $5,500.00 per annum and for 1942 at $6,500.00 per annum. According to Jones, the application which was approved by the Salaries Controller as from January 1, 1943, was changed in the office of the Controller so that it appears on its face that the respondent asked for approval as from that date. The president, however, says that he knew that they were applying to fix the appellant's salary at $7,500.00 from January 1, 1943. The proper interpretation of this document is, in my opinion, that the respondent sought and obtained the approval of the Salaries Controller to the payment of $7,500.00 as the appellant's annual remuneration for his services commencing January 1, 1943. The application was made under the provisions of the Wartime Salaries Order P.C. 1549 and P.C. 4356, the former of which by sec. 5 (b) provided that application for permission to pay increased salaries under the provisions of the Order should be submitted by the employer to the Minister of National Revenue on the prescribed form, setting forth the facts which, in the opinion of the employers, warranted that proposed salary adjustment.\nThe appellant continued in the employ of the respondent in the same capacity after the end of the year 1943 without any discussion as to the terms of his employment and it was not until either the end of December 1944, as stated by Jones, or in January of 1945, as stated by Paoli, that it was suggested that he was entitled to less than $7,500.00 for the year 1944. The appellant had been paid $400.00 monthly as in the years 1942 and 1943 and says that in January of 1945, when he expected to receive the balance of $2,700.00 he was paid only $2,000.00 by Jones. He says that he objected to the reduction claiming that he had a contract for a salary of $7,500.00 and saying that he intended to get the balance and, in addition to speaking to the secretary, also spoke to the general manager about the balance owing to him. The latter, Mr. John M. Isbister, had recently been appointed to his position and, according to the appellant, disclaimed any knowledge of a contract and said that he would take the matter up with Mr. Condy. Later, Paoli says that when he talked with the president the latter' referred him to Condy since he said it was he who had made the arrangement. According to Jones, it was in the latter part of December that he told Paoli that his bonus for the year 1944 had been settled at $2,000.00 and that the latter merely said that if the \"other boys\" were being reduced he had no objection. The appellant says that several times during the year 1945 he brought up the matter of the $700.00 which he claimed remained unpaid in respect of the year 1944 but got no (satisfaction. In the meantime, he received monthly payments of $400.00 until November 19, 1945, when he was informed by Isbister that the position of sales manager had been abolished and that Paoli was to take over his old job as manager of the mining and contracting machinery department and when the latter asked him what about his contract Isbister replied that he did not know what arrangements had been made with Condy. For the month of November he was paid $400.00: this was reduced to $315.00 for the month of December and for January 1946. Early in February of that year he informed Isbister that he intended to leave and the latter told him he had better leave at once, which he did after receiving another half month's salary at the rate of $315.00.\nThe real point of difference between the evidence of the appellant and of Condy as to the arrangement made orally in June of 1942 is that the appellant claims that it was then agreed that he would receive a straight salary of $7,500.00 a year while Condy contends that the arrangement was that the company would pay him not less than $7,500.00 including bonuses for the year 1942. This, the respondent contends, meant merely that the arrangement made contemplated that at the expiration of the year 1942, if his services were retained, his remuneration would be $400.00 a month, plus such gratuity, if any, as the respondent might choose to give him. It seems to me that it is highly improbable that under the circumstances then existing Paoli would have accepted any such arrangement. He had been offered a permanent position with a large company at $8,400.00 a year and would be most unlikely, in my opinion, to accept any such arrangement as the respondent contends was made. I think the terms of the application made to the Salaries Controller on April 14, 1943, confirm the appellant's version of the arrangement. The memorandum dated and speaking as of April 14, 1943, after referring to the offer received by the appellant from Dominion Rubber Company Limited said that the appellant \"will only agree to stay with our company provided his salary is adjusted to $7,500.00,\" showing beyond doubt, in my opinion, that it was the understanding of the acting treasurer and of the president, who saw the application before it was filed, that the then existing arrangement with Paoli was to pay him remuneration at the rate of $7,500.00 a year. The fact that the directors at the meeting held on June 30, 1942, chose to use the word \"bonus\" in referring to part of the appellant's promised pay and that that expression was used in the letter of September 5, 1942, does not appear to me to affect the matter. The point was that his remuneration for the year was fixed at $7,500.00. No part of the remuneration for 1942 was in any sense a gratuity since the company, assuming the agreement was enforceable, was obligated to pay it. The fact that the word \"bonus\" for the purposes of the War Salaries Order was defined to include such payments as a share of the profits payable pursuant to a contract appears to me to be aside from the point. If it was intended that after the expiration of the year any payment beyond $4,800.00 annually was to be made, if at all, in such amount as the respondent might decide upon, I would have expected that, in making the oral agreement with Paoli, Condy would have so stipulated and that the minutes of the directors' meeting would have so stated.\nIt is the remuneration to be paid to the appellant for the years 1944 and 1945 with which we are concerned. As to the year 1942, the agreement to pay him $7,500.00 whether by way of salary or partly as salary and partly a sum called a bonus, was an increase in the appellant's salary rate and subject to the approval of the Minister and that approval was not given. The respondent applied for and obtained permission to pay $7,500.00 annually commencing January 1, 1943, on the faith of the statements made in its letter to the Salaries Controller of April 14, 1943. The appellant was aware at about the time it was made of the application for this approval. It is perfectly clear, in my opinion, that both parties understood that from January 1, 1943, the respondent would pay the appellant a remuneration at the rate of $7,500.00 and while evidence as to an express agreement, apart from that made in June 1942, is lacking, such a contract should be implied from the conduct of the parties. The respondent paid the appellant on this basis for the year 1943 and continued him in its employ throughout the year 1944 and until November 19, 1945, when he was informed by Isbister that his position had been abolished, which was tantamount to a dismissal. No other notice of the termination of the contract was given. The statement made by Jones that Paoli's remuneration had been fixed at $6,800.00 for the year 1944 did not either terminate the contract or alter its terms. The statement was made in regard to the year past and was not, in my opinion, in any sense an offer in respect of the year 1945. For the appellant it was contended by Mr. Finkelstein that the hiring was a general one and that it is to be presumed accordingly that it was a yearly hiring but, since there is here no claim for damages for wrongful dismissal, I think the result is the same whether this be the true view of the position or whether the engagement was indefinite as to time and one which could have been terminated by either side on reasonable notice. In respect of the year 1944 the respondent paid the appellant a total remuneration of $6,800.00 only. Jones says that Paoli said that he had no objection to this reduction: Paoli denies this and upon this issue I think his denial is to be accepted. In my opinion, the situation on November 19, 1945, when Isbister informed the appellant that his position had been abolished was the same as had existed in the years 1943 and 1944 but, since the appellant elected to remain in a different capacity after December 1, accepting a salary of $315.00 which Isbister informed him was all the company intended to pay, in the absence of a claim for damages for wrongful dismissal, the claim should be restricted to the period terminating December 1, 1945.\nThe learned trial Judge was of the opinion that the agreement made between the parties in June 1942 was unenforceable on the ground of illegality, considering that it was forbidden by the Salaries Control Orders-in-Council P.C. 9298 and 1549. As to this, I think it must be assumed that the arrangement was made subject to the approval of the Minister and that it was contemplated that the employer would comply with the requirements of the Orders-in-Council and ask for the necessary approval. I see nothing unlawful in such an arrangement though, of course, no part of the increased remuneration could be lawfully paid until that permission was obtained. I do not, however, consider that this affects the matter to be decided here. The amounts paid in the year 1943 were lawfully paid under the contract which, in my opinion, should be implied from the conduct of the parties and as to them there is no dispute. The agreement under which the appellant was employed in 1944 and 1945 until December 1st was not that made in June of 1942 but that to be implied in respect of the year 1943 under the circumstances above referred to. That agreement required the payment of remuneration at the rate of $7,500.00 a year until it was terminated on December 1st, 1945. I agree with Adamson, J.A., that the appellant is entitled to recover the sum of $3,175.00 and would allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered for that amount, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: I.

(Respondent) Respondent.\n1949: March 14, 15; 1949: December 5.\nPresent:\u2014Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Petition of Right\u2014Whether the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada liable for alleged breaches of trust or debts of (a) the government of the Province of Canada, (b) the government of the Province of Upper Canada\u2014s. 111. The British North America Act.\nThe appellant seeks by Petition of Right to hold the Crown in the right of Canada liable in damages for breaches of trust and contract. The breaches alleged fall under three heads: (1) that in 1824 the Parliament of Upper Canada by statute authorized the flooding by the Welland Canal Co. of some 1800 acres of lands previously granted to the Six Nations Indians, appellant's ancestors, by the Crown and although the statute provided for compensation, the Department of Indian Affairs or its officers as trustees of the said Indians failed to collect it; (2) that in 1836 the Government of Upper Canada authorized a free grant of a further 360 acres of said Indians' lands to the Grand River Navigation Co. and that the said trustees failed to secure compensation therefor; (3) that in 1798 the appellant's ancestors surrendered certain lands to the Crown under an agreement whereby the said lands were to be sold and the purchase moneys held in trust for the said Indians benefit and that in 1836 the said government without the knowledge or consent of the Indians and without authority contracted to purchase stock of the Grand River Navigation Co. for them, and that the said government and, after the Union of 1840, the Government of the Province of Canada, pursuant to such contract paid out $160,000 from the said Indian funds which on the failure of the company was lost. Appellant claims that since by s. 111 of the British North America Act the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada assumed liability for the debts of the former Province of Canada, the said sum with interest should be restored to the funds held by the present Department of Indian Affairs and the federal government on behalf of the appellants. Held: that as to heads one and two of the Petition, any breach of trust, if it occured, took place before the Act of Union of 1840 and appellant had not shown any basis of obligation upon the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada.\nAs to head three, the appeal was allowed and the matter referred back to the Court of Exchequer.\nThe question as to whether the claim was barred by the Exchequer Court Act or the Statute of Limitations was not dealt with by the trial judge nor by this Court.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O'Connor J., 1 answering in the negative the first of two questions of law set down for argument, viz: (1) Assuming the allegations of fact contained in the Petition of Right read with the particulars filed by the Suppliants to be true, does a Petition of Right lie against the Respondent for any of the relief sought by the Suppliants in the said Petition? (2) If a Petition of Right would otherwise lie against the Respondent for any of the relief sought by the said Petition, is the said Petition barred by the Exchequer Court Act and the Statute of Limitations (Ontario)?\nAuguste Lemieux, K.C. for the appellants.\nW. R. Jackett for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Rand JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the suppliants against a decision of the Exchequer Court (1) answering in the negative a question of law set down for determination prior to the hearing. The question is as follows:\u2014\nAssuming the allegations of fact contained in the Petition of Right read with the particulars filed by the Suppliants on October 21, 1943, and September 5, 1944, pursuant to orders made by the President of this Honourable Court on June 3, 1942, and December 21, 1943, respectively, to be true, does a Petition of Right lie against the Respondent for any of the relief sought by the Suppliants in the said Petition?\nThe claims in the petition of right may be classified under three headings. 1. Certain lands in what is now the Province of Ontario were, on February 5, 1798, surrendered by the Six Nations Indians to the then reigning Sovereign by a document which concluded:\u2014\"and do beseech his said Majesty to grant the same in fee to the Persons in the said Schedule mentioned for the several and respective considerations to the said Lands annexed which are to receive from the said Persons, as an Equivalent for the same.\" The unsatisfactory nature of the petition has been pointed out in the reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court but, giving it the most favourable construction that can be suggested on behalf of the suppliants, this claim, which is for the value of part of the lands so surrendered destroyed by flooding, arose before the Act of Union of 1840 and there is no way in which the respondent can be held responsible. The respondent is His Majesty in the right or interest of the Dominion of Canada which, of course, came into existence in 1867. The same consideration is sufficient to dispose of claim 2, which is for the value of lands contained in a free grant to the Grand River Navigation Company in 1836.\nThere is more difficulty as to claim 3 as to which it is alleged that in or about the year 1833 the Government of Upper Canada \"and subsequently the Government of Canada after the Union of 1840\" paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the lands surrendered in 1798, the sum of $160,000 for the purchase of shares of the Grand River Navigation Company. It will be noticed that the only difference so far as dates are concerned between claims 1 and 2, on the one hand, and claim 3, on the other, is that, in the latter, the claim is made that the Government of Canada after the Union of 1840 paid money for the purchase of the shares. The respondent argues that the petition of right shows, at the most, an obligation of His Majesty in the right of the Imperial Government. The allegations are contradictory in many respects but, in disposing of the question of law, they should not be construed too strictly against the suppliants, and I am therefore disposed to leave the matter as the facts to be presented to the trial judge would warrant. Whether or not a trial ensues will depend upon the outcome of the argument of the second question of law set down for determination, viz., as to whether the claims advanced are barred by the Exchequer Court Act and the Ontario Statute of Limitations. The disposition of the present appeal will be without prejudice to such question of law being considered and dealt with so far as the third claim is concerned. The appeal should be allowed and the answer to the question of law should be \"No\" as to claims 1 and 2, and \"Yes\" as to claim 3. While the Exchequer Court simply answered the question in the negative, the costs of and incidental to the hearing were made costs in the cause. That direction might well stand. The costs of the appeal should be to the appellants in the cause, subject to this, that, in any event, they should not receive any costs of or in connection with their factum.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by:\nKellock J.:\u2014In his petition, appellant claims with respect to three separate matters; first, the flooding of approximately 1,800 acres of land on the Six Nations Indian Reserve near Brantford, Ontario, by reason of the execution of works pursuant to the Statute of 1824, 4 Geo. IV, c. 17, and amending Acts, relating to the Welland Canal; second, the taking by Order-in-Councii of October 20, 1836, without compensation, of some 368 acres for the purposes of the Grand River Navigation Company; and third, the use made by or at the instance of the Crown, before and after 1840, of certain trust moneys belonging to the said Six Nations Indians in the sum of $160,000.\nBy his petition and particulars appellant alleges that the lands in claims one and two, and other lands, were the subject of a patent dated the 14th of January, 1793, in favour of \"the chiefs, women and people of the said Six Nations and their heirs forever\". It is further alleged that on or about the 5th of February, 1798, certain of the said lands were surrendered to the Crown by the Indians for the purpose of being re-granted to certain purchasers, which surrender was accepted by the Crown for the said purpose, the conveyances to the purchasers to be delivered by the Crown upon the production of a certificate from certain trustees authorized by the Indians to receive the mortgages to be given back, certifying that the purchasers had done everything necessary to secure to the Indians and their posterity the \"stipulated annuities and considerations which they agree to give for the same\".\nThe petition then alleges the passing of the Act of 1824 by the Parliament of Upper Canada and the flooding in the year 1826 of 1826 4\/5 acres by the execution of the works without any compensation at any time having been made to the Indians, although provision was made by the statute for that purpose. Section 9 of the statute provided that if the canal should pass through any land in possession of any tribe or tribes of Indians, or if any act occasioning damage to their property or possessions should be done under the authority of the Act, compensation should be made to them in the same manner as provided by the statute with respect to the property, possession or rights of other individuals. \"The Chief Officer of the Indian Department within this province\" was required to name an arbitrator on behalf of the Indians and any amount awarded was to be paid to the said Chief Officer \"to the use of the said Indians\". It was subsequently provided in 1826 by 7 Geo. IV, c. 19, s. 5, that all matters to be determined by arbitration under section 7 of the earlier statute should be referred as therein provided \"so that the award or awards of such arbitrators may be made public and declared on or before the first day of September next (1826) and that all and every sum of money by such an award or awards directed to be paid by the said company shall be paid to the party or parties entitled to receive the same on or before the first day of October next\".\nThe petition further alleges in paragraph 4 that since the year 1784 the Department of Indian Affairs, through its Superintendent-General or other officer or officers charged with its control and management, was an express trustee for the Indians with respect to the control and management of their lands and property, including moneys received on their behalf. Appellant claims that it was the duty of the officer named in the Act of 1824, namely, \"the Chief Officer of the Indian Department\" to collect the amount to which the Indians were entitled in respect of the flooding of their lands and that he failed to take any steps to that end, whereby they have suffered loss. The petition also alleges that on the 20th of October, 1836, an Order-in-Council was passed in Upper Canada declaring 368 7\/10 acres of the Indian lands to be a free grant to the Grand River Navigation Company which had been incorporated in 1832 by 2 Wm. IV, c. 13. It is alleged that a patent of the said lands was issued to the company pursuant to this Order-in-Council and that the Indians at no time received any compensation for the lands so taken and that the Crown as their express trustee committed a breach of trust in failing to see that such compensation moneys were paid.\nWith respect to these first two heads of claim the appellant is in the difficulty that any breach of trust, if it occurred, took place before the Act of Union of 1840, and the appellant has not shown any basis of obligation resting upon His Majesty in the Right of the Dominion of Canada in respect of such a liability, although with respect to liabilities arising after that date section 111 of the British North America Act is relevant. I think therefore that the appeal cannot succeed with respect to these two heads of claim.\nComing to the third head of claim, it is alleged by the petition that as a result of the surrender and its acceptance a definite contractual agreement arose under which the Government of Upper Canada undertook to take charge of and sell the surrendered lands, receive the purchase moneys and hold the same intact \"for the benefit of the suppliants' ancestors separate and distinct from the public money of the province, for the purpose of providing a certain sure revenue for the support of the suppliants or their ancestors\". It is further alleged that in or about the year 1833 the Government of Upper Canada, depository and in control of the funds arising from the sale of the Six Nations lands, of which a very considerable amount was then in the custody and control of the Receiver General of the said province, contracted to purchase in the name of the Six Nations, but without their knowledge or consent, 6,121 shares of the par value of $25 each of the Grand River Navigation Company, and that the Government of Upper Canada, through the said Receiver-General, and subsequently the Government of Canada after the Union of 1840, paid, without further authority, out of collections made and arising from sales of lands, the sum of $160,000. It is alleged that these payments were in breach of the contractual agreement referred to. The suppliants claim that the said sum of $160,000 with interest should be restored to the funds held by the Department of Indian Affairs and the present government, on behalf of the Indians, the whole of this money having been illegally paid away for the said purpose and lost.\nIt is further alleged that by an Act of the Parliament of Canada of the 30th of August, 1851, c. 151, the Navigation Company was empowered to raise 40,000 pounds on debentures of the then town of Brantford by reason of which there was created in favour of the said town a mortgage upon all the assets of the said company as a result of which the said assets were ultimately foreclosed by the said town and lost to the Indians.\nAs already pointed out, it is also alleged by the petition that the Department of Indian Affairs from its formation in 1784 to the present time is an express trustee of the lands and property of the Indians, including all Indian money paid to it. It is also alleged that, in addition to the relief claimed on the basis of the \"Statutes, Ordinances and Orders-in-Council\" particularized above, the suppliants are \"entitled to succeed on equitable grounds\" and the specific claim with respect to the $160,000 is for \"repayment of cash paid on stock of the Grand River Navigation Company from trust funds of suppliants\".\nOn behalf of the respondent it is first contended that the allegations of fact in the petition and particulars do not show any agreement by His Majesty or anything held by His Majesty in trust. It is said that reference to the Crown (presumably in documents or statutes) as trustee for the Indians and to the Indians as wards of His Majesty is not a technical use of such terms but such references are merely descriptive of the general political relationship between His Majesty and the Indians. It is also contended that the only fact relied upon to show a trust or agreement is the acceptance by the Governor-in-Council in 1798 of the surrender of the Indian lands. In addition to the particular allegation of trust arising out of the surrender and acceptance in 1798 there is, however, the further allegation in the petition that the Crown, through the Indian Department and its officers, was always a trustee for the Indians with respect to lands or moneys of the Indians.\nIn Civilian War Claimants Association v. The King 2, Lord Atkin said:\nThere is nothing so far as I know, to prevent the Crown acting as agent or trustee if it chooses deliberately to do so.\nIn Kinloch v. Secretary of State for India 3, Lord Selbome, L.C., at 623 said:\nStill it would not be altogether satisfactory to proceed on that ground alone * * * if it really appeared that the intention of the Crown, in the Order in Council and the Warrant which passed from the Crown upon this subject, was to constitute the person who for the time being might fill that office of state a trustee in the ordinary sense of the word, liable to account in a Court of Equity to private persons.\nAt page 625 the Lord Chancellor further said:\nNow the words \"in trust for\" are quite consistent with, and indeed are the proper manner of expressing, every species of trust\u2014a trust not only as regards those matters which are the proper subjects for an equitable jurisdiction to administer, but as respects higher matters, such as might take place between the Crown and public officers discharging, under the directions of the Crown, duties or functions belonging to the prerogative and the authority of the Crown. In the lower sense they are matters within the jurisdiction of, and to be administered by, the ordinary Courte of Equity; in the higher sense they are not. What their sense is here, is the question to be determined, looking at the whole instrument and at its nature and effect.\nI think the law is correctly stated in Lewin on Trusts, 14th Ed. p. 25:\nThe Sovereign may sustain the character of a trustee, so far as regards the capacity to take the estate, and to execute the trust.\nThe authors go on to state that doubts have been entertained whether, the subject can by any legal process, enforce the performance of the trust. They add at p. 26:\nThe subject may, undoubtedly, appeal to the Sovereign by presenting a petition of right, and it cannot be supposed that the fountain of justice would not do justice.\nIn Pawlett v. Attorney-General 4, the plaintiff had executed a mortgage in favour of a mortgagee who had died and his heir being attainted of high treason the King had seized the lands. The plaintiff thereupon exhibited a bill against the King and the executor, seeking redemption of the mortgage, and the question that arose was whether he could have any remedy against the King for redemption. It was decided by Lord Hale and Baron Atkyns that the proceedings would lie. In Esquimalt and Nanaimo Rly. v. Wilson 5, the Judicial Committee in referring to the judgment of Baron Atkyns, said:\nIt was stated in the report that he was strongly of opinion that the party ought in this case to be relieved against the King, because the King was the fountain and head of justice and equity, and it was not to be presumed that he would be defective in either, and it would derogate from the King's honour to imagine that what is equity against a common person should not be equity against him.\nIt is provided by section 18 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might, in England, be subject of a suit or action against the Crown * * *\nThe effect of this section is to clothe the Exchequer Court with jurisdiction with respect to claims maintainable against the Crown whether under the former practice they were maintainable only by petition of right or otherwise.\nWith respect to a contention that there was no jurisdiction in the ordinary courts as to claims against the Crown where a petition of right would not lie, their Lordships in the Esquimalt case said at page 365:\nBut there are many cases in which petition of right is not applicable in which the Crown was brought before the Court of Chancery, and the Attorney-General, as representing the interests of the Crown, made defendant to an action in which the interests of the Crown were concerned * * *\nAt page 367 their Lordships referred to what was said by Lord Lyndhurst in Deare v. Attorney-General 6, namely:\nI apprehend that the Crown always appears by the Attorney-General in a Court of Justice, especially in a Court of Equity, where the interest of the Crown is concerned. Therefore, a practice has arisen of filing a bill against the Attorney-General, or of making him a party to a bill, where the interest of the Crown is concerned.\nTheir Lordships proceeded:\nThis statement, though made on the equity side of the Court of Exchequer, is certainly not limited to the Chancery proceedings that were instituted in that Court; it is of wide and general application. It is in entire agreement with the principles enunciated by Baron Atkyns in the earlier authority, and it is recognized as being the existing practice in the Courte today. With respect to the procedure by petition of right their Lordships said at 364:\nThat procedure is adopted for the recovery from the Crown of property to which the applicant has a legal or equitable right, as, for example, by proceedings equivalent to an action of ejectment or the payment of money.\nSection 7, subsection 1, of the Petition of Right Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 158, is as follows:\nIf the petition is presented for the recovery of any real or personal property, or any right in or to the same, which has been granted away or disposed of by or on behalf of His Majesty, or his predecessors, a copy of the petition and fiat, endorsed with a notice to the effect of the Form C in the schedule to this Act, shall be served upon or left at the last or usual or last known place of abode of the person in possession or occupation of such property or right.\nTheir Lordships in the Esquimalt case at page 364 said in relation to the very similar section of the British Columbia legislation:\nSect. 7 shows that where a petition of right is presented bo recover real or personal estate or any right granted away or disposed of on behalf of His Majesty, a copy is to be left at the house of the person last in possession, showing that the main claim is against the Crown, that the person last in possession is not necessarily a proper party to the suit, but that, in order that he may be affected with knowledge, provision is made 'that he should be served in the manner indicated.\nIn Hodge v. Attorney-General 7, the title-deeds of a leasehold estate had been deposited with bankers, by way of equitable mortgage. The depositor was subsequently convicted of felony and a bill was filed by the mortgagees against the Attorney-General for a sale of the property. Alderson B., sitting in equity, held that the court could declare that the plaintiffs were equitable mortgagees and directed the Master to take an account of what was due to the plaintiffs and decreed that the plaintiffs should hold possession of the property until their lien was satisfied. He held that he did not have any jurisdiction to order a sale or to order the Crown to reconvey.\nI see no more difficulty in the present instance, should the facts warrant, in making a declaration that the moneys in the hands of the Crown are trust moneys and that the appellant and those upon whose behalf he sues are cestuis que trust, even although the court could not direct the Crown to pay. In this latter event it is inconceivable that at this date, any more than in the time of Baron Atkyns, the Crown, as the fountain of Justice, would not do justice. I think, however, no such difficulty lies in the way of an order for payment.\nIn Feather v. The Queen 8, at 294, Coburn C.J., delivering the judgment of the court said:\nWe concur with that court in thinking that the only cases in which the petition of right is open to the subject are, where the land or goods or money of a subject have found their way into the possession of the Crown, and the purpose of the petition is to obtain restitution, or, if restitution cannot be given, compensation in money * * *\nIf this is so with respect to moneys of the subject as to which no trust exists, it cannot be any the less so because the moneys coming to the hands of the Grown are impressed with a trust in favour of the suppliant and there can be no objection, as urged by Mr. Jackett, that the Crown has paid away the moneys. This situation is expressly recognized in section 7 of the Petition of Right-Act, already cited, and in In re Gosman 9 it was held that moneys transferred to the Crown by the trustees and executors of the will of a deceased person where no next-of-kin had been discovered were recoverable by the next-of-kin, although in the meantime the moneys had been paid away by the Crown.\nAs to the moneys received in respect of the sale of the lands, O'Connor J. construed the petition to allege that they had been received by the trustees for the Six Nations. In this he has, I think, been misled by a seeming ambiguity. In a letter of February 20, 1798, to the Duke of Portland, it is stated that the trustees were \"to receive for their use mortgages and other securities for the payment to them of the several and respective considerations stipulated\". This, in my opinion, means that the trustees were merely to hold the securities, not collect them; the words \"for the payment to them\" describe the obligations for which the securities were given; \"their\" and \"them\" signify the Indians. This is confirmed by the minute of council of February 5, 1798, \"to secure to the Five Nations and their posterity the stipulated annuities and considerations which they agree to give for the same\". The same minute speaks of the trustees as \"authorized to receive\" mortgages of the said lands. Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the petition distinctly allege that the Crown was to and did receive the money. The reason for putting the mortgages into trustees would seem to be the obvious one of enabling suit or action to be taken without the difficulty or inconvenience that would attend them in the name of the Crown.\nI take the allegations, therefore, to be: that in consideration of the surrender, the Crown, whether acting with Imperial or Colonial advisers, undertook to convey the property to the purchasers named and to others thereafter to be named, to receive the purchase moneys and to maintain them as a converted form of the lands sold for the purposes of a tribal enjoyment equivalent to that to which the Six Nations were entitled under the grant; and that by transmission this obligation has become assumed by the Crown in right of the Dominion. Although the matters present relations of the nature of a trust, they contain likewise the ordinary elements of a contract.\nUnder the arrangements of 1798 the persons nominated by the Six Nations to receive the securities were the Acting Surveyor General, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, both officers of the Crown, and one, Alexander Stewart, a barrister. The petition does not show how long these persons acted or how it came about that the Department of Indian Affairs became substituted. Some further light may be obtained from subsequent legislation.\nAfter Union by the Act of 1841, 4 and 5 Victoria, c. 74, it is recited that:\nWhereas three-quarters of the stock of the Grand River Navigation Company is held in trust and for the benefit of the Six Nations Indians; and whereas by the provision of the Act incorporating the said Company, the persons in whose name such Stock is so subscribed and held for the said Six Nations Indians, have no adequate influence in the appointment of the Directors! by whom the affairs of the said Company are regulated and managed * * *\nThe statute proceeds to enact that it should be lawful for the Governor of the province by and with the advice and consent of the Executive Council to nominate and appoint two directors at every election so long as the proportion of three-quarters of the capital stock should continue to be held for the use and benefit of the said Six Nations Indians. The reason for this enactment was that it had been provided by section 22 of the Act incorporating the company that no one person should have more than fifteen votes regardless 'of the number of shares held.\nA further development with respect to the holding of these shares is evidenced by the Act of 1853, 16 Victoria, c. 256. By section 1 the holding of a special meeting of stockholders of the company was authorized and by section 2 it was provided that the question to be put at the meeting was whether the company and all works connected therewith should or should not be placed under the control and management of the government of the province. The proviso to the section reads:\nProvided always that inasmuch as three-fourths of the Stock of the Company is held in trust for the benefit of the Six Nation Indians, the decision so come to by the said shareholders, if in the affirmative, shall not be valid or binding until ratified and confirmed by the Governor as Trustee for the said Six Nation Indians.\nIn 1860 by 23 Victoria, c. 151, section 3, it was provided:\nAll moneys or securities of any kind applicable to the support or benefit of the Indians or any tribe or band of Indians and all moneys accrued, or hereafter to accrue, from the sale of any lands reserved or held in trust as aforesaid, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be applicable to the same purposes and be dealt with in the same manner as they might have been applied to or dealt with before the passing of this Act.\nAnd by section 8 it is provided:\nThe Governor-in-Council may, subject to the provisions of this Act, direct how, and in what manner, and by whom, the moneys arising from sales of Indian lands and from the property held or to be held in trust for the Indians, shall be invested from time to time, and how the payments to which the Indians may be entitled shall be made, and shall provide for the general management of such lands, moneys, and property * * *\nIt does not appear who in 1841 were \"the persons in whose name such stock is so subscribed and held for the said Six Nation Indians.\" When the history of the dealings from time to time with the Indian moneys subsequent to their receipt is disclosed from the official records, the court will be in a position to say what was and is the position and obligations in law of the Crown with respect to the moneys in question. For that purpose the matter must go to trial.\nIt is also contended on behalf of the respondent that if the allegations in the petition show any legal obligation on the part of His Majesty, it is an obligation of His Majesty in right of the Imperial Government. It is said that until 1855, or later, the Imperial Government retained control of the administration of Indian Affairs in Canada and reference is made to Rex v. Hill 10; St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber v. The Queen 11; and Easterbrook v. The King 12. The statements in these judgments are all, of course, statements of fact and their applicability to the case at bar will depend upon the evidence to be adduced. It would at present appear however, from the Act of 1841 and the Act of 1853, already referred to, that, whatever may have been the general situation, nevertheless, with respect at least to the moneys here in question, the local government was purporting to exercise some measure of control. It is sufficient for the present purposes to say that the Crown's contention cannot be given effect to at this stage and will depend ulimately for whatever force it may have upon the evidence.\nIt is next contended on behalf of the Crown that any legal claim which might be shown by the allegations of fact in the petition arose prior to 1840, and therefore, the appellants cannot rely upon the provisions of section 111 of the British North America Act. I do not read the petition as thus restricted but as alleging payments out of the moneys in question after the Union of 1840. It may be that these payments were all made in pursuance of one contract to buy the shares alleged to have been made in 1833, in which event it may be contended on the part of the appellant that payments made after the Union of 1840 cannot be justified on that ground if the contract was illegal when made. It may be however, that the payments after Union were independent transactions. That again is a matter for the evidence.\nThe respondent in its factum, although the point was not mentioned in argument, contends that the appellant and those on whose behalf he sues, have not shown that they, as distinct from the original members of the Six Nations living in 1798, are entitled to any interest in the subject matter of the petition. No difficulty was felt on this score in Henry v. The King 13. Without approving or disapproving of anything decided in that case I do not think this is an objection which can or should be dealt with at this stage. When the evidence is fully developed the point may or may not be of importance. I would leave it to be dealt with at the trial.\nI would allow the appeal with respect to the claim for $160,000 and refer the same back to the Exchequer Court. The learned trial judge below did not, by reason of the conclusion to which he came on the first question, deal with the Statute of Limitations which was the subject of the second question, and the reference back will be subject to the determination of that question. This will raise the interesting question as to whether persons with the limited civil rights of the Indians can be barred by the statute. The matter was not argued before us and I do not deal with it.\nAs to costs, I agree with the order proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nLocke J.:\u2014The question set down for argument by an order made under the provisions of Rule 149 of the Exchequer Court states the matter to be determined as being whether, assuming the allegations of fact contained in the Petition of Right and the particulars delivered by the suppliant to be true, a petition of right lies against the respondent for any of the relief sought. This has been treated properly, in my opinion, as raising also the question as to whether the Petition of Right discloses any cause of action, and the matter has been disposed of by the learned trial judge upon this footing.\nIn so far as the claim of the suppliants is to recover damages in respect of the lands flooded by the works of the Welland Canal in the year 1826 and for payment of the value of the lands said to have been granted to the Grand River Navigation Company in 1832 are concerned, I agree that the appeal fails. Apart from the unfortunate amendment to the petition made on April 9, 1943 which, if taken literally, would be fatal to the claim in respect of the lands submerged, it is disclosed upon the face of the petition that the acts complained of took place when the administration of Indian Affairs was in the hands of the Province of Upper Canada. While by section 111 of the British North America Act the Dominion of Canada assumed liability for the debts of the Province of Canada, it is neither suggested in the pleadings nor contended in argument before us that by the Act of Union of 1840 the Province of Canada became liable for liabilities of the Province of Upper Canada of the nature suggested.\nAs to the claim advanced in respect of the amount of $160,000 or part of it, said to have been expended out of the funds of the Six Nations Indians by the Province of Canada for the purchase of Grand River Navigation Company stock, and the claim for interest, I think there is error in the judgment appealed from.\nBy paragraph 13 of the Petition of Right, it is alleged that on February 5, 1798, Captain Joseph Brant, acting under a Power of Attorney from certain chiefs of what were then the Five Nations Indians, in pursuance of arrangements made with the Government of Upper Canada, executed a formal surrender to the Crown of \"the lands to be sold.\" When asked for particulars as to the nature of the deed of surrender, the suppliants delivered a copy of the grant which disclosed that the request advanced on behalf of the Five Nations Indians was that the surrender of 352,707 acres of land be accepted for the sole purpose of enabling His Majesty to grant the lands to certain named purchasers for the consideration stated in a schedule to the document. The consideration for the purchase which aggregated an amount in excess of \u00a342,000 was not to be paid to the Crown but to the Acting Surveyor-General, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the District, and Alexander Stewart, Esq., described in a letter from the Honourable Peter Russell, President of the Executive Council of Upper Canada to the Duke of Portland, Secretary for the Colonies dated February 20,1798, as the persons named by the Five Nations as \"their trustees to receive for their use mortgages and other securities for the payment to them of the several and respective considerations stipulated.\" By paragraph 14 the suppliants alleged that as a result of the negotiations between Brant and the Provincial Government of Upper Canada an agreement was entered into whereby the Government was to take charge of and sell the lands and receive the purchase money and hold the same intact for the benefit of the suppliants' ancestors separate and distinct from the public money of the Province for the purpose of providing revenue for the support of the Five Nations. By paragraph 15 it is alleged that:\u2014\nIn or about the year 1833 the Government of Upper Canada, depositary and in control of the funds arising from the sale of Six Nation lands, of which a very considerable amount was then in the custody and control of the Receiver-General in said Government charged with the duty of selling lands belonging to Suppliants, and receiving the funds arising from such sales and disbursing the same under the contractual agreement made between Joseph Brant aforesaid and the Government of the Province of Upper Canada under which said Government was to hold the proceeds of such lands for the purpose of assuring to your Suppliants and their posterity an annuity for their future support, in despite of the terms of said contractual agreement aforesaid, contracted to purchase in the name of your Suppliants, but without their knowledge or consent, 6,121 shares of $25 each of the stock of the Grand River Navigation Company, and said Government of Upper Canada, through the said Receiver General of its Government and subsequently the Government of Canada after the Union of 1841, paid without further authority out of collections made and arising from said sales of lands authorized and directed to be made by the terms of said contractual agreement with said Brant, the sum of $160,000 from the proceeds of such sales so illegally contracted for without authority to be purchased by him in the name of your Suppliants to complete the payment for such shares, and Suppliants charge that said payment was made in breach of the contractual agreement to hold the whole of said proceeds of sales for the support of your Suppliants or their ancestors as occasion might arise.\nand by paragraph 16 the suppliants asked that the said sum should be restored with interest to the funds held by the Department of Indian Affairs and the present Government of Canada \"on which is binding and effective the contract founded (sic) by said Brant in 1798.\" When asked for particulars as to the identity of the person or persons who made the various payments out of the various funds upon the purchase of the stock, the suppliants replied that the information was in the possession of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Natural Resources.\nAs pleading, the language of these paragraphs leaves much to be desired. Paragraph 15 speaks of the Government of Upper Canada being \"charged with the duty of selling lands belonging to suppliants\" and refers to the funds paid for the Grand River Navigation Company stock as being paid \"out of collections made and arising from said sales of lands\" but without further explanation I think this must be taken to refer to the lands conveyed to the nominees of the Five Nations Indians under the directions given by Brant in 1798, and not to the proceeds of the sale of other lands. While the reference to the Power of Attorney given to Brant by the Five Nations Indians referred to in paragraph 13 shows that the lands in question were surrendered simply for the purpose of permitting grants to be made to the persons to whom the Indians desired the lands to be sold and the particulars of the deed of surrender show that the consideration for the purchase was to be paid over to the individuals named by the Indians as trustees and these persons are referred to in the communication from Peter Russell to the Secretary for the Colonies as the \"trustees to receive for their use mortgages and other securities for the payment to them of the several and respective considerations stipulated\" and the pleading does not allege that these trustees thereafter paid over the consideration to the Crown to be held on behalf of the Indians, I think when these paragraphs are read together it is made sufficiently clear that the suppliants claim that the funds realized from the sale came into the possession of the Crown and were held on behalf of the Indians. The identity of the trustees, named, two of whom were the Honourable David William Smith, His Majesty's Acting Surveyor General, and Captain William Claus, His Majesty's Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and the fact that by c. 74 of the Statutes of the First Parliament of the Province of Canada (4 & 5 Vict.) it was recited that three-quarters of the stock of the Grand River Navigation Company were held in trust for the benefit of the Six Nations Indians (presumably by the Crown) and it was provided that the Governor of the Province, by and with the advice and consent of the Executive Council, might nominate two of the directors of the company, would at least indicate either that possession of the funds by the trustees had been treated from the outset as possession by the Crown or that possession of the funds had thereafter been taken. These are facts which undoubtedly should have been more clearly pleaded but that this is what the suppliants really contend is, in my opinion, evident. It is alleged in paragraph 15 that the Government of Upper Canada contracted to purchase the shares in the Grand River Navigation Company and that the said Government prior to 1841 and the Government of the Province of Canada thereafter paid in the aggregate $160,000 out of the moneys held in trust for the Indians upon the purchase of the stock, without saying what amounts were paid by the respective Governments. It is further in the same paragraph alleged that the Government of Upper Canada was to hold the proceeds of the sale of the lands for the purpose of assuring to the suppliants and their posterity an annuity for their future support and that the moneys paid out for the Grand River Navigation Company stock were so paid without authority from the Indians in breach of the agreement between them and the Crown, and in so far as this relates to the moneys disbursed by the Government of the Province of Canada I am of the opinion that a cause of action against that Province is disclosed. While again the pleading is defective, I think the statement in paragraph 22 (g) that the suppliants rely upon the British North America Act should here be construed as meaning that it is claimed that by virtue of section 111 of that Act His Majesty in right of the Dominion of Canada is liable for the claim as being a debt of the former Province of Canada, liability for which was imposed upon the Dominion by the Statute, and that a cause of action in respect of this part of the claim as against the respondents is shown. Section 111 reads that \"Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province existing at the Union.\" The question as to whether this gave a right of action directly against the Dominion in respect of the liability of the province was not raised before us and is not, in my opinion, one of the questions set down for argument and I accordingly express no opinion upon the point.\nAs to the second branch of the question, I am of opinion that a petition of right lies for the above mentioned part of the relief claimed and that there is jurisdiction in the Exchequer Court for the reasons stated by my brother Kellock.\nThe question as to whether the claim is barred by the Exchequer Court Act and the Statute of Limitations was not dealt with by the learned trial judge and was not argued before us and I do not deal with it.\nThe appeal should be allowed as to the claim advanced in regard to moneys said to have been paid out by the Province of Canada after the date of the Union and as to the interest upon these moneys, but as to the remainder of the claims should be dismissed. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed as to the claim advanced in respect of moneys alleged to have been paid by the old Province of Canada for the purchase of shares of the Grand River Navigation Co. out of the proceeds of the sale of lands surrendered in 1798. The costs of an incidental to the hearing before the Exchequer Court of the question of law shall be costs in the cause. The costs of this appeal shall be to the appellants in the cause except in any event they shall not receive any costs of or in connection with their factums.\nSolicitor for the appellants, Auguste Lemieux.\nSolicitor for the respondent, F.

This fuse had been found the previous fall in a ditch along the public highway between Rimouski and an army training camp nearby. It was established that a regiment camping there in 1943 had received such bombs, with fuses attached, for training purposes; that the fuses were always attached to the bombs; that very severe rules were in force in the camp regarding the handling and disposal of these bombs and that these rules had been followed. The Exchequer Court awarded judgment in favour of respondent and held that in view of the failure of the army officers to explain the presence of the fuse in the ditch, the conclusion must be that there had been negligence on the part of a servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nHeld: reversing the judgment appealed from, that the respondent had the onus, placed upon him by section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, of establishing that the injuries suffered by his son were the result of the negligence of a servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment, and that he had failed to discharge it.\nHeld: also, that under the circumstances disclosed, the presence of the fuse in the ditch of the road was entirely left to conjecture; but that, even if they gave rise to presumptions, in order that any responsibility may be attributed to the Crown, such presumptions would have to be \"graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes\"\u2014which they were not in this case.\nHeld: further, that there was no obligation here, on the part of the servants of the Crown, to explain the presence of the fuse in the ditch, or, in other words, to exculpate themselves.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Michaud, Deputy Judge, allowing the petition of right and awarding a sum of $12,101.55.\nL. A. Forsyth, K.C., W. R. Jackett, K.C., and A. Forget for the appellant.\nAntoine Rivard, K.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Vers novembre 1943, deux jeunes gar\u00e7ons, Jean-Marie Lepage et Georges B\u00e9langer, marchant sur le chemin public \u00e0 environ un mille de la ville de Rimouski, trouv\u00e8rent dans le foss\u00e9 du chemin deux objets, qui leur parurent assez \u00e9tranges, et chacun d'eux en prit un. Le jeune Lepage, \u00e0 son retour \u00e0 la maison, le donna \u00e0 son p\u00e8re qui, ignorant ce que c'\u00e9tait, le mit sur la tablette sup\u00e9rieure d'une garde-robe dans la maison, o\u00f9 il demeura jusqu'au printemps suivant.\nGeorges B\u00e9langer, en arrivant chez lui, le remit \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re Pierre, \u00e2g\u00e9 de quatorze ans, et \u00e0 qui un fr\u00e8re plus \u00e2g\u00e9, Fernando, d'environ vingt ans, conseilla de le jeter parce qu'il pouvait \u00eatre dangereux. Le jeune Pierre, suivant le conseil de Fernando, le jeta en cons\u00e9quence sur un amas de rebuts qui se trouvait sur la v\u00e9randa en arri\u00e8re de leur maison. Mais, un peu plus tard, Raymond B\u00e9langer, \u00e2g\u00e9 de neuf \u00e0 dix ans, s'empara de ce curieux objet, alors que Pierre, s'en \u00e9tant aper\u00e7u, l'enleva \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re plus jeune et jeta l'objet derri\u00e8re l'\u00e9choppe de son p\u00e8re.\nVers la fin d'avril 1944, le jeune Raymond trouva de nouveau l'objet en question; il joua avec pendant environ dix jours, l'emportant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole dans une des poches de son habit et se plaisant \u00e0 le montrer \u00e0 ses condisciples. Enfin, il l'\u00e9changea avec un de ses voisins, Jean-Guy Moreau, \u00e2g\u00e9 de onze ans, pour ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 au cours du proc\u00e8s deux \"boleys\". Pendant une semaine, Guy Moreau garda l'objet en sa possession, s'ing\u00e9niant \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir ce que cela pouvait bien \u00eatre. Dans l'intervalle, il le montra \u00e0 son p\u00e8re, le demandeur actuel \u00e9s qualit\u00e9, qui l'examina et m\u00eame essaya de le d\u00e9visser avec des pinces, mais n'y r\u00e9ussit pas. Il le remit alors \u00e0 son fils Guy en lui disant d'aller le jeter; mais il admet, qu'apr\u00e8s avoir remis l'objet \u00e0 son fils, il ne s'en est plus occup\u00e9.\nGuy Moreau, pour le compte de qui le demandeur a intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente poursuite en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur de son fils mineur, revint quelque temps apr\u00e8s aupr\u00e8s de son p\u00e8re et lui dit: \"Regarde, j'ai d\u00e9coup\u00e9 \u00e7a\". Il avait pris un clou et il avait d\u00e9fait le dessus. Son p\u00e8re regarda de nouveau l'objet, y vit une aiguille et un petit plomb rond, prit ce petit plomb et enfon\u00e7a l'aiguille assez fort, mais rien ne se produisit. Il r\u00e9p\u00e9ta \u00e0 son fils: \"Va donc jeter \u00e7a\". Le jeune Guy partit, et, quelques minutes apr\u00e8s, le p\u00e8re entendit un bruit; il sortit imm\u00e9diatement et trouva son fils le bras en l'air et la main emport\u00e9e.\nIl fut alors d\u00e9couvert que l'objet \u00e9tait une fus\u00e9e ordinairement attach\u00e9e \u00e0 une bombe, qui \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e pour des exercices de man\u0153uvres militaires, par un r\u00e9giment qui, en 1943, \u00e9tait alors en campement \u00e0 quelques milles de la ville de Rimouski. Il est admis que cette fus\u00e9e \u00e9tait par sa nature un dangereux explosif, dont le jeune Guy avait provoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9tonation, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9chir\u00e9 l'enveloppe, en employant un marteau pour enfoncer dans la fus\u00e9e une sorte de pointe qu'il avait d'abord d\u00e9viss\u00e9e et enlev\u00e9e et qu'il ne pouvait r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 remettre.\nGuy Moreau, par suite de cette explosion, subit \u00e9videmment des blessures tr\u00e8s graves qui n\u00e9cessit\u00e8rent d'importants traitements et jusqu'\u00e0 vingt pansements subs\u00e9quents, y compris l'amputation du poignet gauche, la suture de douze perforations intestinales, ainsi que le d\u00e9bridement et le nettoyage d'une plaie \u00e0 la cuisse gauche. Son p\u00e8re, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son fils mineur, all\u00e9gua que ce dernier avait subi une incapacit\u00e9 totale temporaire de cinq mois et une incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente de soixante-dix pour cent, dont soixante pour cent pour l'amputation de l'avant-bras gauche et dix pour cent pour les blessures \u00e0 l'abdomen et au membre inf\u00e9rieur gauche. Il r\u00e9clama \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'honorable Ministre de la D\u00e9fense nationale (Arm\u00e9e), une somme de $25,609.25, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens, en attribuant le dommage subi par son fils \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des autorit\u00e9s militaires, en charge de l'administration du r\u00e9giment de Montmagny en garnison au camp situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de Rimouski, ainsi qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, et pour lesquelles, d'apr\u00e8s lui, l'appelant devait r\u00e9pondre. La d\u00e9fense de la Couronne fut d'abord que la fus\u00e9e qui avait caus\u00e9 le dommage n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par des membres du r\u00e9giment dans le foss\u00e9 du chemin public o\u00f9 elle fut trouv\u00e9e; que les autorit\u00e9s militaires ne pouvaient, en aucune fa\u00e7on, \u00eatre tax\u00e9es de n\u00e9gligence dans le contr\u00f4le des explosifs qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remis pour les fins des man\u0153uvres militaires; qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, si n\u00e9gligence existait de la part d'un employ\u00e9 ou serviteur de la Couronne, ce n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi; qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 l'accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence de la n\u00e9gligence du jeune Guy Moreau lui-m\u00eame, ou de celle de ses parents; et que, \u00e0 tout le moins, Guy Moreau et ses parents doivent \u00eatre tenus pour coupables d'une n\u00e9gligence contributoire.\nLe jugement de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier \u00e9carta le plaidoyer de n\u00e9gligence contributoire et accorda \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e8s qualit\u00e9 une somme de $12,101.55.\nLe jugement de cette Cour se base sur l'article 19 (c) de la Loi concernant la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier; il d\u00e9clare qu'il fut prouv\u00e9 que la fus\u00e9e dont il s'agit faisait bien partie des munitions fournies au r\u00e9giment pour fins d'exercices. Les bombes, avec les fus\u00e9es qui y \u00e9taient attach\u00e9es, furent exp\u00e9di\u00e9es de Valcartier \u00e0 Rimouski en diff\u00e9rents temps au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1943, et des r\u00e8gles s\u00e9v\u00e8res avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9es par les quartiers g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l'Arm\u00e9e pour la direction des officiers et des hommes dans la manipulation et l'usage de ces bombes et fus\u00e9es, qui constituaient des explosifs tr\u00e8s dangereux.\nLes instructions \u00e9taient de garder les bombes et les fus\u00e9es dans les magasins de l'Ordonnance, en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, pour l'usage du district dans lequel se trouvait le camp situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de Rimouski. Elles ne pouvaient \u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9es au quartier-ma\u00eetre du r\u00e9giment sans un ordre \u00e9crit du commandant. D\u00e8s qu'elles \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9es aux quartiers du r\u00e9giment, le quartier-ma\u00eetre devenait responsable de leur garde et de la fa\u00e7on dont il devait en \u00eatre dispos\u00e9. L'officier en charge des exercices militaires \u00e9mettait alors des r\u00e9quisitions \u00e9crites \u00e0 ce quartier-ma\u00eetre, qui ne pouvait les remettre \u00e0 qui que ce soit, autrement que conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces r\u00e9quisitions \u00e9crites. L'officier en charge de l'entra\u00eenement devait alors voir \u00e0 ce que les bombes, avec fus\u00e9es attach\u00e9es, ne fussent employ\u00e9es que pour les fins de l'entra\u00eenement ou des exercices militaires. Celui-ci \u00e9tait tenu de faire rapport au quartier-ma\u00eetre \u00e0 l'effet que toutes les bombes qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remises avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truites au cours des exercices. A la fin de la journ\u00e9e, le quartier-ma\u00eetre recevait ce rapport et on lui retournait en m\u00eame temps les bombes qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es. S'il arrivait qu'une bombe, ou la fus\u00e9e, refusait d'exploser, l'on provoquait son explosion au moyen de la dynamite, et, dans ce cas, ce fait devait \u00eatre consign\u00e9 au rapport de l'officier en charge. En somme, l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve faite par le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s l'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que les r\u00e8glements en vigueur, s'ils \u00e9taient suivis, rendaient impossible qu'une fus\u00e9e, comme celle qui a caus\u00e9 l'accident au jeune Moreau, eut pu rester inexplos\u00e9e ailleurs que dans les magasins du quartier-ma\u00eetre ou en la charge de l'officier qui pr\u00e9sidait aux exercices de tir, et surtout dans un foss\u00e9 le long du chemin public, \u00e0 moins qu'elle n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e; et, dans ce dernier cas, l'officier en charge \u00e9tait tenu de noter le fait et de le rapporter au commandant, qui, \u00e0 son tour, devait le rapporter aux quartiers-g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l'Ordonnance.\nLa preuve des officiers de l'Arm\u00e9e a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'aucune bombe, ou fus\u00e9e, non explos\u00e9e n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9e comme manquant au camp de Rimouski avant le 5 mai 1944. D\u00e8s lors, comment se fait-il que des fus\u00e9es d\u00e9tach\u00e9es des bombes aient pu \u00eatre trouv\u00e9es dans le foss\u00e9 du chemin \u00e0 environ trois mille pieds du camp et \u00e0 un endroit qui ne se trouvait pas sur le trajet que devaient parcourir les bombes en allant de Valcartier au camp de Rimouski?\nL'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance, avec raison, pose le principe que celui qui a la garde d'un objet dangereux est tenu \u00e0 la plus grande pr\u00e9caution pour \u00e9viter le danger \u00e0 la vie humaine que cet objet peut entra\u00eener; mais il ajoute qu'en l'absence d'une explication de la part des officiers de l'Arm\u00e9e, qui avaient la charge de ces dangereux explosifs, il est forc\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que quelqu'un, depuis les quartiers-g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de l'Ordonnance jusqu'aux officiers qui avaient la charge des exercices militaires au camp de Rimouski, \"did not keep a proper check of these bombs entrusted to his care\", et que cela constituait de la part d'un officier ou d'un serviteur de la Couronne, \"negligence while acting within the scope of his duties or employment\"; puis, le jugement consid\u00e8re que rien, \u00e0 raison de son \u00e2ge, de ses connaissances ou de son exp\u00e9rience, n'est de nature \u00e0 indiquer que le jeune Moreau eut pu supposer que l'objet qu'il manipulait \u00e9tait dangereux et que, d\u00e8s lors, il ne peut admettre le plaidoyer de n\u00e9gligence contributoire de sa part. Il \u00e9carte toute question de prescription, parce que la p\u00e9tition de droit fut produite en d\u00e9cembre 1944, alors que l'accident ne remontait qu'au 5 mai de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Il \u00e9carte \u00e9galement toute preuve d'un novus actus interveniens comme pouvant r\u00e9sulter, soit de l'incident o\u00f9 a figur\u00e9 Fernando B\u00e9langer, \u00e2g\u00e9 de vingt ans, soit de l'autre incident, o\u00f9 le demandeur actuel, p\u00e8re du jeune Moreau, prit possession de la fus\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises et la remit \u00e0 son fils en se contentant de lui dire de la jeter, sans m\u00eame se pr\u00e9occuper de s'assurer que son fils Guy s'en \u00e9tait effectivement d\u00e9barrass\u00e9.\nC'est comme cons\u00e9quence de ces raisonnements successifs que la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a rendu contre la Couronne le jugement dont il y a appel.\nIl me para\u00eet que cette Cour, si\u00e9geant en appel, pourrait difficilement substituer \u00e0 l'opinion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a vu et entendu le jeune Moreau comme t\u00e9moin, un a\/vis contraire sur la capacit\u00e9 de ce dernier, par son \u00e2ge, ses connaissances et son exp\u00e9rience, de se rendre compte du danger qu'il courait en manipulant, comme il l'a fait, la fus\u00e9e qui l'a si gravement bless\u00e9. Mais il n'en est pas de m\u00eame de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier est arriv\u00e9e au sujet de l'intervention de Fernando B\u00e9langer et de l'intim\u00e9 Moreau. En plus, en tout respect, je ne puis m'accorder avec l'honorable juge \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du principe qu'il pose qu'il appartient aux officiers du camp d'expliquer la pr\u00e9sence de la fus\u00e9e dans le foss\u00e9 du chemin conduisant de Rimouski au camp d'entra\u00eenement et que, en l'absence de cette explication, la cons\u00e9quence irr\u00e9sistible \u00e9tait qu'il y avait eu n\u00e9gligence de la part des officiers en charge dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions. Je crois que par l\u00e0 la Cour est entr\u00e9e plut\u00f4t dans le domaine des conjectures que dans celui des pr\u00e9somptions qu'un tribunal est justifi\u00e9 de tirer des faits prouv\u00e9s.\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence sont bien arr\u00eat\u00e9es sur ce point et ne souffrent plus de discussion. Elles exigent que les pr\u00e9somptions sur lesquelles peut valablement se fonder une conclusion de ce genre soient graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes. Il m'est impossible de trouver ici une situation qui rencontre ces exigences.\nLes pr\u00e9cautions d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par les r\u00e8glements en force au camp pr\u00e8s de Rimouski ne paraissent laisser aucune ouverture \u00e0 la suggestion que des mesures de prudence suppl\u00e9mentaires eussent pu \u00eatre adopt\u00e9es. La preuve, ainsi que le jugement lui-m\u00eame l'a reconnu, est que ces r\u00e8glements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 scrupuleusement suivis. C'est tout ce que les officiers et les serviteurs de la Couronne pouvaient \u00eatre tenus d'\u00e9tablir. Le fait est que l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance, cherchant \u00e0 s'expliquer ce qui a pu se passer, a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit \u00e0 croire qu'il pouvait s'agir d'un vol. S'il y a eu vol de la part de celui qui aurait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la fus\u00e9e dans le foss\u00e9, la Couronne ne peut en \u00eatre tenue responsable.\nMais, il y a plus. Cette fus\u00e9e \u00e9tait normalement attach\u00e9e \u00e0 une bombe; elle ne pouvait \u00eatre employ\u00e9e que pour provoquer l'explosion de la bombe. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait fermement attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la bombe, qu'elle ne pouvait tomber d'elle-m\u00eame, et que, pour l'en d\u00e9tacher, il fallait employer une force assez consid\u00e9rable, puisque le p\u00e8re du jeune Guy, l'intim\u00e9, essaya sans succ\u00e8s de la d\u00e9visser, comme il l'admet. Il faut donc que celui qui a jet\u00e9 la fus\u00e9e dans le foss\u00e9 ait commenc\u00e9 par la d\u00e9tacher de la bombe. Cela ne pouvait avoir rien \u00e0 faire avec l'exercice des fonctions d'un militaire ou d'un serviteur de la Couronne; et il est impossible de d\u00e9cider en loi que celui qui a accompli cet acte agissait, suivant les termes de l'article 19 (c), \"within the scope of his duties or employment\". Or, le raisonnement du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, en posant le principe qu'il incombait aux officiers militaires en charge de fournir une explication ou une excuse pour la pr\u00e9sence de la fus\u00e9e dans le foss\u00e9, p\u00e8che donc, a mon humble avis, par deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s essentiels: premi\u00e8rement, il suppose que la Couronne avait le fardeau de la preuve et qu'elle devait s'exculper, alors que l'article 19 (c) ne permet le maintien d'une r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne, \u00e0 raison de la mort ou du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la personne ou \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, que dans le cas o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sulte de la n\u00e9gligence de l'officier ou du serviteur de la Couronne. Il faut \u00e9videmment, d\u00e8s lors, que le p\u00e9titionnaire, ou le r\u00e9clamant, prouve cette n\u00e9gligence. Cette preuve ne peut r\u00e9sulter de conjectures ou de suppositions comme celles que nous avons ici. Je ne trouve aucun fait qui puisse donner lieu \u00e0 des pr\u00e9somptions; et, en plus, il faudrait que telles pr\u00e9somptions fussent graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes. Il n'y a rien de tel dans l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle.\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, toujours en vertu de l'article 19 (c), il ne suffisait pas \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de prouver la n\u00e9gligence d'un officier ou d'un serviteur de la Couronne, mais il fallait, en plus, qu'il prouv\u00e2t que cet officier ou ce serviteur n\u00e9gligent, agissait dans les limites de ses devoirs ou de ses fonctions. Non seulement l'intim\u00e9 ne l'a pas prouv\u00e9, mais les circonstances d\u00e9voil\u00e9es d\u00e9montrent exactement le contraire. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te: La fus\u00e9e d\u00e9tach\u00e9e de la bombe ne pouvait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi jet\u00e9e dans cet \u00e9tat par un officier ou un serviteur de la Couronne \"within the scope of his duties or employment.\"\nCela suff\u00eet pour que l'intim\u00e9 ait failli dans la preuve qui lui incombait pour tenir la Couronne responsable du malheureux accident souffert par son jeune fils.\nCette raison entra\u00eene n\u00e9cessairement le maintien de l'appel et dispense d'examiner\u2014ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9galement un tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux obstacle \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation de l'intim\u00e9\u2014si l'intervention de Fernando B\u00e9langer, et, surtout, celle du demandeur lui-m\u00eame, le p\u00e8re du jeune Guy Moreau (responsable des actes de son fils, en vertu de l'article 1054 du Code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec), eut pu quand m\u00eame entra\u00eener le rejet de la p\u00e9tition de droit.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et la p\u00e9tition de droit doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: Perrault Casgrain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rivard, Blais & Gobeil.\n",

A tank, which was the object of the insurance, burst permitting the escape of fumes which ignited and exploded causing considerable damage to appellant's factory. The Superior Court maintained the action on the policy and the Court of Appeal dismissed it on the ground that the damages were caused by fire and were not the direct result of the tearing asunder of the tank. Held: The damage was the direct consequence of the accident to the tank; the bursting of the tank was the proximate cause of the damage. Coxe v. Employers' Liability Ass. Corp. (1916) 2 K.B. 629; Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Society [1918] A.C. 350 and Canada Rice Mills v. Union Marine and General Ins. Co. [1941] A.C. 55 referred to. Stanley v. Western Ins. Co. (1868) L.R. 3 Ex. 71 distinguished.\nHeld also, that the appellant was not deprived of its right of action against the respondent, as the assignment of its rights to the fire insurance companies had not been signified to the respondent.\nPer Band (dissenting): The explosion damage was attributable to the fire which, existing briefly after the initial stages of the accident to the tank, caused the explosion and was a new point of departure in the chain of causation.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Tyndale CJ., and dismissing appellant's action on an insurance policy.\nJ. A. Mann, K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn T. Hackett, K.C. and L. P. Gagnon, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The first point that has to be dealt with, is the question of the appellant's interest. It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the appellant shortly after the institution of the present action, having transferred and assigned to the fire insurance companies, all its rights against the respondent, for and in consideration of the sum of $46,931.28, cannot succeed for lack of interest.\nWith this proposition, I do not agree, as I think that even if the appellant had assigned its rights before the action was started, without the necessary signification being given, it would still have the necessary interest to claim from the respondent.\nThe assignees of the claim did not insure the appellant assignor for damage caused by accident. Their policies covered damage caused by fire, and in this respect they have fulfilled their obligation, by paying to the appellant the full amount of its losses. But they have additionally paid $46,931.28 for the damage caused by an explosion, which the appellant now says is covered by the respondent's policy. Assuming therefore the liability of the defendant, it necessarily follows that the fire insurance companies are not the appellant's insurers for the damage now claimed in the present action.\nWe are not confronted here with the case of an insurance company which, after having paid its own client, victim of an accident, the amount to which the latter is contractually entitled, obtains a subrogation receipt against the tort-feasor. In such a case, there is no doubt that the victim, although having signed a subrogation receipt, may still claim against the author of the damage he has suffered. The legal relations that exist between the victim and the insurer are obviously contractual; those between the victim and the wrongdoer are delictual. They are two entirely different causes of action. It is for his own protection that the victim has paid to obtain compensation, and not for the benefit of the wrongdoer. The latter has no concern with the rights of the insured and the insurance company inter se.\nIn such a case the rights of the victim to sue the author of the tort have been often recognized. Vide (McFee & Co. v. Montreal Transportation Co. 2); (Millard v. Toronto R.W. Co. 3).\nIn Hebert v. Rose 4, the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec held:\u2014\nWhere a certain sum is found to be due for damages caused to an automobile through a collision, an amount received by the plaintiff from an insurance company which had insured his automobile against loss or damage through collision, cannot be deducted from the award.\nAnd later in Coderre v. Douville 5, Mr. Justice Rivard, speaking for the same Court, said:\u2014\nL'appelant va plus loin; il soutient que de demandeur n'a pas le droit aux dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats parce qu'il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9 par la compagnie d'assurance, qu'il y aurait eu subrogation et novation. Les termes de l'acte intervenu entre le demandeur et l'assureur sont clairs; c'est bien une cession de ses droits que Douville a consenti. Dans ce cas, le recours au nom du cr\u00e9ancier contre l'auteur du dommage reste ouvert.\nIn all these cases, the plaintiffs had been paid by their insurers, but this jurisprudence cannot determine the rights of the plaintiff in the case at bar. I have referred to it, merely to point out the entirely different rights of the plaintiff, and to avoid any further confusion on the matter. It may also be said that the amendment to section 2468 C.C. enacted by the Quebec Legislature in 1942 (6 Geo. VI, chap. 68), which says that civil responsibility shall in no way be lessened or altered by the effect of insurance contracts, would cover cases similar to those which I have cited. The object of this section being to confirm the principle established by the Court of Appeal of Quebec, that a wrongdoer may not deduct from the amount of damage he has occasioned, the moneys received by the victim from an insurance company.\nIn the present case, the various fire insurance companies, the transferees of the claim against the respondent, are not insurers against damage originally caused by explosion. They are assignees of a debt which they have bought from the appellant, and therefore, different principles have to be applied.\nThe two relevant sections of the Civil Code are 1570 and 1571. They read as follows:\u2014\n1570. The sale of debts and rights of action against third persons, is perfected between the seller and buyer by the completion of the title, if authentic, or the delivery, of it, if under private signature.\n1571. The buyer has no possession available against third persons, until signification of the act of sale has been made, and a copy of it delivered to the debtor. He may, however, be put in possession by the acceptance of the transfer by the debtor, subject to the special provisions contained in article 2127.\nBetween the appellant and the fire insurance companies, the sale was perfected at the date the relevant document was signed, but it is not contested that a copy of it has never been delivered to the respondent. Of course, this was essential to give the insurance companies \"possession available\" against the respondent, but it is argued that although the assignees could not exercise their rights until the fulfilment of this requirement of the law, the assignor was nevertheless divested of all his rights of ownership, and could not properly bring the present action. If he did so, it would be in violation of section 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which says:\u2014\n81. A person cannot use the name of another to plead, except the Crown through its (recognized officers. It has been said that this theory has received the support of Mr. Justice Cimon in Montreal Loan & Investment Co. v. Plourde 6. But I do not think that such is the case. A perusal of that judgment shows that the plaintiff, the assignor had sold to the assignee a claim against the defendant, but the latter, in lieu of notification, had accepted the assignment. The learned judge rightly decided that the assignee was the only proper party who could claim, haying, on account of the acceptation by the debtor, a \"possession available\" against him. In view of 1571, the assignor was divested of all his rights, and any action taken by him was in the name of \"another\" and contrary to 81 Code C.P.\nBut here, there was no notification, no acceptance, and if, between the seller and the buyer the deed of sale was complete, it was not as to third parties. Until the signification is made, as to third parties, the title remains in the assignor. This is so true, that a garnishee may be served in execution of a judgment against the assignor upon moneys in the hands of the debtor. The former or the assignee will not be allowed to oppose the transfer, if no signification has been made. Vide Aubry & Rau (Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil, Vol. 7, p. 450).\nArticle 1690 of the French Civil Code is similar to section 1571 of the Quebec Code. The French authors are unanimous to accept the theory that until a copy of the deed is served upon the debtor, the title, as to third parties, remains vested in the assignor, who alone may properly bring action to recover the debt.\nTroplong (Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, De la Vente, Vol. 2, 1854, page 457) says:\u2014\nSi la signification eat encore \u00e0 faire, le c\u00e9dant poursuivra le d\u00e9biteur sans que celui-ci puisse lui opposer que, lui c\u00e9dant, il s'est d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 de ses droits. C'est ce qui \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 par arr\u00eat de Ja Cour de Cassation du 4 d\u00e9cembre 1827, portant cassation d'un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Calmer, du 27 ao\u00fbt 1824.\nZachariae (Le Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 4, 1858, pp. 326 and 327) expresses his views as follows:\u2014\nIl y a plus, tant que le cessionnaire n'est pas saisi, le c\u00e9dant lui-m\u00eame peut exiger le paiement sans que le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 puisse lui opposer la cession qu'il en a faite. Aubry & Rau (Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, tome 4, 4th Ed. 1871, p. 434) share the same opinion:\u2014\nQuant au c\u00e9dant, il conserve jusqu'\u00e0 la signification ou acceptation du transport, le droit de faire, tant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du d\u00e9biteur, tous les actes conservatoires de la cr\u00e9ance, et m\u00eame celui d'exercer les actions et poursuites y relatives.\nPlaniol & Ripert (Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 7, 1931, p. 449) also says:\u2014\nPendant l'intervalle qui s\u00e9pare la cession de l'accomplissement de l'une. des formalit\u00e9s de l'article 1690, la cr\u00e9ance qui appartient d\u00e9j\u00e0 au cessionnaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du c\u00e9dant, appartient toujours au c\u00e9dant au regard des tiers.\nAt pages 449 and 450, the same author says:\u2014\nAinsi jusqu'\u00e0 l'acceptation ou \u00e0 la signification, le c\u00e9dant peut poursuivre le d\u00e9biteur ou recevoir paiement.\nAnd on the same page:\u2014\nUne fois la signification ou l'acceptation intervenue, la situation est renvers\u00e9e. Le c\u00e9dant est sorti du rapport d'obligation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de qui que ce soit, le cessionnaire seul se trouve investi de la qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9ancier.\nLaurent (Principes de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, Vol. 24, 3rd Ed. pp. 499 and 500) teaches that:\u2014\nL'article 1690 porte que le cessionnaire n'est saisi \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers que par la signification du transport, ou par l'acceptation que le d\u00e9biteur en a faite dans un acte authentique. De l\u00e0 suit que le c\u00e9dant reste saisi de la cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, malgr\u00e9 le transport qu'il en a fait, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la cession ait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e ou accept\u00e9e. C'est ce que dit Pothier; et quand il dit que le c\u00e9dant n'a point \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la cr\u00e9ance, cela signifie qu'il en reste propri\u00e9taire.\nOn the same page:\u2014\nLe c\u00e9dant reste propri\u00e9taire de la cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, le d\u00e9biteur est un tiers; donc, le c\u00e9dant reste cr\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9biteur est tenu de payer, et il a aussi le droit de payer.\nTo the opinion of these learned authors may also be added, what Mr. Justice Rinfret, now C.J., said in the case of Lamy v. Rouleau 7. Although section 2127 C.C. was there invoked, which is not the case here, there are some principles which have been enunciated in that judgment, which are useful in the determination of the case at bar.\nThe assignor, remaining the creditor cannot be considered as claiming in the name of another, in violation of section 81 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He has the right to sue in his own name, because as to third parties, the title is still vested in him. It is possible that a different situation would arise if even before a formal signification, the assignee instituted proceedings to recover the amount due by the debtor, because in such a case his action would in itself be a sufficient signification of the act of sale, as decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. St. Lawrence Fire Insurance Co. 8, but this is not the case here.\nI have therefore to come to the conclusion that the plain- tiff had a sufficient interest to institute the proceedings that he did.\nDealing now with the second ground of defence that the damage claimed is attributable to fire which is specifically excluded from the policy, and not to an \"accident\" within the meaning of that word contained in the policy, I agree with my brother Locke that it is unfounded.\nThe terms of the policy are as follows:\u2014\nTo pay the Assured far loss on the property of the Assured directly damaged by such accident (or, if the Company so elects, to repair or replace such damaged property), excluding (a) loss from fire (or from the use of water or other means to extinguish fire, (b) loss from an accident caused by fire, (c) loss from delay or interruption of business or manufacturing or process, (d) loss from Jack of power, light, heat, steam or refrigeration, and (e) loss from any indirect result of an accident.\nThe relevant schedule attached to the policy is the following:\u2014\nB. As respects any such unfired vessel, \"Object\" shall mean the cylinder, tank, chest, heater plate or other vessel so described; or, in the case of a described machine having chests, heater plates, cylinders or rolls mounted on or forming ta part of said machine, shall mean the complete group of such vessels including their interconnecting pipes; and shall also include water columns, gauges and safety valves thereon together with their connecting pipes and fittings; but shall not include any inlet or outlet pipes, nor any valves or fittings on such pipes.\nC. As respects any object described in this Schedule, \"Accident\" shall mean a sudden and accidental tearing asunder of the object or any part thereof caused by pressure of steam, air, gas, water or other liquid therein, or the sudden and accidental crushing inward of the object or any part thereof cause by vacuum therein; and shall also mean a sudden and accidental cracking of any cast iron part of the object, if such cracking permits the leakage of said steam, air, gas, water or other liquid, but leakage at valves, fittings, joints or connections shall not constitute an accident.\nIf, therefore, the damage claimed is attributable to fire, which is specifically excluded from the policy, the action must fail. On the other hand, if the damage is the result of an accident within the above definition, and if it is the direct consequence of such accident, the action must succeed and the appeal allowed.\nOn August 2, 1942, in the East Room of the oil mill at the appellant's plant in Montreal, some of the employees were in the process of bleaching turpentine in a tank called Tank No. 1. This tank was normally used for bleaching linseed oil. In the course of these bleaching operations, a \"sizzling\" sound was suddenly heard, coming from Tank No. 1, and which was obviously caused by vapour escaping from the periphery of the manhole door of the tank, and this was followed by the sound of the blowing out of the door under the high pressure of this vapour. The evidence reveals that this vapour in itself was not inflammable, but that it was, when it came in contact with the air. Within a few seconds, a terrible explosion occurred causing to the building extensive damage.\nIt is the contention of the respondent that the loss suffered by the appellant was not a loss directly caused by accident, there being a nova causa that intervened which was fire, and as the respondent is only liable for direct damage caused by an explosion, it therefore denies all liability. The theory is that, although there has been a minor explosion in Tank No. 1, the vapour that escaped from the tank, coming into contact with the air, was ignited by a fire, which was probably an electric spark, and it was only after the intervention of this new cause that the explosion occurred.\nIn order to determine this direct cause, it must be kept in mind, as Lord Dunedin said in Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society 9:\u2014\nIn other words, you seek for the causa proxima, if it is well' understood that the question of which is proxima is not solved by the mere point of order in time.\nIn the same case at page 355, Lord Finlay L.C. said that the determining cause of an accident is what \"in substance\" causes the injury. The damage that may be claimed is the damage which is the \"natural consequence\" of the accident.\nIn Cory v. Burr 10, it is said that the proximate cause is the direct and immediate cause. In Gordon v. Rimming-ton 11, Lord Ellenborough uses \"causa causans\" as the equivalent of proximate cause.\nIt is true that the vapour that escaped from the tank as the result of the explosion, was while floating in the air of the building, suddenly ignited by an electric spark, but I have come to the conclusion that the \"causa causans\" of the damage suffered, what \"in substance\" caused the damage, was the explosion in the tank. The last explosion was the natural sequel, the consequence of the original explosion in the tank, which was the main element of causation,\nIn Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, cited supra, a ship belonging to the appellant was torpedoed, while on a voyage from South America to Le Havre. With the help of tugs the ship reached Le Havre, and she was brought inside the outer breakwater, where she remained for two days, taking the ground at each ebb tide, but floating again with the flood. Finally, her bulkheads gave way, and she sank and became a total loss. It was held that the grounding was not a \"novus casus intervenions\" and that the aggravation of the original injury by the bumping against the quay and the successive groundings, did not convert the partial loss into a total loss. The chain of causation between the injuries caused by the torpedo, and the ultimate sinking of the vessel, was not broken by the series of events which occurred in Le Havre.\nIn the present case, I have come to the conclusion that there was an unbroken sequence between the explosion in Tank No. 1, which is the casualty, and the ultimate loss. There was not an intervening cause, in which was merged the original casualty.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nRand, J. (dissenting):\u2014I take the circumstances of the loss of the appellant's property to be these. The course of escape of gas generated in the tank by the mixture of turpentine and the other substances, as the pressure mounted, was first by way of the small aperture in the manhole door or the vent at the rear, then between the manhole door, forced outward, and the frame, and finally through the manhole when the door was blown off. The sizzling noise was produced in the second stage; and the first explosive sound was the blasting of the door. The gas mixing with the air in the room became combustible and was ignited by a spark probably from an electric mechanism. This burning tended to reach back toward the source of the gas and while its quantity was limited the combustion was relatively slow and presented flames flashing in different directions as it followed the air currents. When the manhole opened the quantity was so great that the rapidity and extent of combustion issued in an explosion. Tongues of flame licked up the thin streams of grayish gas before that point was reached; both gas and flames were seen through both doors by the men working in the adjoining room. There was this fire in the eastern room for a sensible period of' time before the explosion apart from the spark or other source of the original ignition.\nThe passage of that fire into explosion resulted from the sudden access of the gas; if the slow feed or emission had been maintained or if the peak pressure had been reached before the door gave way, there would have been only the fire. In that case it would ordinarily follow that any damage done by it, either through the burning of property insured or by producing other direct effects, would be fire loss.\nWhether the ignition of the gas can be said to have been due to a fire within the meaning of the fire policies ceases, then, to be of importance. There was clearly a secondary stage of fire which superseded the initial cause.\nBefore deducing the legal consequence from the insurance contracts and the facts stated, I venture to point out the distinction between fire damage and damage caused by fire. An insurance against the former looks to the nature of the loss or destruction; it is damage by burning or combustion only. But insurance against damage by fire treats fire as a cause which in the course of its career may set off other agencies, such as explosion, to bring about damage other than fire to be charged against it. The same consideration arises in exceptions from the main risks; and the question is whether the exception is as to the kind of damage or to the consequences of a certain cause. The terms of the policies here are, in this respect, reasonably free from doubt. The parties agree \"respecting loss .\u2026 from an Accident as herein defined to the object described herein.\" The Company \"agrees to pay for loss ' on the property of the assured directly damaged by such Accident .\u2026 excluding (a) loss from fire (or from the use of water or other means to extinguish fire, (b) loss from an accident caused by fire .\u2026 , and (e) loss from any indirect result of an Accident.\" The tank was undoubtedly what is called in schedule 2 an \"unfired vessel\" and an accident to such a vessel was descirbed as \"a sudden and accidental tearing asunder, etc.\" The bulging of the manhole door and its later blasting, was, in my opinion, a rending asunder within that definition.\nThe language \"property .\u2026 directly damaged by such accident\" deals with accident as a casual agency and without more would embrace all loss directly resulting from it: loss \"from fire\" must, I think, be given the same meaning: Stanley v. Western Insurance Company 12; and it is intended to eliminate from the trail of consequences of an accident all those which are to be attributed to the interposition of fire as the efficient factor in a chain of subsequent effects.\nThis may perhaps be clarified by elaboration. The exception is from a liability for an \"accident\" and its results. The \"fire\" must then appear or be involved in those results, otherwise it would be outside the risk assumed; and as the word is used in a causal sense, the exclusion extends to all effects that follow from it as cause: we are to conceive it as a new point of departure, and disregard antecedents. In an ordinary policy against fire, we do not go back for originating causes; what has brought fire about is irrelevant; we take it as if it were a first cause. The same conception is to be given to fire as an exception; when it appears we mark it as a new factor and we are not concerned with what has preceded it. Was it then an actuating agent here? I am bound to say that the answer seems to me to admit of no doubt. It was the flame that set the mixed gases into combustion so great and. rapid as to produce the explosion. Both the gases and the fire were necessary to that reaction, but the fire was the actor in producing it. The problem is not one of abstract or philosophical causal determination; we are endeavouring to ascertain the scope of an exception from a risk assumed, the language of which carries the ordinary and popular sense of these phenomena.\nMr. Mann contends that a fire in other than property-insured producing other causes of damage does not entail liability under a fire policy; from which he concludes that, as one or other of the groups of insurance companies must be bound, the disaster must be attributed to the accident. It was, no doubt, a fact that the gas, as substance or property, was not insured against fire; but in the case of Hobbs v. Guardian Insurance Company 13 approved by the Judicial Committee in Curtis's & Harvey Limited v. North British Company 14, neither was the match or the gunpowder; and yet this Court held that the burning powder was fire so as to carry responsibility for the explosion which ensued. I take this decision to mean that fire as a cause of damage insured against is fire in any form which may by its proximate consequence produce loss to the property insured. That is precisely what we have here. But whether liability arises accordingly on the part of the fire insurers is a matter beyond the issues in these proceedings; it is enough that the fire be within the exception of the respondent's contract.\nThis view differs from that of the Chief Justice at trial in the significance attributed to the flashes of flame previous to the explosion. He considers it too fine a distinction, in relation to the language of the policy, to resolve the developing explosion into stages and to treat the first and second\u2014the ignition and the gas combustion periods\u2014as constituting a \"fire\" existing as such, to be taken as a cause of new consequence. But that depends on the facts and I am unable to interpret them here as not creating an intermediate state of fire, either of the original gases or in the initial stages of the explosion. Time is significant and explosion was not necessarily involved in the burning gases. The minutes or even seconds which elapsed marked a period not of explosion but of a state of things that, in combination with new elements, led to explosion; the impact of the mass of gas upon the floating fire was the same as the contact of the burning match with the powder in Hobbs, supra, and likewise the development of the burning mass into explosion.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellant at the trial recovered from the respondent under an accident policy for that portion of loss attributed to an explosion. This judgment was reversed upon appeal 15 and the appellant (plaintiff) further appeals to this Court.\nOn August 2, ,1942, the appellant in its linseed oil mill in the City of Montreal was filtering turpentine. A No. 1 steam-jacketted bleacher tank (hereinafter referred to as \"the tank\") was used as part of the apparatus. This tank was located with other equipment, including motors and dynamos, in the east room on the top or third floor of the mill. 850 gallons of discoloured turpentine were poured into this tank, the steam turned into its jacket at a temperature of 145\u00b0 to 160\u00b0F. Then 200 lbs. of \"filtrol\" and 50 lbs. of \"filter cel\" were placed in the tank and the agitator therein operated for half to three-quarters of an hour. It is established that this operation of the agitator in the contents of that tank would generate enough heat and pressure to first push the door and permit some vapour to escape through the periphery with a hissing or sizzling noise and then as the pressure was building up rapidly to quickly blow the door open releasing a large quantity of vapour.\nIn the room adjoining and to the west was other equipment including the filter presses. The men in charge were not satisfied with the turpentine coming through and gathered around the filter presses. In that position they heard a hissing or sizzling noise. One saw \"fumes or vapour, then saw fire,\" another \"saw a big flash like fire\" and a third was not sure whether he saw flames or fumes in the doorway connecting these east and west rooms. The men all hurried to the fire escape. As they reached the fire escape they heard a \"boom\" which is accepted as that of the door being blown off the tank. Then as they proceeded down the fire escape they heard an explosion which damaged the roof, walls and windows and which generally disturbed the entire structure. The fire followed and the total loss incurred was about $159,724.62. The companies holding the fire insurance have paid that part admittedly caused by fire, but the balance of $45,791.38 is that which resulted from the explosion and which in this appeal the appellant claims under the terms of the accident policy.\nThe evidence is to the effect that as the vapours escaped through the periphery they were ignited by contact with something in that room, probably an electric switch, motor or dynamo. Whatever it was is described in the proceedings as unidentified, and the fire thus caused was seen by the men as they hurried to the fire escape. One of the experts stated:\u2014\nIf you have a tank, such as in this case, which is generating vapors quite rapidly and filling alleyways that are 25 or 50 feat long and many feet wide and many feet high full of an inflammable mixture of turpentine vapors and air, it would be a miracle if they did not explode.\nIt is further explained that these explosions occur in three stages:\nIn the first stage a flame moves through the explosive mixture at a slow, more or less uniform rate of speed. In the second stage the speed of the flame increases, and the flame may oscillate backwards and forwards in the explosive mixture, and there may be turbulence or a mixing up of the gases in the mixture, and finally there is the third stage in which 'the flame is accelerated in velocity to a great speed and there is usually a loud report and this is the stage termed detonation.\nAnd further:\nWhen an explosive mixture is ignited, a flame forms and moves slowly through the explosive mixture. This slow movement may last for from a fraction of a second to several seconds or minutes, and the rate of velocity usually is from one foot to ten feet per second.\nThe policy insured the appellant in respect of a loss from an accident to an object. The tank is enumerated among the objects covered by the policy and the blowing off of its door constituted a \"sudden and accidental tearing asunder\" of the object and therefore an accident within the meaning of the policy.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that when the large volume of vapor escaped as a consequence of the \"tearing asunder\" the explosion followed as a direct cause therefrom, while on the other hand, the respondent contends that the explosion was due to the fire. Sec. 1 of the policy requires the company:\nTo pay the assured for loss on the property of the Assured directly damaged by such accident \u2026 excluding\n(a) loss from fire (or from the use of water or other means to extinguish fire),\n(b) loss from an accident caused by fire,\n* * *\n(e) loss from any indirect result of an accident.\nThe appellant under the terms of the foregoing sec. 1 in order to recover must adduce evidence establishing that the loss or damage to its property was the direct or proximate cause of the accident. McGillivray, Insurance Law, 2nd Ed., p. 811; Becker, Gray & Co. v. London Assurance Corp. 16. The particular loss we are here concerned with arises out of an explosion the loss or damage from which was not by the terms of the policy specially excluded. The respondent to bring this explosion within the exclusion clause (a) must therefore establish that it was directly or proximately caused by a fire. The issue between the parties is, in these circumstances, what was the direct or proximate cause of this explosion,\u2014the accident or the fire? The position is therefore somewhat similar to that in Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Society 17, where the appellants contended the ship was lost by a \"peril of the sea\", while the respondents contended the loss was caused by torpedoing for which under the policy they were not liable because of a warranty \"from all consequences of hostilities or warlike operations.\" Lord Dunedin, at p. 363, stated as follows:\nBut the moment that the two clauses have to be construed together it becomes vital to determine under which expression it falls. The solution will always lie in settling as a question of fact which of the two causes was what I will venture to call (though I shrink from the multiplication of epithets) the dominant cause of the two. In other words, you seek for the causa proxima, if it is well understood that the question of which is proxima is not solved by the mere point of order in time.\nIn order to have an explosion of the type here in question there must be an inflammable or explosive mixture and it must be ignited. In this case that explosive mixture was the turpentine vapour and the air; it was ignited and in that sense there was a fire.\nEverything happened in a very short space of time. The \"tearing asunder\" of the door released at first a quantity and almost immediately a large volume of turpentine vapour into the room. Without the release of the vapour there would have been no explosion. The \"tearing asunder\" of the door which released such a volume of vapour would appear to have been the direct or proximate cause of the explosion. The presence of the air and ignition were necessary and in that sense causes of the explosion. Seldom, if ever, does an explosion, fire or accident result from one cause. The law, from all the causes leading up to a result, selects that which is direct or proximate and regards all the others as remote. The direct or proximate cause may not be the last, or, indeed, that in any specified place in the list of causes but is the one which has been variously described as the \"effective\", the \"dominant\" or \"the cause without which\" the loss or damage would not have been suffered. In Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Society, supra, the torpedoing of the ship was, though not the last cause, that which was held to be the direct or proximate cause. Lord Atkinson at p. 366 stated:\nIt is quite true that in the efforts to salve the cargo and the ship her injuries may have been aggravated, but none the less, in my opinion, was the 'loss the direct and immediate consequence of the torpedoing.\nIn Canada Rice Mills Ltd. v. Union Marine and General Insurance Co. 18, a cargo of rice was damaged by heating. The jury found that the rice was damaged by heating caused by the closing of the cowl ventilators and hatches from time to time during the voyage, and it was held that this was a reasonable precaution, having regard to weather conditions. The policy covered \"perils of the sea.\" The main contest was whether the proximate cause was the \"peril of the sea\" or the closing of the cowl ventilators and hatches. Lord Wright stated at p. 71:\nBut it is now established by such authorities as Leyland Shipping Co. v. Norwich Union Fire Society, (1918) A.C. 350, and many others, that causa proxima in insurance law does not necessarily mean the cause last in time, but what is \"in substance\" the cause, per Lard Finlay (Ibid. 355), or the cause \"to be determined by common-sense principles,\" per Lord Dunedin, (Ibid. 362). The same rule has been reiterated by the House of Lords several times since then, most strikingly, perhaps, in P. Samuel & Co. v. Dumas, (1924) A.C. 431 \u2026 Their Lordships agree with this expression of 'opinion, and accordingly are prepared to hold that the damage to the rice, which the jury have found to be due to action necessarily and reasonably taken to prevent the peril of the sea affecting the goods, is a loss due to the peril of the sea and is recoverable as such. The foregoing is on the basis that there was a fire within the meaning of the policy. In view of the conclusion arrived at, it is unnecessary to deal with the important question whether the fire was actually a fire within the meaning of the policy or a part of the explosion.\nThe circumstances surrounding the payment to the appellant by the fire insurance companies of the amount here claimed are such as not to deprive the appellant of an interest sufficient to initiate and carry on these proceedings. Upon this issue I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Taschereau with which I fully agree.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nLocke, J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench for Quebec (Appeal Side) which allowed an appeal by the respondent insurance company from a judgment of Tyndale, J. which had condemned the respondent to pay the sum of $45,791.38 loss occasioned by an explosion on the appellant's premises. Letourneau, C.J., dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.\nBy the insuring agreement in question, the respondent company agreed with the appellant \"respecting loss (excluding loss of the kind described in section II and including loss of the kind described in section IV) from an accident as herein defined to an object described herein occurring during the policy period \"inter alia to pay the assured for loss on the property of the assured directly damaged by such accident (or if the Company so elects to repair or replace such damaged property) excluding (a) loss from fire (or from the use of water or other means to extinguish fires), (b) loss from an accident caused by fire, (c) loss from delay or interruption of business or manufacturing or process, (d) loss from lack of power, light, heat, steam or refrigeration, and (e) loss from any indirect result of an accident.\" By a schedule to the policy the unfired vessels covered were certain objects designated in a further schedule and included a steam jacketed bleacher tank situate in the East room on the third floor of the appellant's factory in Montreal and as respecting any object described in the schedule \"accident\" was declared to mean:\nA sudden and accidental tearing asunder of the object or any part thereof caused by pressure of steam, air, gas, water or other liquid therein or the sudden and accidental crushing inward of the object or any part thereof caused by a vacuum therein; and shall also mean a sudden and accidental cracking of any east iron part of the object if such cracking permits the leakage of said steam, air, gas, water or other liquid, but leakage at valves, fittings, joints or connections shall not constitute an accident.\nThe limit of liability for any such accident to one of the designated objects was $50,000.00.\nWhile it is admitted that there was an accident to the steam jacketed bleacher tank above referred to which was followed by an explosion and by fire, there is disagreement as to just what constituted the accident. Stated briefly the facts are that on August 2nd, 1942, during the currency of the policy the bleacher tank was being used by the appellant company for bleaching a quantity of turpentine for the first time. Theretofore it had been used only for the purpose of bleaching linseed oil and it was attempted to bleach turpentine in the same manner. The process involved placing a quantity of turpentine in the tank together with Fuller's earth and a substance called Filter Cel, heating the mixture mechanically. This work was undertaken apparently without a proper appreciation of the danger involved: the effect of the process was to build up a very heavy pressure within the vessel which first loosened the manhole door of the tank permitting an escape of a quantity of vapour, and then blew off the door permitting the escape of a larger quantity. According to the witnesses who were in the adjoining room on the third floor of the factory, they first heard a hissing or sizzling noise which the learned trial judge considered to have been caused by the vapour escaping from around the periphery of the manhole door which had been loosened by the pressure, and this was followed closely by the sound of the door being blown out by the pressure of the vapour. It was within a matter of seconds thereafter that the explosion occurred, causing the shattering of the upper part of the building in respect of which the appellant's claim is made. While a fire followed which did extensive damage to the appellant's premises the resulting loss, liability for which on the part of the respondent was excluded by the policy, was covered by fire insurance policies and no question arises as to this.\nThere was conflict in the evidence of the foreman and some of the other workmen who were in the room adjoining that in which the tank was situate as to whether any fire was visible before the explosion occurred. The appellant's foreman said that after hearing the sizzling noise caused by the escape of the vapour from the tank, he saw a flash \"like a shot of lightning\" and immediately shouted to the men to get out, and this was followed by the noise undoubtedly caused by the door being blown off the tank and this promptly by the explosion, the whole sequence of events lasting, according to him, a very few seconds. Others who were present did not see this, but the point is not of importance in view of the fact that the learned trial judge accepted the evidence of Dr. Lipsett and Dr. Lortie, expert witnesses called by the appellant that a flame would undoubtedly be present in the explosive mixture formed by the mingling of the turpentine vapour with the atmosphere before the actual detonation. According to these witnesses, an explosion of this kind, where the mixture is not closely contained within a vessel occurs in three stages: in the first, a flame moves through the explosive mixture at a slow rate of speed, in the second the speed of the flame increases and it may oscillate backward and forward in the explosive mixture and there may be turbulence or a mixing up of the gases, and finally a third stage in which the flame is accelerated in velocity to a great speed and there is usually a loud report, this being termed detonation. The source of the ignition of the mixture however was not shown. Various possible explanations were given by Dr. Lipsett who said that a mixture of turpentine vapours and air such as was present here can be ignited by a source of ignition that is at 584\u00b0 Fahrenheit and that a piece of iron at that temperature, which would be far below red heat, could ignite it. This witness said that the manhole door might have become heated up beyond that temperature during the chemical reaction in the tank, but that there were many other possibilities, one of the common causes of ignition of inflammable vapours being sparks from electric motors or from switches or machinery or naked lights and that if there is a large volume of inflammable vapour mixed with the air and set loose in a room, it will usually find a source of ignition. As he expressed it where the vapour was released under the circumstances here existing, it would have been a miracle if it did not explode. The learned trial judge found that the source of the ignition of the vapour was not proven.\nIt is the contention of the respondent that the only-accident was the blowing off of the manhole door and that before this had occurred there was a fire burning in the explosive mixture caused by the mingling of the turpentine vapour which had theretofore escaped from the tank with the atmosphere and that accordingly the loss was \"from fire\" within the meaning of the exception. It was shown by the evidence that after the turpentine, Fuller's earth and Filter Cel had been placed in the tank, steam had been admitted into the jacket surrounding it under pressure to bring the temperature of the mixture up to 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Tests conducted with a similar mixture by Dr. Lipsett disclosed that when these ingredients were heated to this temperature a chemical reaction started which evolved heat, the temperature of the turpentine and the other materials rising at first slowly until a temperature of about 250\u00b0 Fahrenheit was reached when the reaction became more vigorous and at 315\u00b0 Fahrenheit the turpentine began to boil, producing the vapours which the witness considered had built up the pressure in the tank which he estimated would have risen to 50 or 60 pounds to the square inch. The manhole door was held closed by a retaining arm which was in turn held in place by bolts passing through lugs on each side of the door. These bolts were shown to have been 3\" in diameter and about 9\" in length, and tests conducted by Dr. Lipsett showed that with a pressure such as would have been exerted upon the interior of the door such a bolt bent almost 1\" and it was the opening caused by the forcing out of the manhole door permitted by the bending of the bolts or one of them that Dr. Lipsett considered to have been the vent through which the first vapours escaped, causing the hissing noise heard by the witnesses. The tank itself was designed to withstand a pressure of 75 pounds, and according to the witness Hazen would withstand about six times that amount but less than this was necessary to force the manhole door partially open. Hazen agreed with Dr. Lipsett that the sides of the door were forced out or lifted by the pressure produced by the vapour and it is apparent that this could occur only if the arm or the bolts fastening it were bent or forced outward. The learned trial judge has found that the sequence of events after the first escape of the turpentine vapour was that it became ignited in some unknown manner, a flash or flame being visible in the vapour, the manhole door then blew off and the explosion followed. The definition of \"accident\" speaks of a \"sudden and acci- dental tearing asunder of the object or any part thereof.\" The word \"tearing\" is not, I think; one which would commonly be used to describe the shattering of or the distortion of metals which would bend upon the application of sufficient force. It should be interpreted, however, in my opinion, to include a forcing asunder of parts of the object brought about as in the present case by the application of pressure upon the bolt or bolts sufficient to bend them, and forcing the manhole door out of its seating in the wall of the tank, permitting the escape of the vapour. In my opinion, the forcing out of the manhole door and the bending of the bolt or bolts which permitted this and the subsequent blowing off of the door should be treated as the accident and not the latter occurrence alone.\nThe damage in respect of which the claim is made was not caused by burning. Against this risk the appellant was insured, and the insurance companies have paid the loss. For the appellant it was urged before us that the expression \"loss from fire\" should be construed as meaning loss from burning only, but I think this contention cannot be sustained and that loss of which fire is the proximate cause is included in the exception. \"Loss from fire\" in my opinion is not to be construed differently than if the words were \"loss caused by fire\" and these words have always been construed as relating to the proximate cause. Coxe v. Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation Limited 19, Scrutton, J. The expression \"proximate cause\" as pointed out by Lord Sumner in Becker, Gray and Company v. London Assurance Corporation 20 is not an ideal way of expressing what is intended: he considered that \"direct cause\" would be a better expression. In Leyland Shipping Company Limited v. Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society Limited 21, Lord Dunedin, in deciding which of two asserted causes had caused the loss of the vessel, said that the solution lay in deciding what was the dominant cause of the two. It was expressed by Lord Wright, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Canada Rice Mills Ltd. v. Union Marine and General Insurance Company Limited 22 as what is \"in substance\" the cause. As pointed out by Lord Shaw in the Leyland Shipping case, (supra), to treat the proximate cause as if it was the cause which is proximate in time is out of the question; the cause which is truly proximate is that which is proximate in efficiency.\nThe law applicable to the matter appears to me to be accurately stated in Welford's Accident Insurance, 2nd Ed., 178 where the learned author says:\u2014\nThe operation of the doctrine of proximate cause is not affected by the number of causes that may intervene between the peril and the loss. Thus, a scratch may produce septicaemia which develops into septic pneumonia resulting in death. Nevertheless the death is caused proximately by the scratch. In these cases though the loss is not the immediate result of the operation of the peril upon the subject matter of insurance, there is nevertheless no break in the chain of causation which leads through a succession of causes directly from the peril to the loss. They are so intimately connected the one with the other that but for the operation of the peril the loss would not have happened. The relation of cause and effect is therefore established between them, the intermediate causes are themselves brought into existence by the peril and constitute the instruments by which it produces its ultimate result.\nAnd again at page 184:\u2014\nIf there is a causal connection between the peril and the loss, the excepted cause being merely a link in the chain of causation inasmuch as it is a reasonable and probable consequence of the peril, the peril is the cause of the loss within the meaning of the policy.\nThe doctrine of proximate cause is common to all branches of insurance (Welford & Otter-Barry on Fire Insurance, 4th Ed., 259). In the Leyland Shipping case, the steamship Ikaria had been torpedoed by a German submarine off the coast of France: the vessel succeeded in making her way into the port of Havre and was taken alongside the quay in the outer harbour. When a gale sprang up, causing her to bump against the quay the harbour authorities ordered her to a berth inside the outer breakwater where she was moored and remained for two days, taking the ground at each ebb tide but floating again with the flood. Finally her bulkheads gave way and she sank and became a total loss. The policy sued upon covered loss by perils of the sea, but contained a warranty against all consequences of hostilities, and the action failed. The repeated grounding of the vessel at ebb tide and the floating again with the flood was admittedly the immediate cause of the bulkheads giving way and the sinking of the vessel, but it was held that the torpedoing of the ship was the proximate cause. Barclay, J., in his reasons for judgment on the appeal in this matter, has said that while the policy insured against the risk of direct damage, the subsequent exclusion of fire would seem to exclude fire even if it was a direct cause of the loss, and considered that the decision in Stanley v. Western Insurance Company 23 applied. But here the loss claimed for is not damage by burning but by the shattering of the premises by explosion. In the Stanley case liability for damage by explosion was excluded, and it was accordingly held that there could be no recovery. Here there is no such exclusion. I agree that loss of which fire is the direct or proximate cause is excluded, but in my view the loss was not so caused.\nIn the present case it was the application of heat by the introduction of steam under pressure into the jacket surrounding the tank heating the contained mixture and producing the turpentine vapours, the pressure of which first loosened and then blew off the manhole door and it was this accident which was the effective cause of the explosion and the resulting damage. I agree with the learned trial judge that there was no break in the chain of causation which led through a succession of causes directly from the peril insured against to the loss. The flash or flame produced by the ignition of the inflammable vapours was undoubtedly a causa sine qua non, as was the grounding of the vessel in the Leyland case caused by the action of the tide, but this was, in my opinion, one of the two intermediate causes, i.e. the mingling of the turpentine vapour with the atmosphere producing the highly explosive mixture and its ignition from the unknown source brought into existence by the peril insured against and not, therefore, the causa proxima. I find nothing in the decision of this Court in Hobbs v. Guardian Assurance Co. 24, to assist the contention of the respondent: there the insurance was against loss or damage by fire and fire was found upon the evidence to have been the proximate cause of the damage.\nIt was contended in argument before us that the onus was upon the respondent to prove at the trial that the explosive mixture had been ignited by fire and that this had not been done, and further that in any event the flash or flame observed by some of the witnesses prior to the explosion was not a fire within the meaning of that expression as used in the policy but, in view of my conclusion that fire was not the proximate cause of the loss, it appears to me unnecessary to deal with either question.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Taschereau and I agree with his conclusion that the assignments given by the plaintiff to the various fire insurance companies after the commencement of the action, of which no notice was given to the respondent, do not affect its status to sue.\nIt was further contended for the respondent that in any event it was liable only for a portion of the loss. This is based upon the fact that the appellant carried at the time of the loss insurance with the Associated Reciprocal Exchanges which covered direct loss or damage by explosion, subject to certain conditions and exclusions, one of these relating to \"pressure containers\". As to this, I agree with the learned trial judge.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the judgment at the trial restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett & Mitchell.\n1 Q.R.

To do so would amount, in effect, to a declining of jurisdiction. APPEAL, by leave of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, from a decision of that Board authorizing, upon application, an interim increase in freight rates and postponing final determination of the said application pending the General Freight Rates Inquiry, the report of the Royal Commission on Transportation and its consideration by Parliament. The appeal is on the following questions which in the opinion of the Board involved questions of law:\n1. Is it the duty of the Board of Transport Commissioners under the Railway Act, upon application by the railway companies subject to its jurisdiction, to determine whether and to what extent an increase in freight rates should be authorized because of changing conditions or cost of transportation?\n2. If so, did the Board fail to perform that duty in respect of the application of the Railway Association of Canada dated July 27, 1948, for authority to make a general advance of 20 per cent in freight rates, when by its Judgment dated September 20, 1949, it postponed the final determination of the said application until the investigations, studies and determination of the several matters referred to in the said Judgment have been completed?\nC.

If so, did the Board fail to perform that duty in respect of the application of the Railway Association of Canada dated July 27, 1948, for authority to make a general advance of 20 per cent in freight rates, when by its Judgment dated September 20, 1949, it postponed the final determination of the said application until the investigations, studies and determinations of the several matters referred to in the said Judgment have been completed?\nBy a judgment of the 30th of March, 1948, made upon an application by the Railway Association of Canada on behalf of the railways subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament, the Board authorized a general increase in freight rates of 21 per cent, the majority judgment expressing the view that the increased rates would give the present appellant, at the end of the fiscal year, 1948, a small surplus on its transportation operations. This view was based upon the assumption that operating results in 1948 would be approximately the same as had been experienced in 1947.\nOn the 27th of July, 1948, the railways, having in the meantime been called upon to pay higher wages to their employees, filed with the Board an application for authority to make a further general advance of 20 per cent in the then existing freight rates and alleged that the increase in wage rates alone would effect an increase in the annual operating expenses of the appellant of some twenty-seven million dollars. The railways also asked for authority to make an interim increase of 15 per cent pending the final determination by the Board of the application for a permanent increase, but they consented to the deferring of the final determination on the condition that the application for this interim increase should be set down for summary hearing at a date agreeable to the Board during the month of September next and that \"judgment thereon shall have been given by the Board.\" These terms not having been met, this consent was subsequently withdrawn and the application for an interim allowance pending disposition of the main application need not be further considered.\nMeantime, on the 7th of April, 1948, P.C. 1487 had been passed, directing the Board to undertake a general freight rates investigation. Meantime also, the provinces, in September 1948, had launched an appeal to the Gover- nor-in-Council from the judgment of the 30th of March, 1948, and applied to the Board to stay its hearing of the new application of the railways, pending the disposition of this appeal. The appeal was disposed of by Order in Council P.C. 4678 of the 12th of October, 1948, by which the Board was directed to consider the complaints which were the subject matter of the appeal, concurrently with the application of the railways.\nFurther, while the application of the railways was still pending, the Board, having fixed January 11, 1949, to hear it, the Governor-in-Council by P.C. 6033 of December 29, 1948, appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into and report upon all questions of economic policy within the jurisdiction of Parliament arising out of the operation and maintenance of national transportation, including such matters as guidance to the Board in general freight rates revision, competitive rates, international rates, etc., review of the Railway Act and recommendation of amendments; review of the capital structure of the Canadian National Railway Company; review of present day accounting methods and statistical procedure of railways in Canada; and review of the results achieved under the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act, 1933, and amendments. It was however, expressly provided:\nThat the scope of this Commission shall not extend to the performance of functions which, under the Railway Act, are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nHearing of the review directed by P.C. 4678 and the application of the railways was concluded by the Board on the 5th of April, 1949, and judgment was delivered on the 20th of September following. The judgment of the majority delivered by the Chief Commissioner, and concurred in by Mr. Commissioner Chase, granted a general interim increase in freight rates of 8 per cent and increases in rates on coal and coke of 8 cents per ton. The judgment concluded as follows:\nWhen the investigations, studies and determinations of the several matters hereinbefore referred to have been completed the Board will notify the applicants and respondents of the date and place of hearing to consider further evidence and representations respecting this application.\nAs will subsequently be shown, the above paragraph amounted to a declaration that the Board declined to pass upon the application for increased rates until after the Royal Commission had concluded its hearings and made its report and, \"possibly\", until any amendments to existing legislation which might be recommended had been dealt with by Parliament, and also until the general freight rates investigation, which the Board itself was directed to undertake by P.C. 1487, had been concluded. These matters might very well occupy a considerable period of time and, apart from the general freight rates investigation to be conducted by the Board itself, these matters involved investigations by bodies in no way related to the Board. Appellant contends that, while no one would argue that the Board could not properly adjourn proceedings pending before it from time to time as might be necessary in order to dispose of them properly, as indeed the Board is expressly authorized to do by section 45 (2) of the statute, it may not make an order such as that here in question amounting to a refusal to function altogether, pending the occurrence of matters which are entirely irrelevant to the discharge by the Board itself of the duty incumbent upon it under the provisions of the Railway Act.\nOn the part of the respondents, it is conceded that the first question should be answered in the affirmative and also that in so far as the postponement is conditioned upon amendment by Parliament to existing law, the judgment is in error. It is contended, however, that apart from this consideration the Board was entitled to take the other matters into consideration and base its decision to postpone thereon.\nWe proceed to deal with the meaning and effect of\nWhen the investigations, studies and determinations of the several matters hereinbefore referred to have been completed\nin the concluding paragraph of the judgment.\nIt was made to appear before the Board that there had been an advance in wages paid by the railways since March, 1948, of 17 cents per hour. The learned Chief Commissioner said that evidence had not been furnished to show what portion, if any, of this increase in labour costs was proper and necessary. In his opinion the question of increased labour costs had been most inadequately dealt with, both in the evidence and in argument,\nand therefore before any final decision is given on this application the applicants will be afforded an opportunity to supplement the evidence and argument already before us in this regard. By itself this is no doubt unobjectionable. It is merely to say that when the parties are ready to deal with the point the Board would hear them. However, this does not stand by itself but must be taken with the other \"matters\" to which we shall refer, all of which are governed by the final paragraph of the judgment, under which, when all such matters are \"completed\" the Board will then proceed. In the meantime the Board will not deal with the application before it.\nAnother \"matter\" was the contention put forward on behalf of the Canadian National Railways that any increase in freight rates should substantially meet the requirements, not only of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had been taken somewhat as the yardstick heretofore, but also of the National Railways. With respect to this the Chief Commissioner says:\n\u2026 I am of opinion that the final determination respecting this application must (the italics are mine) await the findings of the Royal Commission on Transportation, and possibly the implementation of certain of those recommendations.\nWith reference to the evidence directed toward establishing a rate base, the judgment says, inter alia,\nIt may very well be that the proper basis for establishing freight rates in this country should follow a revision of the capital structure of the Canadian National Railways and the appropriate statutory direction to this Board as to freight rates based on that valuation. It is not open to the Board at present to adopt such a course. Therefore it is all the more important that no final determination be made respecting this application at the present time.\nIf this means (and it is open to such a construction) that in the view of the majority no decision on the pending application could, nor would, be given until Parliament should have acted with respect to these matters, this would be, in our opinion, a ground of decision entirely irrelevant. If this is not the meaning of the language, then this particular matter has no bearing on the present appeal.\nThe learned Chief Commissioner refers to a number of other matters as reasons why his decision \"should authorize an interim increase only.\" In the context of the judgment this language can only mean that by reason of these considerations the majority decline to pass on the main application. The first of these matters is the ques- tion of economy in carrying out the Canadian National-Canadian Pacific Act of 1933. As to this the judgment says:\nAt the present time it is beyond the Board's jurisdiction to inquire into that question but I find again that one of the matters referred to the Royal Commission on Transportation in P.C. 6033 is that it \"Review and report on the results achieved under '(the above statute)' making such recommendations as the present situation warrants.\"\nAnother matter under this head was the objection of the respondents to the principle of horizontal increases. The judgment states that the Board is not in a position to \"give a final determination\" with respect to the question because of the fact that it was a matter to be dealt with by the Board in conducting the general freight rates investigation directed by P.C. 1487.\nThe third matter under this head was the question of maintenance costs and \"deferred maintenance.\" As to these the judgment says that\u2014\nthe question of proper maintenance costs as well as that of deferred maintenance will require further study by the Board in the light of additional information and accounting procedure which may flow from the recommendations of the Royal Commission \u2026\nFrom these references it is apparent that the postponement is until the General Freight Rates Inquiry (to be conducted by the Board itself), the report of the Royal Commission on Transportation, and probably (but perhaps not so clearly), the consideration by Parliament of that report, have all come to pass.\nIn our opinion if anything involved in these matters was relevant to a determination of the application of the railways and the review of the 21 per cent judgment ordered by P.C. 4678, it was for the Board itself to make its own determination and it was not competent to the Board to await the investigation of such matters by some other body or the passing by Parliament of some future legislation with respect to them. Such a decision involves, in our opinion, a declining of jurisdiction.\nThe Board of Transport Commissioners is not only an administrative body but a court of record and it has, in addition to any other power or authority, \"full jurisdiction to inquire into, hear and determine any application by or on behalf of any party interested,\n(b) requesting the Board to make any order, or give any direction, leave, sanction or approval, which by law it is authorized to make or give, or with respect to any matter, act or thing, which by this Act, or the Special Act, is prohibited, sanctioned or required to be done. Sec. 33(1) (b).\nThis jurisdiction the Board is bound to exercise.\nIn Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford 1, a case dealing with the nature and extent of duty imposed upon The Lord Bishop under an English statute couched in permissive terms, the Lord Chancellor, Earl Cairns, had occasion to review a number of pertinent authorities, among which was The King v. Havering-atte-Bower 2. In that case a power granted by royal charter to the steward and suitors of a manor giving them authority to hear and determine civil suits was under consideration. It was held that this was in effect the establishment of a court for the public benefit and that the stewards and suitors of the manor had no discretion but were bound to hold the court. Lord Cairns at page 225 of the Julius case expressed himself as to the principle involved as follows:\n\u2026 where a power is deposited with a public officer for the purpose of being used for the benefit of persons who are specifically pointed out, and with regard to whom a definition is supplied by the Legislature of the conditions upon which they are entitled to call for its exercise, that power ought to be exercised, and the Court will require it to be exercised.\nIn the same case Lord Penzance said:\nIn all these instances the Courts decided that the power conferred was one which, was intended by the Legislature to be exercised; and that although the statute in terms had only conferred a power, the circumstances were such as to create a duty. In other words, the conclusion arrived at by the Courts in these cases was this\u2014that regard being had to the subject-matter\u2014to the position and character of the person empowered\u2014to the general objects of the statute\u2014and, above all, to the position and rights of the person, or class of persons, for whose benefit the power was conferred, the exercise of any discretion by the person empowered could not have been intended.\nIt was the view of all the members of the House in that case that while words which are permissive do not of themselves do more than confer a faculty or power, nevertheless, to quote The Lord Chancellor at page 222:\n\u2026 there may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done, something in the object for which it is to be done, something in the conditions under which it is to be done, something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty, and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed, to exercise that power when called upon to do so.\nIn our opinion to postpone passing upon a matter by-reason of matters which are entirely irrelevant to the proper discharge of the duty placed upon the Board under the statute to decide these matters for itself amounts in effect to a refusal to function. It is no answer to say, as the respondents did, that it was always open to the railways to make a further application. In the face of the present judgment no one can doubt what would be the answer to such an application.\nThe injustice to the appellants by reason of the judgment here in question can best be illustrated by a reference to the earlier judgment delivered by the learned Chief Commissioner on April 23, 1949, in Province of British Columbia v. C.P.R., C.N.R., et al 3. That was an application by the province of British Columbia for an order directing the railways to remove from the freight tolls the so-called \"mountain differential.\" In the course of his judgment the learned Chief Commissioner, with whom Mr. Commissioner MacPherson agreed, said at 225:\nOn behalf of the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and on behalf of the City of Winnipeg and the Winnipeg Board of Trade it was urged that the removal of the mountain differential should not be made prior to a, general freight rate inquiry and study in Canada. Such an inquiry and study is now in progress. It will take much time to complete. As a result of that inquiry and study, and that being made by the Royal Commission on Transportation, it is possible that amendments to the Railway Act will have to be considered by Parliament before results of that study and the recommendations of the Royal Commission can be made effective. I see no reason why the Province of British Columbia before receiving the relief it seeks in this application should have to await the results of the study made by this Board and the Royal Commission.\n* * * *\nFor the reasons already given I cannot, and do not subscribe to the doctrine which would involve perpetuating an injustice clearly established, until some date in the future when the General Freight Rates Inquiry will be concluded.\nWith respect, there can be no difference in principle between a refusal to postpone consideration of an application on behalf of a province to reduce railway rates and a refusal to deal with an application by the railways for increased rates, the ground of decision being in each case the same. If there is injustice in the one case (and we respectfully agree with the learned Chief Commissioner that there would have been) there is the same injustice in the other. In granting a measure of relief, as it did by its interim order of 8 per cent, the Board concedes that the railways had made out a case for relief. The error lies in failing to proceed to determine the extent to which the interim relief granted was adequate or inadequate on the basis of the case made.\nWe think therefore the principle of the decision in Maxwell v. Keun 4, applies and that the majority judgment was such that injustice would be done by the order here in question were it to stand. To adopt the language of Cozens-Hardy M.R., in Sackville West v. Attorney-General 5, followed in Maxwell's case, the learned Chief Commissioner \"failed to see that such would be the effect of his decision.\"\nNo doubt in deciding on \"adjournments\" the Board may and must exercise its discretion having regard to circumstances, but the general language of section 45(2) does not permit of that discretion being exercised with regard to irrelevant matters such as formed the grounds of postponement in the case at bar. As was said by Lord Esher M.R., in the Queen v. Vestry of St. Pancras 6:\nIf people who have to exercise a public duty by exercising their discretion take into account matters which the courts consider not to be proper for the guidance of their discretion, than in the eye of the law they have not exercised their discretion.\nThe decision in Canadian National Railways v. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. 7, contrasted with that in Great Western Railway v. Chamber of Shipping 8, illustrates the point.\nWhile the question before this Court is not the soundness or otherwise of any view expressed in the judgment as to the manner in which any of those matters should finally be dealt with by the Board, but merely whether the Board erred in refusing to determine those matters on the present application, counsel for the respondent asked that the court should deal with these matters, if it saw fit, to \"prevent further wrangling before the Board.\" It may therefore not be irrelevant to refer to one matter, namely, the view expressed by the learned Chief Commissioner with respect to increased labour costs. This increase in wages on the part of the appellant followed upon an advance of this amount made by Canadian National Railways. The learned Chief Commissioner in his judgment does not say what further could or should have been done by the railways to establish the \"propriety and necessity\" of the increase, nor can we. Although the respondent provinces on the appeal before us attempted to support the view expressed of the majority, they did not take that point before the Board and were equally at a loss to suggest before us what further could have been done by the railways. Such a stand is therefore difficult to understand. We desire to add, however, that nothing in the above must be taken as indicating that in our view, any more than in that of the learned Chief Commissioner, proof of increased wages even though \"fair, reasonable and necessary\" must, without more, necessarily or automatically result in the authorization of increased freight rates. While a very important element, it is only one of the relevant circumstances which would have to be considered.\nWe therefore certify our opinion to the Board in the affirmative in answer to each of the questions asked. While there is jurisdiction under section 52(8) to award costs, it was agreed there should be no costs of this appeal.\nQuestions answered in the affirmative; no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: K.

Dastous And Rose Canned Food Products Appellant;\nand\nMathews-Wells Company Limited Respondent.\n1949: March 7, 28, 29, November 23; 1949: December 22.\nPresent:\u2014Rinfret C.J., Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nReporter's Note.\u2014On November 23, 1949, at the request of the Court, counsel were heard further on three points of law suggested by the Court.\nTrade Mark\u2014Meaning of words \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" as used in s. 18\u2014Whether canned chicken \"similar\" wares to jams, pickles, sauces and vinegars within the meaning of s. 2(1)\u2014Whether the mark \"Rose Brand\" and the mark \"Rosie\" are \"similar\" within the meaning of s. 2(k)\u2014The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, S. of C. 1932, c. 38.\nThe respondent, a manufacturer of jams, jellies, pickles, sauces and vinegars, etc., is the proprietor of three trade marks; all carry the words \"Rose Brand\" and each bears the representation of a rose. The first two marks were registered in 1914 and 1931 respectively under the Trade Mark and Design Act, the third, a design mark, under The Unfair Competition Act, 1932. The appellant under the name of \"Rosie Canned Food Products\", processes and sells various forms of canned chicken and chicken products. His labels had as their predominant feature the word \"Rosie\", a contraction of his Christian name Rosario, followed by the word \"Brand\" in small letters, and a red rose with green leaves protruding from the sides. His application to register the mark \"Rosie\" was refused by the Registrar on the ground that it was confusingly similar to the registrations of the respondent.\nIn an action for infringement and passing off the Exchequer Court, restrained the appellant from using the word \"Rosie\" or any similar word, or the representation of a rose, on prepared food products similar to that of the respondent and in particular, canned chicken.\nHeld: (Reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court), that the appeal should be allowed.\nPer: Rinfret C.J., Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\u2014The wares of the respective parties are not, in the circumstances, within the scope of similarity defined by s. 2 (l).\nPer: Rinfret C.J.\u2014The wares are not of the same kind as required by the definition of s. 2 (k), and although they may have the common characteristics of food, that is not sufficient to declare them similar, as it would be contrary to the definition of trade mark under s. 2 (m). Per: Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\u2014The facts of the case establish an intention to relegate the first mark to the role of a mere supporting registration and its abandonment as a mark for use in association with wares; the new designs of the later two marks have been so evolved and in such circumstances as to lead to the same conclusion.\nPer: Rinfret CJ.\u2014The word \"Rose\", alone is not registrable under the Act, nor could the respondent by mere registration validly acquire a monopoly on the word \"Rose\" for its wares; there was no infringement of the marks so far as they are limited to the word \"Rose Brand\", nor was there evidence of confusion or deception by the buying public between the products of the respective parties.\nPer: Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\u2014The language of s. 18 as it speaks of registration \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\", is to be taken as signifying the fact of being on the Register and the expression therefore embraces all registrations in the Register maintained under that Act.\nPer: Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\u2014Although s. 18 (2) deals with the effect of a certified copy of the record of registration it implies necessarily that the registration itself would carry the like conclusive effect. In the circumstances of this case, the proof was made upon which the section is intended to operate.\nPer: Locke J.\u2014The certificates tendered as proof of the registration of the marks claimed to have been made under the Trade Mark and Design Act did not prove either the fact of registration nor that the marks were vested in the respondent. They were neither given under the provisions of s. 18 of The Unjair Competition Act, 1932, nor did they relate to registration made pursuant to that Act and proved nothing. The trade mark registered in November 1932 was properly proved by a certificate under s. 18 (2) but upon the evidence was only available upon the claim for infringement in respect of pickles and vinegar and the appellant's products were not \"wares of the same kind\" within the meaning of s. 2 (k).\nHeld: Also, that the evidence did not establish the alternative claim of passing off.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. 1, whereby he held that the appellant had infringed three marks of the plaintiff; (a) a specific trade mark registered in 1914 under the Trade Marks and Design Act to be used in connection with the sale of jams, preserves, canned goods (except salmon), pickles, sauces, marmalades, jellies (excepting jelly powders), catsups and mustards, and consisting of a label, a rose on a green background with the wording \"Rose Brand\"; (b) a specific trade mark registered in 1931 under the Trade Mark and Design Act, to be applied to the sale of olives, vinegars, peanut butter, mayonnaise and salad dressing, consisting of a reproduction of a red rose with a green leaf on either side, and the word \"Rose Brand\" being represented in a black parallelogram; (c) a design mark registered in 1932 under The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of pickles, pickled goods, condiments, prepared mustards, salad dressings, spices, vinegars, jams, jellies, preserved and canned goods, excluding baking powders, flavouring extracts and jelly powders, consisting of a parallelogram-shaped panel having the reproduction of a rose protruding from one upper corner and a horizontally exposed rectangular panel superimposed upon the parallelogram-shaped panel and bearing the words \"Rose Brand\" and name of contents, and name of the respondent.\nRedmond Quain, K.C., and T. R. Giles for the appellant.\nChristopher Robinson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an action for infringement of three trade marks and for passing off, and a reference as to damages and an injunction were granted in favour of the respondent.\nThe respondent company, whose Head Office is at Guelph, Ontario, is the proprietor of the following three marks:\u2014\n(a) A specific trade mark to be used in connection with the sale of jams, preserves, canned goods (except salmon), pickles, sauces, marmalades, jellies (excepting jelly powders), catsups and mustards. This trade mark \"consists of a label, a rose on green background with the wording \"ROSE BRAND\", name of contents grown and packed at Rosemount Orchards, Beamsville, Ontario.\n(b) A specific trade mark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of olives, vinegar, peanut butter, mayonnaise, and salad dresing. The trade mark \"consists of a red rose with a green leaf on either side and the words \"ROSE BRAND\", the latter being represented in a black parallelogram\".\n(c) A design mark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of pickles, pickled goods, condiments, prepared mustards, salad dressings, spices, vinegars, jams, jellies, preserved and canned goods, excluding baking powder, flavouring extracts and jelly powders. This design mark \"consists of a parallelogram-shaped panel having the reproduction of a rose protruding from one upper corner and a horizontally exposed rectangular panel.\" The first and second trade marks were registered under the Trade Mark and Design Act, respectively on December 2, 1914, and on July 18, 1931. The design mark was registered under The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, on October 2, 1933.\nThe appellant carries on business under the name of \"Rosie Canned Food Products\" at Fruitland, Ontario, and is its sole proprietor. On August 7, 1946, he made application to register the mark \"ROSIE\" for use on wares described as canned chicken dinners (a mixture of chicken, vegetables and gravy), canned chicken stew (a mixture of chicken, vegetables and gravy), canned jellied chicken, and canned chicken sandwich spread. This application was refused by the Registrar on the ground that it was confusingly similar to the registration of the respondent.\nThe respondent has never manufactured canned chicken or chicken products of any sort. Most of its products are sold in jars or bottles. Only fifteen per cent of its jam is sold in tins, and about five per cent of its pickles also in tins, mostly in gallon size.\nThe appellant sells his products in small tins, confined entirely to canned chicken and chicken products, chicken being the main ingredient of the latter. He commenced business about 1945, and he adopted the word \"ROSIE\" as his trade mark (this being a contraction of his name, Rosario) and sold his products under the name of \"ROSIE BRAND\". The labels on the tins used by him have as their most prominent features the word \"ROSIE\" (followed by the word \"Brand\" in small letters), and a red rose with green leaves protruding from the sides.\nAt the outset the learned trial judge asked Counsel for the respondent his view of the meaning of the words \"canned goods\", which appear in the specific trade mark above described as (a) and in the design mark (c), and whether that was a proper term, to indicate a particular ware or particular wares as described, to which Mr. Robinson answered as follows:\u2014\nI do not think it is and I am quite prepared to say that it is bad and that it ought to be disregarded. I think that would be the easiest way of dealing with that, my lord, because, quite apart from canned goods, the registration covers in terms jams, jellies, pickles and sauces. I am not concerned with this registration, Exhibit 1, beyond jams, jellies, pickles and sauces, because those are the goods on which the plaintiffs have used the mark and I obviously can base my claim for infringement on the possible similarity between the goods to which the plaintiff is applying its mark and the goods to which the defendant is applying his mark and I am not concerned to base my conten- tions on the broad description of goods which may have been covered in the original registration but on which the plaintiff since 19331 does not appear to have used the mark. I do not concede that the mark was not properly registered but I am not relying on that. I am relying on that mark only in so far as jams, jellies, pickles and sauces are concerned. Then we come to the second registration which covers, of the goods on which the plaintiff has used the mark, vinegar, and the third registration covers, of these goods, vinegar and pickles. I will leave the question of infringement, my lord, to be decided on the basis of exhibit 1 as applied to the goods which I have mentioned, exhibit 2, as applied to vinegar, and exhibit 3 as applied to vinegar and pickles, and that my friend concedes is good.\nThe effect of the above declaration is that while the trade marks or design mark are registered in respect of numerous and all-embracing classifications of wares, the marks were never used by the respondent except for a very limited number of classes of wares, and the issues were accordingly narrowed down. We have it from the admission of Mr. Robinson that the registration was bad and should be disregarded in respect of \"canned goods\", and that the respondent was not relying on the marks except in so far as they covered jams, jellies, pickles and sauces, or vinegar in the second registration, and vinegar and pickles in the third registration. The declaration further admits that since 1931 the respondent does not \"appear to have used the marks\".\nThe respondent complained of the use of the word \"ROSIE\" by the appellant, or any similar word, or the representation of a rose on prepared food products similar to those made and distributed by the respondent.\nIt should be noted at once that there is no evidence of confusion, or deception, by the buying public between the products of the respective parties, and this is very material. On this point it is stated by Kerly on Trade Marks at p. 206:\u2014\nWhere the marks have been circulating side by side in the market where deception is alleged to be probable, the fact that no one appears to have been misled is very material. Moreover, I cannot persuade myself that the word \"ROSE\" considered alone may be registrable under the Act. It is a word of universal use. It is established in evidence that \"there are literally scores of Rose Brand articles that grocers buy: smoked meats called 'Rosemount'; British Columbia salmon sold under the name of 'Red Rose Brand'; flour sold under the name of 'Rose Reno' and under the name of 'Rose Canadienne'; canned salmon and pilchard sold under the name of 'Rose Marie'; canned fruits or vegetables under the name of 'Royal Rose'.\" All the former have been registered as trade marks and, in addition, \"Empire Rose\" by the Canada Rice Mills, Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., \"Glen Rose\" by the Kyabram Co-operative Fruit Preserving Co. Ltd., for canned apricot, peaches, pears, pineapple and fruit salad, \"Cremerose\" for sugar substitute, and \"Calirose\", on behalf of the firm of Ross MacKinnon, Vancouver, B.C., for canned tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato puree, beans, peas and asparagus. So it seems quite impossible to admit that by mere registration the respondent could have validly acquired monopoly of the word \"ROSE\" for its wares.\nEliminating, therefore, the use of the word \"ROSIE\" by the appellant, which is further explained by the fact that it is a contraction of the appellant's name Rosario, it does not seem possible to hold that there has been an infringement in that respect of the marks of the respondent so far as they are limited to the words \"ROSE BRAND\".\nMore difficulty, however, is encountered by the appellant when one looks at the get-up of its wares and the dress in which they are presented to the buyer. Kerly at p. 601 states that the material, colour and decoration of the wrappers and the lettering and arrangement of the labels should be looked at to decide whether they were meant as an imitation of the respondent's marks. (Lever v. Goodwin 2. In that case soap wrapped in the same peculiar parchment paper, with the similar type of printed matter, were treated as an obvious case of fraud. But, as observed by Farwell J. in Chivers V. Chivers 3, p. 420 at p. 429:\u2014\"The real difficulty is the finding of fact.\" The complaint of infringement alleged by the respondent is based on sub-sections (a) and (c) of section 3 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, which read as follows:\u2014\n3. No person shall knowingly adopt for use in Canada in connection with any wares any trade mark or any distinguishing guise which\n(a) is already in use in Canada by any other person and which is registered pursuant to the provisions of this Act as a trade mark or distinguishing guise for the same or similar wares;\n* * * * *\n(c) is similar to any trade mark or distinguishing guise in use, or in use and known as aforesaid.\nThe section reads \"shall knowingly adopt\" and the appellant contended that when he adopted the get-up of his wares he did not know that it bore similarity with the get-up registered by the respondent.\nHowever, section 10 of the Act is to the effect that any person who adopts a mark identical with or similar to a mark already in use \"shall be presumed to have knowingly adopted the same unless it is established\" that it was adopted in good faith and in the belief that one was \"entitled to adopt and use it\", or that the mark so adopted has been continuously used \"in the ordinary course of business and in substantially the manner complained of during the five years immediately before the commencement of the proceedings\".\nNow the proceedings in this case were commenced on January 11, 1947. The appellant did not urge before this Court that he could claim the benefit of section 10 (c) as having continuously used the get-up of his wares in the ordinary course of his business during the five years immediately before the commencement of the proceedings and the evidence, to my mind, would not justify the Court in coming to that conclusion. He did say, however, that he adopted the get-up complained of in ignorance of the use of the get-up adopted by the respondent; but it does not seem possible to give him the benefit of section 10, as one does not find in the record evidence sufficiently convincing that he has succeeded in rebutting the presumption of having knowingly adopted his get-up, if it is found to be similar to the marks of the respondent, within the meaning of the Act. I think, therefore, that the litigation must be decided independently of section 10.\nUnder section 2 (k)\u2014\n\"Similar\", in relation to trade marks, * * * is meant to describe marks, names or guises so resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind, would be likely to cause dealers in and\/or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced, or for their place of origin.\nUnder sub-section (l) of section 2\u2014\n\"Similar\" in relation to wares, describes categories of wares which, by reason of their common characteristics or of the correspondence of the classes of persons by whom they are ordinarily dealt in or used, or of the manner or circumstances of their use, would, if in the same area they contemporaneously bore the trade mark or presented the distinguishing guise in question, be likely to be so associated with each other by dealers in and\/or users of them as to cause such dealers and\/or users to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced, or for their place of origin.\nIt should be noted that in a 2 (k) (the definition just quoted) it is stated that the wares must be \"of the same kind\".\nIn the judgment appealed from it is stated that as to the similarity of the respective marks of the plaintiff and the defendant \"there can be no doubt\", and that they are similar within the definition of that word in section 2 (k). The judgment continues to say that the design used by the appellant is identical with the design of the respondent\u2014a red rose with green leaves\u2014and that the word mark \"ROSIE\" adopted by the appellant and used in connection with the word \"BRAND\" is obviously similar to that of the respondent.\nBut it is observed that the definitions of the word \"similar\" in sections 2 (k) and 2 (l) offer three particular requirements:\u2014(1) characteristics of the wares, (2) the correspondence of the classes of persons by whom they are normally dealt in or used, and (3) the manner or circumstances of their use. However, when the learned judge speaks of the characteristics of the wares he says that little consideration need be given to the common characteristics; that chicken is the main ingredient of all the products of the appellant and is not in use in any way by the respondent and that vegetables are used to some degree by the respondent and also by the appellant. He adds, further, that, as to the correspondence of the classes of persons by whom they are normally dealt in or used and the manner or circumstances of their use, it has been established in evidence that the products of both the appellant and respondent are dealt in by wholesale and retail grocers, and in some retail stores they appear alongside each other, and that the products of both parties are purchased by the general public. In that connection the learned judge refers to the judgment of this Court in Proctor and Gamble Co. of Can. Ltd. v. LeHave Creamery Co. Ltd. 4, where application was made to expunge the registered mark \"White Clover\", as applied to butter, the appellant having previously registered the same word mark as applied to hydrogenated cottonseed and vegetable oils, and it was held (p. 438) that \"the two articles are so associated with each other as to cause the great majority of the purchasing public to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character and quality.\" But in that case it is to be noted that the word marks were identical and that the two products were used to a certain extent for the same purpose, i.e., for shortening; that observation is made by the learned trial judge himself.\nFinally, the learned judge states\u2014and that seems to be the main basis of his decision\u2014that \"while some of the products of the appellant are used for purposes other than those for which the respondent's goods are used, all are used for food and many of the products of the respondent are used for sandwiches, as are some of the appellant's products.\" On that ground his conclusion was that the wares of the parties were similar within the meaning of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, and, as he had already indicated that their marks were also similar, he held that the appellant had infringed the respondent's marks and accordingly he granted an injunction to the respondent, with an order for the delivery up of labels and dies of the appellant, as claimed, and costs. As the respondent further had claimed damages, a reference to the Registrar was directed to inquire and report as to same, if any, sustained by the respondent by reason of the appellant's alleged infringement.\nI find myself unable to give to sections 2 (k) and 2 (l) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, the application made by the learned trial judge. With respect, in my view, under section 2 (k) similarity is not established so long as the wares of the respective parties are not \"of the same kind\"; and it cannot be held that the wares of the respective parties come under the definition of the word \"similar\" in section 2 (l). As has been seen, Counsel for the respondent himself admitted that the respondent's marks, so far as they were meant to apply to canned goods generally, or to preserved goods, were bad, invalid and could not be upheld.\nTrade marks, or design marks, in section 2 of the Act are meant to distinguish \"particular wares falling within a general category from other wares falling within the same category\"; and it is for that reason that a trade mark cannot be registered or held valid if it should be claimed for wares \"of a general category\", that is to say, for canned goods or for preserved goods. The trade mark must apply to particular wares in order to distinguish them, says the definition of \"Trade mark\" (section 2 (m)) from \"other wares falling within the same category\", and that is to say within the same general category.\nSo, therefore, whilst Counsel for the respondent properly admitted that he could not hold a trade mark generally for canned goods, or preserved goods, and that he had to limit his trade mark to jams, jellies, pickles, sauces and vinegar, in the same way must it be said that the respondent could never have obtained a trade mark, in the words of the learned trial judge, as \"used for food\".\nThe trade mark could be adapted, asked and prayed for registration only for \"particular\" articles of food; and it seems to be quite clear that although the wares of both parties may be classified as coming under the general category of \"food\", it cannot be held that if the respondent holds trade marks for the particular articles of food, to which Counsel for the respondent has himself limited the validity of the trade marks, to wit, jams, jellies, pickles, sauces and vinegar, it can come before the Courts to ask them to exclude the appellant from using a trade mark, even if it has the same characteristics as the trade mark of the respondent, to be used in connection with different articles of food, to wit, canned chicken products in which the appellant deals alone. They are not wares of the same kind as required by the definition of \"similar\" in section 2 (k). They may have the common characteristic of food, but that is not sufficient to declare them similar, as it would be contrary to the definition of a trade mark under section 2 (m). Denying the use of the appellant's trade mark for his chicken products, on the ground that the latter are food, extends the meaning, or symbol, of the trade mark to a generality going much beyond the meaning of trade mark and its definition under the Act.\nI need not repeat here that a trade mark can be registered only if \"adapted to distinguish particular wares falling within a general category from other wares falling within the same category.\" Here the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the wares of both the appellant and the respondent fall within the general category of food; but the respondent's trade mark is limited to distinguish his particular wares falling within the general category of food from the appellant's particular wares falling within the same category.\nUnder The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, food generally cannot be considered a class of goods and no valid registration can be attributed to a trade mark pretending to cover all foods.\nBut, moreover, the registration obtained by the respondent was not for a general category, even if it could have been so obtained. It is expressly limited to the particular categories of food stated to be jams, jellies, pickles, sauces and vinegar. The trade mark here only preserved the right of the respondent to distinguish these particular wares from other wares falling within the general category of food and, therefore, it can never be claimed to exclude the appellant from using the same mark for chicken products which he alone puts on the market, even if it should be assumed that otherwise the whole of the trade mark adopted by the respective parties are held to be similar in other respects. I have already indicated that, in my opinion, the word \"ROSE\" used by the respondent cannot prevent somebody else from using the same word and, perhaps, more particularly the appellant from using the word \"ROSIE\", which is an abbreviation of his own name; and as the respondent's marks are composed not only of a rose with green leaves, but they include the words \"ROSE BRAND\", it may well be said that, as part of the marks registered by the respondent cannot exclude the use of the same part by another manufacturer or producer, for that reason also the respondent was not entitled in this case to the judgment which it secured in the Court appealed from.\nSo far as the complaint of passing-off is concerned, counsel for the respondent stated in this Court that he submitted it on the record as it stood and it does not appear that any particular evidence was directed to that issue. The learned trial judge, having found for the respondent on the question of infringement, did not consider it necessary to discuss the question of passing-off and in this Court counsel for the respondent merely referred to it.\nThe claim on that score would come under section 11 (b) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, and, to my mind, the respondent fails on that point in view of the fact that in order to make that section applicable he had to show that the course of conduct of the appellant was \"likely to create confusion in Canada between his wares and those of a competitor\". The word \"competitor\" is not defined in the Act and, therefore, must be taken to have its usual meaning. In the Oxford Dictionary, 1933 Edition, \"competitor\" is defined as \"one of several who aim at the same object\". The use of that word in section 11 (b) of the Act, which in section 2 (m) forbids the obtaining of a trade mark for a general category of wares and enacts that a trade mark must be limited to particular wares, clearly shows that a \"competitor\", within the meaning of the Act, is a man who aims at the same object as another, or several, and, therefore, cannot include the trader in chicken products as a competitor to the trader in jams, jellies, pickles, sauces and vinegar.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action, with costs throughout. The judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand, J.:\u2014The respondent claims infringement of three trade marks. The first was registered in 1914 and was described as consisting of \"a label, a rose on green background, with the wording 'Rose Brand', the name of the contents and grown and packed at Rosemount Orchard, Beamsville, Ontario.\" The words \"Rose Brand\" were printed across the face of the rose. On the register there is a notation of an assignment on May 28, 1931 by the original applicant, Davies, to Matthews and a further assignment on September 25, 1931 by the latter to the plaintiff. The mark was to be used in connection with jams, preserves, canned goods (except salmon), pickles, sauces, marmalades, jellies (excepting jelly powders), catsups and mustards.\nThe second mark was registered on July 18, 1931 and consisted of the \"representation of a red rose with a green leaf on either side and the words 'Rose Brand', the latter being represented in a black parallelogram\"; and was to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of olives, vinegar, peanut butter, mayonnaise and salad dressing.\nThe third, which extends the parallelogram section of the second, was entered on November 12, 1932 and is described as \"a parallelogram shaped panel, having the representation of a rose protruding from one upper corner and a horizontally disposed rectangular panel superimposed upon the parallelogram shaped panel\", the illustration of which contains, as its upper portion, the second mark including the words \"Rose Brand\". It was to be used with pickles, pickled goods, sauces, condiments, prepared mustards, salad dressing, spices, vinegars, jams, jellies, preserved and canned goods, excluding baking powder, flavouring extracts and jelly powders. This registration was under The Unfair Competition Act which came into effect on May 13, 1932.\nMr. Robinson disclaims the use of the second and third marks for any other wares than vinegar and pickles, but he claims the benefit of the first for jams, jellies, pickles and sauces. Admittedly the first in its actual form has never been used by the respondent, but it is urged that by the effect of section 18 there is a conclusive presumption that in relation to the goods mentioned the first was in use at the time of its registration and in such a manner that the appellant cannot deny that his mark was adopted with knowledge of registration and use.\nThe language of section 18 as it speaks of registration \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" presents a question of interpretation of some difficulty. Ordinarily what is done \"pursuant\" to a statute is done following the authority of the statute, and if we take the word \"registration\" to indicate the act of registering, then clearly that act in relation to the first mark could not be said to have been so done. But if \"registration\" is taken to signify the fact of being on the register, which clearly it can be, and if results are to be avoided for which at least no reason appears in the broad purposes of the Act, we are driven, I think, to the conclusion that the expression embraces all registrations in the register maintained under the present Act. As Mr. Robinson points out, section 4 (2) would seem to be inexplicable if the phrase as there used did not include all registered trade marks; and it would seem to me that the same thing can be said of section 3.\nI should add perhaps that although section 18 (2) deals with the effect of a certified copy of the record of registration, I take it to imply necessarily that the registration itself would carry the like conclusive effect. The documents showing the registration in all three cases were offered and accepted without objection\/and it was assumed that they brought before the court what the register itself could have done had it been offered. In these circumstances, the proof has been made upon which the section is intended to operate.\nIt is to be taken then that the defendant has adopted his trade mark knowingly in relation to those of the company, but he contends that the first mark has been abandoned. The designs and the circumstances of their adoption lead me to the view that the second and third were intended to supplant the first. In the last no colour of the rose is specified and it is on a green background. In the former, the rose is red with two green leaves profecting one on each side at the bottom; but the significant change is in the mode in which the words \"Rose Brand\" as the prominent feature of the mark appear. These now show in silver on the black parallelogram producing, in contrast to the rose, a vivid and arresting effect. There are in evidence over 100 samples of these marks which, in the course of time, have come to be used with the wares, among others, for which the first is claimed.\nAnother consideration supporting that intention arises from the inscription on the lower part of the first, containing the name of the orchard and the place at which the fruits were grown and packed. Under section 23 (5) (c) the first would now be taken to be a design mark without attributing any meaning to these descriptive words, but since they would not be registrable independently of the design, they do not constitute independently a word mark. The matters before us warrant the conclusion that, in representing in fact the place of business of the respondent to be at Rosemount Orchards, Beamsville, they would be misleading; whether or not the respondent is continuing the business of Davies, its place of manufacture, as advertised, is at Guelph. The inscription could, of course, have been dropped, but two modifications in the way of artistic improvement of the remaining design have already been dealt with.\nThe foregoing facts seem to me to establish the intention to relegate the first mark to the role of a mere supporting registration, and that as a mark for use in association with wares, it has been abandoned.\nA similar question arose in Hart's Trade Mark 5. There, Hart was the owner of a conventional Red Rose mark registered for the whole of Class 42, which included \"substances used as food, or ingredients in food.\" Although he sold condensed milk, his trade mark had not been used with it, but shortly before an application was made by a competing company to register a red rose device, Hart had decided to apply his own to that commodity. The company moved to have Hart's mark expunged or limited by excluding condensed milk from the goods for which it was registered and Byrne J. held that as there had been no intention to use the mark with condensed milk at the time of registration, the goods in question should be expunged. This made it unnecessary to decide the question of abandonment, but on that point he observed:\u2014\nI will only say that this must be a question of intention, as was pointed out by Mr. Justice Chitty in Mouson v. Boehm 6, and I should feel great difficulty in holding that where, as in the present case, the only user relied on, so far as concerns the particular goods, is that evidenced by the mark having been five years on the Register, there has been no abandonment, when, for more than 15 years subsequent to such five years, prior to the assignment to the respondent, there had been no user, but a sale of the description of goods with user of other and different marks.\nThe later marks here are not different, but their new designs have been so evolved and in such circumstances as to lead to the same conclusion. It is quite true that the respondent has renewed the first mark. That does indeed show an intention to keep the registration alive, but the intention with which abandonment is concerned is that of using the mark in connection with particular goods. Here we have not only no evidence other than the presumption from section 18(2) of the use at the time of registration in 1914 or thereafter by the original owner, but admittedly no user whatever from the time the company began its business in 1931 until the trial, a period of over fifteen years.\nThe remaining question then is whether the canned chicken goods, including sandwich spread, sold by the appellant and the vinegar and pickles of the respondent sold chiefly in jars are, in the circumstances, within the scope of similarity defined by section 2 (l), and I have come to the conclusion that they are not.\nA rose is a well-known constituent of a trade mark; the evidence discloses nine or ten examples in which the word itself is used, and in one case with the adjective \"red\". Such marks are used on canned corn, pumpkin and salmon, the latter of which was, among others, excepted from the general class of canned goods in the application for the first mark. The word, therefore, with or without the flower or its colour or as the name of a \"brand\", is not unique or exceptional, and the evidence justifies our taking it as one of somewhat close differentiation by the general trade. This characteristic is highly relevant to the likelihood of con- fusion as to the source of wares; and from the facts before us, it would appear that the actual practices in the trade negative that likelihood in relation to those in question.\nAn alternative claim for passing off was made, but weighing the whole of the evidence with care, I am unable to say that the company has established it.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nLocke J.:\u2014In this action the respondent claims an injunction restraining the appellants, their servants and agents, from using the word \"Rosie\" or any similar word, or the representation of a rose on prepared food products similar to those made and distributed by the plaintiff, an order for the delivery up to the plaintiff of all labels in the possession of the appellants bearing the word \"Rosie\", and damages. The respondent claims the infringement of three registered trade marks, two of which are said to have been made under the Trade Mark and Design Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 71: R.S.C. 1927, c. 201), and the third under The Unfair Competition Act, 1982. By the Statement of Defence the appellants put in issue the allegations that the plaintiff or its predecessor in title had adopted the trade marks in question, or that it was registered as the owner of the marks.\nAs proof of its ownership of the first of these marks, the respondent filled what appears to be the original certificate of its registration dated December 2, 1914, attached to which there was a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Patents reading \"Certified to be a true and correct copy of a specific trade mark as registered in the Trade Mark Register No. 83, folio 20350, in accordance with the Trade Mark and Design Act by Arthur Henderson Davies on December 2, 1914, application for which was filed Nov. 16, 1914.\" Attached to the document is a photostatic copy of Davies' application for registration and of the mark, being the representation of a rose with the words \"Rose Brand\" printed across it and the words \"Grown and packed at Rosemount Orchards, Beamsville, Ont.\" Upon the back of the certificate of registration there appear two endorsements dated respectively May 28, 1931, and September 25, 1931, indicating that the mark had been assigned first to J. G. Mathews and thereafter to the respondent. The second certificate above referred to which, it is contended, proved that the trade mark was registered by Davies and thereafter assigned to the respondent is dated May 22, 1931. In regard to the 1931 mark, the respondent filed what appears to be the original certificate of the registration of a specific trade mark of the words \"Rose Brand\" in a described setting dated July 18, 1931, attached to which there is what purports to be a copy of the application for registration. There is, however, no certificate as to this document.\nThese certificates were apparently given by the Commissioner of Patents under the provisions of s. 48 of The Trade Mark and Design Act, c. 201, R.S.C. 1927. That section provided that such a certificate should, without proof of the signature, be received in all parts in Canada as prima facie evidence of the facts therein alleged. The certificates, therefore, if receivable in evidence would have shown that the mark had been registered respectively by Davies and by the respondent. The first would not have sufficed to prove the assignments which the respondent contends vested the right to the mark in it as to which it was silent. S. 48, however, was amended by s. 61 (2) of The Unfair Competition Act, 19S2, by deleting from it the words \"trade mark\" so that as the section related to procedure only it could not be invoked in support of either certificate at the trial which took place in 1947. It is said for the respondent that the certificates, by virtue of s. 18 of The Unfair Compeition Act, 1982, are prima facie evidence of the facts set out in the record of the registration of the marks, and further that the person named therein is the registered owner of the mark for the purposes and within the area therein defined and conclusive evidence that at the date of the registration the trade mark therein mentioned was in use in Canada or in the territorial area therein defined for the purpose therein set out, in such manner that no person could thereafter adopt the same or a similar trade mark on the same or similar goods in ignorance of the use of the registered mark by the owner thereof. The language of s. 18 is that \"the production of a certified copy of the record of the registration of such trade mark made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" shall be prima facie evidence of the matters above referred to. This language is capable of the construction that the words \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" refer to a copy certified in accordance with its provisions, and also of meaning that they refer to the words \"trade mark\" which immediately precede them. The certificates were tendered in evidence and admitted without objection. The learned trial judge considered that the proper meaning of these words was that the certified copy referred to was one given pursuant to s. 25 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1982. It was not drawn to his attention that both of the certificates had been given prior to the date when that Act came into force. For the respondent, it is now said that the words \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" refer to the registration of the mark and not to the certificate and that since the trade mark register made under the provisions of the earlier Act forms part of the register maintained under the provisions of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, these trade marks fall within the section: the certified copy, it is contended, means a copy certified under any statutory authority. In my opinion, neither contention can be sustained. I think the words \"made pursuant to the provisions of this Act\" must be interpreted according to what I regard as their plain meaning, that being that the registration referred to is one made pursuant to an application under The Unfair Competition Act, 1982. The certified copies which were received being neither given under the provisions of that Act nor being copies of registrations made pursuant to it, were neither prima facie evidence of the facts set out in the record nor conclusive evidence of the matters above mentioned. Copies of the entries made in the trade mark register might have been admitted under s. 26 of the Canada Evidence Act, c. 59, R.S.C. 1927, had the seven day notice required by s. 28 been given and the fact that the record was one of the ordinary books kept in the Department proven by the oath or affidavit of an officer of such Department, as required by s. 26. Neither of these steps were taken and I think it is clear that in tendering the certificates either s. 48 of the Trade Mark and Design Act or s. 18 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932 was relied upon. There was no objection made to their reception but, in the circumstances of this case, I think this should not affect the matter.\nThe respondent seeking to take advantage of the assistance given by s. 18 to a plaintiff filing a certified copy of the record of registration, including the remarkable provision that such copy is conclusive evidence that at the date of the registration the trade mark was in use in Canada in such manner that no other person could thereafter adopt the same or a similar mark on the same or similar goods, must, I think, be required to comply strictly with the requirements of the section. In Jacket v. The International Cable Company 7, where certain evidence had been wrongly admitted without objection, Lopes, L.J. said that it was the duty of the Court of Appeal to disregard the document improperly admitted as the case should be decided upon legal evidence, a decision referred to and adopted in the judgment of Duff, C.J. in The King v. The Ship \"Emma K\" 8. The certificates, in my opinion, were inadmissible and the claim, in so far as it is one for infringement founded upon the alleged registration of the trade marks of 1914 and 1931 and their use, must fail.\nThe third of the trade marks in question was registered by the respondent as a design mark on November 12, 1932, under the provisions of the 1932 Act and proven in the manner permitted by s. 18. The mark is stated by the application to consist of a parallelogram shaped panel having the representation of a rose protruding from one upper corner and a horizontally rectangular panel superimposed upon the parallelogram shaped panel, and a specimen of the mark annexed shows a rose red in colour. By the application for registration the respondent represented to the Commissioner of Patents that he had adopted and continuously used the mark in connection with the manufacture and sale of pickles, pickled goods, sauces, condiments, prepared mustards, salad dressings, spices, vinegars, jams, jellies, preserved and canned goods, excluding baking powder, flavoring extracts and jelly powders from May 26, 1931. The president of the respondent company, however, disclosed by his evidence at the hearing that these statements as to the user of the mark were largely inaccurate. The respondent company was incorporated by letters patent in the year 1931 and in that year and apparently until the year 1935 the only products manufactured were pickles and vinegar. In 1935 the respondent commenced to put up olives, in 1937 jams and apple butter, in 1938 fruit juices and preserved cherries and in 1939 sauce for use with meat, and while the evidence is not entirely clear as to all of these products it would appear that the mark registered in 1932, with some slight variations in the case of some products, was used. S. 30 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, requires the applicant for registration of a mark to state in writing the date from which the applicant or his named predecessor in title has or have used the mark. While by the terms of s. 18 (2) of The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, a certified copy of the record of the registration of the mark, subject only to proof of clerical error therein, is stated to be conclusive evidence that at the date of the registration the trade mark was in use in Canada for the purpose therein set out in such manner that no person could thereafter adopt the same, it was thus shown as part of the plaintiff's case in the course of the proceedings that if there had been any use of this mark prior to its registration it was in respect of pickles and vinegar only. Counsel for the respondent at the trial, in these circumstances, very properly stated to the trial judge in the course of his argument that so far as the plaintiff's claim for infringement was concerned he relied upon the 1932 registration in respect of vinegar and pickles only.\nS. 19 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1932, provides that:\u2014\nIf it appears to the court that a registered trade mark was not registrable by the person by whom the application for its registration was made, the owner thereof shall not be entitled to any remedy or relief in an action for the alleged infringement of such mark without other evidence of his rights than the mere production of a certified copy of the record of the registration.\nFollowing immediately, as it does, the provision in s. 18 (2) above referred to, that the certified copy is conclusive evidence of the use of the mark in such a manner that no other person could thereafter adopt the same on the same or similar goods, the sections appear to be inconsistent. Where, however, as in the present case, it is shown by the evidence tendered on behalf of the owner of the mark that there was no such user in respect of a large number of the products mentioned in the appli- cation until years after the registration of the mark, and in particular when counsel for the owner frankly admits that he cannot rely upon the mark in respect to the claim for infringement, except in respect of two of the numerous products mentioned, I think the claim may properly be dealt with on the facts disclosed by the evidence.\nThe plaintiff's claim should, therefore, be dealt with in so far as relief is claimed upon the basis of an alleged infringement upon the footing that it is properly registered in respect of pickles and vinegar only. The evidence shows that Dastous commenced the business of canning chicken in various forms in the year 1944. S. 3 of The Unfair Competition Act, 1982, in so far as relevant, provides that no person shall knowingly adopt for use in Canada in connection with any wares any trade mark or any distinguishing guise which is similar to any trade mark or distinguishing guise in use. \"Similar\" in relation to a trade mark is defined by subsec. (k) of s. 2 as describing marks so resembling each other or so clearly suggesting the idea conveyed by each other that the contemporaneous use of both in the same area in association with wares of the same kind would be likely to cause dealers or users of such wares to infer that the same person assumed responsibility for their character or quality, for the conditions under which or the class of persons by whom they were produced or for their place of origin. The respondent's design, mark exhibits a rose and while the mark applied for and granted did not describe this as a red rose the design filed with the application may perhaps be taken as part of it and on this the rose is red in colour. The mark which the appellants sought to register was a word mark only but in use they exhibited the word written in prominent letters, in conjunction with a red rose. There is thus some likeness in the appearance of the two marks as used. The respondent does not, of course, claim the mark in respect of all articles of food and disclaims any claim to the mark in respect of canned goods generally. The respondent's registration enumerating various articles of food, while claiming the mark for canned goods, ex- pressly excludes baking powder, flavouring extracts, and jelly powder. The evidence showed that there were a large number of other registered marks, one at least registered long prior to the year 1932, containing the word \"rose\" in various forms and some containing the representation of a red rose. Thus, as shown by the certified copy of the file relating to the appellant's application filed by the respondent as part of its case, \"Rose Brand\" was registered as a specific mark by The Canadian Packing Company, Limited, on August 26, 1920, for hams, bacon, lard, butter, cheese, eggs and oleomargarine. This mark was assigned to Canada Packers, Ltd., by an assignment registered on August 26, 1937. The \"Red Rose Brand\" was registered as a trade mark for canned salmon in 1933 by British Columbia Packers, Limited, and in addition registrations have been made of the words \"Royal Rose\" in respect of canned fruits, vegetables and canned fish, \"Rose Marie\" for mint products, and \"Rose Canadienne\", \"Empire Rose\", \"Glen Rose\", \"Cremerose\" and \"Calirose\" for various canned foods. The words \"Red Rose\", in conjunction with a representation of a red rose, have also been widely used for many years as a trade mark for tea. The cross-examination of Mr. Matthews also indicated that there is a rose or red rose mark for jelly powders used by some other manufacturer and, for this reason, these goods were excluded when applying for the registration of the mark. I do not consider that the appellants' chicken products are \"wares of the same kind\" as the pickles and vinegar sold by the respondent, nor, in view of the large number of other food products sold either with the mark \"Rose Brand\" or a representation of a red rose, do I think that the use of the appellants' mark will cause either dealers in or users of these chicken products to infer that they were produced by the respondent or that the respondent assumed responsibility for their character or quality. No doubt these various articles of food are exhibited in grocery stores in close proximity with each other. In so far as the dealers in these wares are concerned, I cannot think that there is any possibility of there being any confusion and, as to purchasers who are no doubt not given to scanning carefully what is written upon the labels of food products and who are, I would assume, confronted in grocery stores with many different kinds of food bearing the mark \"Rose\" in some form or another, I think there is no more probability of their being led by the mark to conclude that the chicken products are those of the respondent than they are to conclude that the respondent's goods are put up by the manufacturers of Red Rose tea, or of the hams, bacon and other products of the Canada Packers, or the canned fruits, vegetables and fish of the Windsor Canning Company, Ltd. I think that if there was any such risk the respondent would not have registered this mark in 1932 in the face of the registration of the \"Rose Brand\" by the Canadian Packing Company, Ltd., twelve years before. The claim for infringement, in my opinion, therefore fails.\nThe claim for passing-off was not dealt with by the learned trial judge since he was of the opinion that the claim for infringement had been proven. It is said in the Statement of Claim that the use by the defendants of these labels directs public attention to their wares in a manner that might reasonably be apprehended to be likely to cause confusion between the said wares and those of the plaintiff. Upon this aspect of the claim the respondent does not rely upon the registration of his various marks but upon their use prior to the date when the appellants commenced to use their mark. The respondent has shown that, in addition to the manufacture and sale of pickles and vinegar between the years 1931 and 1935, thereafter between the years 1935 to 1939 inclusive, it put up and sold extensively olives, jams, apple butter, fruit juices, preserved cherries and sauce for use with meat. The respondent did in fact discontinue the production of some of these products during the war, but there is no evidence to justify the finding that it has abandoned the use of its design mark upon any of them. The basis of a passing-off action being a false representation by the defendant, it must be proved in each case as a fact that such a representation has been made: the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the defendant in connection with the goods of the mark, name, or get-up in question impliedly represents such goods to be those of the plaintiff (Spalding v. Gamage 9, Lord Parker at p. 284). It is not necessary to prove any actual deception or actual resulting damage, it being sufficient to prove that the practice complained of is of such a nature that it is likely in the ordinary course of business to deceive the public. It was shown by the respondent that the labels used by it upon a variety of products for some years prior to 1944 exhibited a representation of a rose red in colour, in conjunction with the words \"Rose Brand\". The appellants displayed prominently upon their labels the word \"Rosie\" in conjunction with the figure of a red rose on goods which are, in my view, of a different kind than those manufactured by the respondent. If anyone has been misled there was no evidence to that effect, the only witness called being the wife of the Toronto representative of the respondent who expressed her opinion that if she saw canned chicken products with the words \"Rosie Brand\" and the picture of a rose she would think they were the goods of the respondent. Why she should think this rather than that they were products of other manufacturers using the same or closely similar brands, she did not explain. The evidence wholly fails to satisfy me that the use by the appellants of the word \"Rosie\" alone, or in conjunction with the figure of a rose, is likely in the ordinary course of business to deceive the public and result in a passing-off.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Carreau & Quain.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n1 (1948) 8 C.P.R. 2; 7 Fox Pat.

On Oct. 4, the Court ordered a rehearing which took place on Nov. 23. Judgment was delivered on Dec. 5, 1949.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nArchitect\u2014Fees\u2014Appointed by resolution of hospital\u2014Revocation and retainer of another architect\u2014Action to recover fees or damages for plans made\u2014Art. 1691 C.C.\nBy a resolution of its Board of directors, it was proposed that appellant \"retienne\" the respondent to prepare plans and to supervise the erection of an extension to its hospital and a nurses' residence. Respondent was to be paid pursuant to the Architects' tariff but only \"pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\" (clause 3). Subsequently, without knowledge that respondent had in fact prepared preliminary plans, appellant revoked the earlier resolution and retained another architect. The nurses' residence having been erected, respondent brought action to recover fees for both sets of plans but the action was dismissed by the Superior Court. This judgment was reversed on appeal.\nHeld: that respondent, having received express instructions to proceed with the plans following his retainer, was entitled to damages under Art. 1691 C.C, such damages in respect of the plans for the nurses' residence being the amount prescribed by the tariff and in respect of the other plans for the loss of the chance that the building might have been proceeded with.\nPer Taschereau J. (dissenting in part): As clause 3 of the resolution fixes only the time at which the fee will be due and is not a renunciation of payment if the works are not proceeded with, respondent is entitled either as fees or as damages under Art. 1691 C.C. to the amount provided for the preliminary studies by section 11 of the Architects' tariff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing, Bissonnette JA. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court, Rh\u00e9aume J., which had dismissed the action, and awarding respondent the sum of $9,389.62.\nR. Brossard, K.C., for the appellant.\nG. Monette, K.C., for the respondent. The Chief Justice: M. le Juge Kellock, dans ses notes de jugement, r\u00e9cite \u00e0 ma satisfaction la suite des faits dans cette cause, et, comme je m'accorde en tout point avec lui, je ne crois pas devoir les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici.\nD'accord avec la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 2, je suis d'avis que la r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e par les membres du Bureau de direction de l'appelante, le 19 septembre 1939, constituait un contrat entre cette derni\u00e8re et l'intim\u00e9. Cela appert \u00e0 la fois de la lettre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e par le secr\u00e9taire d\u00e8s le lendemain et par celle du 21 septembre adress\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident et aux directeurs de l'H\u00f4pital o\u00f9 il d\u00e9clare accepter sa nomination comme \"architecte des travaux d'agrandissement de votre h\u00f4pital ainsi que de la construction d'une maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades.\"\nPlus tard, le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1940, l'appelante a adopt\u00e9 une nouvelle r\u00e9solution par laquelle elle a rescind\u00e9 celle du 19 septembre et elle a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 la nomination de l'intim\u00e9.\nJe n'entretiens pas de doute sur le sens de la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre; l'emploi du mot \"retienne\" n'est pas susceptible\u2014je le dis en tout respect\u2014de l'interpr\u00e9tation que lui a donn\u00e9e l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance. D'ailleurs, la meilleure preuve de l'intention du Bureau de direction de l'appelante en adoptant cette r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre se trouve indiscutablement, comme le signalent tous les juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), dans la r\u00e9solution du 22 f\u00e9vrier 1940. Le fait m\u00eame de l'adoption de cette r\u00e9solution en est d\u00e9j\u00e0 une s\u00fbre indication. Si la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre n'avait pas eu pour effet de retenir d\u00e8s lors les services de l'intim\u00e9, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d'adopter celle du 22 f\u00e9vrier pour la rescinder. Mais, en plus, les termes m\u00eames employ\u00e9s par le Bureau de direction pour la rescision du contrat renforcissent cette interpr\u00e9tation, puisque la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre y est indiqu\u00e9e comme \"retenant les services de M. Napol\u00e9on Beauchamp, architecte de Montr\u00e9al\" et que cette m\u00eame r\u00e9solution se termine en disant \"que la nomination de M. Beauchamp soit en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e\".\nLe contrat entre les parties \u00e9tait devenu complet lorsque l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'appelante sa lettre du 21 septembre par laquelle il acceptait sa nomination. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsque le 22 f\u00e9vrier 1940, l'appelante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rescinder la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre par laquelle elle retenait les services de M. Beauchamp et de r\u00e9voquer sa nomination, l'appe- lante agissait conform\u00e9ment au droit qui lui est reconnu par l'article 1691 du Code civil. Elle pouvait r\u00e9silier, par sa seule volont\u00e9, le march\u00e9 qu'elle avait fait avec l'intim\u00e9; il s'en suivait que ce march\u00e9 \u00e9tait par le fait m\u00eame mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9, mais, \u00e9galement, il en r\u00e9sultait pour l'appelante l'obligation de d\u00e9dommager l'intim\u00e9 \"de ses d\u00e9penses actuelles et de ses travaux en lui payant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suivant les circonstances\".\nA partir de ce moment-l\u00e0 ce n'\u00e9tait plus le contrat qui r\u00e9gissait les relations des parties mais c'\u00e9tait la loi telle qu'elle est exprim\u00e9e dans cet article 1691 (C.C.).\nL'article 1691 (C.C.), qui permet au ma\u00eetre de r\u00e9silier, par sa seule volont\u00e9, le march\u00e9 qu'il a contract\u00e9 pour la construction d'un \u00e9difice ou autre ouvrage, s'applique \u00e9galement au contrat consenti \u00e0 un architecte \u00e0 raison de cette construction. Les deux avocats des parties n'ont pas contest\u00e9 ce principe. D\u00e8s lors, l'appelante avait le droit de r\u00e9silier son contrat avec l'intim\u00e9 mais seulement \"en d\u00e9dommageant (l'intim\u00e9) de ses d\u00e9penses actuelles et de ses travaux et en lui payant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suivant les circonstances\".\nMais, si le contrat ayant cess\u00e9 d'exister ne peut plus r\u00e9gir les relations des parties, en vertu m\u00eame de l'article 1691 (C.C.), il faut quand m\u00eame recourir \u00e0 ce contrat pour d\u00e9cider quel est le montant que l'intim\u00e9 peut r\u00e9clamer comme cons\u00e9quence de la r\u00e9siliation, vu que c'est dans ce contrat que l'on doit trouver la mesure de la perte p\u00e9cuniaire que l'intim\u00e9 se trouve \u00e0 subir. Or, le contrat, tel qu'il se lit dans la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre, c'est que l'intim\u00e9 avait \"droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au tarif minimum exigible par l'Association des Architectes de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, suivant le co\u00fbt de la construction des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\".\nMais cette r\u00e9solution contenait \u00e9galement un troisi\u00e8me paragraphe qui se lit comme suit:\nIl est entendu, n\u00e9anmoins, que les honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s de M. Beauchamp ne seront exigibles que pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. S'il n'y avait pas eu de r\u00e9siliation, ce paragraphe devait entrer en ligne de compte dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 laquelle aurait eu droit l'intim\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 son contrat aurait persist\u00e9.\nLe mot \"n\u00e9anmoins\" dans ce paragraphe indique l'intention des parties d'apporter une exception au paragraphe deux de la r\u00e9solution en vertu duquel l'intim\u00e9 devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au tarif des architectes.\nD'apr\u00e8s ce tarif, les services professionnels de l'intim\u00e9 en rapport avec toute la b\u00e2tisse, comprenant les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires, etc., lui donnaient droit \u00e0 une commission de 5 p. 100 sur le co\u00fbt total des travaux (n\u00b0 8); mais les honoraires partiels, dans le cas de discontinuation des travaux, lui donnaient droit, pour les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires, \u00e0 un cinqui\u00e8me de cette commission (n\u00b0 11).\nIl n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendu, en l'esp\u00e8ce, que les parties ne pouvaient d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ces prescriptions du tarif.\nOr, le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de la r\u00e9solution doit \u00eatre entendu comme une d\u00e9rogation au tarif exigible par l'Association des Architectes. Cela est \u00e9tabli tout d'abord, comme nous l'avons signal\u00e9 plus haut, par l'emploi du mot \"n\u00e9anmoins\" et, ensuite, par la stipulation que les honoraires et et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9 \"ne seront exigibles que pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\".\nJe ne puis me d\u00e9fendre de l'impression que cette derni\u00e8re partie du paragraphe est ambigu\u00eb. L'emploi des mots \"travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\", en leur donnant leur sens litt\u00e9ral, pourrait se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par M. Beauchamp lui-m\u00eame. Je dois avouer que ce fut l\u00e0 ma premi\u00e8re impression; mais, \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion, il ne para\u00eet pas vraisemblable que ce serait l\u00e0 ce que les parties avaient en vue. Les mots \"travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\" sont les m\u00eames que ceux qui sont employ\u00e9s dans le paragraphe deux de la r\u00e9solution; or, dans ce paragraphe, il est clair qu'ils se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent aux travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l'entrepreneur. Il est de r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9ter de m\u00eame fa\u00e7on les m\u00eames mots employ\u00e9s \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises dans un document. En vertu de cette r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation, les mots \"travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\" devraient \u00eatre tenus pour s'adresser au m\u00eame genre de travaux \u00e0 la fois dans le paragraphe deux et dans le paragraphe trois. Le mot \"pour\" cause \u00e9galement une certaine perplexit\u00e9. Dans son sens ordinaire, cela voudrait dire que M. Beau-champ pourrait exiger des honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s pour le montant des travaux qu'il aurait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s lui-m\u00eame. D'autre part, ce mot \"pour\" peut, suivant le texte, signifier: \"\u00e0 raison de\" ou \"par rapport \u00e0\".\nMais, de tout cela, si l'on applique \u00e0 ce document les r\u00e8gles pos\u00e9es dans les articles 1013 et 1019 du Code civil, la conclusion doit \u00eatre que M. Beauchamp ne pourrait exiger des honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qu'\u00e0 raison du montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par l'entrepreneur. En effet, le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que la commune intention des parties est douteuse, et, dans ce cas, comme c'est M. Beauchamp qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution, le contrat doit s'interpr\u00e9ter contre lui et en faveur de l'H\u00f4pital St-Luc qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation (1019 C.C.); et cette commune intention des parties doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par interpr\u00e9tation plut\u00f4t que par le sens litt\u00e9ral des termes du contrat (1013 C.C).\nSi donc le contrat n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9 mais que, ou bien la construction eut \u00e9t\u00e9 discontinu\u00e9e, ou (comme c'est le cas ici) l'une des constructions seulement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9e, soit l'agrandissement de l'h\u00f4pital, soit la maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades, M. Beauchamp avait consenti \u00e0 ne recevoir d'honoraires et de d\u00e9bours\u00e9s que bas\u00e9s sur le co\u00fbt ou bien des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 leur discontinuation, ou bien de la construction de la maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades, puisque, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du proc\u00e8s, seule cette construction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9e et l'agrandissement de l'h\u00f4pital n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nCe qu'il devait recevoir, en vertu du contrat, est n\u00e9ces-sairement la mesure de l'indemnit\u00e9 que lui accorde l'article 1691 du Code civil.\nEn agissant ainsi la Cour n'applique pas le contrat aux parties, puisque ce contrat est r\u00e9sili\u00e9, mais elle s'en sert pour \u00e9tablir le montant du d\u00e9dommagement ou de l'indemnit\u00e9 auquel l'intim\u00e9 a droit en vertu de la loi, en tenant compte de ce qu'il aurait re\u00e7u si le contrat n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nSans doute, cette discussion r\u00e9sulte plut\u00f4t de la r\u00e9audition que la Cour a cru devoir ordonner pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur ce point. Et si cette question n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e que par la Cour elle aurait pu avoir une influence sur les frais auxquels l'appelante aurait pu pr\u00e9tendre, mais, lors de cette-r\u00e9audition, le procureur de l'appelante a affirm\u00e9 qu'il avait ' soulev\u00e9 ce moyen tant devant la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance '. que devant la Cour d'appel, et nous en trouvons la confirmation dans les notes de jugement de M. le Juge Barclay auquel se sont ralli\u00e9s MM. les Juges Marchand et Errol M. McDougall.\nVoici ce que dit M. le Juge Barclay:\nA condition was added, presumably and apparently for the very reason that the actual building operations might be delayed or might be subject to change, whereby it was stipulated that the plaintiff could claim payment for his services only \"pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\".\nCela indique que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) l'interpr\u00e9tation de cette phrase du contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il s'en suit que. l'intim\u00e9 devait r\u00e9ussir tant devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel). Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait rejet\u00e9 son action. Il lui fallait donc aller devant la Cour du Banc du Roi pour obtenir l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle la r\u00e9siliation du contrat par l'appelante lui donnait droit.\nL'intim\u00e9 doit donc recevoir ses frais tant devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel).\nMais, d'autre part, par suite du raisonnement ci-dessus, le montant que lui a accord\u00e9 la Cour d'Appel est trop \u00e9lev\u00e9, car il n'y est pas tenu compte de cette troisi\u00e8me clause de la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre 1939, laquelle, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, ne peut plus r\u00e9gir les relations des parties mais doit quand m\u00eame \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour constater la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration que l'intim\u00e9 aurait pu r\u00e9clamer s'il n'y avait pas eu de r\u00e9siliation.\nEn appliquant ce calcul \u00e0 la cause, l'intim\u00e9 a droit, suivant le tarif des architectes, \u00e0 cinq pour cent sur le co\u00fbt total de la construction de la maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades, puisque ce travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9; mais, en ce qui regarde l'agrandissement de l'h\u00f4pital qui, au moins en autant qu'il appara\u00eet au dossier, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, il ne peut recevoir des honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s calcul\u00e9s sur le montant ou le co\u00fbt de cet agrandissement qui n'existe pas. Cependant, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 1691 (C.C.), il est justifiable de r\u00e9clamer \"des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suivant les circonstances\", parce qu'en vertu du contrat il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 compter que l'appelante proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 la construction de cet agrandissement et les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires qu'il a faites portaient \u00e9galement sur cet agrandissement. Il nous para\u00eet juste et \u00e9quitable de fixer le montant qu'il devrait recevoir de ce chef \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de ce qu'il aurait re\u00e7u si l'agrandissement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit. L'addition de ces deux sommes donne un montant de $6,000.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 mais le jugement de la Cour d'Appel doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 pour les raisons ci-dessus. Le montant du jugement en faveur de l'intim\u00e9 devra donc \u00eatre fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $6,000; et comme l'appelante se trouve tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 r\u00e9ussir d'une fa\u00e7on assez substantielle; en plus, en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, je crois que l'appelante devrait avoir de l'intim\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 de ses frais d'appel devant cette Cour.\nTaschereau, J. (dissenting in part):\u2014Je partage les vues de mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Kellock, et comme lui je crois. qu'un contrat est intervenu entre les parties, et que c'est \u00e0 la demande de l'appelante que l'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les plans pr\u00e9liminaires pour l'agrandissement de l'H\u00f4pital, et pour la construction de la maison des Gardes-Malades.\nCependant, en ce qui concerne le montant \u00e0 \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'il faut donner \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre 1939, j'entretiens une opinion diff\u00e9rente. Cette r\u00e9solution est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9e:\nQue la Direction de l'H\u00f4pital Saint-Luc retienne les services de M. Napol\u00e9on Beauchamp, architecte, de Montr\u00e9al, pour la pr\u00e9paration des plans, devis, estim\u00e9s et surveillance des travaux d'agrandissement de son h\u00f4pital et de la construction d'une maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades.\nPour la pr\u00e9paration desdits plans, devis, estim\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s, M. Beauchamp aura droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au tarif minimum exigible par l'Association des Architectes de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, suivant le co\u00fbt de la construction des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nIl est entendu, n\u00e9anmoins, que les honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s de M. Beauchamp ne seront exigibles que pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante est que l'intim\u00e9 est priv\u00e9 de tout recours et ne peut r\u00e9clamer ses honoraires, si les autorit\u00e9s de l'h\u00f4pital d\u00e9cident, comme elles l'ont fait d'ailleurs, de ne pas poursuivre leurs travaux. Une analyse attentive du texte de cette r\u00e9solution ne me permet pas de partager ces vues. En vertu du premier paragraphe, les services de l'intim\u00e9 sont clairement retenus pour la pr\u00e9paration des plans, devis, estim\u00e9s et surveillance des travaux. Le second d\u00e9termine quel sera le montant des honoraires de l'architecte, et il y est stipul\u00e9 qu'il sera bas\u00e9 sur le co\u00fbt de la construction des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment au tarif des architectes. C'est-\u00e0-dire que l'intim\u00e9 aura droit \u00e0 un pourcentage d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par l'article 8 du tableau d'honoraires minimum des architectes de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec. Cet article est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\nPour services professionnels en rapport avec toute la b\u00e2tisse, comprenant les \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires, les plans complets, les devis, les d\u00e9tails, et la surveillance des travaux, except\u00e9 ce qui est pr\u00e9vu plus loin, l'architecte aura droit \u00e0 une commission de cinq pour cent (5 p. 100) sur le co\u00fbt total des travaux.\nLa r\u00e9solution ne fait donc que confirmer ce que disent les r\u00e8glements.\nQuant au troisi\u00e8me paragraphe, dont l'interpr\u00e9tation doit servir de d\u00e9termination \u00e0 cette cause, il ne fait que fixer le temps o\u00f9 le montant des honoraires sera exigible. C'est comme si l'on avait dit que les honoraires seront payables \u00e0 mesure que les travaux seront ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. L'architecte \u00e9videmment n'a pas droit \u00e0 un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui qui est justifi\u00e9 par l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux. C'est la r\u00e8gle ordinaire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution.\nEn vertu de l'article 8 cit\u00e9 plus haut, cet honoraire est de 5 p. 100 pour les plans pr\u00e9liminaires, les plans complets, les devis et la surveillance des travaux, et la commission est bas\u00e9e sur le co\u00fbt total de ces m\u00eames travaux. Dans le cas o\u00f9 seulement les plans pr\u00e9liminaires sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par l'architecte, l'honoraire n'est que de un-cinqui\u00e8me de l'honoraire total. (Article 11 du tarif.)\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 que les plans pr\u00e9liminaires, et c'est alors que l'appelante a rescind\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution du 19 septembre 1939, en s'auto-risant, comme elle avait d'ailleurs le droit de le faire, de l'article 1691 C.C. qui dit:\n1691. Le ma\u00eetre peut r\u00e9silier, par sa seule volont\u00e9, le march\u00e9 \u00e0 forfait pour la construction d'un \u00e9difice ou autre ouvrage, quoique l'ouvrage soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9, en d\u00e9dommageant l'entrepreneur de ses d\u00e9penses actuelles et de ses travaux et lui payant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats suivant les circonstances. Quels sont alors les droits de l'intim\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9, par la seule volont\u00e9 de l'appelante, emp\u00each\u00e9 de continuer le travail pour lequel ses services professionnels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 requis? C'est \u00e9videmment de r\u00e9clamer une indemnit\u00e9, comme le lui permet l'article 1691 C.C. Il ne peut \u00e9videm-' ment pas r\u00e9clamer le 5 p. 100 pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'article 8 du tarif car les travaux n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et il n'a ni pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les plans d\u00e9finitifs ni exerc\u00e9 aucune surveillance. Mais je crois que l'article 11 qui lui accorde un cinqui\u00e8me des honoraires pour les esquisses pr\u00e9liminaires, et qui ne supposent aucune ex\u00e9cution de travaux, vient \u00e0 son secours.\nLa preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas que l'intim\u00e9 ait accept\u00e9 d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 seulement si les travaux \u00e9taient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. Quant au troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de la r\u00e9solution, rien dans sa r\u00e9daction ne me permet de conclure qu'elle comporte une semblable renonciation. Elle d\u00e9termine plut\u00f4t le terme de paiement dans le cas d'ex\u00e9cution compl\u00e8te des travaux; elle ne pourvoit pas au paiement de l'honoraire d\u00fb \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 pour la seule pr\u00e9paration des esquisses pr\u00e9liminaires. Je crois en cons\u00e9quence que l'intim\u00e9 peut invoquer l'article 11 du tarif, qui a force de loi, par suite de l'acceptation de ce tarif des architectes par arr\u00eat\u00e9 minist\u00e9riel.\nLes all\u00e9gations dans la d\u00e9claration du demandeur-intim\u00e9 sont telles que son action peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e soit comme une action pour services professionnels, soit comme une action en dommages. Quelle que soit la fa\u00e7on dont on l'envisage, elle doit \u00eatre maintenue, car si le demandeur a institu\u00e9 une action pour services professionels, il a \u00e9tabli qu'il r\u00e9clame conform\u00e9ment au tarif; si d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 il conclut \u00e0 des dommages, le montant de ses honoraires auxquels il a droit, est la mesure qui d\u00e9termine l'\u00e9tendue de ses dommages.\nJe rejetterais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens, et confirmerais le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, qui a accord\u00e9 au demandeur la somme de $9,369.62 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis la date de la signification de l'action.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is the question of fact as to whether or not the preliminary plans prepared by the respondent were executed in pursuance of the contract between the parties. I do not accept the contention of Mr. Monette that, upon the basis of the resolution of the 19th of September, 1939, without more, the respondent was called upon to prepare these plans. I think the pleadings and the course of the trial indicate that the respondent himself did not take such a position, but that his case was that he had received express instructions to proceed with the preparation of the plans or, at the least, that the course of dealing between himself and Roy was on the basis that he should do so.\nThe respondent, for this purpose, relied upon an interview with Roy, which, at first, he placed as having taken place on the 23rd or 24th of September, 1939, two or three days after he had written the directors of the appellant on the 21st of that month accepting the retainer. That any such interview had taken place was denied by Roy, who, according to the evidence, had been in Toronto from September 20th to October 5th. At a later stage of the trial, and after the above evidence had been given, the respondent, being recalled, said that his earlier evidence as to the time had been an error and that the interview had occurred in the early part of October.\nThe learned trial judge said that he preferred the evidence of Roy to that of the respondent, whose evidence, he said, lost force because of the fact that three of the respondent's employees had testified that they had commenced work on the plans in question in the last days of September.\nThe Court of Appeal 3 reversed the finding of the learned trial judge, the view of the majority being that the finding was an inference drawn solely from the respondent's conflicting evidence as to the date of the disputed interview and that the respondent must have had instructions to proceed as it could not have been a mere coincidence that the plans prepared by the respondent bore so close a resemblance to the plans of the nurses' residence later constructed by the appellant. They also took the view that, even if the disputed interview did not take place, the respondent was entitled to proceed with the plans on the basis that the appellant expected him, as a professional man, to do so, under the terms of his employment. With this latter view I have already dealt. Some facts are not in dispute. It is perfectly clear in the first place that at no time, and from no person, did the respondent receive any information to enable him to prepare the plans he actually did prepare apart from the disputed interview between himself and Roy. The evidence also establishes that the plans were completed by February of 1940, and that their preparation occupied a period' of some months, although whether they were commenced in September, or not until October, is in question. The respondent testified that, at the disputed interview, he and Roy discussed the dimensions of the nurses' residence, the number of floors and rooms and the appropriate services and that it was to have five stories and two hundred rooms. He said he also received similar information with respect to the proposed extension to the existing hospital building. It appears that, while the extension to the hospital has not yet been built, the nurses' residence is a building of five stories with two hundred rooms and has a measurement within 37,000 cu. ft. of that shown on the respondent's plans.\nIf the interview in dispute did not take place, the respondent must have prepared the plans in question purely out of the air for the purpose of suggesting something to the directors. That is the appellant's contention. If that be so, it is, as the Court of Appeal 4 thought, somewhat remarkable that the respondent could produce plans bearing so close a resemblance to the building actually erected, because it is common ground, that the respondent's plans were never communicated to the directors of the hospital.\nIt seems to me that a conclusion in accord with appellant's contention is not consistent with the evidence of the plans themselves, which I have carefully examined. In my opinion, plans prepared on the basis suggested by the appellant would not have taken the form of those actually prepared. They would have been more in the nature of sketches and would have been so marked, whereas the plans made are much more complete and exact and the interior minutiae much more extensive than would have been the case were the respondent merely suggesting some-thing to the directors. In the case of the extension to the hospital itself, the plans show the extension integrated at each floor with the existing building. This required an exact knowledge of the dimensions of the existing building, inside and outside as well as its interior lay-out, and it is shown that the respondent obtained all this before proceeding. Two of his employees examined the premises on more than one occasion for the purpose of obtaining the necessary measurements. It seems to me therefore, that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts, as to which there is no dispute, is that the information necessary to prepare the plans here in question, not having been obtained from Roy or anyone in the employ of the hospital at any time other than on the occasion of the disputed interview, must have been obtained as the respondent deposed, even though his statements as to the date it occurred are conflicting.\nThe learned trial judge was influenced in reaching his conclusion by his view that the evidence of the respondent's employees as to when they had commenced work on the plans was much more definite than it in fact was. This is illustrated by the following extracts:\nSavard:\nD.\u2014Voulez-vous dire jusqu'\u00e0 quand vous avez travaill\u00e9 sur ces plans-l\u00e0? R.\u2014Je sais que j'ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'automne, vers la fin de septembre, octobre, novembre, mais j'ai eu d'autre travail \u00e0 faire.\n* * *\nD.\u2014Voulez-vous dire \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s quand vous y \u00eates all\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois? R.\u2014C'\u00e9tait vers la fin de septembre ou au commencement d'octobre. Je me souviens que ce n'\u00e9tait pas en plein \u00e9t\u00e9. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s chaud mais pas trop froid.\nD.\u2014Vous les avez prises \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la b\u00e2tisse, je comprends? R.\u2014Oui.\nD.\u2014Pas \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur? R.\u2014Non, pas la premi\u00e8re fois.\nD.\u2014Etes-vous all\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur? R.\u2014Oui, je suis all\u00e9 personnellement \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur.\nD.\u2014Plus tard? R.\u2014Oui, \u00e0 une visite subs\u00e9quente.\nD.\u2014Combien plus tard? R.\u2014Peut-\u00eatre une semaine, je ne me souviens pas tr\u00e8s bien.\nD.\u2014Quelques jours plus tard? R.\u2014Oui.\nD.\u2014Y \u00eates-vous all\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de monsieur Beauchamp ou y \u00eates-vous all\u00e9 de votre propre chef? R.\u2014A la demande de monsieur Beauchamp. All that the other two witnesses had to say on the point is:\nJarry:\nD.\u2014Avez-vous eu l'occasion de pr\u00e9parer des plans pour l'agrandissement de l'h\u00f4pital Saint-Luc? R.\u2014Il y a eu quelques travaux pr\u00e9liminaires pour l'h\u00f4pital Saint-Luc dans le mois de septembre.\nD.\u2014Ensuite? R.\u2014Ensuite, \u00e9videmment, on a eu d'autres travaux ext\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital Saint-Luc, mais surtout sur l'h\u00f4pital Saint-Luc j'ai travaill\u00e9 du mois de novembre au mois de f\u00e9vrier assid\u00fbment.\nBigonesse:\nD.\u2014Maintenant, pour qui \u00e9tiez-vous \u00e0 l'emploi dans le cours du mois de septembre mil neuf cent trente-neuf (1939)? R.\u2014Pour Beauchamp.\nD.\u2014Pourriez-vous dire \u00e0 la Cour sur quel travail vous avez travaill\u00e9? R.\u2014Sur divers travaux.\nD.\u2014Vous \u00eates-vous occup\u00e9 des plans de l'agrandissement de l'h\u00f4pital Saint-Luc? R.\u2014Oui.\nIn my opinion this evidence is not sufficiently definite to displace the conclusion upon the other facts which I have already discussed.\nThe other point upon which Mr. Brossard quite properly relied was that the respondent, upon completion of his plans, did not submit them to the appellant, and notwithstanding that he met Roy frequently from time to time, did not mention that the plans had been prepared until after he was made aware that the appellant was retaining the services of another architect and was proceeding with the erection of the nurses' residence. This is a circumstance which, it is admitted by Mr. Monette, is on its face extraordinary. The explanation given is that a provincial election took place in October, 1939, which resulted in a change of government and that as the hospital was dependent upon a provincial grant before it could build, it was assumed by all concerned that a grant could not be obtained from the party in power if the respondent's employment were continued. On the 22nd of February, 1940, the directors of the hospital, without any communication with the respondent, passed a resolution rescinding that of the 19th of September, 1939, under which the respondent had been employed. Article 1691 of the Civil Code permits such a course, subject to payment as therein mentioned. While the action of the appellant in thus rescinding the respondent's employment was not communicated to him, it is said that the resolution is cogent evidence of the recognition on the part of the hospital directors of the situation brought about by the change of government, and that the conduct of the respondent in standing by is equally referable to the same event. In view of the conclusion which I think should be reached, apart from this aspect of the matter, I think that this explanation, having been accepted by the Court of Appeal, this court is not in a position to say it should not have done so.\nIn reaching the above decision I do so, well aware of the effect normally to be given to a finding of fact by the tribunal of first instance which hears and sees the witnesses. Had I been convinced that, after a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, the learned trial judge had chosen to believe Roy and to disbelieve the respondent, I would, of course, have accepted that finding, but I do not find that the learned judge had before his mind the cogent effect of the fact of the preparation of the plans themselves, their nature, the time during which they were prepared and the other matters to which I have referred.\nThe question arises as to the relief to which the respondent is entitled. The resolution of the 19th of September, 1939, under which he was engaged is as follows:\nQue la Direction de l'H\u00f4pital Saint-Luc retienne les services de M. Napol\u00e9on Beauehamp, architecte, de Montr\u00e9al, pour la pr\u00e9paration des plans, devis, estim\u00e9s et surveillance des travaux d'agrandissement de son h\u00f4pital et de la construction d'une maison destin\u00e9e aux gardes-malades.\nPour la pr\u00e9paration desdits plans, devis, estim\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9s. M. Beauehamp aura droit d'\u00eatre pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au tarif minimum exigible par l'Association des Architectes de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, suivant le co\u00fbt de la construction des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nIl est entendu, n\u00e9anmoins, que les honoraires et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s de M. Beauehamp ne seront exigibles que pour le montant des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.\nThe effect of the last paragraph of this resolution was not the subject of argument when this appeal was first heard and for that reason we directed that this point should be the subject of re-argument. This has now taken place. Mr. Monette's contention is that the paragraph does not amount to a suspensive condition but merely fixes the time of payment. On the other hand, Mr. Brossard contends that the effect of the paragraph is that the hospital should be under no liability to the respondent unless it actually determines to build.\nThe background of the resolution is that both the hospital directors and the respondent knew that unless government funds were made available the hospital would not be able to proceed. In the light of this circumstance I think it was the purpose of paragraph 3 to protect the hospital against liability to the architect in the event that a decision not to build was made. It is to be remembered', also, that the resolution itself was drafted by the respondent.\nIf, therefore, the hospital had intimated to the respondent before the latter's services were dispensed with, that it did not intend 'to proceed with the works, he would not have had any ground of complaint. That, however, was not what occurred. While the contract was in full force and effect the appellant notified the respondent that his employment was at an end and under the provisions of Article 1691 of the Civil Code he became entitled to damages. At the time of the trial it appeared that the nurses' residence had been proceeded with, if not entirely completed, and I think the measure of damages to be applied, insofar as the plans with relation to that building is concerned, entitles the respondent to the amount claimed, namely, $2,730.11. With respect to the addition to the hospital itself however, what the respondent has lost is the chance that the addition might be proceeded with, in which event he would have been entitled to his fees for the plans he had made. The amount has to be assessed as a jury would determine it and I think that if the respondent were given an amount, in addition to the amount mentioned above, so that his recovery would be $6,000 in all, substantial justice would be achieved.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed to the extent mentioned. As the appellant succeeds in part, I think that it should have one-half of the costs in this court. I would not interfere with the order for costs below.\nAppeal allowed in part and amount of recovery fixed at $6,000.\nSolicitors for the appellant: David, Brossard & Demers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Bernard Nantel.\n1 Q.R.

The appellant contended that the patent as a whole was invalid in that it did not correctly and, fully disclose the invention and that of the claims sued on, 6, 7 and 9 were too broad and 8 was not infringed. The disclosure set forth that certain sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid had been found to increase greatly the efficiency of the froth-flotation process when used with frothing agents and paragraph 4 read: \"The invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance. These form anions and cations in solution.\"\nClaim 6 read: \"The process of concentrating ores which consists in agitating a suitable pulp or an ore with a mineral-frothing agent and an alkaline xanthate adapted to co-operate with the mineral-frothing agent.\" The improvement in the concentration as set out in claim 7 was to be \"in the presence of a xanthate\"; in claim 8, \"in the presence of potassium xanthate\"; and in claim 9, \"in the presence of xanthate and a frothing agent.\"\nHeld: (Kerwin J. dissenting), that in determining whether a patent \"correctly and fully describes the invention,\" the Specification, including the disclosures and claims, is to be read as a whole.\nHeld: also that claims 6, 7, 8 and 9 were invalid since they included substances i.e., xanthates, admittedly harmful to the process.\nPer: Kerwin J., dissenting,\u2014\"Xanthate\" as used in claim 9 must be read as limited by the definition in the disclosures, and as it is a technical word for which there is no precise meaning, the inventor supplied one in paragraph 4 of the disclosures\u2014the term thus limited did not include cellulose xanthates and heavy metal xanthates. APPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court, Thorson J., President, 1 holding that claim 9 of Letters Patent No. 247,576 was valid and had been infringed by the appellant.\nP. C. Finlay K.C. and Christopher Robinson for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. and Cuthbert Scott and J. C. Osborne for the respondent.\nKerwin J.: (dissenting) The defendant in this action, Noranda Mines Limited, appeals against a judgment of the Exchequer Court 2 declaring that claim 9 of Canadian Letters Patent of Invention dated March 10, 1925, was valid and had been infringed by the appellant and ordering the usual consequential relief. The letters patent were issued as the result of an application filed October 23, 1924, for an invention of Cornelius H. Keller relating to Froth Flotation Concentrates of Ores. The respondent is the plaintiff Minerals Separation North American Corporation to whom Keller assigned all his right, title and interest in and to the invention, and to whom the letters patent were issued. Claims 6, 7 and 8 were also in suit but the trial judge, the President of the Exchequer Court, decided that the first of these was void for avoidable obscurity and that, in view of his conclusion as to claim 9, it was unnecessary to deal with 7 and 8. The appellant admits infringement on claim 9 and as I have come to the conclusion that it is valid, no opinion is expressed as to the other three.\nFroth flotation is a method of treating an ore so as to separate the gangue from the values, and which method reduces the bulk of material that has to be subsequently smelted to obtain the desired metal. The operation is accomplished by the addition of a frothing agent to the pulp to which the ore had already been reduced and by such a violent agitation of the pulp that, at the top, a voluminous froth is formed, having the property of tending to cause the values to adhere to the bubbles as they rise through the pulp. The froth is removed and, after the required number of treatments the minerals contained therein are known as the concentrate. For my purpose the process may be thus baldly stated because although it was fully developed in the evidence and is set forth in detail in the reasons for the judgment appealed from, there is no dispute between the parties as to its existence in that form at the earliest time of any importance in the litigation, that is March, 1915, which is relied upon by the appellant as being the time when the use of xanthates in froth flotation concentration of ores was known by one R. B. Martin. In fact the first ground of appeal of the appellant is that the President was in error in holding the contrary. Before proceeding, the other three grounds of alleged error may be stated:\u2014\n2. In holding that the specification of the patent in suit described the invention in the manner required by the statute;\n3. In holding that claim 9 was limited by the disclosure to a certain kind of xanthates;\n4. In holding that the disclosure was limited to a certain kind of xanthates which did not include cellulose xanthate and heavy metal xanthates.\nIt will be convenient to examine the last three of these allegations before turning to the first but attention should now be directed to subsection 1 of section 7 and subsection 1 of section 14, of the Patent Act, chapter 23 of the 1923 Canadian Statutes, which was the enactment in force at the time of the application for, and granting of, the patent in suit. These enactments are as follows:\u2014\n7. (1) Any person who has invented any new and useful art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof, not known or used by others before his invention thereof and not patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country more than two years prior to his application and not in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to his application may, on a petition to that effect, presented to the Commissioner, and on compliance with the other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to such person an exclusive property in such invention.\n14. (1) The specification shall correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor. It shall set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making or compounding, a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. It shall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege. It is upon subsection 1 of section 14 that the appellant relies in connection with its last three submissions and I therefore refer immediately to the disclosure. Paragraphs 2 to 7 inclusive thereof read:\u2014\n2. The invention relates to the froth-flotation concentration of ores, and is herein described as applied to the concentration of certain ores with mineral-frothing agents in the presence of certain organic compounds containing sulphur.\n3. It has been found that certain sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid greatly increase the efficiency of the froth-flotation process when used in connection with mineral-frothing agents. The increased efficiency shows itself sometimes in markedly better recoveries, sometimes in effecting the usual recoveries with greatly reduced quantities of the usual mineral-frothing agents, and sometimes in greatly reducing the time needed for agitation to produce the desired recoveries.\n4. The invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance. These form anions and cations in solution. Excellent results were also obtained by agitating ore pulps with the complex mixture produced when 33 per cent of pine oil was incorporated with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrate, and xanthates or analogous substances were produced by adding carbon disulphide to this mixture.\n5. The galena-bearing froth obtained with xanthates or analogous substances used at the rate of 0.2 pounds per ton of ore had a characteristic bright sheen, like a plumbago-bearing froth, and seemed to make a more coherent froth than when other materials were used on the same ore.\n6. In general the substances referred to are not mineral-frothing agents,\u2014producing only a slight scum, and some evanescent frothy bubbles, when subjected to agitation which would produce mineral-bearing froth on an ore pulp in the presence of a mineral-frothing agent. The substances are effective in enabling a selective flotation of lead and zinc; and cause uncombined silver, if present, to tend to go into the lead concentrate rather than with the zinc, where these are separated in separate concentrates. Usually pre-agitation is unnecessary, the brightening and other effects seeming to be practically instantaneous. The pulps may be either acid, alkaline or neutral according to circumstances.\n7. Two sticks of caustic potash weighing perhaps 15 grams were partly immersed in about 80 cc. of commercial carbon disulphide and kept for about ten days in a closed bottle containing some air in the warm region of the laboraotry where were the hot plates used for drying. These eventually yielded a yellow or orange salt which was used with pine oil at the rate of approximately half a pound to a ton of ore in concentrating Hibernia ore from Timber Butte Mining Company. The test was with a neutral pulp, and the concentrates were seen to be clean with brightened lead sulphide particles.\nParagraph 8 states that for laboratory purposes potassium xanthate was prepared in the manner described and the subsequent paragraphs set forth certain tests, and the specification ends with eleven claims, of which the ninth only need be noticed:\u2014\n9. The improvement in the concentration of minerals by flotation which comprises subjecting the mineral in the form of a non-acid pulp to a flotation operation in the presence of a xanthate and a frothing agent.\nIn its attack the appellant has sought to place each of the paragraphs of the disclosure set out above in a straight jacket and by a meticulous examination of every word has endeavoured to show that Keller never put his finger on what he had discovered. That this is not a proper way to read the specification is made clear by a number of authorities, to one only of which is it necessary to refer. In Smith Incubator Co. v. Seiling 3 Chief Justice Duff states at 255:\u2014\nIt is now. settled law that, for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the claims, the language in which they are expressed must be read in light of the specification as a whole, but it is by the effect of the language employed in the claims themselves, interpreted with such aid as may properly be derived from the other parts of the specification, that the scope of the monopoly is to be determined.\nAnd at page 260, the present Chief Justice notes:\u2014\nAs often observed, of course, the claims must be construed in the light of the rest of the specification; and that is to say, that the specification must be considered in order to assist in comprehending and construing the meaning\u2014and possibly the special meaning\u2014in which the words or the expressions contained in the claims are used.\nIn accordance with this principle, \"xanthate\" as used in claim 9, must be read as limited by the definition in the disclosure. This is not inconsistent with the decision of this Court in B.V.D. Company Limited v. Canadian Celanese 4 as xanthate is a technical chemical word for which there is no precise meaning and, therefore, the inventor supplied one in paragraph 4 of this disclosure. I agree that the words \"such as\" mean \"of the type of\". So read, Keller has made it clear to any one versed in the art that his invention consists of a new and useful improvement in froth flotation concentration of ores by the use of a mineral frothing agent with sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical of the type of an alkyl radical which forms anions and cations in solution. Without detailing the evidence which appears in the President's reasons, I may state that I am satisfied that Keller's disclosure was limited to a certain kind of xanthates, which did not include cellulose xanthates and heavy metal xanthates.\nI now turn to the first argument of the appellant that the use of xanthates in flotation was known in 1915 by Martin and that, therefore, Keller had not, in compliance with subsection 1 of section 7 of the Patent Act, invented any new and useful process not known by others before his invention. Martin was not called as a witness. He had been engaged by the respondent's predecessor in March, 1915, under an employment agreement, and by another agreement of the same date had given an option to a related English company for the purchase, subject to a shop right to Utah Copper Company, of all inventions previously made by him relating to the treatment of ores and to flotation concentrates and reagents. On the same day, Martin disclosed his alleged inventions to Higgins, the chief metallurgist for the respondent's predecessor. Among these was the only one requiring mention, \"NATROLA\", the name he had used at Utah Copper Company for a composition he later called \"STANOL\". At the trial, Higgins said Martin had been provided with laboratory accommodation, chemicals and ores, and that he had supervised Martin's work but that STANOL had been found by Higgins, Martin, and a third party to be of no use. Later, at Higgin's suggestion, Martin incorporated in a document dated August 15, 1915, and known as Bulletin 2, descriptions of his flotation reagents, including Stanol. Applications for patents covering other alleged inventions of Martin were prepared and according to the testimony of Mr. Williams, the respondent's patent attorney, they represented all that Martin had succeeded in demonstrating to be of any value of the inventions brought by him to his employer. Bulletin 2 was discussed between Higgins and Martin when the former found that there were so many formulae in the document that he concluded that they could not all be equally effective and he asked Martin to put the best of each one of them in a book of reference. Some time before October 21, 1915, this book was prepared and handed to Higgins and in it are set out certain notations showing what was most useful in each of the preparations contained in Bulletin 2. This was followed by Bulletin 3 in which STANOL is not mentioned. On October 22, 1915, Bulletin 4 was delivered by Martin to Higgins and on page 9 is mentioned \"STANOL\" and stated that it was not satisfactory on ore at Anaconda Mine. Bulletin 4 is the last one in which mention is made of STANOL notwithstanding that Martin prepared and delivered eighty-eight bulletins in all. Although applications were prepared for KOTRIX and certain reconstructed oils which had been disclosed by Martin, he and Higgins decided that there was nothing of value in STANOL to patent. It appears that shortly after the issue of the Keller patent in the United States, Martin resigned his position with the respondent and subsequently was instrumental in having declared an interference between the Keller United States patent and Martin's own application for a patent. This interference was dissolved without a determination of the question of priority.\nNowhere did Martin claim that STANOL was xanthate. He was thinking of STANOL only and while he theorized as to there being some xanthate in it and that it should be effective in flotations, the evidence all leads to the conclusion that he did not know the value or use of xanthate as such; that is, he did not know the invention that Keller later made. It should be added that there is no suggestion that Keller ever saw Martin's bulletins or books. This makes it unnecessary to consider the respondent's argument that even if Martin did know, section 61(1) (a) of the present Patent Act, 1935, a 32, although enacted in 1932 by c. 21, sec. 4 (after the patent in suit was issued) applies so as to render such knowledge unavailing unless Martin had disclosed or used his process in such manner that it had become available to the public.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand, J.:\u2014The first objection raised by the validity of the patent is that the inventor, in the specification, has failed to satisfy the requirement of the statute that he describe his invention correctly and fully. Both at the trial and before us the defendant pressed the question, what is the invention? And to deal with that initial challenge adequately a statement of the main facts must be given. The invention is stated to be an improvement in a process known as the froth flotation of minerals, a method of separating them which in its modern form dates from the year 1905. These minerals are chemical compounds containing metals such as gold, silver, copper, lead, etc.; and they are found generally in a mixture with other substances, chiefly silicas, called an ore body. The minerals may be thickly or thinly scattered throughout the ore; but their extraction from the mixture is a preliminary to the direct recovery of the metal from the compound in which it appears.\nThe flotation process consists, first of crushing and grinding the ore to varying degrees of fineness: the material is then thoroughly mixed with water into what is called a pulp: an oil or similar substance is added: air is introduced, and the whole well agitated. Masses of bubbles are formed, apparently with an oily film, which, laden with mineral particles, rise to the top in a dark scum called the concentrate. This scum is collected, the froth matter is driven off, and the residue of mineral is then ready for the smelter.\nThe oil or other substance added is primarily a frothing agent: but it has also more or less a collecting function, that is, it produces an attraction between the air bubbles and the mineral particles which causes the latter to cling to the former. The theory of this attraction seems not to be agreed upon, nor whether the emulsified oil in any degree films the particles. But I infer that it is a real attraction, probably of an electro-magnetic nature, and is not merely a mechanical involvement of the particles in the surface tension of the bubbles. The attraction may also be selective: that is, the copper, say, may be caught up in priority to the lead. Some agents are more effective in producing froth than collecting the mineral while others have a converse action: and a combination of two or even more may be used. So many factors of difference in the minerals and in the ores are found, that each mine tends to work out its own best method; changes in the chemical composition may take place more or less constantly, both slowly and rapidly, and local adaptation may become a factor in good operation. For instance, mineral may oxi- dize. Now oxide minerals, in which an oxide of the metal sought predominates, cannot directly be recovered in flotation: the bubbles do not collect the particles. In sulphide minerals, on the other hand, they do. Oxides are therefore washed or filmed with a sulphidizing agent and they then are amenable. The choice of agents to be used may thus, by similar and other conditions, be influenced.\nThe search then became one for more effective collector agents, including agents for sulphidizing, substances that would, at the cheapest cost, gather to the concentrate the greatest quantity of values, or minerals, and the least of the waste or gangue: and the whole field of organic and inorganic chemistry was opened to the exploration.\nIn this state of things, the scientists of the respondent took up the hunt. In 1922, September 19, one of them, a chemist named Keller, in search of a sulphidiser, issued a direction to his associate in metallurgy to test a salt known as potassium xanthate for that purpose. In the course of the next year a great many experiments with xanthate and similar substances were carried out in the company's laboratories at San Francisco and New York. It was discovered that certain xanthates, although not sulphidizing agents, did produce a remarkable increase in the flotation efficacy of frothing or collecting agents. They were not capable of producing froth and did not, apparently, react through coating the particles of mineral. Their property of enhancing the process was demonstrated in March, 1923; and after continuing tests and the exploration of peripheral areas throughout the summer and autumn, application for a patent was made in the U.S.A. on October 21, 1923.\nSince the discovered salts have neither frothing nor sulphidizing powers, they are not directly effective on oxide ores until first sulphidized, and they must be combined with a frothing agent: their role is to influence favourably the process as it was carried on with oils and other substances at the time of the invention. They are therefore new factors whose effect is made upon the existing process, in which they appear to play a part analogous to that of a catalytic agent.\nNow it is obvious that in the field of chemistry family relationship in compounds is likely to be characterized by similar significant reaction results; and that a xanthate has such modifying powers leads at once to the notion of a chemical group which, possessing certain characteristic qualities, may be efficacious in producing the same effects. So it happened with Keller. Having made an important discovery, he set about to distribute the field of such agents not only as a contribution to the operation but also to protect his invention against encroachment. The invention became therefore the discovery of a series of modifiers and the initial question raised is whether there has been a sufficient description of that series. In such a, case an inventor cannot be called on to investigate and to name every possible substance individually of the group; he may do that by a description and that description may be of attributes or by classification.\nThe argument tended to assume that the \"correct and full\" description required by section 14 of chapter 23 of the Patent Act, 1923 must be in what has been called the narrative portion of the specification. But the statute makes no such provision; the specification is to end with the claims, but it is in the specification that the description must be given: and to the whole of it we are entitled to look to ascertain what the invention is. The language of Duff C.J. in Smith Incubator Co v. Seiling, 5 at p. 257, in which he speaks of the specification \"as a whole\", seems to me to have been carefully phrased to avoid the restrictive interpretation suggested.\nThe specification recites that \"it has been found that certain sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid\" are effective for the purposes of flotation. It then proceeds to reduce this general statement to defined particulars by furnishing examples of derivatives which embody the special property, by indicating certain characteristics and lastly by delimiting, in the claims, the boundaries, within the field of the derivatives, of the group for which the inventor asserts monopoly. The introductory sentence to the claims, \"Having described certain embodiments of the invention, what is claimed is\", clearly, I think, relates the claims to the description as well as the delineation of the exclusive field. What the disclosure lacks to a full description is the completion of enumeration; at this point description has become enumeration, and that is furnished by the claims. I take the disclosure to imply in fact that the invention consists of those sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid which are described or defined in the claims. So far as a claim may include, for instance, a useless or an antagonistic substance, it is, as a definition of the monopoly, defective, but its descriptive function remains. The only question then is whether when the description contains a substance of no value or use the patent ipso facto is invalid as not specifying the invention correctly and fully. The special circumstance here is that the invention is a distributive discovery; (a), (b), (c) and (d) are asserted individually and severally; the first three have in fact been invented and are correctly and fully described; but the inventor has also described as invention, (d), which he has not invented. Assuming a claim which does not include (d), it is as if the inventor had declared, I assert I have also invented (d) but I do not claim it. Only if we treat the invention as being of the group as an entirety, can it be said that the description is not correct; but that is not what the specification here intends. The substances are to be viewed as quasi-independent inventions but by the necessities of the case they can distributively be made the subject of a single patent.\nThe invention is therefore the use in flotation of those substances taken distributively which are sulphur derivatives and which are of such nature or characteristics, are so combined, and react in such conditions as are expressed in the specification as a whole. To require the full detailed description to be given in the so-called narrative would necessitate a virtual repetition of the claims. Taking the specification in its totality, Keller has, I think, met the requirement of the statute: no competent metallurgist would have any difficulty in grasping the discovery in all its essentials.\nAgainst this conception, it is said that the expression \"sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid\" is ambiguous, on which there would be wide divergencies of opinion in metallurgists or chemists. But it is agreed by Dr. Purves, for the appellant, that a sulphur derivative is one in which the oxygen of the formula H2CO3 is replaced by sulphur. The initial replacements would result in H2CO2S, H2COS2 and H2CS3, mono-, di-, and tri-thio-carbonates. Dr. Purves, however, in a chart of resultant combinations, in the mono- and di-groups substituted chlorine or an ammonium radical for OH: in doing that he violated, I think, the primary premise of sulphur substitution for the oxygen. In this I accept the opinion of Higgins, the chief metallurgist of the respondent, that \"derivative\" means exactly what it says, and that the introduction of CI and NH2, though it does produce a derivative containing sulphur, does not produce a sulphur derivative of carbonic acid; it would properly be called a chlorine or other derivative of a sulphur derivative; but to that the statement of the discovery does not extend.\nThe invention was one of great value to the mining industry and brought in a group of agents of which there had been no previous knowledge or experience. It was not only natural but legitimate that the inventor should have endeavoured to protect his discovery. Precise description in such an uncharted field is hedged with difficulty; and although overreaching must draw its penalty, we are not called upon to employ microscopic means of discovering it nor to insist upon a pedantic accuracy to satisfy a formal symmetry.\nA great deal of the evidence was taken up with matter arising out of the 4th paragraph of the specification which reads:\u2014\nThe invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance. These form anions and cations in solution. Excellent results were also obtained by agitating ore pulps with the complex mixture produced when 33 per cent of pine oil was incorporated with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrate, and xanthates or analogous substances were produced by adding carbon disulphide to this mixture.\nThe respondent took the position that here was an exclusive description of xanthate for the purposes of the specification; that the xanthates intended to be denoted by that term were those containing an alkyl radical, which in solution formed anions and cations. These compounds, it may be stated, are salts of xanthic acid. That restrictive definition was considered necessary seemingly to support claim 9 which speaks of \"a xanthate\", by excluding certain xanthates which admittedly are of no value, such as cellulose and certain of the heavy metal compounds. This re- duction of the discovery to special xanthates and \"similar substances\" mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 7 appears to me to be incompatible with the plain meaning of the language of the paragraphs as well as of the specification generally. What the narrative does is to furnish the circumstances and results in tests of certain \"embodiments\" of the invention, or, as one might say, of certain members of the group discovered. The reference may be taken as limited to such xanthates; but they are named only as illustrative examples: they, only, are disclosed in some detail; but that the language is intended to furnish a conventional meaning of xanthate to be carried forward into the claims is a conclusion which I am quite unable to draw.\nThe claims which the defendant is charged with infringing are numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9. The first, 6, is as follows:\u2014\nThe process of concentrating ores which consists in agitating a suitable pulp of an ore with a mineral-frothing agent and an alkaline xanthate adapted to co-operate with the mineral-frothing agent to produce by the action of both a mineral-bearing froth containing a large proportion of a mineral of the ore, said agitation being so conducted as to form such a froth, and separating the froth.\nIt was attacked as ambiguous in the expression \"alkaline xanthate\". Admittedly xanthates are neither alkaline nor acid: they are neutral; and the adjective, as every competent metallurgist would know, cannot be taken to indicate such a characteristic of the substance. Nor do I think it can be taken to refer to the condition of the pulp. But, in some sense it does clearly qualify xanthate and I find no difficulty in satisfying myself in what that lies. Throughout the disclosure it appears that xanthates of potassium and sodium were used exclusively in the experiments. These are two alkali metals which in the standard formula for xanthate replace the hydrogen atom associated with sulphur. The disclosure also describes 'how these xanthates were made by the inventor, which was by first dissolving the hydrate of the one or the other in ethyl alcohol and then adding carbon disulphide. From these facts and the somewhat free and imprecisely adapted use of adjectival language by chemists, as well as the general knowledge of the chemistry of xanthates, I think it a reasonable inference that the language is intended to describe xanthates in which the metal or radical which replaces the hydrogen atom is that which comes from an alkali, those in the making of which an alkali is used. Several alternatives were suggested. The meaning attributed by the respondent was alkali metals, which are those present in alkalies: the appellant suggested, in addition, alkaline earths which are earths, i.e. oxides, of chlorine and certain allied elements, and which exhibit properties midway between alkalies and earths: but I am unable to take the word to relate to either of these classes. Claim 5, in specifying an \"alkali metal\" salt, seems to conclude the question against the first; and the second falls through its own remoteness,\nIt was contended by Mr. Robinson that, on the respondent's interpretation, the inclusion of ammonium xanthate invalidated the claim because that substance was of no value in flotation. The evidence relied on is the report of Keller in which he describes the combination of ammonium hydrate with alcohol and carbon disulphide to produce what he took to be xanthate. But both Higgins and Dr. Purves agree that ammonium xanthate cannot be so produced and that Keller was wrong in his chemistry. Whatever the product his mixture gave him, whether good or bad for his purpose, it was not xanthate; and ammonium xanthate has not been shown to be of no utility.\nBut it would appear that whether we take the expression to signify alkali or alkali metal, the same objection arises. The evidence discloses that cellulose xanthate is a product from ingredients of which the alkali, sodium hydrate, is one; it is then a xanthate embraced within both meanings; and since admittedly it is harmful to the process, the claim cannot stand.\nBut with this, the language \"with a mineral-frothing agent and an alkaline xanthate adapted to co-operate with the mineral-frothing agent to produce by the action of both a mineral-bearing froth containing a large proportion of a mineral of the ore\" must be considered. At trial, the appellant challenged this language as insufficient in not specifying which xanthates were \"adapted\" and which not. In this interpretation \"adapted\" relates to the properties of the xanthate necessary to co-operative action, and its effect would be that it would restrict xanthates to those that could be successfully used. Mr. Gowling, in his factum, states that \"it simply means that the purpose of mixing the two substances is to enable them to co-operate together to give the desired result.\" I must confess to a difficulty in appreciating the sense intended to be conveyed by this but, in my opinion, in any admissible sense the clause cannot be taken validly to restrict the scope of \"alkaline xanthate\" to those that will co-operate, and the clause does not, therefore, affect the conclusion otherwise reached.\nThe second claim, 7, reads:\u2014\nThe improvement in the concentration of minerals by flotation which comprises subjecting the mineral in the form of a non-acid pulp to a flotation operation in the presence of a xanthate.\nThis is met by the formidable objection that \"a xanthate\" means any xanthate including cellulose xanthate. It may be convenient to state here that \"cellulose\" xanthate is a description in terms of the organic radical used; but xanthates are also known in terms of their metal or of both the metal and radical. The only answer to this is the special interpretation given paragraph 4 with which I have already dealt. The common knowledge contained in. the working chemistry dictionaries in 1923 extended to a great many xanthates besides those of soluble metals or alkyl radicals. They had become in fact known to Keller. For these as well as the reasons already given, I must give the language its ordinary meaning and hold the claim invalid.\nA second objection is that the claim extends to the use of xanthate without a frothing agent. If it stood alone, I should be disposed to interpret \"flotation operation\" as including a frothing function. But the express mention of a \"frothing agent\" in claim 9 in collocation with \"flotation operation\" implies there either some special conjunction with the xanthate or that two frothing agents are contemplated, or that \"flotation operation\" is not intended to embrace frothing. The duty of an inventor is to define intelligibly and consistently the boundaries of his exclusive area, and it would be doing violence to this requirement to accept either of the first two suggested meanings; I must then take it that where a frothing agent is not mentioned it is intended to be excluded as a requirement. On this ground, also, the claim fails.\nClaim 8 is as follows:\u2014\nThe improvement in the concentration of minerals by flotation which comprises subjecting the mineral in the form of a non-acid pulp to a flotation operation in the presence of potassium xanthate. It raises the same question of frothing agent just considered and for the same reason it is defective.\nIt was urged that the appellant did not use potassium xanthate within six years preceding the commencement of action. The respondent's answer was both that Exhibit M2 shows that use and that sodium xanthate is a chemical equivalent. The contradiction arises from the fact that the ' defendant takes potassium xanthate in the claim to mean potassium ethyl xanthate and the respondent that it covers potassium xanthate with any alkyl radical. Paragraph 8 of the specification sets out the method followed by Keller to make potassium xanthate and the ingredients used show that he made potassium ethyl xanthate. But that was for laboratory purposes only and there is no implication that it is the only potassium xanthate or that for the purposes of the specification potassium xanthate means that with the ethyl radical. Both amyl and hexyl radicals are mentioned in Exhibit No. 6 listing the xanthates made before 1923. Notwithstanding the evidence of Higgins, that, in common parlance among metallurgists, in the absence of reference to the radical, ethyl is understood, I think the respondents are right in their interpretation.\nThis in turn raises the question of potassium cellulose xanthate. The metal used in cellulose xanthate, in the manufacture of rayon, is sodium: but the evidence of Bennett is that potassium xanthate of cellulose has the same effect on flotation as the sodium compound, a conclusion which would follow from the fact, agreed upon, that in these compounds the two metals are interchangeable.\nAssuming the expression signifies ethyl xanthate, the contention that sodium is, for this purpose, an equivalent must be considered. Both sodium and potassium xanthates, presumably ethyl, are disclosed as having been made and tested and found beneficial to flotation. Potassium was evidently more fully explored than sodium although the latter would appear to be the cheaper product. Both were thought, no doubt, to be protected under claim 7: and we are entitled to ask, why, then, the special claim for the one and not the other. It may be that potassium xanthate was looked upon as the central and basic discovery which would carry with it any such equivalent. But that is a speculation which I do not feel at liberty to act upon. An equivalent is a known substitute means to a certain end; but here sodium xanthate is known as a modifying agent only as it has been discovered as part of the invention. To select one of two substances so discovered is impliedly to exclude the other: otherwise it would be to patent the invented substance not directly but as an equivalent; but the specification makes it quite clear that these two substances are not being dealt with in that manner.\nThe claim, then, is too broad and fails.\nThe last is 9:\u2014\nThe improvement in the concentration of minerals by flotation which comprises subjecting the mineral in the form of a non-acid pulp to a flotation operation in the presence of a xanthate and a frothing agent.\nThis the President held valid. He accepted the contention that paragraph 4 defines and limits xanthates for the purposes of the specification, i.e, those containing an alkyl radical and forming anions and cations in solution. With this I have already dealt. It is a matter of interest that on the original application in the United States, the words were, \"as carried out with salts of the alkyl sulphur derivatives\"; to change this to \"salts of the sulphur derivates * * * containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical\" is, in my opinion, to put the actual intention of the draughtsman in the Canadian document beyond controversy; and interpreting the paragraph in the context of the specification as plain and unambiguous language, I find it to carry out that intention.\nOn the plain language of this claim, it is bad: there were known to Keller many xanthates which were of no value to the process. In opening the case, counsel for the respondent, speaking of claim 7, stated that \"a xanthate\" meant \"any xanthate\" and that I think is precisely what it means in 9. The reconstruction of paragraph 4 now put forward appears to me as an artificial patchwork which imputes meaning beyond the capacity of the words to bear.\nAs is seen, the claims fail chiefly because of the inclusion of xanthates which are antagonistic or uselss to the flotation. That of cellulose is most prominent, and in this it is the radical, cellulose, that provides the destructive element. There are at least sixteen organic radicals with which before 1923 xanthate had been made; in the tests of Keller the ethyl radical was used almost exclusively: but cellulose which had become well-known through the development of rayon was in fact tested and found hostile. In other xanthates it is the metal that is known to furnish that character.\nThese conclusions diverge from those of the President on the point of the interpretation of paragraphs 4 and 7; and as the language of these paragraphs is set against that of the claims, we have a good example of the sort of thing mentioned by Earl Loreburn in Natural Colouir v. Bioschemes 6:\u2014\"Some of those who draft Specifications and Claims are apt to treat this industry as a trial of skill, in which the object is to make the Claim very wide upon one interpretation of it, in order to prevent as many people as possible from competing with the patentee's business and then to rely upon carefully prepared sentences in the specification which, it is hoped, will be just enough to limit the claim within safe dimensions if it is attacked in Court.\" As in B.V.D. v. Canadian Celanese 7 the claims are wide and general; and for the reasons there given, they cannot be restricted by the language of the disclosure.\nSeveral other objections were raised, the most important of which was that the invention had already been known by Martin, a chemist employed by the parent company of the respondent; but in view of the conclusion reached on the claims, consideration on these grounds becomes unnecessary.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nKellock J.: The specification states that one, Keller, has invented \"certain\" new and useful improvements in \"froth-flotation concentration of ores\" and he declares that what follows is a \"clear, full and exact description of the same\". The next paragraph reads:\nThis invention relates to the froth-flotation concentration of ores, and is herein described as applied to the concentration of certain ores with mineral-frothing agents in the presence of certain organic compounds containing sulphur.\nSo far, it would appear that the \"invention\" with which the paragraph opens, is something different from the \"certain organic compounds containing sulphur\" with which the paragraph concludes. In paragraph 3, however, the inventor states what he has found in the following language:\u2014\nIt has been found that certain sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid greatly increase the efficiency of the froth-flotation process when used in connection with mineral-frothing agents.\nThe paragraph then gives particulars of the respects in what this increased efficiency shows itself. Paragraph 4 then follows:\u2014\nThe invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance. These form anions and cations in solution. Excellent results were also obtained by agitating ore pulps with the complex mixture produced when 33\u2153 per cent of pine oil was incorporated with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrate, and xanthates or analogous substances were produced by adding carbon disulphide to this mixture.\nIn paragraph 5 the inventor says:\nThe galena-bearing froth obtained with xanthates or analogous substances used at the rate of 0.2 pounds per ton of ore had a characteristic bright sheen, like a plumbago-bearing froth, and seemed to make a more coherent froth than when other materials were used on the same ore.\nIn paragraph 6 he says:\nIn general the substances referred to are not mineral-frothing agents * * * The substances are effective in enabling a selective flotation of lead and zinc * * * Usually pre-agitation is unnecessary * * * The pulps may be either acid, alkaline or neutral according to circumstances.\nIn my opinion, taking the view for the moment that \"the invention\" is to be found in paragraph 4, such invention is really twofold\u2014(1) the use of xanthates, and (2), the use of the \"analogous substances\" in flotation. I do not think either can properly be described as primary or secondary. The inventor in paragraph 5 says that either produce the results therein described, and in paragraph 6 he says that \"the substances\", i.e., both the xanthates and the analogous substances, are not mineral-frothing agents and may be used in acid, alkaline or neutral pulps.\nAs the claims here in question relate to xanthates only, I do not consider it necessary to consider further the \"analogous substances\" in view of the conclusion to which I have come with respect to the claims.\nWith respect to xanthates, the respondent contends that paragraph 4 is to be read as saying that \"the invention\" consists of xanthates containing an alkyl radical and a soluble metal. This, in effect, is the view which commended itself to the learned trial judge. Appellant on the other hand, says that the paragraph does not so state and that \"the invention' 'is not defined by the paragraph, but is only described as carried out with certain substances, the ambit of the invention being left vague. Appellant further says that if the paragraph is a definition, the expression \"such as an alkyl radical\" is used in the sense of \"for example\" and the organic radicals mentioned in the paragraph are not limited to alkyl but extend to all organic radicals or, alternatively, if limited by the expression, the radicals are all organic radicals of the type of alkyl. In appellant's contention these include all aliphatic radicals which react chemically in the same way as alkyl radicals. Appellant further submits that the second sentence of the paragraph is not part of the definition but even if it is properly to be so considered cellulose xanthate would be included and cellulose xanthate is not only useless but positively harmful in flotation.\nThe first question to be considered therefore, is the proper construction of paragraph 4. I deal first with the opening sentence of the paragraph.\nAccording to Murray's English Dictionary, 1919 Edition, \"such\" is a demonstrative word used to indicate the quality or quantity of a thing by reference to that of another or with respect to the effect that it produces or is capable of producing. Head 9 deals wih uses of the words \"such as\" marked by special word-order and in sub-paragraph (d) which follows upon illustrations of attributive use after a substantive, the authors state that the expression such as \"is used to introduce examples of a class:=for example, e.g.\"\nHad the expression used in paragraph 4 read \"such an organic radical as an alkyl radical\" the situation might have been more in favour of the respondent's contention but the expression actually used \"an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical\" points to the construction that the patentee was using the phrase \"an alkyl radical\" by way of example or illustration only. If \"an alkyl radical\" and an alkyl radical only had been intended it would have been simple to so state, but in the absence of any context other than that furnished by the first sentence of the paragraph itself, the patentee appears not to be limiting himself to alkyl radicals but is including the larger field.\nIt is well settled that the specification is to be read as a whole and the claims, of course, are part of the specifications. In Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Company Ld. v. Clark 8 Warrington J., as he then was, said:\n* * * the Claims are to be looked at as intended to define the invention, to point out what it is that the inventor regards as new, and for which he claims protection, and the general rule in dealing with claims is to treat what is not claimed as being disclaimed.\nIn Jackson v. Wolstenhulmes 9, Cotton L.J. said at 108:\nThe object of a claim is this, to restrict and cut down what might be suggested as the claim made by the previous part of the description, so as to show what it does consist of, and to prevent the patent from being defeated in consequence of words being used which might lead to the inference that something which was not intended to be claimed was claimed, and thus the patent being defeated by there being included in the previous part of the specification that which was not new but old.\nPerhaps the most authoritative statement is that of Lord Russell of Killowen in Electric and Musical Industries v. Lissen 10, as follows:\nThe function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed, so that others may know the exact boundaries of the area within which they will be trespassers. Their primary object is to limit and not to extend the monopoly. What is not claimed is disclaimed. The claims must undoubtedly be read as part of the entire document and not as a separate document; but the forbidden field must be found in the language of the claims and not elsewhere. It is not permissible, in my opinion, by reference to some language used in the earlier part of the specification to change a claim which by its own language is a claim for one subject-matter into a claim for another and a different subject-matter, which is what you do when you alter the boundaries of the forbidden territory. A patentee who describes an invention in the body of a specification obtains no monopoly unless it is claimed in the claims.\nIn Smith Incubator Co. v. Seiling 11, Duff C.J.C., at 256 quoted Lord Loreburn in Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Co. v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co. Ltd. 12 as follows:\nWe are asked to construe the claim with reference to the specification, not in order to understand what the former says, but to make it say things which in fact it does not say at all.\nThe claims then define and limit the ambit of the invention and may be read with the disclosure in the earlier part of the specification \"in order to understand what the former says\". Accordingly, one finds that claim 10 claims the use of \"a sulphur derivative of carbonic acid containing an organic radical\", simpliciter. The same is true of claim 11, the only difference being that it is \"a salt of a sulphur derivative of carbonic acid containing an organic radical\" which is there claimed. One contrasts with this language that which is found in claim 3 where the wording is \"a salt of an alkyl sulphur derivative of carbonic acid\". In these circumstances I do not think it open to the patentee to say that when he said in paragraph 4 \"an organic radical, such an alkyl radical\" he used that wording as the equivalent of \"an alkyl radical\" simpliciter. To permit this would enable the patentee to say under claim 10 or 11 as against an infringer using an organic radical in his process but not an alkyl radical, that paragraph 4 extended to all organic radicals and that the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical\" had been used as an illustration only. Alternatively also, it would be open to him to put forward the present argument that paragraph 4 meant \"an alkyl radical\" simpliciter and that claims 10 and 11 were obviously too wide and should not have scared off anyone from using anything except an alkyl radical. There is a well settled principle which prevents language being so used by a patentee whose obligation under section 14 of the Patent Act of 1923 is to \"correctly and fully describe the invention as contemplated by the inventor\" and to \"set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making or compounding a machine, manufacture or composition of matter\". The specification must \"end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege\".\nIn Natural Colour Kinematograph Co. Ld. v. Bioschemes Ld., 13, at 266, Lord Loreburn said:\nSome of those who draft Specifications and Claims are apt to treat this industry as a trial of skill, in which the object is to make the Claim very wide upon one interpretation of it, in order to prevent as many people as possible from competing with the patentee's business, and then to rely upon carefully prepared sentences in the Specification which, it is hoped, will be just enough to limit the Claim within safe dimensions if it is attacked in Court. This leads to litigation as to the construction of Specifications, which could generally be avoided if at the outset a sincere attempt were made to state exactly what was meant in plain language. The fear of a costly lawsuit is apt to deter any but wealthy competitors from contesting a Patent. This is all wrong. It is an abuse which a Court can prevent, whether a charge of ambiguity is or is not raised on the Pleading, because it affects the public by practically enlarging the monopoly, and does so by a kind of pressure which is very objectionable. It is the duty of a patentee to state clearly and distinctly, either in direct words or by clear and distinct reference, the nature and limits of what he claims. If he uses language which, when fairly read, is avoidably obscure or ambiguous, the Patent is invalid, whether the defect be due to design, or to carelessness or to want of skill. Where the invention is difficult to explain, due allowance will, of course, be made for any resulting difficulty in the language. But nothing can excuse the use of ambiguous language when simple language can easily be employed, and the only safe way is for the patentee to do his best to be clear and intelligible. It is necessary to emphasize thi3 warning.\nIn the case at bar if the present contention of the respondent as to his meaning is correct, there was no more difficulty at the date of the application than now in so expressing it, but in my view, upon the internal evidence furnished by the specification itself, that is not what the draughtsman had in mind in the preparation of the first sentence of paragraph 4.\nThis conclusion is confirmed by a reference to what occurred in connection with the application in the United States, which antedated the application in Canada. In the original application the wording used in paragraph 4 was \"the invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the alkyl sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid known as xanthates as the new substance\". This was subsequently amended by striking out the word \"alkyl\" where it appeared before the word \"sulphur\" and by inserting after the word \"said\" the words \"containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical\" so as to produce the form of wording in the Canadian application. As I have already stated, I have reached my conclusion as to the construction of the Canadian patent upon the internal evidence of that patent itself. The American proceedings merely illustrate that the respondent intended the meaning that, in my opinion, the language he adopted in the Canadian patent properly bears. I think therefore that the invention described in the first sentence of paragraph 4 extends to all organic radicals.\nComing to the second sentence, \"These form anions and cations in solution\" the respondent says that this sentence limits the substances referred to in the first sentence and that these substances must be soluble, as that term would be understood at the date of the patent by a skilled workman in the flotation field. Again it may be pointed out that it would have been a simple matter for the patentee to have spoken in the first sentence of paragraph 4 of \"soluble salts of sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an alkyl radical and known as xanthates\". Appellant says that he did not do so and that the second sentence forms no part of the description of the xanthates referred to in the first sentence. That is that the second sentence cannot be read as meaning that the only substances referred to by the patentee are those which have some particular degree of solubility. The appellant contends, further, however, that even if the second sentence of the paragraph is part of the definition cellulose xanthate is included.\nIn 1923 the only xanthate in commercial use according to the evidence was cellulose xanthate which was used in the rayon industry. Keller himself experimented with cellulose xanthate prior to July of that year but did not find it useful and, according to the evidence of the witness, Bennett, cellulose xanthate is not only useless but absolutely harmful for flotation purposes. This is accepted by the respondent and is 'the subject of an express finding by the learned trial judge.\nAs to the word \"soluble\" the evidence is that it would be interpreted in accordance with the use to be made of the information. Dr. Purves said that to a practical organic chemist if a substance is soluble to the extent of a few tenths of one per cent it would satisfy his understanding of the term. There is no contradiction of this or that a metallurgist would have any different view. The witness Bennett, a practical metallurgist, used a one per cent solution of cellulose xanthate in tests performed by him. In the respondent's factum it is stated that \"flotation re-agents do not necessarily have to be very soluble: 2 pounds of re-agent to one ton of ore, i.e., 4 tons of water are ordinarily used\".\nRespondent contends, however, 'that such a solution is not a true solution but a colloidal one and the respondent's witness, Higgins, said that in 1923 colloids were avoided like poison in flotation. I do not think that this evidence is sufficient to remove cellulose xanthate from the ambit of paragraph 4 of the specification, if it is otherwise included as I think it is. The utility of the use of any xanthate in flotation was entirely new in 1923 and I do not think it can be said that a metallurgist, on reading the specification at that time would, without test, have excluded cellulose xanthate from paragraph 4 merely because it was a colloid. He would have no experience or knowledge of xanthate and therefore the language of paragraph 4 would, in my opinion, be taken by him as including cellulose xanthate. There are two matters in evidence which confirm this view. The first has already been referred to, namely, that Keller experimented with cellulose xanthate before discarding it. In the second place, in Bennett's view a metallurgist in 1923 would have tested cellulose xanthate before he would know whether it was useful or not. I therefore think that it has been made out that cellulose xanthate comes within the meaning of paragraph 4, even taking the view that the second sentence is part of the description of xanthates covered by the paragraph.\nIt is contended on the part of the respondent however, that any practical metallurgist, on reading the specification, would first try potassium and sodium xanthate and would go no further and that the difficulty of storing and transporting cellulose xanthate, its cost and other considerations would exclude it in his mind.\nIn Norton and Gregory Ld. v. Jacobs 14 Sir Wilfred Greene, M.R., said at 276:\nThe fact that a skilled chemist desiring to use the invention would reject certain reducing agents as being unsuitable is one thing; it is quite a different thing to say that a claim must in point of construction be cut down so as to exclude those reducing agents because a skilled chemist would not use them. To adopt the latter proposition would not be to construe the Specification but to amend it, * * *\nAs pointed out by Lord Normand in Raleigh Cycle Co. v. H. Miller & Co. Ltd. 15 at 318, the above observation, while directed to the construction of claims, applies with equal force to the disclosure. The decision of Warrington J. in Thermit Ld. v. Weldite Ld. 16, is distinguishable. See also Vidal Dyes Syndicate Ld. v. Levinstein Ld. 17 per Fletcher Moulton L.J., at page 272. In my opinion therefore the invention described in the specification extends to cellulose xanthate. Coming then to the claims, those which are in question are 6, 7, 8 and 9. With respect to claim 6, the material words are \"alkaline xanthate\". According to the respondent, what was intended was \"alkali-metal Xanthate\", and in the opinion of Mr. Higgins the term used would be so understood by a metallurgist. It is admitted that \"alkaline xanthate\" is a contradiction in terms, as all xanthates are neutral. According to Dr. Purves, a number of possible constructions could be given to the words. In claim 5 the phrase \"alkali-metal salt\" is used. It therefore seems that when the draughtsman of the specification intended \"alkali-metal\" he knew how to so express himself. When he used the word \"alkaline\" in claim 6 the presumption is that something else was intended. This is left in ambiguity. Even if the contention of the respondent be accepted that \"alkaline\" is to be read \"alkali-metal\" the latter expression would include sodium and potassium cellulose xanthate. From any point of view, therefore, the claim in my opinion is invalid.\nClaims 7 and 9 may be considered together. The relevant expression is \"a xanthate\". The respondent seeks to read these claims as limited to the xanthates described in paragraph 4 of the disclosure. For the reasons already given in considering the proper construction to be placed upon that paragraph, these claims are invalid as extending to cellulose xanthate. Apart from this, my opinion on the authorities is that the expression \"a xanthate\" in the above claim is not to be so limited. In my view the case does not come within the principle applied in Western Electric Co. v. Baldwin 18, but rather within that applied in the B.V.D. Co. v. Canadian Celanese Ltd. 19.\nIn Baldwin's case the question related to the construction of claim 2, which read:\nThe combination with a plurality of thermionic repeaters connected in tandem, the first repeater of the series having a high-voltage output and the last repeater of the series having a high-current output\nIt was held that the language of the claim was to be interpreted by the specification as a whole and that the thermionic repeaters mentioned in the claim must be taken to be thermionic repeaters having the characteristics ascribed \"by definition\" in the specification. It will be sufficient to quote the specification itself, in part:\nIt has been discovered that audions of the usual type may be so constructed that, without the use of transformers, they will step up the input voltage of either direct current or alternating current of any frequency in one step to as much as 30 times its original value, or in two successive steps to as much as 500 times its original value The voltage amplification thus secured is entirely free from wave distortion whatever may be the initial frequency and wave form. This type of audion will, for convenience, be hereinafter referred to as the high-voltage output audion.\nIt has furthermore been discovered that audions may be constructed which will step down the input voltage, for example, to one-third of its original value. This last mentioned type of audion has a high-current and a low voltage output. Because of its low output impedance, i.e., the low impedance between its cathode and anode, such type of audion can be worked efficiently into a line of like impedance. This new type of audion will, for convenience, hereinafter be referred to as the high-current output audion.\n* * *\nIt has been discovered that a combination of one or more of the aforementioned high voltage output type of audions working into one of the high-current output type, will operate, without transformers, from a line of low impedance, for example, 250 ohms, into a like line with a resultant current much greater, fifty or more times greater, than would flow in the second circuit if it were directly connected to the first circuit. The present invention is directed to such combination of two different types of repeaters, preferably, audions.\nIn giving the judgment of the court Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., said at page 578:\nTo revert to the definitions of the combination to which, as the specification says, \"the invention is directed,\" it would be difficult to find any construction, consistent with the grammatical sense of the words, that would exclude the absence of transformers from the essential features of the combination in respect of which protection is claimed. First of all, he defines the \"high-voltage output audion\"; and an element of that definition is that \"without the use of transformers\" it will perform certain operations on the input current.\nThen, there is a definition of the \"high-current output audion,\" which does not explicitly make the absence of transformers an essential element, but which, as already indicated, appears very clearly to do so when it is read with the specification as a whole properly construed.\nThen, after mentioning that the patentee has applied for patents in respect of these types of audions, he proceeds to describe the combination, and the combination, which is the invention for which he desires protection, is of one or more of the aforementioned high voltage output type of audions (a type which, by definition, is of such a construction that it performs the function assigned to it in this circuit arrangement without the use of transformers) with one of the high-current output type.\nAnd at page 583:\nI have no doubt whatever that, on a proper construction of the specifications as a whole, the combination mentioned in the second claim is the combination described in the passage just quoted; or that the \"thermionic\" repeaters mentioned in the claim must be taken to be thermionic repeaters having the characteristics ascribed by definition to those with which the inventor has succeeded in securing the results which he says are secured by his invention. As a matter of construction, the point does not really appear to me to be open to serious argument.\nIn my opinion the result of the judgment is that the court found that \"a high voltage output\" repeater and a \"high-current output\" repeater, as those expressions were used in claim 2 were to be construed by the definition contained in the disclosure which, as the disclosure itself says would be the expressions \"hereinafter\" used as meaning the types defined.\nWhen one turns to the Canadian Celanese case, the distinction between that case and Baldwin's case is obvious. In fact, although three of the members of the court who decided the Celanese case had sat on the former appeal, the Baldwin case was not mentioned. The disclosure in the patent, which it was claimed by the respondent had been infringed, described the invention as associating a woven, knitted or other fabric, made of yarns of a thermoplastic cellulose derivative, with other fabrics. The claim, however, did not mention yarns at all but merely referred to \"a thermoplastic derivative of cellulose\". It was held that the use of the cellulose derivative in the form of yarns, filaments or fibres was of the very essence of the invention but that the claims must be interpreted as they stood. In both the British and United States patents the claims had expressly mentioned yarns, or filaments or fibres. At page 237 Davis J., giving the judgment of the court said:\nWe are invited to read through the lengthy specification and import into the wide and general language of the claims that which is said to be the real inventive step disclosed. But the claims are unequivocal and complete upon their face. It is not necessary to resort to the context and as a matter of construction the claims do not import the context. In no proper sense can it be said that though the essential feature of the invention is not mentioned in the claims the process defined in the claims necessarily possesses that essential feature. The Court cannot, limit the claims by simply saying that the inventor must have meant that which he has described. The claims in fact go far beyond the invention. Upon that ground the patent in invalid.\nThe same result was reached by the Court of Appeal in England in a similar case, Molins and Molins Machine Co. Ltd. v. Industrial Machinery Co., Ltd. 20.\nIn my opinion, in the case at bar, we \"cannot limit the claims by simply saying that the inventor must have meant that which he has described\". \"A xanthate\" is what the patentee claims. This would include at least one xanthate which will not work. The claim is therefore invalid.\nWith respect to claim number 8, which is limited to \"potassium xanthate\", the appellant says it has not infringed this claim as it has not used potassium xanthate, although it has used sodium xanthate. The respondent contends however, that sodium xanthate is the chemical equivalent and that the appellant's use constituted an infringement. The question in my opinion resolves itself, first, into the question as to whether the respondent has, upon the true construction of the specification as a whole, excluded from claim 8 everything but the specific substance there mentioned and, in my opinion, it has. There are in all eleven claims in the specification and both potassium and sodium xanthate would be included in the general language used in everyone of them with the exception of the particular claim in question, assuming that some meaning can be given to the expression \"alkaline xanthate\" in claim 6. Further, one finds the general expression \"a xanthate\" in claims 7 and 9 and, as just mentioned, the expression \"alkaline xanthate\" in claim 6. I think, therefore, that it is impossible to contend that in using the expression \"potassium xanthate\" in claim 8, anything else but that substance was intended to be included.\nIn the result the respondent fails to obtain protection with respect to a very useful invention which became dominant in the art but this result comes about in my opinion from the failure to observe the requirements of the statute calling for clear expression as to the invention and the claims. There was no difficulty in the adoption of reasonably clear language in the present case.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action both with costs.\nEstey J.: This is an appeal from a judgment in the Exchequer Court awarding damages against the appellant for infringement of respondent's Canadian Letters Patent No. 247,576, dated March 10, 1925. This patent was applied for by Cornelius H. Keller under date of October 23, 1924, in respect of \"improvements in froth flotation concentration of ores.\" The improvements were effected by the introduction of \"xanthates or analogous substances\" into the froth flotation process. That such improvements were effective is clearly established and infringement is admitted if the patent is valid.\nThe appellant's contention is that the specification does not adequately describe the invention nor set forth the claims within the meaning of sec. 14(1) of the Patent Act, S. of C. 1923, c. 23, and therefore the patent is invalid.\n14 (1) The specification shall correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor. It shall set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making or compounding, a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. It shall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\nThe purpose of this section is set forth in 22 Halsbury, p. 161, art. 388:\nIn order that the public may have sufficient and certain information respecting what they are prohibited from doing whilst the privilege continues, the patentee must particularly describe and ascertain the nature of his invention. In order that, after the privilege is expired, the public may be able to do what the patentee has invented, he must particularly describe and ascertain the manner in which the same is to be performed.\nThe appellant's first contention, therefore involves a construction of the specification. My lord the Chief Justice in commenting upon the construction of the specification in French's Complex Ore Reduction Co. v. Electrolytic Zinc Process Co., 21 stated at p. 470:\nIt should not be construed astutely. The patent should be apporached, in the words of Sir George Jeissel \"with a judicial anxiety to support a really useful invention\" (Hiniks & Son v. Safety Lighting Co.) 22 but, on the other hand, the consideration for a valid patent is that the inventor must describe in language free from ambiguity the nature of his invention, including the manner in which it is to be performed; and he must define the precise and exact extent of the exclusive property and privilege which he claims. Otherwise the specification is insufficient and the patent is bad.\nThe respondent's contention is that the foregoing sec. 14(1) is complied with; that the language of paras. 2 and 3 of the disclosure portion of the specification when read together do limit the substance used to \"certain sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid,\" and that in para. 4 the inventor sets forth his invention.\n4. The invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance. These form anions and cations in solution. Excellent results were also obtained by agitating ore pulps with the complex mixture produced when 33 per cent of pine oil was incorporated with an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrate, and xanthates or analogous substances were produced by adding carbon disulphide to this mixture.\nIt will be observed that in the foregoing para. 4 the inventor speaks of \"xanthates or analogous substances.\" Inasmuch as the alleged infringements are restricted to the use of xanthates, we are here concerned only with xanthates.\nThe \"certain sulphur derivatives\" in para. 3 are in this paragraph restricted to \"salts of the sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid containing an organic radical, such as an alkyl radical and known as xanthates, as the new substance.\" The parties did not agree as to the meaning of the phrase \"sulphur derivatives.\" However, the evidence is to the effect that the more accurate construction of this phrase would restrict it to those derivatives in which the S or S's alone displace one or more O's in carbonic acid (H2CO3). The sulphur derivatives thus obtained are five in number and they are the only sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid.\nThe displacement of the oxygen by the sulphur may take place according to five different formulae and the five resulting acids are known as thiocarbonic acid (the prefix \"thio\" meaning \"sulphur\"). These five acids are known as mono-thio carbonic acid (H2CO2S), di-thio carbonic acid (H2COS2), and tri-thio carbonic acid (H2CS3), each of the former having two formulae.\nFrom the di-thio carbonic acid having a central carbon with sulphur bonded by two bonds on the left, one with the SH group and one with the OH group, xanthic acid is formed when the hydrogen of the OH group is replaced by an alkyl radical. Then when the H in the SH group is replaced by a metal the result is a di-thio carbonate, or a salt properly described as a \"sulphur derivative of carbonic acid.\" If the metal used be potassium the result is \"potassium xanthate.\"\nThe next requirement of para. 4 is that these salts contain \"an organic radical such as an alkyl radical.\" It is around the construction of this phrase \"such as an alkyl radical\" that much of the controversy centres. The first contention is with respect to the meaning of the word \"alkyl.\" The parties hereto agree that all organic chemical compounds contain carbon and that a radical is an incomplete fragment of a molecule. The respondent's witness Higgins explained that \"organic alkyl radicals\" are \"the residue of the saturated hydro carbon groups.\" In these saturated hydro carbon groups if all of the C bonds are taken up the result is a product of which methane (CH4) is one. If, however, CH3 is formed, one C bond remains unattached and you have the methyl radical (CH3). The ethyl radical is C2H5. In every radical there is at least one bond of C unattached. The other radicals of the saturated hydro carbon group are propyl, butyl, amyl and hexyl. Higgins would restrict the \"alkyl radicals\" to these six.\nAppellant contends that Higgins' definition of \"alkyl radical\" is too narrow and that all \"aliphatic radicals\" should be included under the word \"alkyl\" when properly defined.\nBy agreement the parties filed a list of ninety-one xanthates, being the only xanthates that in 1923 could be found referred to in scientific literature and that in all of these the radicals are \"aliphatic,\" (as distinguished from the other classification of \"radicals\" known as \"aryl\"). These were grouped under sixteen headings, according to their radicals, and six of these groups were the above mentioned \"alkyl radicals.\" The appellant contends that all of the ninety-one xanthates should be included in the \"alkyl\" group. If, however, Higgins' definition is accepted, only six of the groups are classified as having \"alkyl radicals.\" The appellant's experts admitted that the Higgins definition \"is a good definition and it is the strictest, most precise, narrowest definition which is accepted in textbooks,\" and again, \"It is clean-cut and very often quoted and very frequently used.\" The appellant's experts were able, however, to cite authorities which did use the word in a wider sense than that used by Higgins. The evidence of Dr. Purves is pertinent in this regard. He says that all of the radicals in the ninety-one xanthates are \"aliphatic\" and \"all infringe that strict definition in one respect or another.\"\nThe learned President accepted the respondent's contention that the specification should be construed as not to include all \"organic aliphatic radicals\" and that \"such as\" means \"of the type of\" and in this I am in agreement, and the further discussion is on that basis. It is, however, of some significance that Keller and his associates would know of the different senses or meanings given to the phrase \"alkyl radical\" by the authorities when they adopted the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical,\" and yet not only made no effort to specifically declare that they adopted the Higgins meaning but, as will immediately appear, actually added to the confusion. That the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical\" was deliberately chosen is apparent from an examination of the application filed for the United States patent on October 23, 1923, where as originally filed the paragraph corresponding to para. 4 under discussion read \"with salts of the alkyl sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid known as xanthates,\" which did definitely limit the xanthate to those having an \"alkyl radical.\" That application, however, was amended by striking out the word \"alkyl\" and inserting after the word \"acid\" the words \"containing an organic radical such as an alkyl radical\" and adding the sentence \"These form anions and cations in solution.\" The language of the amendment was adopted in the Canadian application dated one year later, October 23, 1924. It is no longer \"alkyl sulphur derivatives\" but \"sulphur derivatives containing an organic radical such as an alkyl radical.\" The deliberate insertion of the words \"such as an alkyl radical\" under these circumstances cannot be construed other than that the inventor intended to include more than \"alkyl radicals,\" but that he did not intend to include all organic radicals.\nThroughout the evidence the respondent appears to treat the words \"such as\" to mean not \"of the type of\" but rather as meaning \"restricted to\" or \"synonymous\" with \"alkyl radical.\" This is emphasized by the evidence of Higgins, specifically referring to para. 4, where he states: \"That is a more detailed description of his agent, and 'this introduces, in addition to the sulphur and the metal, the alkyl radical.\" Again, when his attention was directed to the formula of a di-thio carbonate here in question, he stated the radical \"had to be an alkyl radical\" in order that the xanthate here desired might be obtained.\nThen again, this para. 4 must be read and construed as part of the entire specification. French's Complex Ore Reduction Co. v. Electrolytic Zinc Process Co., supra. The respondent contends that the invention is described in paras. 2, 3 and 4 of the disclosure and that in para. 8 thereof he sets forth how he prepared potassium xanthate in the laboratory. The opening words of the first three of these paragraphs are significant: \"2. This invention relates to * * *; 3. It has been found that certain sulphur derivatives * * *; 4. The invention is herein disclosed in some detail as carried out with salts * * *\" In para. 8 the inventor states: \"For laboratory purposes potassium xanthate was prepared as follows * * *\" This language does not suggest that this was \"the method\" but rather that it was but \"a method.\" Then at the conclusion of this disclosure he states: \"Having thus described certain embodiments of the invention, what is claimed is * * *\" All of the foregoing goes far to support the appellant's contention that the inventor never does define or describe his invention but contents himself with setting forth his findings in a series of experiments. However, approaching the case as presented by the respondent, the foregoing adds to the ambiguity and confusion and does not, nor does any other part of the specification, assist in determining the meaning of the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical.\"\nThe specification must be construed as a whole, but here nothing is found in the claims portion that defines or clarifies the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical.\" Claim No. 3 is limited to \"a salt of an alkyl sulphur derivative.\" This again is the very language and limitation in the United States application before the amendment. Claims 4 and 5 refer to ethyl-sulphur derivatives of carbonic acid. These are the more restricted but in other claims the language is sufficiently wide and comprehensive to include xanthates with radicals other than the \"alkyl.\" In Claims 6, 7, 8 and 9 here in issue, being the only claims in which \"xanthates\" are specifically mentioned, one finds in para. 6 the phrase \"an alkaline xanthate.\" Xanthates are neutral and this phrase is admittedly contradictory and would be so recognized by one skilled in the art. It was suggested by the respondent that the phrase \"alkali xanthate\" was intended and the appellant admits such would be a reasonable construction. The phrase \"alkali xanthate\" would include the \"alkali metal xanthates\" which may have \"alkyl\" or one of the other radicals mentioned in the course of this litigation. It would include the \"cellulose xanthate\" which does not contain an \"alkyl radical\" but which forms a collodial solution and is admittedly harmful in the flotation process. Respondent, however, submitted that it was excluded by the draftsmen inserting the words \"adapted to co-operate with the mineral-frothing agent,\" which in this Claim No. 6 immediately follows the words \"alkaline xanthate.\" Then in Claims 7 and 8 the word \"xanthate\" is used without any limitation whatever, and here again it would include xanthates with other than \"alkyl radicals.\"\nThe terms \"potassium xanthate\" and \"sodium xanthate\" are used repeatedly throughout both the disclosure and claims without any word of limitation as to their radical content. Likewise, the terms \"alkaline xanthate\" (construed to mean \"alkali xanthate\") and \"xanthate\" appear in the claims without limitation as to their radical content. These terms were in 1923 well known and understood by chemists and metallurgists, certainly to the extent that every one of these xanthates might have \"alkyl\" or practically any of the other \"aliphatic radicals.\" Keller does not discover a new xanthate but what he discovers is a new use of xanthate by his introduction of it into the froth flotation process. Therefore those skilled in the art in reading this specification would conclude that the xanthates used were not those which had only the \"alkyl radical.\"\nA specification may be so drafted as to indicate a special or limited sense in which the terms may be used but here the inventor, so far from doing that, has first adopted clear and definite language, discarded it, and in lieu thereof has adopted terms which are ambiguous and which ambiguity, under the circumstances that here obtain, must have been then apparent. In this regard the language of Lord Parker in Natural Colour Kinematograph Co. Ld. v. Bioschemes Ld. 23 is pertinent:\nFurther though it may be true that in construing an instrument inter partes the Court is bound to make up its mind as to the true meaning, this is far from being the case with a Specification. It is open to the Court to conclude that the terms of a Specification are so ambiguous that its proper construction must always remain a matter of doubt, and in such a case, even if the Specification had been prepared in perfect good faith, the duty of the Court would be to declare the Patent void. and also the language of Earl Loreburn at p. 266:\nIf he uses language which, when fairly read, is avoidably obscure or ambiguous, the Patent is invalid, whether the defect be due to design, or to carlessness or to want of skill. Where the invention is difficult to explain, due allowance will, of course, be made for any resulting difficulty in the language. 'But nothing can excuse the use of ambiguous language when simple language can easily be employed, and the only safe way is for the patentee to do his best to be clear and intelligible.\nAnd in our own Courts, Mr. Justice Maclean in the Exchequer Court stated:\nIf the specification uses language which when fairly read, is avoidably obscure or ambiguous, the patent is void, whether the defect be due to design, or to carlessness, or to want of skill; nothing can excuse the use of ambiguous language when simple language may easily be employed, due allowance of course, being made where the invention is difficult to explain and there is a resulting difficulty in the language. De Forest Phonofilm of Canada Ltd. v. Famous Players Can. Corp. Ltd., 24.\nThe specification as phrased gives no information as to what is meant or included in the phrase \"such as an alkyl radical.\" Keller found that xanthates with an \"alkyl radical\" soluble in water effected a substantial improvement in the froth flotation process and the evidence at the trial would indicate that so far as xanthates were concerned that constituted his invention. The language of the specification, however, is not so restricted. The language there adopted leads the reader into a field that was unknown to the inventor and which in the specification is not defined. In fact beginning with the phrase \"sulphur derivatives\" almost every important phrase, as already indicated, is so used that issues such as are here raised were almost inevitable. That in itself is indicative of ambiguity and the absence of that clarity which sec. 14(1) of the Patent Act contemplates.\nThis is not a case where the language is open to one or more constructions and the Court, in the language of Lindley L.J., in Needham and Kite v. Johnson & Co.25: \"* * * would put upon it that construction which makes it a valid patent rather than a construction which renders it invalid.\" The language here used is so vague and ambiguous that in order to attribute to it that clarity and certainty required by the statute we must erase or eliminate the words \"such as\" and therefore amend rather than con- strue the language of the specification and thereby restrict the xanthates used in the improvement to those having an \"alkyl radical.\"'\nApart from what has already been said, there is another ambiguity inherent in this phrase, and that is the test to be applied to determine what \"alkyl\" is \"such as an alkyl radical.\" Should the radical be composed of the same or similar ingredients, or whether its effect in chemical reactions should be as the \"alkyl radical\" is left entirely to conjecture. Moreover, the evidence is to the effect that once you go beyond the \"alkyl radical\" as defined by Higgins, it is impossible to find a point where a line can be drawn until the xanthates containing all of the \"organic aliphatic radicals\" are included. The respondent in this action makes no such claim. Even if (one adds the limitation in para. 4 that they form anions and cations in solution, the specification does not correctly and fully describe the invention as required by sec. 14(1) (above quoted) of the Patent Act.\nAs already indicated, the ambiguity persists throughout both the disclosure and claims portion of the specification, and in the claims 6, 7, 8 and 9 herein in question it is not stated \"distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege,\" within the meaning of sec. 14(1).\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellant: H olden, Murdoch, Walton, Finlay and Robinson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Scott, Kelley and Howard.\n1 [1947] Ex.

During the existence of the lease, a flood took place with the result that the Corporation passed a by-law closing a portion of the street running through the farm. No provision for indemnity was made in the bylaw. More than two years later appellant exercised his right to buy the property and immediately took action for indemnity against the town. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The enclave was not caused by the closing of the street but by the flood and the Town had the right to close the street but should have paid appellant an indemnity since it did not transfer the site of the street to appellant as provided for by para. 33 of art 429 of the Cities and Towns Act.\nHeld: Appellant had the necessary interest to take this action because by virtue of art. 1088 C.C. when he exercised his right to buy the property, things were replaced in the same state as if the lease had not existed and the property had been bought ab initio.\nHeld: The short prescription of arts. 622 and 623 of the Cities and Towns Act does not apply as this is not an action in damages but one for indemnity\u2014very closely akin to an action for compensation for expropriation. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, confirming, Bissonnette and Casey JA. dissenting, the dismissal by the Superior Court of an action for indemnity as the result of the closing of a street.\nJ. C. Samson, K.C., and Paul G\u00e9rin for the appellant.\nW. H. Shurtleff, K.C., and A. Laurendeau, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le demandeur-appelant est en possession depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es d'une ferme situ\u00e9e dans la ville de Coaticook, dont une partie, se trouvant au nord de la rue Washington, comprend les lots 1896 et 1897 du cadastre de la localit\u00e9, et l'autre partie, soit les lots 1844, 1846, 1847, 1848 et 1849, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de ladite rue, repr\u00e9sente avec le reste de la terre, une superficie d'environ 40 acres.\nCette rue Washington traverse en cons\u00e9quence la ferme de l'appelant, dans une direction est-ouest, \u00e0 partir d'un pont situ\u00e9 sur la rivi\u00e8re Coaticook, et se dirigeant jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la ville, aux bornes du Canton Barford. Toutes les b\u00e2tisses de l'appelant, soit une maison et ses d\u00e9pendances, sont situ\u00e9es du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord de la rue Washington de sorte que, pour se rendre de ses b\u00e2tisses \u00e0 la partie sud de sa terre, il lui faut n\u00e9cessairement traverser cette rue en question qui, jusqu'aux incidents qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action, \u00e9tait une rue publique.\nDans le cours du mois de juin 1943, une pluie torrentielle causant une inondation consid\u00e9rable, a d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 le cours de la rivi\u00e8re Coaticook, lui tra\u00e7ant un nouveau lit \u00e0 l'intersection de la rue Washington et de la rue \u00c9vang\u00e9line, \u00e0 une distance d'environ 200 pieds du pont. Comme r\u00e9sultat de cette inondation, le demandeur, qui ant\u00e9rieurement avait acc\u00e8s par la rue Washington aux autres rues publiques ainsi qu'au pont qui y conduit, est pratiquement priv\u00e9 de cet avantage. A quelques p\u00e9riodes de l'ann\u00e9e, il peut traverser \u00e0 pied ou \u00e0 cheval le nouveau lit de la rivi\u00e8re, ou bien il doit parcourir une distance d'environ un mille en traversant la terre d'un nomm\u00e9 Beaulieu, pour se rendre \u00e0 la rue Riverdale.\nS'autorisant des dispositions de l'article 429 (1) de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, le Conseil Municipal a, le 13 mars 1944, adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement connu sous le N\u00b0 310, par lequel il a aboli et ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 la circulation cette partie de la rue Washington qui se trouve \u00e0 l'est du nouveau lit de la rivi\u00e8re Coaticook, jusqu'aux limites de la ville de Coaticook touchant au canton Barford. En vertu de l'article de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes susdit, ce pouvoir d'ordonner la fermeture des rues existantes appartient au Conseil, mais toutefois, le r\u00e8glement qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ainsi la fermeture d'une ou de plusieurs rues, doit pourvoir \u00e0 indemniser s'il y a lieu ceux qui sont l\u00e9s\u00e9s, et est sujet \u00e0 l'approbation de la Commission Municipale de Qu\u00e9bec avant d'entrer en vigueur.\nComme r\u00e9sultat, et de l'inondation et de ce R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, le demandeur est non seulement enclav\u00e9 sur sa terre, priv\u00e9 de toute issue aux rues publiques, sauf de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, mais il lui est \u00e9galement impossible, \u00e0 moins de passer sur cette rue Washington dont la fermeture a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e, de circuler librement sur cette partie de sa terre au nord de l'ancien site de la rue, pour se rendre au c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud, et vaquer ainsi \u00e0. ses occupations quotidiennes de fermier.\nLe R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310 ne pourvoit \u00e0 aucune indemnit\u00e9, mais contient une clause \u00e0 l'effet que la Corporation ne doit payer aucune compensation comme r\u00e9sultat de la fermeture de ladite rue, parce que c'est le d\u00e9bordement de la rivi\u00e8re Coaticook qui serait la cause de la situation o\u00f9 se trouve l'appelant. Le demandeur-appelant a, en cons\u00e9quence, institu\u00e9 une action dans laquelle il demande que huit des Attendus du R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310 soient annul\u00e9s et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ultra vires, et que la d\u00e9fenderesse soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 lui payer la somme de $5,500 \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, par jugement en date du 25 mars 1947, a rejet\u00e9 l'action avec d\u00e9pens, et la Cour d'Appel 2 a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Casey dissidents. M. le Juge en chef L\u00e9tourneau en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la ferme du demandeur-appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 enclav\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sultat de la destruction d'une partie de la rue par l'inondation, et que la fermeture de cette partie de la rue contigu\u00eb \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, n'a pas rendu la position de ce dernier pire, car la rue, apr\u00e8s l'inondation, ne servait aucun but utile. M. le Juge Barclay conclut que l'appelant avait droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, mais que la seule mesure des dommages dus comme r\u00e9sultat de l'enclave, \u00e9tait le prix d'une nouvelle sortie qu'en vertu de la loi il avait droit d'obtenir, et la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation, s'il y en avait, \u00e0 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cependant, comme d'apr\u00e8s lui, la preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas le montant des dommages soufferts, il rejetterait l'action. M. le Juge Marchand est \u00e9galement d'opinion que l'action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e mais pour des motifs diff\u00e9rents. Il croit en effet que l'action est une action en dommages, et qu'elle est prescrite. Selon lui, en vertu de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, articles 622, alin\u00e9a 5, aucune action en r\u00e9clamation de dommages n'est recevable \u00e0 moins qu'elle na soit intent\u00e9e dans les six mois qui suivent le jour o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9 ou le jour o\u00f9 le droit d'action a pris naissance, et la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 623 de la m\u00eame loi. M. le juge Bissonnette avec qui concourt M. le juge Casey, accueillerait l'action, et condamnerait l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelant la somme de $2,500 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis l'institution de l'action et les d\u00e9pens.\nLa premi\u00e8re objection soulev\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est que l'appelant n'a pas la qualit\u00e9 voulue pour instituer la pr\u00e9sente action, vu qu'il ne serait pas le propri\u00e9taire des lots affect\u00e9es par le R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310. L'examen des titres r\u00e9v\u00e8le en effet que le 17 mai 1940, un nomm\u00e9 John B. Cleveland de la ville de Coaticook, a vendu la terre qui a fait l'objet du pr\u00e9sent litige \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Armand Gr\u00e9goire, et audit acte de vente est intervenu le pr\u00e9sent demandeur qui, pour et en consid\u00e9ration de la somme de $650, dont quittance, a renonc\u00e9 en faveur de l'acheteur \u00e0 tous les droits qu'il pouvait avoir en vertu d'une promesse de vente consentie en sa faveur par ledit Cleveland le 25 juin 1925. A la m\u00eame date, devant G. Albert Normandin, notaire, Armand Gr\u00e9goire a lou\u00e9 avec promesse de vente audit Albert J. J. McConmey, la m\u00eame terre avec b\u00e2tisses dessus construites, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances. Cette promesse de vente \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'un bail, en vertu duquel l'appelant, durant une p\u00e9riode de trois ans, s'engageait \u00e0 payer comme loyer la somme de $1,050. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement convenu que si l'appelant payait bien et fid\u00e8lement le loyer ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, et s'il remplissait les autres obligations stipul\u00e9es au contrat, le loyer pay\u00e9 durant trois ann\u00e9es serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le prix de vente de ladite propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et Gr\u00e9goire s'engageait alors \u00e0 donner un titre valable au locataire McConmey. Le 30 juillet 1945, pour donner suite \u00e0 la promesse ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e, Armand Gr\u00e9goire a vendu au pr\u00e9sent appelant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, et \u00e0 l'acte il est mentionn\u00e9 que le vendeur d\u00e9clare que l'appelant lui a pay\u00e9 toutes sommes qu'il pouvait lui devoir en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats en vertu dudit bail et de la promesse de vente. Gr\u00e9goire a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans cet acte qu'il n'a jamais eu l'intention d'acheter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour lui, mais que l'acte de vente de la susdite propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui fut consenti seulement dans le but d'obtenir une garantie sur un pr\u00eat de $1,050, qu'il avait consenti \u00e0 l'appelant.\nJe partage enti\u00e8rement les vues de l'honorable Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel, et je suis d'opinion que quand l'acte de vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, en vertu duquel le demandeur appelant est redevenu le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble en question, le 30 juillet 1945, c'est-\u00e0-dire quelques jours avant l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, les choses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remises dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient originairement. (Code Civil 1088.)\nComme le dit M. Mignault, tome 5, page 443:\nLa condition accomplie ayant un effet r\u00e9troactif au jour du contrat, les choses se passent comme si le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pur et simple ab initio.\nToutes ces transactions ont \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans le seul but d'effectuer \u00e0 l'appelant un pr\u00eat de $1,050, et ce dernier n'a sign\u00e9 les contrats dont je viens de parler, que pour donner des garanties \u00e0 son pr\u00eateur. Le jour o\u00f9 il a repris de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'acte de rachat de juillet 1945, le droit de l'acheteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 an\u00e9anti comme s'il n'avait jamais exist\u00e9. Je crois donc que la premi\u00e8re objection de l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas fond\u00e9e, et que l'appelant avait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u00e9cessaire pour instituer les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures. Je n'entretiens pas de doute non plus, que c'est comme cons\u00e9quences de cette pluie torrentielle que la rivi\u00e8re a chang\u00e9 son lit, et je ne crois pas qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e avait l'obligation de r\u00e9parer une ancienne digue construite il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et destin\u00e9e \u00e0 retenir les eaux de la rivi\u00e8re. Le r\u00e9sultat \u00e9vident du changement de lit de la rivi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'enclaver \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur-appelant. Il pouvait, il n'y a pas de doute, circuler encore sur la rue Washington depuis la partie ouest de la rue, \u00e0 l'endroit du lit nouveau de la rivi\u00e8re, jusqu'\u00e0 la limite est, o\u00f9 la Municipalit\u00e9 de Coaticook est en bordure du canton Barford. Mais c'est dans ces \u00e9troites limites que ses activit\u00e9s \u00e9taient restreintes, pour les fins d'exploitation de sa ferme.\nPlusieurs juges de la Cour d'Appel ont par erreur assum\u00e9 que quand la rivi\u00e8re Coaticook, comme cons\u00e9quence de l'inondation, s'est ainsi creus\u00e9 un lit nouveau, le pont qui autrefois traversait la rivi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9 sous la pouss\u00e9e des eaux. \u00c9videmment, ceci est une erreur, car aucun pont n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9, et le pont utilis\u00e9 pour traverser la rivi\u00e8re, existe encore et se trouve \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 ouest de la rue Washington, de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du lit nouveau de la rivi\u00e8re, mais il est inaccessible \u00e0 l'appelant. Il faudrait que l'appelant ou la Municipalit\u00e9 construise un nouveau pont \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 la rivi\u00e8re a creus\u00e9 son lit nouveau et ces travaux, tel que le r\u00e9v\u00e8le la preuve, entra\u00eeneraient des d\u00e9penses consid\u00e9rables. Il ne s'agirait donc pas, pour trouver une issue sur la voie publique au demandeur-appelant, qu'un pont soit reconstruit pour remplacer un autre d\u00e9truit, mais il faudrait construire un pont nouveau \u00e0 quelques cents pieds de celui qui existe encore.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, quand la Municipalit\u00e9 d\u00e9fenderesse a adopt\u00e9 le R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310, dans lequel elle a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 la fermeture de la rue Washington sur la longueur que l'on sait, elle n'a donc pas enclav\u00e9 la terre de l'appelant, car avec les r\u00e9serves que je viens de signaler, cette enclave existait d\u00e9j\u00e0. Il est incontestable, comme le demandeur-appelant l'admet lui-m\u00eame dans son plaidoyer \u00e9crit, que l'intim\u00e9e avait le droit de fermer cette rue, en s'autorisant des dispositions de l'article 429, para. 1 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, qui r\u00e9git l'intim\u00e9e, mais la question qui se pose est de savoir si elle \u00e9tait tenue de payer une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant. \u00c9videmment, cette indemnit\u00e9 ne devait \u00eatre payable que si, comme r\u00e9sultat de la fermeture de cette rue, l'appelant subissait un pr\u00e9judice. Dans l'affirmative, la loi est claire et pr\u00e9cise, et l'indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e. Assur\u00e9ment, pour que l'indemnit\u00e9 puisse \u00eatre exig\u00e9e de la d\u00e9fenderesse, il faut de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que la fermeture de la rue soit la cause sine qua non du pr\u00e9judice souffert par le demandeur.\nIci, une distinction s'impose. Je n'ai pas de doute que ce pr\u00e9judice en ce qui concerne la privation \"d'une issue sur la voie publique, pour l'exploitation de son h\u00e9ritage\", (C.C. 540) est la cons\u00e9quence de l'inondation. Pour qu'un fonds soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme enclav\u00e9, il n'est pas essentiel que son propri\u00e9taire n'ait aucune issue sur la voie publique; si la seule issue est insuffisante \u00e0 l'exploitation du fonds, il y a enclave. Vide (12, Jousselin, 550) (Marcad\u00e9, vide art. 682 C.C.) (Aubry & Rau, 35, para. 243) (12, Demolombe, M. 600) (8, Laurent, M. 76 & 81) (Planiol & Ripert, Vol. 3, pages 857 & 860) (Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vol. 6, page 783) (Juris-Classeur Civil, art. 680-682, page 6, verbo servitudes l\u00e9gales). Il semble donc \u00e9vident que m\u00eame si le R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310 n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par le Conseil Municipal, la terre du demandeur-appelant serait enclav\u00e9e au sens de l'article 540.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse est-elle oblig\u00e9e de construire un pont ou de refaire le chemin pour permettre la travers\u00e9e au-dessus du nouveau lit de la rivi\u00e8re, et donner acc\u00e8s au demandeur \u00e0 la voie publique? Dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause, je ne le crois pas. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'entretien de chemin, ou de pont, mais v\u00e9ritablement de construction, dont le co\u00fbt serait disproportionn\u00e9 aux b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, que le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pourrait en retirer. Vide (La Corporation de la Paroisse de St-Jacques-des-Piles v. Biais 3.\nMais si le R\u00e8glement N\u00b0 310 n'est pas la cause de l'enclave subie par le demandeur, il en r\u00e9sulte tout de m\u00eame, \u00e0 mon sens, que la terre en question se trouve compl\u00e8tement s\u00e9par\u00e9e en deux, et qu'il est maintenant impossible au demandeur de circuler du nord au sud, ou vice versa. On sait que le Code Municipal est diff\u00e9rent sur ce point de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes. En vertu du Code Municipal, lorsque le Conseil d\u00e9cide de fermer une rue, l'assiette de la rue ainsi ferm\u00e9e, appartient automatiquement aux propri\u00e9taires riverains. (C.M. 467.) En vertu de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente, car l'assiette de la rue ferm\u00e9e reste la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 ou de la Ville qui, par r\u00e8glement, en a ordonn\u00e9 la fermeture. En vertu de l'article 429, para. 33, le Conseil de Ville a le droit, par vente ou \u00e9change, ou de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, de disposer du terrain qui faisait partie de la rue dont la fermeture a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e, pourvu que la Commission municipale de Qu\u00e9bec ait approuv\u00e9 le contrat de vente ou d'\u00e9change. Si l'intim\u00e9e avait, de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9, transport\u00e9 l'assiette de la rue \u00e0 l'appelant, il n'y aurait \u00e9videmment aucun grief qui pourrait lui \u00eatre reproch\u00e9, mais malheureusement, ceci n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l'appelant souffre le pr\u00e9judice que je viens de mentionner et pour lequel il a droit, je crois, \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9.\nQuel est le montant qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 au demandeur-appelant? L'action telle qu'institu\u00e9e contient les all\u00e9gations voulues pour permettre au demandeur de r\u00e9clamer l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle il a droit, mais malheureusement, la valeur du pr\u00e9judice qu'il subit n'est pas clairement \u00e9tablie. Je suis en cons\u00e9quence d'opinion, parce que cette Cour a le pouvoir de le faire, qu'une ordonnance soit \u00e9mise, retournant le dossier de cette cause \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieur du district de St-Fran\u00e7ois, afin que les dommages subis par le demandeur soient \u00e9tablis devant un tribunal comp\u00e9tent.\nEn d\u00e9terminant le montant de cette indemnit\u00e9, le tribunal \u00e9videmment ne devra pas tenir compte du montant qu'il en co\u00fbtera \u00e0 l'appelant pour obtenir un droit de passage sur la terre de Beaulieu, pour se rendre \u00e0 la rue Riverdale, car l'enclave au sens de l'article 540 ne r\u00e9sulte pas du R\u00e8glement 310. Mais il devra, je crois, prendre en consid\u00e9ration le fait que par la fermeture de la rue Washington, la terre du demandeur-appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9e en deux, et que par l'effet de ce m\u00eame r\u00e8glement, l'issue au chemin public, \u00e0 pied ou \u00e0 cheval, qui lui restait \u00e0 travers le nouveau lit de la rivi\u00e8re, lui est maintenant interdite. Cette issue sans doute n'\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour l'exploitation de l'h\u00e9ritage, mais \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame un avantage, minime il est vrai, mais dont la suppression est une cause de pr\u00e9judice.\nUn autre point a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, et c'est que la pr\u00e9sente action serait prescrite en vertu des dispositions des articles 622, para. 5, et 623, de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes. Le premier de ces articles est \u00e0 l'effet qu'aucune action en r\u00e9clamation de dommages n'est recevable contre la Municipalit\u00e9, \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne soit intent\u00e9e dans les six mois qui suivent le jour o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9, ou le jour o\u00f9 le droit d'action a pris naissance. L'article 623 nous dit que toute action, poursuite ou r\u00e9clamation contre la municipalit\u00e9 ou l'un de ses officiers ou employ\u00e9s, pour dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lits, de quasi-d\u00e9lits ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9s, est prescrite par six mois \u00e0 partir du jour o\u00f9 le droit d'action a pris naissance, nonobstant toute disposition de la loi \u00e0 ce contraire.\nJe suis clairement d'opinion, comme le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e l'a lui-m\u00eame admis lors de l'audition de cette cause, que cette courte prescription des articles 622 et 623 ne s'applique pas. Il ne s'agit pas d'une action en dommages r\u00e9sultant de d\u00e9lit, de quasi-d\u00e9lit ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9, mais bien d'une r\u00e9clamation pour indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant d'un acte l\u00e9gal que la Municipalit\u00e9 avait parfaitement le droit de poser, ce qui n\u00e9cessairement exclut toute id\u00e9e de d\u00e9lit, de quasi-d\u00e9lit ou d'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. La fermeture de la rue ne tombe dans aucune de ces cat\u00e9gories, et la nature de l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle un contribuable a droit quand il souffre un pr\u00e9judice, du genre de celui qui nous occupe, ressemble au montant de la compensation qu'il peut r\u00e9clamer, quand il y a expropriation. Ces actions o\u00f9 l'on conclut \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9, ou encore ces compensations accord\u00e9es dans les cas d'expropriation, sont enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes des r\u00e9clamations en dommages qui, selon les dispositions des articles 622 et 623 de la Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes, se prescrivent par six mois.\nSur le tout, je crois que le pr\u00e9sent appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu, et que le dossier devrait \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 au tribunal du district de St-Francis pour qu'il soit proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de l'indemnit\u00e9 payable au demandeur-appelant. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances sp\u00e9ciales de cette cause, le demandeur-appelant aura droit en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, tant pour la premi\u00e8re que la seconde audition, et en Cour d'Appel, \u00e0 ses frais d'une action de la classe qui' sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le montant des dommages accord\u00e9s par le juge qui entendra la cause de nouveau. Il aura droit \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s devant cette Cour et \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 des honoraires taxables.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Appellant: J. C.

At trial before the Exchequer Court, appellant contended that respondent's claim for the part of the salary withheld by the Crown during the years 1929 to 1934 (during which period respondent was Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec), was prescribed when the petition of right was taken on 13 November 1943. The Exchequer Court held that the law of Quebec applied and that the claim was not prescribed.\nHeld: There is no \"res judicata\" in this case as the only issue raised and discussed at the previous hearing was the status of the Lieutenant-Governor and the Court was not empowered to and did not deal with the issue of prescription.\nHeld: If the law of Quebec applies here, the prescription is not of five but of thirty years as the salary of the Lieutenant-Governor is not one of the subject matters found in Article 2250 C.C, nor does it fall under 2260 (6) as this Article contemplates a contract of hire of work which presupposes a relationship of employer and employee, which relationship does not exist between His Majesty and the Lieutenant-Governor.\nHeld: Also, that if the law of Ontario applies, the limitation period being twenty years, the claim would not be barred either.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J. 1, holding that the claim for salary of the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, who held office from 1929 to 1934, was not prescribed on 13 November 1943 when the petition of right was taken by the respondents.\nF. P. Varcoe, K.C. and J. Desrochers for the appellant.\nFernand Choquete, K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014This case now comes before this Court for the second time 2. The facts may be briefly summarized as follows:\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice Carroll was from 1908 until 1921 a Puisne Judge of the Court of King's Bench, and from 1929 until 1934, Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec. When he resigned from the Bench in 1921, he was entitled to a pension of $6,000, and was also entitled annually from 1929 until 1934, to an additional $10,000, being the statutory amount paid to the Lieutenant-Governor.\nHis Majesty however refused to pay both the pension and the salary, and based His refusal on section 27 of The Judges' Act (R.S.C. 1927, chap. 105), which reads as follows:\u2014\nIf any person become entitled to a pension after the first day of July one thousand nine hundred and twenty, under this Act, and become entitled to any salary in respect of any public office under His Majesty in respect of His Government of Canada, such salary shall be reduced by the amount of such pension.\nOn the 21st of June, 1944, the matter having been brought to the Exchequer Court by way of Petition of Right, the Honourable Mr. Justice Angers ordered that the following question of law be set down for hearing before trial:\nAssuming that the Honourable H. G. Carroll became entitled on February 18, 1921, to a pension under The Judges' Act at a rate of \u00a76,000 per annum and was entitled to receive the same during and in respect of the period from April 2, 1929, to May 3, 1934, and that during the said period he occupied the office of Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec to which office there was attached the salary of $10,000 per annum, and assuming that he received payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada in respect of said pension and of salary as Lieutenant-Governor during the said period at the rate of $10,000 per annum, are the suppliants entitled to relief sought by the Petition of Right? This question was answered in the affirmative by Mr. Justice Angers 3, and that judgment was confirmed by this Court 4. It was held that the office of Lieutenant-Governor is not a public office under His Majesty in respect of His Government of Canada, but that it is a public office In respect of the Government of the Province for which he is appointed.\nThe matter was then referred back to the Exchequer Court, and the plea was amended in order to allow His Majesty to allege that the claim is barred and extinguished by virtue of the statute of limitations, namely, section 32 of the Exchequer Court Act, chap. 34, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, and articles 2250, 2260 para. 6, and 2267 of the Quebec Civil Code. Mr. Justice Angers 5 dismissed this contention and came to the conclusion that the suppliants were entitled to recover from His Majesty the King the sum of $30,500, being the amount withheld by the appellant.\nThe respondents claim that the present appeal should be dismissed and submit that there is \"res judicata\", that the law of limitation of the Province of Quebec does not apply, that if it does, the prescription of five years is inapplicable, and that in any event, the appellant has renounced prescription.\nDealing with the first point, the argument raised by the respondents is that when the Exchequer Court and this Court answered the question of law in the affirmative, they also disposed of the question of prescription which is now raised. With this contention I do not agree. The original submission made to the Court was on a particular point, and the only issue raised and discussed was the status of the Lieutenant-Governor. The courts had to decide whether the Lieutenant-Governor fulfilled federal or provincial functions, and they could not go beyond answering the question put, in the affirmative or the negative; they were not empowered therefore to deal with the issue of prescription which now comes for adjudication. The two issues being entirely different, the plea of \"res judicata\" appears quite unfounded. The second point as to prescription, offers more difficulty. Is it the law of limitation of Ontario where the appointment of the Lieutenant-Governor was made and where the remuneration is paid that applies? Or is it the law of Quebec where the functions are performed and where the payment is received? If the law of Ontario governs this case, the claim is not barred, as the limitation period is twenty years. (Halsbury, 2nd Ed., vol 20, p. 600) (Weaver, \"Limitations\" p. 301). If the law of Quebec applies, is it the five year or thirty year prescription term? I do not think that for the purpose of determining this case, it is necessary to examine all these questions, as I have come to the conclusion that the claim is not barred, whether the laws of Ontario or Quebec apply. The only possible limitation under the Quebec law would be the five year short prescription, but it does not stand in the respondents' way.\nThe appellants have invoked sections 2250, 2260 para. 6, and 2267 of the Civil Code, and also section 32 of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1924, chap. 34). These sections read as follows:\u2014\n2250. With the exception of what is due to the Crown and interest on judgments, all arrears of rents, including life-rents, all arrears of interest, of house-rent or land-rent, and generally all fruits natural or civil are prescribed by five years.\nThis provision applies to claims resulting from emphyteutic leases or other real rights, even where there is privilege or hypothec.\nPrescription of arrears takes place although the principal be imprescriptible by reason of precarious possession.\nPrescription of the principal carries with it that of the arrears.\n2260. The following actions are prescribed by five years:\u2014\n6. For hire of labour, or for the price of manual, professional or intellectual work and materials furnished, saving the exception contained in the following articles;\n2267. In all the cases mentioned in articles 2250, 2260, 2261 and 2262 the debt is absolutely extinguished and no action can be maintained after the delay for prescription has expired.\nSec. 32 Exchequer Court Act:\u2014\nThe laws relating to prescription and the limitation of actions in force in any province between subject and subject shall, subject to the provisions of any act of the Parliament of Canada, apply to any proceedings against the Crown in respect of any cause of action arising in such province.\nIt seems clear that the amount claimed by the respondents, which is the portion of the salary reduced by the amount of the pension, is not any of the subjects found in section 2250 of the Civil Code. It is surely not a rent, and it cannot be included in the words \"generally all fruits natural or civil\". Natural fruits are those which are the spontaneous produce of the soil, and civil fruits are the rent of houses, interest of sums due and arrears of rents. Section 449 of the Civil Code also adds that the rent due for the lease of farms is also included in the class of civil fruits.\nThe pertinent paragraph of section 2260 of the Civil Code is paragraph 6 which has already been cited, and which according to appellant's submission, would bar respondents' claim. This section 2260 C.C is not found in the Code Napoleon, and it is useful I think, to keep in mind that it has been enacted by the Legislature in the same form as suggested by the commissioners in their third report, section 111(c), page 549, where they say, that when the prescription is not otherwise provided, \"the action for hire of labour or for price of work either manual, professional or intellectual, and for the materials furnished\" will be five years. This section clearly contemplates the contract of hire of work as defined in section 1602 of the Civil Code and which reads as follows:\u2014\n1602. The lease or hire of work is a contract by which one of the parties, called the lessor, obliges himself to do certain work for the other, called the lessee, for a price which the latter obliges himself to pay.\nThe seoction says \"for a price\", and it also supposes a relationship of master and servant, of lessee and lessor, the former obliging himself to pay the price agreed upon and the latter obliging himself to do a certain work. In other words, there must be an employer and an employee.\nMarcad\u00e9, Civil Code, vol. 6, expresses his views in the following manner:\u2014\nLe louage d'ouvrage est donc un contrat par lequel une partie, qu'on appelle locateur, s'oblige \u00e0 faire jouir de son travail une autre partie, qui s'oblige \u00e0 le payer et qu'on appelle locataire.\nTroplong, in his book \"De l'\u00e9change et du louage\", vol. 2, page 222, expresses similar views:\u2014\nLe contrat de louage de services est un contrat par lequel Je travailleur s'engage \u00e0 faire quelque chose pour une personne qui s'engage de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 lui donner en retour un prix convenu.\nDealing with section 2260, Langelier, vol. 6, page 515, says:\u2014\nLe sixi\u00e8me cas de prescription de cinq ans mentionn\u00e9 par notre article est celui de l'action r\u00e9sultant de louage d'ouvrage. Finally, Mignault, dealing with the same paragraph 6, says at page 530, vol. 9:\u2014\nLe sixi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 2260 formule une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui s'applique \u00e0 tout contrat de louage d'ouvrage \u00e0 moins que ce contrat ne tombe sous la disposition des articles 2260 et 2262.\nParagraph 6 does not mention only \"hire of labour\" but adds also \"or for the price of manual, professional or intellectual work\". It was essential I think, that these words should have been added, in order that the same prescription should be applied, not only to a claim where the price is stipulated, but also to a claim of an employee who sues for the value of services rendered, whether they be manual, professional or intellectual.\nLangelier is quite clear on this point, and at page 515, vol. 6, he says:\u2014\nLes mots \"prix du travail\" comprennent, non seulement le prix fix\u00e9 express\u00e9ment, mais la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 laquelle celui qui a fourni son travail a droit, alors m\u00eame que le prix n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9.\nBut this distinction must not be interpreted as meaning that the essential contractual relationship is not also necessary in the latter case as it is in the former.\nIn drafting section 2260, the codifiers no doubt had in mind the controversy that existed in France during the past century between the most eminent writers, as to whether the words \"hire of intellectual services\" included notaries, lawyers, doctors and all those rendering professional services. Vide Huc, \"Commentaire du Code Civil\", vol. 10, p. 519; Guillouard, \"Trait\u00e9 du contrat de louage\", vol. 2, p. 251 et suiv.; Merlin, Vol. 21, \"R\u00e9pertoire de Jurisprudence\", p. 356; Troplong, \"De l'\u00e9change et du louage\", vol. 2, p. 237 et suiv.; Championni\u00e8re, \"Trait\u00e9 des droits d'enregistrement\", vol. 2, pp. 424 et 427.\nObviously, in order to make the law clearer and to avoid any further doubts, the Legislature enacted section 2260 in its present form, with different paragraphs dealing with professionals, and having a special paragraph for \"hire of labour\" as defined in section 1602 C.C. Any case not mentioned in 2260 C.C. is not covered by it. A short prescription, where the law denies the action and completely extinguishes the debt, must be found in the Code; otherwise, it is the thirty year prescription that applies (C.C. 2242). In the case now before this Court, can it be said that there existed between His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion, and the late Mr. Justice Carroll, this relationship of employer and employee, of 'master and servant, of lessee and lessor of services, and enabling the' courts to apply the short prescription of five years, found in paragraph 6 of section 2260? In the previous judgment delivered by this Court (The King v. Carroll et al 6), when the first appeal was disposed of, this Court, basing itself on numerous decisions of the Judicial Committee, determined the real status of a Lieutenant-Governor. It reached the conclusion that the Lieutenant-Governor did not fulfil federal functions, but that his office was exclusively of a provincial character; that he was for provincial purposes as much the direct representative of His Majesty as the Governor General is for federal purposes; and that it was the functions performed, that had to be examined in order to determine the real nature of the services rendered.\nIt is true that the appointment of a Lieutenant-Governor is made by the Governor General in Council and that the remuneration is paid by the Federal Government, but these are merely constitutional obligations imposed upon the Dominion, which when fulfilled do not alter the provincial character of the office of a Lieutenant-Governor. The procedure through which the appointment is made does not create any relationship of employer and employee, of master and servant, of lessee and lessor of services. It is the constitutional machinery used to determine who will in a given province represent the Sovereign.\nBy a fiction of the law, the Lieutenant-Governor stands in a unique position, fulfilling in the Province, for which he is appointed the duties fulfilled by the King himself in England, and which no one else can exercise. (Todd-Parliamentary Government, 2nd Ed., p. 584). And in acting in that capacity, he is not an employee of His Majesty in the right of the Dominion. I fail to see between the appellant and the respondent any of the essential contractual elements necessary to bring the claim within section 2260 C.C. Having reached this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the last point raised by the respondents that the appellant has renounced prescription.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: F. P. Varcoe and J. Desrochers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. Choquette.\n1 [1949] Ex. C.R. 169.\n2 [1948] S.C.R. 126.\n3 [1947] Ex. C.R. 410.\n4 [1948] S.C.R. 126.\n5 [1949] Ex.

Mccool Limited Appellant,\nand\nThe Minister Of National Revenue Respondent\n1949: June 6, 7; 1949: December 5.\nPresent: Kerwin, Rand, Kellock, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Income Tax\u2014Timber Limits\u2014Claim for Depletion\u2014Discretion of Minister must be based on sufficient facts\u2014Interest on unpaid purchase price not interest on borrowed capital\u2014The Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, ss. 5 (1) (a) (b), 6 (a) (b), 65\u2014The Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 34, s. 36.\nThe Income War Tax Act, s. 5 (1) (a) provides that the Minister of National Revenue in determining the income derived from timber limits may make such allowance for their exhaustion as he may deem just and fair. Section 5 (1) (6) provides that there may be deducted from income such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income as the Minister in his discretion may allow. The respondent company acquired certain timber limits and other assets from T. E. McCool under an agreement by which it assumed McCool's liabilities and gave him or his nominees, members of his family, all its issued stock, 600 shares, and its demand note for $123,097 bearing interest at five per cent. The agreement assigned no specific value to the timber limits, which McCool had bought for $35,000, but the company in filing its income tax return, claimed depletion on the basis of a valuation of $150,000, which it alleged was the price it paid for them and was less than their market value. It also claimed as a deduction the interest paid on the demand note.\nThe Minister ruled that the limits be valued for the purposes of the Act at the cost price to McCool and that the depletion allowable be based on that figure, and that interest be not allowed on the note in arriving at the taxable profit.\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting) that the Minister having decided that an allowance for depletion should be made, there was an insufficiency of evidence before him upon which he could in the exercise of his discretion determine the amount thereof and therefore the matter should be referred back to him.\nPer: Locke J., dissenting, the Minister having decided that an allowance for depletion should be made on the basis of value there was evidence before him upon which he might properly find the fair value as being $35,000. The onus was on the taxpayer to show that the Minister had been influenced by irrelevant considerations or had otherwise acted in an arbitrary or illegal manner justifying the intervention of the Court and this had not been done.\nPer: Locke J. Evidence of value not having been placed in issue on the pleadings, was inadmissible. The Exchequer Court Act, s. 46. Johnson v. Minster of National Revenue, [1948] S.C.R., 486, applied.\nHeld: also, that the interest paid on the demand note was not \"interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn income\" within the meaning of s. 5(1) (6).\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J., 1 whereby an assessment affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue relating to the amount allowable for depletion of timber limits was set aside and referred back to the Minister for adjustment, and a cross-appeal by the taxpayer from that part of the judgment which disallowed its claim for interest allowance.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and T. Z. Boles for the appellant.\nLee A. Kelley K.C. and W. R. Meredith for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin and Rand, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014Cameron J. 2 has found the refusal of the Minister to accept the depletion allowance claimed to have been based on two grounds: that there was in fact no change of ownership of the assets; and that they had been set up in the books of the company at an appreciated value. I regret to be unable to agree with this conclusion. What the communication from the Minister, exhibit No. 2, \"that the timber limits will be valued for the purposes of the Income War Tax Act\" conveys to me is the intention to allow depletion on the basis of market value. To arrive at that, the Department took the nearest free transaction, the purchase by McCool from Miss Booth for $35,000, to be the most dependable fact presented. The pleadings raised the issue, not of value, but cost to the company, and evidence was adduced before Cameron J. which satisfied him that the limits, at the time of purchase, were worth between $150,000 and $200,000. Strictly that was not the fact to be found, although relevant to it; the distinction between value and cost seems to have been lost sight of. If the new matter from independent sources had been available to the Minister, it must have affected somewhat his finding of value: and assuming it to have been found by the Court that the real cost to the company was $150,000, a further fact appeared which has not been taken into account by the Minister. The Crown objected to the evidence of value but under the misconception that the right to depletion and its amount were in the uncontrolled discretion of the Minister; and it was intimated that if such a view was wrong, the matter should be returned to the Minister for further consideration of value. But as the Minister had decided for the allowance and on the basis of value, the only issue should have been that of amount. This simple situation was complicated originally by the failure of the company to bring or at least to offer to bring forward the evidence later presented, and at the trial both by the pleading and by the erroneous view of discretion. In substance, it is a case in which the Minister, in ascertaining a basic fact, has been misled by the insufficient proof offered, a proof which in the circum- stances it was on the company to furnish. In addition to the fact that the judgment purports to direct the Minister to award an allowance on the basis of cost to the company as distinguished from value, decided upon by the Minister, if what is now disclosed had been considered, can it be said that the Minister must have found the amount of $150,000 to be the value or that he must then have proceeded on the same basis of allowance? The Minister is entitled to determine the sum to be allowed on the whole of the material factors and are not the new matters adduced by the company, and the striking difference indicated between value and original cost, such factors?\nI do not find it necessary to decide that question because another new fact has been introduced. McCool advised the Commissioner that the quantity of timber on the limits was twenty million feet. It now appears that it is at least twenty-five million and may run more. This is obviously relevant to the allowance for the year in question on any basis, but it has never been considered by the Minister.\nThe case of Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights Canadian Ropes Ld. 3 was interpreted to justify the order made, but the cases are distinguishable. There the Minister proposed under section 6(2) to exercise a discretion in reducing the amount of an admitted outlay as an expense against revenue. Only on proper and sufficient grounds could that be done, which the Court, on the matter before it, found not to be present. But the issue raised and fought out, and on which the Minister was content to stand or fall, was the sufficiency of the facts before him for the ruling he made: and it was held that he was bound by the finding of the Court.\nHere there was no such clear cut issue brought to the Court: the parties were to some degree at cross purposes. And in view of the issue raised, the evidence presented, the finding made, and the error in the total quantity of timber, there were facts disclosed which through the failure of the company were not before the Minister and which I think he is entitled to consider: but in finding a basic fact the Minister must, of course, act judicially on the evidence before him. The respondent has cross-appealed on the refusal to allow as an expense the payment of interest on that part of the consideration to McCool given by the company for the assets transferred which consisted of a promise to pay money. It is, I think, misleading to convert a transaction of this sort into what is considered to be its equivalent and then to attribute to it special incidents that belong to the latter. Whether, if the company had raised money by issuing bonds, with which McCool had been paid off, the interest on them could be deducted as an expense I do not stop to consider; that is not what we have before us. There was no borrowing and lending of money and no use of money for which interest would be the compensation. What the vendor did was to sell his property, for the consideration, in addition to the shares, of a price plus interest; that interest is part of the capital cost to the company.\nThe item is clearly within section 6(a) which prohibits deduction of \"disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\"; as a capital payment, it comes within the ban of section 6(b) ; and treated as interest, it is not within section 5(1) (6) which allows interest on \"borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income\" : Inland, Revenue Commissioners v. Rowntree, Co. Ltd. 4,\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal, and refer the matter back to the Minister to take such action in relation to an allowance for depletion as the facts disclosed or the further facts that may be disclosed may call for. There should be no costs in either court.\nKellock J.:\u2014The facts are sufficiently stated by the learned trial judge and need not be here repeated. In the first appeal the question is as to depletion allowance for the period ending August 31, 1942, in respect of the \"Booth\" limit.\nIt is contended on behalf of the Crown that the Minister properly exercised his discretion under section 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act on the material before him and allowed depletion on the \"basis of value as shown by the only real evidence of value before him, namely, the price paid by McCool for the limit\"; that the Minister did not accept the transaction between McCool and the company as determining the value; and that the Minister was entitled to proceed on this view. It is said that the learned trial judge erred in concluding that the Minister had based his decision on the ground that there had been no actual change of ownership of the assets under the transaction between McCool and the company, and erred further, in concluding that the Minister had based his decision on the ground that the limit had been set up in the books of the company at an appreciated value. The Crown also complains that the trial judge erred in having regard to evidence which was not before the Minister.\nAt the time the Minister made his decision under section 59 of the Income War Tax Act, by the terms of which he has the obligation, upon receipt of the taxpayer's notice of appeal, to \"duly consider the same and affirm or amend the assessment appealed against\", he had before him:\n(a) the option agreement of March 27, 1940;\n(b) the agreement between McCool and Ryan of August 31, 1940;\n(c) a balance sheet purporting to be the closing balance sheet as of August 31, 1940, of T. E. McCool;\n(d) the opening balance sheet of the respondent company as of August 31, 1940;\n(e) the income tax return in question;\n(f) an assessor's report showing that the company had issued 600 of its 1,000 authorized shares of which 360 had been issued to McCool personally, and the remaining 240 on his direction to members of his family and that on a value of $24,000 a gift tax of $1,000 had been paid in respect of these 240 shares.\nIt is important to see what was the issue, first, while the matter was before the Minister, and second, in the Exchequer Court.\nIn its Notice of Appeal to the Minister, the appellant included in its statement of facts the statement that the timber limits were transferred to it \"on a valuation of $150,000\", and in its reasons for appeal it claimed that it should be allowed\u2014\nDepletion on the basis of a valuation of $150,000 and not $35,000, the sum of $150,000 being the price paid by it for the said limits when purchased from Mr. McCool and being less than the actual market value of the said limits at the date of acquisition by the Appellant.\nIt also claimed that the Minister erred in his interpretation of the Act and had not used a proper, fair and just discretion \"in valuing the said limits for the purpose of depletion at the cost price to Mr. McCool of $35,000 and the said assessment is accordingly made on an improper basis\".\nThe language last quoted has reference to a letter to the appellant from the Inspector of Income Tax which accompanied the Assessment Notice and stated that:\nIt has been ruled by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Taxation) that the timber limits will be valued for the purpose of the Income War Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act at the cost price to T. E. McCool of $35,000 * * *\nIn the decision in writing of the Minister upon the appeal from this assessment, the assessment was affirmed \"on the ground that a just and fair allowance has been made under the provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of Section 5 of the Income War Tax Act, of the amount of $10,445.94 in respect of depletion of a timber limit\".\nIt will be seen that the Minister does not state the ground of his decision. It is not stated that the Minister had concluded, (a) that on the evidence before him the value of the limits when acquired by the appellant was $35,000 rather than $150,000, nor (b), that the cost to the appellant was not $150,000, nor (c), whether it was cost to the taxpayer or market value, if there were a difference, which was the proper figure to be taken and which he had taken in arriving at his decision.\nWhen the matter reached the Exchequer Court counsel for the Minister put the matter thus:\nI think perhaps my learned friend has in mind calling certain expert evidence as to the value of the timber limits, and as to that I would like to say this: the respondent takes the position that under the applicable section of the Income War Tax Act, which is 5(1) (a), it is entirely a matter of discretion with the Minister whether or not he shall allow depletion on timber limits * * * If the respondent is right in that, then of course the question of value would be of little moment. That was to say that the amount of any allowance for depletion was a matter exclusively for the Minister and the question of value did not enter. Counsel went on to say further:\nBut if your Lordship should decide that the respondent is wrong in that, I would submit that then your Lordship ought to remit the case back to the Minister in order that he might exercise his discretion according to proper principles; and then it would be for the Minister to make inquiries as to the value of the timber limits. The department, rightly or wrongly, was not prepared in advance of this trial to send people out to cruise limits in order that it might meet any evidence of this kind to be given by the appellant * * *\nHis Lordship: Are you objecting to any evidence which has to do with the actual value of the limit?\nMr. Macdonald: Yes, my Lord. The exhibits already filed show that the appellant claimed that the value was $150,000, and I submit that with them in front of us we perhaps have enough on which to go and do not need to listen to a lot of evidence as to cruising the limit.\nIf this correctly reflects the basis of the decision of the Minister upon the appeal from the assessment, it establishes, in my opinion, that the Minister made his decision on the theory that any amount which he allowed could not be questioned by the taxpayer. At the trial his counsel took the position that if the Minister were wrong and, having determined to make an allowance for depletion, should have done so on the basis of the value of the limits, the matter must go back to him for that purpose.\nIn his examination for discovery Mr. Williams was referred to the recommendation of the Timber Committee, which reads as follows:\nThat the depletion allowance be such as to permit the owner of timber or the holder of a right to cut timber from Crown or private lands to recover successively and rateably out of income before tax such capital sums as he may have invested in acquiring such ownership or rights, and no more.\nOn being asked whether or not this recommendation had been adopted by the Department, he replied in the affirmative and said:\nQ. On the basis of the adoption of that recommendation, the department then set the value of the limit at $35,000?\nA. Yes.\nIf this be correct, the Minister must have taken the position that the investment of the appellant was only $35,000. This result could only be arrived at by identifying the appellant company with Mr. McCool personally. In Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue, 5, Rand J. said at 489:\nNotwithstanding that it is spoken of in section 63(2) as an action ready for trial or hearing, the proceeding is an appeal from the taxation; and since the taxation is on the basis of certain facts and certain pro-visions of law either those facts or the application of the law is challenged. Every such fact found or assumed by the assessor or the Minister must then be accepted as it was dealt with by these persons unless questioned by the appellant. If the taxpayer here intended to contest the fact that he supported his wife within the meaning of the Rules mentioned he should have raised that issue in his pleading, and the burden would have rested on him as on any appellant to show that the conclusion below was not warranted. For that purpose he might bring evidence before the Court notwithstanding that it had not been placed before the assessor or the Minister, but the onus was his to demolish the basic fact on which the taxation rested.\nIn its statement of claim the appellant set out the facts, including an allegation that the limits had been acquired by it at a cost of $150,000 and alleged that it was that amount which was the proper basis on which depletion should be allowed. The appellant complained that the assessment was improper in that the Minister erred in \"using the sum of $35,000 as the basis for allowing depletion and in not properly interpreting section 5, subsection (1), paragraph (a), of the said Act with respect to depletion on the ground, among others, that the Appellant on the basis of the Minister's discretion would never recover its capital investment through depletion allowance\".\nIn his defence the Minister merely affirmed that he had properly allowed the amount of $10,445.94 in respect of depletion and that by making the said allowance he had exercised, according to the proper legal principles, the discretionary power vested in him under the subsection.\nIn these circumstances I do not think that whatever might have been the situation otherwise, it can be argued on behalf of the Crown, as Mr. Varcoe does, that \"the Minister decided to allow depletion on the basis of value as shown by the only real evidence of value before him, namely, the price paid by McCool for the limit\", or that \"he did not accept the transaction between McCool and the Company as determining the value\". Neither in his formal decision nor in his statement of defence, does it appear that this is what happened and it is perfectly clear that counsel for the respondent at the trial did not so understand the matter. I think, therefore, that it has not been shown in this court on behalf of the appellant that the Minister's decision was arrived at in accordance with proper principles.\nIn Fraser v. Minister of National Revenue 6, the Judicial Committee held that the Minister has a double discretion under section 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, first, to determine whether the case is one for an allowance, and second, if so, to determine how much shall be allowed. With respect to the opening words of section 5, namely:\nIncome * * * shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions.\ntheir Lordships held that these words merely \"require the Minister to make a deduction under head (a) if he has decided that the case is one for a deduction\". Their Lordships intimated that in exercising his discretion as to whether he should or should not make an allowance, the Minister must proceed on \"just, reasonable and admissible grounds\". The view of the Minister in the Fraser case was, in their Lordships' opinion, \"an intelligible view which was both tenable and admissible, and in adopting it the Minister cannot be said to have transgressed the bounds of his discretion so as to justify any interference with his decision\".\nTheir Lordships went on to say :\nThe criteria by which the exercise of a statutory discretion must be judged have been defined in many authoritative cases, and it is well settled that if the discretion has been exercised bona fide, uninfluenced by irrelevant considerations and not arbitrarily or illegally, no court is entitled to interfere even if the court, had the discretion been theirs, might have exercised it otherwise.\nIn the instant case the Minister did determine that the case was one for an allowance. The question in the present appeal is therefore whether, in exercising the second branch of the statutory discretion, the Minister proceeded in accordance with the principles above laid down. As I have already said, I do not think that has been shown.\nIt is no doubt a prevalent practice for promoters to acquire assets with a view to turning them over to an incorporated company called into being at their instance, at a figure involving a handsome profit which may or may not have any relation to actual value, but in my opinion there is no presumption that such is invariably the case. It seems to me that the Minister acted on some such view without any evidence to support it, such evidence as there was, being to the contrary, or else he must have disregarded the separate legal existence of the company.\nOn the pleadings the respondent claimed that its investment of $150,000 in the limits was the amount upon which depletion allowance should be based. The appellant denied this and did not raise any other issue, at the trial taking the stand, not that cost was improper and value or some other basis correct, but that the amount allowed could not be questioned. Cost was not necessarily the basis which the Minister was bound to apply. On the other hand the stand taken by the Minister could not be supported. I therefore think that the matter must be referred back to the Minister on the basis however, that it has already been determined that an allowance for depletion should be made. This will permit the fact of there being 25,000,000 feet on the limits instead of the amount previously thought to exist, namely, 20,000,000 to be taken into consideration.\nI would therefore allow the appeal to the extent mentioned. I think the respondent should have its cost in the court below, but that there should be no costs in this court.\nIn the second appeal the company claims that the interest paid on the note given to McCool for the balance of the purchase price of the assets acquired by the company should be allowed as an operating expense on the ground that the note represents borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income within the meaning of section 5(1) (b) of the statute. This claim was disallowed by the Minister and the company's appeal was dismissed by the learned trial judge, on the ground that in order to qualify under the statute the taxpayer would have to be in the position of a borrower and some other person would have to be a lender, while in fact there was no such relationship as between the company and McCool. I agree with the learned trial judge that the company cannot bring itself within the language used in section 5(1) (b). To employ the language of Viscount Finlay in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Port of London Authority 7, in order to enable the statute to apply, \"there must be a real loan and a real borrowing\". Here there is nothing more than unpaid purchase money secured by a promissory note which, in my opinion, is insufficient. It is not sufficient to say that if the company had borrowed the amount of the note and paid McCool it would have been entitled to the deduction. However that may be, that was not done and the statute does not apply. This appeal should also be dismissed.\nEstey J.:\u2014The respondent in filing its income tax returns for the taxation year ending August 31, 1942, claimed an allowance of $51,874.36 for the exhaustion of a timber limit, and interest on $123,097.34 at the rate of 5 per cent on and after the 1st day of September 1941. The allowance was reduced to $10,445.94 and the interest entirely disallowed by the officials of the Department of National Revenue. Their decision was affirmed by the Minister, but in the Exchequer Court varied with respect to the allowance and affirmed as to the disallowance of the interest. These items constitute the subject-matter of this appeal.\nAn allowance with respect to a timber limit is provided for in sec. 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments thereto, the material part of which reads:\n5. (1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) The Minister in determining the income derived from * * * timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the * * * timber limits as he may deem just and fair * * *\nThis section was under review in D. R. Fraser & Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue 8, where Lord Macmillan states:\nHe has a double discretion, first, to determine whether the case is one for an allowance, and second, if so, to determine how much shall be allowed. The Minister \"may\" not \"shall\" make an allowance. The language is permissive, not obligatory.\nAnd further, at p. 36:\nThe criteria by which the exercise of a statutory discretion must be judged have been defined in many authoritative cases, and it is well settled that if the discretion has been exercised bona fide, uninfluenced by irrelevant considerations and not arbitrarily or illegally, no court is entitled to interfere even if the court, had the discretion been theirs, might have exercised it otherwise. The Department of National Revenue on February 10, 1942, adopted and published the recommendations of the Timber Depletion Committee of the Income Tax Division. The part of the recommendations material hereto reads as follows:\nThat the depletion allowance be such as to permit the owner of timber or the holder of a right to cut timber from Crown or private lands to recover successively and ratably out of income before tax such capital sums as he may have invested in acquiring such ownership or rights, and no more.\nSuch a recommendation though not binding upon may be followed by the Minister but in either event it must be determined whether in a particular case he has exercised a judicial discretion. Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ld. v. Minister of National Revenue 9.\nThe decision of the Minister made in the exercise of his discretion should be supported unless it is \"manifestly against sound and fundamental principles\" : per Davis J. in Pioneer Laundry & Dry Cleaners v. Minister of National Revenue 10, and quoted with approval by Lord Thankerton in Pioneer Laundry & Dry Cleaners v. Minister of National Revenue supra.\nIt is apparent that in this case the Minister had decided that an allowance should be made and no question has been raised with respect to that portion of his decision. The ruling of the Deputy Minister clearly made under the terms of the foregoing recommendation and affirmed by the Minister reads in part:\nIt has been ruled by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Taxation) that the timber limits will be valued for the purpose of the Income War Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act at the cost price to T. E. McCool of $35,000, that the depletion allowable will be the result of dividing $35,000 by the total cruise and multiplying by the cut during the period * * *\nIn considering the appeal the Minister had before him the following facts: T. E. McCool purchased the timber limit from Gertrude E. Booth for $35,000 under an option agreement dated March 27, 1940, and carried it at that amount on his personal balance sheet as of August 31, 1940. \u00c0 letter written by Crandall, who was engaged in lumber operations and was familiar with and interested in purchasing the timber limit, to T. E. McCool on September 27, 1940, intimated that his company would have paid a substantially higher price to have obtained it. The respondent was incorporated to take over the assets of T. E. McCool ' and did so under an agreement setting out a list of items not separately valued. The company in consideration of the transfer of the assets agreed (a) to assume and pay all debts and liabilities of T. E. McCool in the sum of $37,684.20, (b) cash in the sum of $400 to be used in the purchase of four organization shares, (c) allot and issue to T. E. McCool or his nominees 596 fully paid up and non-assessable shares of capital stock at a par value of $100, and (d) give to the vendor a demand note for the sum of $123,097.34 with interest at 5 per cent from and after the 1st day of September, 1941. It was also stated in the material before the Minister that the timber berth here in question was valued at $150,000, and that the respondent purchased it for \"less than the actual market value of the said limits at the date of the acquisition,\" and that the respondent carried it in its balance sheet at $150,000. It was also disclosed that T. E. McCool was the largest shareholder in the company and the other shareholders were the members of his family.\nAt the trial in the Exchequer Court the validity of the discretion exercised by the Minister was in issue. No evidence was adduced on behalf of the Crown but the respondent read into the record the examination for discovery of Mr, Williams, Director General of the Corporation Assessments Branch of the Taxation Division, Department of National Revenue, in which Mr. Williams deposed that \"an allowance for depletion is made in order to enable the total cost of the limits to be absorbed in the production,\" that the $35,000 was selected \"because the department felt that that was the actual cost to the taxpayer.\" Further, that \"they had seen an option agreement and copies of other agreements between the chief shareholder of the taxpayer and the original owner of the property in which he agreed to pay $35,000 for the limits.\" Mr. Williams did not know whether the department had any idea of the value of the limits and deposed that he \"would consider that the company was McCool's company, that he would have control as to the price to be fixed on any assets that were purchased from himself, and consequently that that was not a transaction as between strangers,\" and that here the department which \"usually looks at a transaction in regard to market value, if there is not a ready market * * * at the last transaction that took place for cash, at arm's length or as between strangers.\"\nThe foregoing evidence establishes that the Minister was following the recommendation in determining the \"just and fair\" allowance and therefore that it should be related to the possibility of eventually returning out of income the taxpayer's investment in the timber limit. That though on behalf of the respondent it was plainly stated that $150,000 was paid for this timber limit and that it was worth more, the Minister, without any knowledge of the value of the timber limit decided that \"the cost, price to T. E. McCool of $35,000\" in a transaction between strangers should be accepted as the investment to the taxpayer in this timber limit.\nAn assumption that a sale between strangers discloses the cost to or the investment of a company formed to purchase the assets of the purchaser (in the sale between strangers), including the asset then purchased in which company the controlling shareholder is that purchaser and the other shareholders members of his family, may in some circumstances be justified. Not, however, in a case such as this where apart from the agreements there is a statement from an independent prospective purchaser to the effect that the timber limit was obtained by T. E. McCool at a bargain; where the agreements evidencing these sales were by the taxpayer placed before the Minister without any request on his behalf, as well as the statement intimating that the $35,000 was a bargain; and where throughout the record there is no suggestion of wrongdoing or fraud on the part of the taxpayer.\nWhile these agreements disclosing such a difference in the purchase price would naturally raise in the mind of the Minister questions upon which in the exercise of his discretion he had to pass, they did not provide the relevant facts upon which that discretion ought to have been exercised. The statute contemplates that these important decisions ought not to be made without at least an endeavour to obtain all the relevant facts. That was no doubt one of the reasons why secs. 41-46 were included. Under these sections the Minister may demand additional information of the character such as would be suggested in this case, more particularly because there is nothing to suggest that the further information relative to the figures, and particularly the value of the investment as eventually adduced at the trial, would not have been produced and possibly this litigation avoided.\nIt would therefore appear that the Minister in determining the said sum of $35,000 acted upon insufficient facts and therefore did not exercise a judicial discretion as that term is defined in the authorities. Lord Greene in Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights' Canadian Ropes Ltd. 11, stated at p. 123:\nThe court is, in their Lordships' opinion, always entitled to examine the facts which are shown by evidence to have been before the Minister when he made his determination. If those facts are in the opinion of the court insufficient in law to support it, the determination cannot stand. In such a case the determination can only have been an arbitrary one.\nSee also Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra, and D. R. Fraser & Co. Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, supra.\nI am therefore in agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial Judge that the Minister in exercising his discretion has acted upon a wrong principle.\nThe learned trial Judge having concluded that the Minister had exercised his judicial discretion upon a wrong principle, it would appear that the case should have been referred back to the Minister as the only party authorized under the statute to determine the \"just and fair\" allowance. The statute is explicit:\n5. (1) * * *\n(a) The Minister * * * may make such an allowance * * * as he may deem just and fair * * *\nThe general language of sec. 66, conferring the exclusive jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court, is circumscribed and limited by such phrases as \"subject to the provisions of this Act * * *\" and \"determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment * * *\". Apart from specific language to the contrary, it would appear that it still remains the duty of the Minister to determine under sec. 5(1) (a) the allowance that he may deem just and fair and a reference back to the Minister should have been directed for that purpose. In the Pioneer Laundry Case, supra, the Minister acted upon irrelevant facts in determining under sec. 5(1) (a) a depreciation allowance of $255.08 as against the amount claimed by the taxpayer of $17,775.55. The Privy Council directed \"that the assessment should be set aside and the matter referred back to the Minister.\"\nThe learned trial Judge followed the direction made by the Privy Council in Wrights' Canadian Ropes case, supra. That case, with respect, appears to be distinguishable. There the issue under sec. 6(2) was in respect to the disallowance of the major portions of three items of expense and was decided by the Privy Council upon a construction of certain documents. Lord Greene stated, at p. 124: \"So far, therefore, as these documents are concerned their Lordships cannot find any material which could have justified any disallowance.\" That concluded the matter and therefore the Privy Council directed the case be remitted to the Minister \"for an adjustment of the figures consequential on the allowance of the respondents' appeal.\" It is also significant that the Pioneer Laundry Case upon another point is referred to in the Wrights' Canadian Ropes judgment, but no suggestion that the order there directed was not appropriate to the circumstances of that case.\nThere would appear to be no difference in principle between a case in which the Minister proceeds upon irrelevant facts and where he proceeds upon insufficient facts and therefore under the authority of the Pioneer Laundry case the matter should be referred back to the Minister in order that he may determine a \"just and fair\" allowance within the meaning of sec. 5(1) (a).\nThe respondent in its appeal asks that interest on the demand promissory note of $123,097.34 be allowed under sec. 5(1) (6), the essential part of which reads as follows:\n5. (1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purpose of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n* * *\n(b) Such reasonable rate of interest on borrowed capital used in the business to earn the income as the Minister in his discretion may allow * * *\nTerms such as \"borrowed capital\", \"borrowed money\" in tax legislation have been interpreted to mean capital or money borrowed with a relationship of lender and borrower between the parties. Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Port London Authority 12; Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Rowntree & Co. Ltd. 13 ; Dupuis Fr\u00e8res Ltd. v. Minister of Customs and Excise 14. It is necessary in determining whether that relationship exists to ascertain the true nature and character of the transaction. In this case the promissory note arises out of an exchange in which, as already detailed, the purchase price was paid by assuming outstanding obligations, a small payment of cash, allotment of captial stock and the execution and delivering of this promissory note. Under such circumstances it cannot be held that the relationship of lender and borrower in respect to this note exists between the respondent company and the payee of the note.\nThe appeal of the Minister of National Revenue should be allowed and the case remitted to the Minister to determine a just and fair allowance for depreciation. The appeal of T. E. McCool Limited should be dismissed. T. E. McCool Limited should have its costs in the Exchequer Court and no costs to either party in this Court.\nLocke J.:\u2014(dissenting in part): In the exercise of the powers vested in the Minister by subsec. (a) of sec. 5 of the Income War Tax Act, as amended by sec. 10 of cap. 34 of the Statutes of 1940, the respondent company was allowed an amount of $10,445.94 for depletion of timber limits acquired by it under the circumstances hereinafter stated. That subsection in so far as relevant provided that:\u2014\n\"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) the Minister in determining the income derived from mining and oil and gas wells and timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair.\nThe respondent appealed from the assessment claiming to be entitled to a larger amount by way of depletion and the assessment was affirmed by the Minister but, on appeal to the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. set aside the assessment and referred the matter back to the Minister for adjustment on the footing that the value of the timber was not less than $150,000 and that depletion should be based upon this figure rather than upon $35,000, the value as found by the Minister. Under the subsection the Minister has a discretion first, to determine whether any allowance is to be made for the exhaustion or depletion of timber limits and, if he determines that such an allowance should be made, then secondly, as to the amount of the allowance. By a letter accompanying the notice of assessment which was for the taxation period between October 21, 1941, and August 31, 1942, the assessor informed the respondent, inter alia, that:\nIt has been ruled by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Taxation) that the timber limits will be valued for the purpose of the Income War Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act at the cost price to T. E. McCool of $35,000, that the depletion allowable will be the result of dividing $35,000 by the total cruise and multiplying by the cut during the period.\nHaving decided that an allowance for depletion should be made, the question to be determined is whether the Minister's discretion as to what was a just and fair allowance has been properly exercised. The facts properly to be considered in deciding this; question are, in my opinion, few in number.\nThomas E. McCool had been engaged for a long period of years in the logging and lumber business and by an option agreement dated March 27, 1940, acquired the right to purchase the limits in question from Gertrude R. Booth within a stipulated time for the sum of $35,000. That option was exercised by McCool within the time limited and a payment of $10,000 made on account of the option price. Having acquired the limits, they were shown on the balance sheet of McCool's business dated as of August 31, 1940, valued at the sum of $35,000. He had apparently decided to incorporate a company to take over his business and to take shares in the proposed company for a portion of the purchase price and give part of these shares to various members of his family. For some reason which is not clear to me, he decided to enter into an agreement with Lawrence S. Ryan, a chartered accountant and who had apparently acted as his auditor, whereby he agreed to sell his assets to Ryan who was designated as trustee on behalf of a company to be formed under the name of T. E. McCool Ltd., consisting of the limits in question, certain other lands and timber limits, a hotel property, certain chattels and accounts receivable and shares of stock and the amount of his cash on hand, to the proposed company in consideration of its assuming his business liabilities in an amount stated, issuing to him or his nominees 600 fully paid up shares of the par value of $100 each, and giving a demand note in the sum of $123,097.34. This agreement was also dated August 31, 1940, and it is to be noted that no part of the stipulated consideration was allocated to any of the assets agreed to be sold. The respondent company was not incorporated until some fourteen months thereafter when, by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act dated October 20, 1941, it came into being. Its organization meetings were held in the following month when a further agreement dated November 28, 1941, was made between McCool, Ryan and the new company whereby McCool, with Ryan's expressed consent, agreed to sell the assets referred to and an additional piece of land to the company for the consideration mentioned. Three hundred and sixty of the shares were directed to be issued to Thomas E. McCool and on his direction the remaining 240 shares were issued to his nominees, most of whom appear to have been members of his family, and the promissory note was delivered. Neither this agreement nor the minutes of the meetings of the company authorizing its execution allocate any portion of the agreed purchase price to the timber limits in question.\nWhile the company did not commence to carry on business until October 21, 1941, Mr. Ryan prepared what he called a balance sheet of the company as of August 31, 1940, and this was produced and filed as an exhibit at the trial, accompanied by a letter addressed by him to the shareholders dated November 10, 1941, stating that in accordance with the instructions received he had prepared the balance sheet. The minutes of the company's various meetings held at the time of the acquisition of the assets contain no reference to this letter or to the balance sheet and while Ryan gave evidence at the trial he said nothing to indicate that they had been considered or formally dealt with by either the shareholders or the directors. By a further letter addressed to the shareholders dated December 15, 1942, Ryan advised the shareholders that he had prepared a balance sheet as of August 31, 1942, and this document was filed with the Inspector of Income Tax with the company's return dated December 16, 1942, for the taxation period in question. In the balance sheet of August 31, 1940, the Booth limits were shown among the fixed assets of the company as an amount of $150,000: in the balance sheet as of August 31, 1942, they were shown at the sum of $150,812 and to the latter statement filed with the taxation return there was attached a statement as to the depletion claimed which read:\u2014\nI estimate on the basis of a cruise made of this limit there would be twenty million feet of standing timber consisting of white, red and jack pine, spruce, balsam, poplar, birch, basswood, cedar at the time of purchase. The cost per one thousand feet-board measure would be $7.50 to give a total cost of $150,000\u201420,000,000 feet at $7.50 per thousand.\nand below this there appeared the words \"Certified correct\n\u2014T. E. McCool Limited per T. E. McCool, President.\"\nSince the appeal is in respect of the amount allowed in the exercise of a discretion, it is necessary to ascertain the nature of the material which was before the Minister when the amount of the allowance to be made for depletion was determined. This consisted of the option agreement, the balance sheet of T. E. McCool as of August 31, 1940, the so-called trust agreement between McCool and Ryan, the so-called opening balance sheet of T. E. McCool Ltd. as of August 31, 1940, the balance sheet for the period ending August 31, 1942, with the attached schedules and McCool's certificate as to the value upon which the company claimed depletion, and a report of the assessor showing that the shares had been issued and that McCool had paid a gift tax on the 240 shares he had given to the members of his family and others on the footing that they were of the value of $100 each. In so far as the Booth limits were concerned, the only information touching their value was accordingly the admitted fact that they had been bought in the year 1940 for $35,000 and that the purchaser T. E. McCool had shown them as of this value in his balance sheet for the period ending August 31, 1940, and his statement appended to the tax return of the company dated December 16, 1942, that he estimated that there were 20,000,000 feet b.m. on the limit and that the \"cost\" of 1,000 feet would be $7.50 on the basis apparently that $150,000 had been the cost to the company of the purchase of the timber limits at which amount they were valued in the balance sheet of August 31, 1942. The Minister thus had before him evidence as to the purchase price agreed to be paid for the transaction between two parties who were at arm's length and the fact that Mr. McCool, an experienced lumberman, showed the properties in the balance sheet of his own business as being of the same value as the stipulated purchase price, and on the other hand the fact that in the balance sheet prepared after the incorporation of the company this same asset had been shown at a value of $150,000 and to a slightly increased amount as of August 31,1942. It was undoubtedly, in my opinion, the intention of the Minister to provide for a depletion allowance on the basis of the value of the limits and not upon their cost to the company and I see nothing in this record justifying the intervention of the court when, upon the evidence before him, he found that that value was the lesser of these two figures.\nIn the notice of appeal from the assessment the respondent company in the statement of facts recited the agreement made by it with T. E. McCool for the purchase of the limits on November 28, 1941, and contended that the Booth timber limits were transferred to the company \"on a valuation of $150,000\" and claimed depletion on the basis of this valuation \"being the price paid by it for the said limits when purchased from Mr. McCool and being less than the actual market value of the said limits\" at the date the company acquired them. Upon the Minister rendering his decision rejecting the appeal, the notice of dissatisfaction retiterated the statement of facts contained in the notice of appeal and claimed that the discretionary power of the Minister \"has not been properly exercised, is not in conformity with the provisions of the Act, has not been exercised in a reasonable manner and the facts upon which such discretion was exercised were not properly before the Minister, nor were they examined by him.\" It is, in my opinion, of importance that when by consent pleadings were delivered the taxpayer alleged that at the time of the transfer of the assets the Booth timber limite were transferred to the company \"at a cost of $150,000.\" and that it was not alleged that the limits were of that value so that the question of value was not placed in issue. The complaint as to the exercise of the Minister's discretion was that he had erred in :\u2014\nnot exercising any discretion, or in not exercising his discretion on material sufficient in law to support his decision, and that such decision was made in a purely arbitrary manner, and that the decision of the Minister and his reply contained no grounds or reasons for his decision, nor are the facts outlined' therein upon which the Minister arrived at his decision.\nThe statement of defence filed by the Minister after denying these allegations contended that the Minister had exercised his discretionary power in accordance with proper legal principles.\nMuch of the evidence admitted at the trial was, in my opinion, irrelevant: its admission appears to me to have been based on a misconception as to the issues that were to be tried. In The Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights' Canadian Ropes 15, Lord Greene, M.R., dealing with an appeal from the exercise of the Minister's discretion under sec. 6(2), pointed out that since an appeal is given by the statute this involved the consequence that the Court was entitled to examine the determination of the Minister but that the limits within which the Court is entitled to interfere are strictly circumscribed. It is for the taxpayer to show that there is ground for interference and, unless it is shown that the Minister has acted in contravention of some principle of law, the Court cannot interfere. After quoting the language of Lord Thankerton in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners v. Minister of National Revenue 16, adopting the language of Davis J. in that case in this Court 17, that the Court would not interfere with the Minister's decision unless \"it was manifestly against sound fundamental principles\", Lord Greene said in part:\u2014\nThe court is, in their Lordships' opinion, always entitled to examine the facts which are shown by evidence to have been before the Minister when he made his determination. If those facts are in the opinion of the Court insufficient in law to support it, the determination cannot stand. In such a case the determination can only have been an arbitrary one. If, on the other hand, there is on the facts shown to have been before the Minister sufficient material to support his determination the Court is not at liberty to overrule it merely because it would itself on those facts have come to a different conclusion. In Fraser v. Minister of National Revenue 18, a case in which the exercise by the Minister of his discretion under the same subsection as is here under consideration, Lord MacMillan, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part:\u2014\nThe criteria by which the exercise of a statutory discretion must be judged has been decided in many authoritative cases, and it is well settled that if the discretion has been exercised bona fide, uninfluenced by irrelevant considerations and not arbitrarily or illegally, no court is entitled to interfere even if the court, had the discretion been theirs, might have exercised it otherwise.\nThis was the question to be determined at the trial in the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer, however, tendered evidence to indicate that at the time of the acquisition of the timber limits by the company they were of a fair value of $150,000. It is not suggested that the value as of August 31, 1940, when McCool entered into the agreement with Ryan, differed from that of November 28, 1941. None of this evidence had been before the Minister and in effect the contention of the appellant company was that his finding should be set aside upon evidence that was not before him. The evidence as to the value was, however, in my opinion clearly inadmissible on a second ground. The court having ordered the delivery of pleadings sec. 36 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, cap. 40 applied and the practice and procedure in the action was to be that of similar actions in the High Court of Justice in England on the 1st day of October 1887, unless otherwise provided by the Act and general rules made in pursuance of the Act. I find nothing in either the statute or in any rules of court which alters the practice of the High Court of Justice that the issues to be determined at the trial are those disclosed by the pleadings. In Johnston v. The Minister of National Revenue 19, at 489, Rand J. in delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court said that in such an appeal the taxpayer must allege the grounds upon which he relies in support of his claim that the decision of the Minister is erroneous. Here, in spite of the fact that the question of the value of the limits was not raised in the pleadings, the evidence was received and the learned trial judge, being of the opinion that since it was contended in the notice of appeal that the limits were of the value of $150,000 that question was in issue, said:\nThe question of value is clearly relevant to the issue and it is not barred by the provisions of sec. 65(1) of the Income War Tax Act, as the appellant clearly raised that issue in its Notice of Appeal.\nWith great respect, I think there is nothing in sec. 65 which affects the provisions of sec. 36 of the Exchequer Court Act. That section is merely intended to permit the appellant to raise in his pleadings whatever issues he may wish, without being restricted by the grounds raised in the notice of appeal or notice of dissatisfaction. If the learned trial judge by the passage quoted intended to indicate that the issues to be tried in the Excheuer Court where pleadings are delivered are those raised by the notice of appeal and the notice of dissatisfaction as well as by the pleadings, I am unable to agree. That the timber limits had been acquired by the respondent company at a cost of $150,000 was, however, clearly raised by the pleadings and the learned trial judge found that this had been proven. The only evidence on this point is that of T. E. McCool and Ryan since, as has been above pointed out, nothing in the agreements or the company's records throws any light on the matter. Mr. Ryan, however, who had prepared both the financial statement of T. E. McCool as of August 31, 1940, and the so-called opening statement of the company bearing the same date, said that the limit was actually valued at $150,000 at the time that McCool agreed to sell it to the company in 1940, and the other assets acquired were of a value in round figures of $70,000. Mr. McCool said that it was valued at this amount \"when it was transferred to the company\", this being some fourteen months after the date referred to by Ryan. While the cost of the limits to the taxpayer had been put in issue by the pleadings, it is not suggested that when the Minister exercised his discretion he had been informed that the cost to the taxpayer was the larger amount and, even if the evidence had been relevant, I do not think the fact was established by the evidence of Ryan and McCool. It is to be borne in mind that Ryan who professed to act as trustee for a nonexistent cestui qui trust when entering into the agreement with McCool on August 31, 1940, was simply the latter's nominee. He was not acting as trustee for the persons who it was intended should become shareholders of the proposed company and it is clear from the terms of the instrument that he did not intend to bargain for the limit on his own behalf. Assuming, as I do, that there was a discussion between McCool and Ryan as to the value of the respective assets referred to in the agreement of August 31, 1940, that cannot establish the agreed purchase price as between the company and McCool under the agreement made fourteen months later. As to McCool's evidence, he did not explain by whom the timber limits were so valued at the time they were purchased by the company and I think the fact was not proven.\nIt is further said in the reasons for judgment at the trial that:\u2014\nIn this case, as in the Pioneer Laundry Case, the Deputy Minister has based his decision on two grounds: (a) that there was no actual change of ownership of the assets, and (b) the assets (the Booth Limits) were \"set up in the books of the appellant Company at appreciated values.\"\nand that in fixing the depletion allowance the Minister had proceeded on a wrong principle since he had based the allowance on the cost of the limits to a predecessor in title. The letter accompanying the notice of assessment does not, in my view, support this view. That letter informed the taxpayer that the Deputy Minister had ruled that the limits would be valued for the purpose of the Act at the cost price to McCool of $35,000. That was the Minister's opinion as to the value of the property and nothing more. The argument for the respondent company is really that the Minister fell into the same error as had been made in the Pioneer Laundry case, having declined to recognize that T. E. McCool Ltd. was a separate entity and considering it as merely the alter ego of McCool. The only evidence which might support such a contention is that to be found in the examination for discovery of an officer of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue which was put in evidence at the trial. The witness, who had not been in the employ of the Government at the time the discretion of the Minister was exercised, was of the opinion that the decision had been made by Mr. C. F. Elliott, K.C., the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, and was permitted to express certain opinions as to what he thought might have influenced Mr. Elliott in making his determination. Many of the answers which this witness was permitted to make were simply speculations on his part and were inadmissible and while they were given without objection this cannot affect the weight to be given to them. Thus the witness was permitted to say that the figure of $35,000 \"was fixed by the Department\" because \"the Department felt that that was the actual cost to the taxpayer,\" the form of the answer being prompted by the form of the question. Again the witness said that \"the Department usually looks at a transaction in regard to the market value if there is not a ready market\u2014such as there is on the stock exchange, for example, or over the counter trading\u2014as the last transaction that took place for cash, at arm's length or as between strangers.\" If the evidence was of any value it merely indicated that the witness thought that Mr. Elliott had considered that the price paid by McCool was evidence that he might properly consider in determining the fair value of the timber limits. The witness was further asked the following questions and made the following answers:\u2014\nQ. This statement of T. E. McCool Limited dated August 31, 1940, that you mentioned, have you any knowledge as to whether or not the division of the shares as set out in that statement had some effect on the making of the decision?\u2014A. 1 would think it would.\nQ. On what basis would you think it would?\u2014A. I would consider that the company was Mr. McCool's company, that he would have control as to the price to be fixed on any assets that were purchased from himself, and consequently that that was not a transaction as between strangers.\nQ. Is there any section in the Act that you have knowledge of under which that ruling would come?\u2014A. Well, in this particular case, one that is dealing with depletion, I think it is 5(1) (a), where it is purely a matter of permission '(sic) as to the amount of the allowance to bo made.\nQ. Speaking of this distribution of shares, you have stated that the fact that Mr. McCool controlled the company might have had some bearing on the decision?\u2014A. I think it would.\nThese answers were on the face of them merely expressions of the witness' opinion and speculations as to what may have had \"some bearing on the decision\" and inadmissible as evidence. I find no support in this evidence for the view that the Deputy Minister in coming to his decision fell into the error made in the Pioneer Laundry case or based his decision on the ground that the assets were set up in the books of the appellant company at appreciated values or to qualify in any way the statement made by the assessor in the letter of February 9, 1945, which accompanied the notice of assessment. Having decided in the exercise of his discretion that an allowance for depletion should be made, it was further within his discretion to determine that the value of the limits, and not their cost to the company, should be the basis of the allowance. There was evidence before him, in my opinion, upon which he might properly find that the fair value of the limits was $35,000 and I do not find any evidence that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations or otherwise acted in an arbitrary or illegal manner justifying the intervention of the Court. In the light of the evidence as to value which was admitted at the trial under the above mentioned circumstances, the amount fixed by the Minister may well have been much less than the true value but this does not, in my opinion, enable us to refer the matter back to him for further consideration. To do so involves setting the assessment aside and I am unable to see upon what ground this can be done. If the Minister should consider that under all the circumstances some relief should be given to this taxpayer, no doubt this can be done.\nThe appeal as to the depletion allowance should be allowed and the judgment in the Exchequer Court set aside, with costs in both Courts.\nAs to the claim of the respondent company to the allowance for interest on the promissory note, I agree with the learned trial judge and would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed without costs in either Court, assessment set aside and matter referred back to the Minister to take such further action as all the facts disclosed, or to be disclosed, call for. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T. Z. Boles.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Scott, Kelley and Howard.\n1 [1948] Ex. C.R. 548.\n2 [1948] Ex.
