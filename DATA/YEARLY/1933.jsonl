MOTION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nHenri G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the motion.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. contra.\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant moves for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada rendered December 9, 1932.\nThe matter relates to conflicting claims in applications for patents made by or on behalf of the parties. The proceeding does not involve a pecuniary demand, but affidavits are filed on behalf of the appellant to the effect that the claims in conflict are of great importance, and that their value to the parties herein and, in particular, to the appellant, is far in excess of the sum of $500. In fact it is sworn in the affidavits that, according to the value of the claims in conflict forming the subject matter of the present case, the actual amount in controversy far exceeds the sum of $500.\nIn my opinion that is sufficient to give the Supreme Court of Canada jurisdiction to entertain the appeal in this case under section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act. The right of appeal given therein, although expressed in the words \u201cthe actual amount in controversy,\u201d should be held to extend not only to cases where a sum of money exceeding $500 is actually in dispute, but also to cases where a claim to property or rights of a value exceeding $500 is actually involved in the proceeding. I take this to be the effect of the unanimous judgment of this Court in the case of Burnett v. Hutchins Car Roofing Co.[1], which is directly in point because the matter there in controversy related, as it does in the present case, to conflicting applications for a patent.\nIt might also be stated that in Borrowman v. The Permutit Company[2], in a similar case of conflicting applications, this Court entertained jurisdiction (although, however, the point was not raised) and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[3] subsequently confirmed the judgment of this Court.\nMoreover, the question of the proper construction to be given to the words \u201cactual amount in controversy\u201d in section 82 was discussed in this Court in the case of The Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. The Superintendent of Insurance[4]. The Chief Justice (with whom Cannon J. concurred) was of opinion that the condition of the right to appeal was not satisfied in that case, because there was not at stake \u201ca pecuniary sum of more than $500, or, at least, tangible property, exceeding that amount in actual value,\u201d and the right to recover which was directly in issue in the judicial proceeding. Duff J., (with whom Smith J. concurred) thought section 82 should be read with section 83 of the Exchequer Court Act and, \u201chaving regard to the general scope of the sections, it must be held that in this particular respect the conditions of jurisdiction * * *\u201d are complied with \u201cif the right immediately involved amounted to the value of\u201d $500.\nFrom this Court the case went to the Privy Council[5] where the question as to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to consider the judgment of the Exchequer Court Judge was given up, but, in their reasons, their Lordships declared themselves to be in agreement with the dissenting Judges in this Court. If the Supreme Court were without jurisdiction, it would seem to follow as a logical consequence that the judgments herein would have been disregarded; and the fact that they were approved would, I think, be at least an indication that, in the opinion of their Lordships, the Court was not precluded from entertaining jurisdiction under the conditions referred to.\nBeing of opinion that the affidavits filed establish the value of the claims in dispute at more than $500, and that, therefore, the appellant has a right of appeal de piano to this Court, and that this is a judicial proceeding wherein the actual amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $500 within the meaning of s. 82, I entertain some doubt accordingly as to my authority to allow an appeal under section 83 and, at all events, if I am right, the special leave to appeal becomes unnecessary. However, my decision is not binding on the full Court and it may well be that the Court might hold a different view.\nUnder the circumstances it seems to me that the proper course to follow is to notify the parties of the opinion I hold at present on the motion of the appellant presented to me, so that the appellant, if it is so advised, may proceed to lodge its appeal in the ordinary way under section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nIn the meantime I wish to express no opinion on the question whether this is a proper case for the granting of special leave to appeal under section 83 of the Act. I will keep the motion before me for further adjudication, according as occasion requires, at the request of either party, after notice to the other.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lajoie, Lajoie, Gelinas & Macnaughten.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] (1917) 54 Can.

V, c. 70, s. 6 (1)\u2014Manufacturing company and selling company and control by foreign parent company\u2014Relationship of the companies and mode of business\u2014Sales by manufacturing company to selling company and by latter to public\u2014\u201cSale price\u201d for basis of the tax. P. Co. (an Ontario company), incorporated January 17, 1924, manufactured (inter alia) certain kinds of toilet articles, which they sold only (and were, by arrangement, allowed to sell only) to C. Co. (a Dominion company, which, prior to incorporation of P. Co., was engaged in the manufacture and sale of such articles) which sold them to the trade. Both companies had the same president, and the same vice-president and general manager. All the capital stock of both companies, except qualifying shares, was owned by a foreign parent company, which fixed from time to time the percentage over cost to be allowed P. Co., on figures furnished by department heads. The quantity of goods to be produced by P. Co. was prescribed by C. Co., which controlled the formul\u00e6. The Crown claimed that the sales (from January 17, 1924, to April 13, 1927) made by C. Co. to the trade were chargeable with sales tax, under s. 19BBB (1) of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 70, s. 6 (1). The companies claimed that the price at which P. Co. sold to C. Co. (and not the price received by C. Co., as claimed by the Crown) was the proper basis for the tax.\nHeld: C. Co. (but not P. Co.) was liable for the tax, based on the prices obtained by it, as being the real prices taxable under the true intent of the Act. The character and substance of the real transaction must, for taxation purposes, be ascertained and the tax levied on that basis. On the evidence it must be held that the goods in question were produced and sold to the public by a combination of the two incorporated departments of a foreign company doing business here in order to reach the Canadian consumer. While the two companies were separate legal entities, yet in fact, and for all practical purposes, they were merged, P. Co. being but a part of C. Co., acting merely as its agent and subject in all things to its proper direction and control.\nDixon v. London Small Arms Co., 1 App. Cas. 632, at 647-648, 651, etc., and other cases, referred to.\nJudgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court, [1932] Ex. C.R. 120 (holding P. Co. liable for the tax, to be based on the selling price of the goods calculated at the \u201cfair market price,\u201d as and when sold), varied.\nAPPEALS and cross-appeal from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada. (1)\nThe plaintiff claimed from the defendants a sum alleged to be due for sales tax, and for interest and penalties.\nMaclean J.[1] found that the sale price on which the defendant, The Palmolive Manufacturing Co. (Ontario) Ltd., had paid sales tax was not the \u201csale price\u201d on which it should have been paid, within the meaning of the Special War Revenue Act, and declared that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from that defendant the balance due, and that the sales tax be based upon the selling price of the goods calculated at the fair market price of same as and when sold, reserving the precise amount recoverable under the judgment and the question of interest and penalties. He dismissed the action as against the defendant, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. Ltd.\nThe defendant, The Palmolive Manufacturing Co. (Ontario) Ltd., appealed to this Court. The plaintiff appealed and cross-appealed, claiming that the judgment below should be varied by declaring that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants sales tax calculated upon the price received by the defendant, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. Ltd., and by giving judgment against the latter company as well as against the other defendant, and by directing payment by the defendants of interest and penalties.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of this Court now reported.\nThe appeal of the defendant, The Palmolive Manufacturing Co. (Ontario) Ltd., was allowed, and the action against it dismissed without costs throughout either to or against it. The appeal of the plaintiff against the defendant, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. Ltd., was allowed and the case against that company remitted to the Exchequer Court with a direction to enter judgment for the amount of the sales tax, at the rates from time to time applicable, based on the prices obtained by that company (less the amounts already paid by the other defendant), with interest at the rate of 5% per annum up to 14th April, 1927, and thereafter at the rate of 2\/3 of 1% per month; with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nW. N. Tilley, K.C., and G. M. Clark, K.C., for the companies.\nH. H. Davis, K.C., and D. Guthrie for the Crown.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Cannon J.\u2014These are an appeal and a cross-appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada of the 12th of May, 1932[2], in an action brought by His Majesty the King on the information of the Attorney General of Canada against Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company and The Palmolive Manufacturing Company (Ontario) for the recovery of sales tax on goods sold between the 17th January, 1924, and the 13th April, 1927, together with interest and statutory penalties.\nPrior to the 1st of January, 1924, the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended, imposed, by sec. 19 BBB, an excise tax on sales and deliveries by manufacturers, or producers, and wholesalers, or jobbers. This section was replaced by 13-14 Geo. V, c. 70, s. 6 (1), as follows:\n19 B.B.B. (1). In addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Part, or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of six per cent on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, including the amount of excise duties when the goods are sold in bond, which tax shall be payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him.\nThis new levy came into force on the 1st of January, 1924, and imposed \u201ca consumption or sales tax\u201d on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, which tax was made payable \u201cby the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him\u201d.\nSince 1917, the Palmolive Company of Canada Ltd., whose name was later changed to Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co. Ltd., one of the defendants (which will hereinafter be called the Dominion company), was engaged in the manufacturing and sale of soap and toilet preparations in Toronto. On the 17th January, 1924, the other defendant, the Palmolive Manufacturing Company (Ontario) Limited (which will hereinafter be called the Ontario company) was incorporated. The letters patent have not been produced; but from the evidence it appears that during the period from the 17th of January, 1924, until the 13th of April, 1927, this company was engaged, with the Dominion company, in the manufacturing and sale of toilet soap and toilet articles.\nThe only witness heard was Mr. Charles R. Vint, who has been, throughout that period, Vice-President and General Manager of both companies. Although the evidence would have been more satisfactory if the contracts between the two companies and with the parent American company had been produced, this gentleman seems to have given fairly and without reticence the relationship of the three companies and the mode in which the business was carried on. Avoiding the incidence of taxation is one of the reasons mentioned for the incorporation of the Ontario company, and it is claimed that, by this incorporation in 1924 of a manufacturing company, the price arranged between this unit of the organization with the older company which continued to sell to the public, is the real price of the goods produced or manufactured by them and is, legally, the basis of the sales tax payable by this producer.\nThe Crown, by their cross-appeal, contended that the price received from the public by the Dominion company for their goods is the only and real price of sale which should be considered.\nAccording to Mr. Vint, the following conditions obtained during the period under scrutiny:\n1. All the capital stock of both the Dominion and the Ontario companies, except the few qualification shares, was owned and held by the parent company, the Palmolive Company of Delaware;\n2. Each company had the same President;\n3. Mr. Vint was Vice-President and General Manager of each company;\n4. The Ontario company\u2019s activities were limited to manufacturing and, to a certain extent, shipping operations;\n5. The salaries of the employees of both companies were fixed by the parent company;\n6. The quantity of goods to be produced by the Ontario company was prescribed in advance by the selling company which controlled the formulae and prescriptions;\n7. The raw materials (oils) were purchased as previously by or through the parent company;\n8. The percentage over cost to be allowed to the Ontario company was fixed from time to time by the parent company on figures furnished by department heads;\n9. The cost to the customers of the Dominion company was just the same (subject to trade fluctuations) as it was before what Mr. Vint calls the departmentalization of the original business;\n10. Goods were shipped, from Toronto at least, by the manufacturing (Ontario) company direct to the customers on the instructions of the Dominion company and also, on the same instructions, to warehouses in Montreal and Winnipeg. These warehouses, although the evidence is not clear, seem to have remained the property of the Dominion company;\n11. The two departments, during all this period, were carried on in the same premises as before, with the same machinery, and, more or less, the same workmen, the same superintendents and the same employees;\n12. The Ontario company, according to Mr. Vint, had no right to sell Palmolive goods to outsiders. This is to be noted as the present case concerns only the sale of Palmolive goods. \u201cThe Dominion Company,\u201d says Mr. Vint, \u201care owners of the Palmolive Trade Marks; they could not allow their goods to be manufactured promiscuusly, could they; they had to be manufactured under their proper arrangements in order to protect their trade marks, and they were interested primarily in goods of their own manufacture, but the Manufacturing Company sold goods on their own account that were not under trade marks\u201d;\n13. The Dominion company gave permission to the Ontario company to make the goods according to the formul\u00e6 and prescriptions and to make the wrappers and everything necessary according to trade mark directions.\nUnder those circumstances, the Crown alleges as a fact that the defendant, the Ontario company, was the instrument or agent of the defendant, the Dominion company, and that the operations of the manufacturing company were the operations of the Dominion company; that the alleged sales made by the Ontario company to the Dominion company were fictitious and made with intent to avoid payment of the amount of sales tax properly payable and that the sales of the Dominion company to the trade were chargeable with sales tax.\nIn order to determine whether the Ontario company was an independent manufacturer or the agent and subordinate of the older company, I believe the case of Dixon v. London Small Arms Company[3] to be very much in point. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, Lord Hatherley, Lord Penzance, Lord O\u2019Hagan and Lord Selborne all discuss under what circumstances a manufacturer might be considered as a private contractor or as the agent of the person who wishes to produce a certain article.\nLord Hatherley, at pp. 647-648, says:\nNow I apprehend, my Lords, that when you speak of a home manufacture, and a manufacture through the medium of servants and agents of your own, you ordinarily mean, although in some cases some elements may be wanting, and in others, others\u2014that there is a plant\u2014that you have an establishment\u2014that you either have in your own possession or have acquired by purchase the article upon which you are to operate in bringing your manufacture to perfection\u2014and, having done all that, you proceed to manufacture as you think fit, at your own time and in your own manner, stopping the manufacture when you think fit so to do, and retaining the control over it in your own hands. I do not think that that would be interfered with because you might give cut one or two portions of it to be manufactured by piece-work, if you think fit to do so. But how different is that from the contract which you enter into when you go out into the open market and purchase an article.\nAnd Lord Penzance says (p. 651):\n* * * and I conceive that the argument * * * that it was a contract of agency, rests upon the general proposition that in all cases where an individual, bargaining, contracts to sell a completed article, which is to be manufactured according to the special directions of the purchaser, he is, while in the course of manufacturing that completed article, the agent of the purchaser.\nAnother test proposed by the noble Lord Penzance is whether there is anything in the contract that would prevent the manufacturer from selling the same goods (in that case small arms) to a foreign government. If he could do so, he must be considered to have been an independent contractor and not an agent of the Crown.\nNow, in our case, it clearly appears that the Ontario company were not at liberty to sell the Palmolive products to outsiders. They were not free agents, as far as the manufacture and sale of these articles were concerned.\nAnother test submitted by the House of Lords was: While the work was going on, could the dismissal of a workman be ordered or could any step which the officers of the Dominion company thought desirable in the organization of the Ontario company be ordered by the General Manager of the latter company, who was also the General Manager of the other company? Could the General Manager give any special direction for doing the work in a special way; or was that entirely in the power of the Ontario company? Could the Dominion company withdraw any orders they had given or order that the same should be done in a different way? Who could decide the rate at which the work should proceed?\nEvidently the Ontario company had to carry out the instructions of the Dominion company. Was not this home manufacture, to use the expression of Lord Hatherley, acting under a master\u2019s control, dealing with a master\u2019s product and attending solely to a master\u2019s interest? The two companies were not even free agents in fixing the alleged price or remuneration, as this was determined by the parent company, as appears by the following:\nQ. Then during that period, from January, 1924, to April, 1927, who fixed the cost, or the prices, rather, to be paid by the Dominion Company to the Ontario Company?\u2014A. That was made by\u2014in consultation with the Delaware Company, having regard for the interests of both companies.\nQ. Consultation by whom with the Delaware Company?\u2014A. Well, our Delaware office.\nQ. By you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You, as representing both the Dominion and the Ontario Companies?\u2014A. Well yes, as Manager of both. I had facts, of course, on the operations of both companies.\nQ. Well then, you, after consultation with the Delaware Company, decided what was a fair price to charge?\u2014A. At the meeting in the Delaware office the facts were presented and it was the opinion of the meeting\u2014prices were arrived at as of the opinion of the meeting, you see.\nThis is not an ordinary free sale in the open market, where a freely made tender by a person is freely accepted or rejected by another person. I entertain serious doubt, in the absence of a written contract between the two companies, whether this evidence is sufficient to show that the contract of sale really existed, as alleged by the defendant. In order to effect a sale, it is manifest from the general principles which govern all contracts that it requires two parties capable of giving, freely, a mutual assent.\nAccording to Collinson v. Lister[4], a contract requires two parties and a man in one character can with difficulty contract with himself in another character. And in Grey v. Ellison[5]: A company which carries on two kinds of business under two separate departments, is nevertheless one company, so that one department of it cannot enter into a contract with the other. At page 444, the Vice-Chancellor, in this case of Grey v. Ellison, says: If a man were so fanciful as to grant a lease to himself of his own house, with a covenant that he should quietly enjoy, and a covenant that he should pay to himself a rent for his own house, and chooses to conduct it in the way of having two departments, that is, that he will draw cheques upon himself upon his own account for rent, and pay them into another account of his own at his bankers\u2014it would be a mere whimsical transaction; but it would be futile and an abuse of language to say that it came within the law of contract.\nBut, in the present case, the producer has incorporated the manufacturing department as a separate company. Is this sufficient to successfully avoid the payment of the sales tax on the real price paid by the public when purchasing the goods of this producer?\nIn Cartwright v. City of Toronto[6], which was also an assessment case, my brother Duff stated that taxing statutes \u201cmust be construed according to the usual rule, that is to say, with reasonable regard to the manifest object of them as disclosed by the enactment as a whole.\u201d\nAnd under the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, sec. 15,\nEvery Act and every provision and enactment thereof, shall * * * receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nI believe that the character and substance of the real transaction must, for taxation purposes, be ascertained and the tax levied on that basis.\nIn The Gramophone and Typewriter Limited v. Stanley[7], Cozens-Hardy, M.R., said:\nI do not doubt that a person in that position may cause such an arrangement to be entered into between himself and the company as will suffice to constitute the company his agent for the purpose of carrying on the business, and thereupon the business will become, for all taxing purposes, his business. Whether this consequence follows is in each case a matter of fact.\nIn The King v. Bloomsbury Income Tax Commissioners[8], Lord Reading, C.J., deals with two companies in the light of the law as laid down in the Salomon case[9], and says that if the companies were in fact acting as agents for and carrying on the business of a partnership the applicant would be liable to income tax in respect of the profits and gains made by the firm. In Daimler Company Limited v. Continental Tyre & Rubber Company[10], Lord Halsbury, at page 316, went behind the legal entity and held that the English company controlled by German directors and shareholders was in substance a hostile partnership and was therefore incapable of suing. To use his words, it became material \u201cto consider what is this thing which is described as a \u2018corporation\u2019.\u201d\nIn Rainham Chemical Works Limited v. Belvedere Fish Guano Company Limited[11], Lord Buckmaster says:\nA company, therefore, which is duly incorporated, cannot be disregarded on the ground that it is a sham, although it may be established by evidence that in its operations it does not act on its own behalf as an independent trading unit, but simply for and on behalf of the people by whom it has been called into existence.\nA reference may also be made to the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 decisions treating two distinct corporate entities as parts of the same enterprise and the apparent transactions between them as really nothing more than book-keeping entries. Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe[12]; Gulf Oil Corporation v. Lewellyn[13].\nThe above authorities satisfy me that we must, as matters of fact, identify the producer of the goods and determine the real price received by such producer when selling them to the public for consumption. In this case, it is abundantly clear that the Palmolive soap is produced and sold to the public by a combination of these two incorporated departments of a foreign company doing business here in order to reach the Canadian consumer. While the two companies are separate legal entities, yet in fact, and for all practical purposes, they are merged, the Ontario company being but a part of the Dominion company, acting merely as its agent and subject in all things to its proper direction and control. In order to reach completely the producer, both companies had to be brought before the court; and I believe that the Crown\u2019s cross-appeal against the Dominion company should be allowed. That company should be condemned to pay the tax at the rates from time to time applicable based on the prices obtained by the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company, Limited, during the period under scrutiny, less the amounts already paid, with interest at the rate of 5% per annum to the 14th of April, 1927, and thereafter at the rate of 2\/3 of 1% per month. We are bound on this issue by The King v. Carling Export Brewing & Malting Co. Ltd.[14], confirmed on this point by the Privy Council[15].\nThe condemnation against the Palmolive Manufacturing Company (Ontario) cannot stand, as they were, under the evidence, only agents of the producers, who also looked after the sales of the Palmolive products, and its appeal should therefore be allowed and the claim against it dismissed\u2014but, in view of the circumstances, there should be no costs throughout either to or against that company.\nThe cross-appeal should be allowed and there should be judgment against the Dominion company for the amount of sales taxes at the rates from time to time applicable and based upon the price received by the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company Ltd. for the goods mentioned in paragraph seven of the information herein, less the amounts paid by the Palmolive Manufacturing Company (Ontario) Limited, with interest at 5% from the date on which such sales taxes became due until the 14th of April, 1927; and thereafter a penalty of 2\/3 of 1% per month. Each party will pay their own costs on the appeal of the Ontario company against The King; costs will be against the respondent in the cross-appeal of His Majesty versus The Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company Limited both here and before the Exchequer Court; and the case will be remitted to the latter court with a direction to enter judgment accordingly.\nAppeal of The Palmolive Mfg. Co. (Ont.) Ltd. allowed without costs.\nAppeal of His Majesty the King against Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co.

As to the others (certain openings in the blade for certain purposes)\u2014if construed as presenting generally certain characteristics, they were invalid, having regard to the prior art; if construed as limited to the precise mechanism described in the specification and shown in the drawings, the respondent\u2019s blade did not infringe; the patent in question had to do with a certain mechanical improvement in a well known class of safety razors; and, even if there was valid subject matter of a patent in the blade alone (to which a contrary view was indicated), the subject matter lay in the particular mechanical mode by which the alleged invention was carried into operation, and the patentee could not bring within the scope of his invention a blade such as that of respondent (although it might fit the patented razor), differing, in the respects in which it did, from what the patentee had specifically described and claimed. (Tweedale v. Ashworth, 9 R.P.C. 121, at 126, 128, and other cases cited).\nThe nature of the invention protected by a patent and the extent of the monopoly thereby granted must be ascertained from the claims. The claims should be construed with reference to the specification and to the drawings, but the patentee\u2019s monopoly is confined to what he has claimed as his invention (Patent Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 150, s. 14; Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. Tubeless Pneumatic Tyre & Capon Headon Ltd., 15 R.P.C., 236, at 241; Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Co. v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co. Ltd., 25 R.P.C. 61, at 82-83).\nThe patentee had claimed the blade as an appendant or subordinate invention (in addition to the main or principal invention consisting in the complete safety razor). In such a case, the patentee must describe with particular distinctness the alleged new element for which he asks special protection. He must make plain the metes and bounds of the subsidiary invention and he will be held strictly to the thing in which he has claimed \u201can exclusive property and privilege\u201d (Patent Act, s. 14; Ingersoll v. Consolidated Pneumatic, supra, at 84).\nJudgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court, [1932] Ex.\nC.R. 132, dismissing appellant\u2019s action, affirmed. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1), dismissing its action for alleged infringement of a patent. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nA. W. Anglin K.C. and E. G. Gowling for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., R. S. Smart K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant brought this action against the respondent for the alleged infringement of patent No. 260,368. The particulars of breaches were that the respondent manufactured and sold razor blades which constitute an infringement of claims 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the patent.\nThe defence was: no infringement; and, alternatively, no invention on account of anticipation, lack of novelty and lack of utility.\nBefore the Exchequer Court, the appellant failed in its action, which was dismissed with costs[1].\nThe patent relates to safety razors and the invention is stated to be particularly applicable to the class of safety razors comprising a guard, a backing and a thin flexible blade clamped between the guard and the backing to retain the cutting edge of the blade in shaving position to the guard teeth.\nIn the class of razors referred to, as, for example, in the widely known razors of the original Gillette type, it has been customary to provide the backing members with pins that project through holes in the blade and into holes in the guard member, whereby the blade and the backing are retained from rotation on the guard by the co-operation of the pins with the guard and by the clamping of the blade between the guard and the backing, so that the blade performs no function in retaining any of the said parts in relation one to another.\nThe object of the invention defined in the patent is said to provide a safety razor wherein a blade will co-operate with a guard member to retain the blade in shaving relation thereto and the blade will also co-operate with a backing member to retain the latter in proper relation to the blade for shaving purposes, so that the position of the backing member with regard to the guard member is maintained by the blade and not by the co-operation of said members together in the well known manner which used to prevail up till then.\nHaving so defined the object of the invention, the specification states that the latter comprises novel details of improvement more fully set forth thereinafter and to be pointed out in the claims; also, that \u201creference is to be had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof.\u201d The specification then proceeds to describe the razor, and the description refers to the blade as follows:\nThe blade is provided with a substantially centrally disposed opening 2a through which the projection 4 of the backing member may pass when the blade is between the members 1 and 3. Heretofore, so far as I am aware, the opening in the blade for the projection from the backing for clamping the parts together has been circular so that reliance was had upon spaced pins projecting from the backing to pass through spaced holes in the blade and into holes in the guard member to keep the blade and backing in position on the guard member. In accordance with my invention I provide co-operative means between the blade and the guard member to keep the blade from rotating on said member. For such purpose I provide a projection lb on the blade side of the guard member adapted to enter an opening 2a in the blade. By preference I make the opening 2a in the blade of non-circular shape, preferably having straight sides, the opening 2a in the drawing being shown in so-called diamond shape, and the projection is of non-circular shape, as shown in so-called diamond shape, (fig. 3), adapted snugly to receive the metal at the sides of opening 2a so that the blade will, by said projection, be retained upon guard member 1 with its cutting edges in shaving relation to the guard teeth when the parts are assembled. Means are provided between the blade and the backing member to cause the blade to retain the backing in operative relation to the blade and the guard, for which purpose I have shown the blade provided with recesses or openings 2b, preferably at its ends, adapted to receive projections or pins 6 extending from the backing member toward the blade, but not to co-op rate with the guard member to retain the backing.\nThe balance of the description relates to the combination of the guard, the backing member and the blade and explains how they should be assembled for purposes of cooperation.\nThere follows a series of eleven claims, the last six of which have to do with the combination, that is to say, with the complete razor; while the first five claims relate to the blade alone. They are the only claims with which we are concerned in this case and they may now be set out in this place:\n1. A blade (having means to co-operate with clamping members located on opposite sides of the blade to retain said members and blade in shaving relation.\n2. A blade having means to position it on a clamping member, and having means to co-operate with another clamping member to retain the latter member in relation to the blade.\n3. A blade provided with means to position itself on a clamping member, and having means independent of the first-named means for positioning another clamping member on the blade.\n4. A blade having a non-circular opening substantially centrally disposed to retain the blade in shaving relation to a guard member, said blade having means spaced from said opening to co-operate with a clamping member to retain the latter in shaving relation to the blade independent of the guard member.\n5. A blade having an angularly shaped opening disposed substantially centrally in the blade to co-operate with a guard member to retain the blade in shaving position thereon, and said blade being provided with means spaced from said opening to co-operate with a backing member to retain the latter in shaving relation to the blade and to the guard member.\nThe plain object of the invention as described in the specification is to substitute to the razor of the old Gillette type a new and improved safety razor wherein the position of the backing member with regard to the guard member is maintained by the blade and not by the co-operation of the backing and guard. The purpose of this was explained in the evidence.\nIn that class of razors, which have a flexible blade clamped between a guard and a backing, both the outside surface of the guard teeth as well as the upper corner at the edge of the backing member combine as a shield for the blade to prevent it cutting the face when it is in use. \u201cThe combined function of the guard and cap makes it a safety razor, provided the blade does not project too far beyond a plane which might be considered a tangent to the guard teeth and corner of the cap (or backing member), which plane (in this case) is represented by a man\u2019s cheek when he shaves with a razor. The guard teeth bear on the cheeks underneath and pull down so as to depress the cheek somewhat, so that the blade will only cut the hair and not dig deeply into the cheek.\u201d\nObviously the amount of the exposure of the blade along that tangent plane is important and has a great deal to do with the utility of the razor, for, the greater the accuracy of the blade exposure, the greater the shaving efficiency of the razor.\nAccording to the evidence, a long series of blade tests and shaving tests indicate 4\/1000 of an inch is the preferable exposure. But there are difficulties in the way of securing this result. There stands the necessity for clearance, that is, the necessity of providing a \u201csliding fit\u201d between the holes in the blade and the projections in the holder. And there is also the manufacturing necessity of providing tolerances, or, in other words, of determining, from a commercial and economical point of view in governing the factory, how far the clearances should be allowed to vary from the dimensions essentially required for the \u201csliding fit.\u201d The consequence is that the accuracy of the blade exposure is affected by these clearances and tolerances. It is contended that, through the invention, the variations caused by the cumulative effect of the clearances and tolerances are corrected to a great extent and, thus, the improvement makes surer the approximation to the ideal exposure. This is caused, it is explained, by the fact that the clearances and tolerances are taken up simultaneously by the respective movements of the several parts of the razor, that is to say, that the movements of the guard and cap\u2014which are designed to move independently from one another\u2014are controlled by the blade, acting as a link between the two. As a result, you may have the same tolerances or, in other words, the same inaccuracies in manufacture, but they are taken care of and they are corrected to an extent at least sufficient to insure at all times the desired accuracy of the blade exposure. It is in this, the appellant stated, that lies the whole point of the patent.\nThis result, however, as will be perceived, is brought about\u2014and can only be brought about\u2014by the co-operation between the blade and the other members of the razor. It is not produced\u2014and cannot be produced\u2014by the blade alone. It is essentially the result of the particular combination of the component parts of the razor.\nFor the purposes of this case, it may be assumed that there was invention in the combination referred to. If there was, it is protected by the claims of the patent which are not in issue. But the attachment of the blade to the other members of the razor is not involved here. The question we have to consider is whether the blade was patentable independently of the combination and, if so, whether it was adequately claimed and whether the blade manufactured and sold by the respondent constitutes an infringement thereof.\nIn order to answer that question, we must be guided primarily by the provisions of the 14th section of the Patent Act.\nThat section requires the specification to be a correct and full statement of what the invention is. The inventor must describe its operation or use as contemplated by him. He must set forth clearly the method of constructing or making the manufacture he has invented. He must end the specification with claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which he regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege. In any case in which the invention admits of illustration by means of drawings, the inventor shall, with his application, send in drawings showing clearly all parts of the invention and each drawing shall have written references corresponding with the specification. One duplicate of the specification and of the drawings, if there are drawings, shall be annexed to the patent, of which it shall form an essential part.\nIt follows that the nature of the invention protected by a patent and the extent of the monopoly thereby granted must be ascertained from the claims. The claims should be construed with reference to the specification and to the drawings, but, as pointed out by Lindley, M.R., in The Pneumatic Tyre Company Limited v. The Tubeless Pneumatic Tyre and Capon Headon Limited[2], whether the patentee has discovered a new thing or whether he has not, his monopoly is confined to what he has claimed as his invention. And, if the proposition requires further support, we would like to quote a passage from the speech of Lord Loreburn, L.C., (concurred in by Lord Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten and Lord Atkinson) in the case of Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Company v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Company Limited before the House of Lords[3]. It is, we think, peculiarly apposite in the circumstances:\nThere can be no dispute about the law. Each Claim in a Specification is independent, and a plaintiff in an action for infringement must show that there has been an adoption of some new invention adequately described in a Claim when fairly construed. I am not aware that any special canons of construction are applicable to Specifications, nor am I able to accept, if indeed I rightly understand them, certain formidable generalizations presented to us in argument as to the principles on which they are to be interpreted. Obviously, the rest of the Specification may be considered in order to assist in comprehending and construing a Claim, but the Claim must state, either by express words or by plain reference, what is the invention for which protection is demanded. The idea of allowing a patentee to use perfectly general language in the Claim, and subsequently to restrict, or expand, or qualify what is therein expressed by borrowing this or that gloss from other parts of the Specification, is wholly inadmissible. I should have thought it was also a wholly original pretension.\nThe claims alleged to have been infringed are set out in an earlier part of this judgment. They are five in number, but they may be divided into two groups.\nThe first group, composed of claims 1, 2 and 3, may be at once disposed of. They are clearly anticipated in the prior art and we deem it unnecessary to refer to or even to enumerate the numerous patents shown in the evidence as disclosing blades of the kind described in these claims and blades having means performing similar functions. We fail to see how claims 1, 2 and 3 may be patentably distinguished from the patents set forth in the particulars of objection and discussed in the evidence of Mr. Blosk. Moreover, each of these claims are completely met, we think, by one or the other of the original Gillette patents (U.S. Nos. 775,134 and 775,135), which have expired.\nFurther, it may be noted that claims 1, 2 and 3 do not appear in the corresponding United States patent. The evidence shows that they were inserted in the original application for that patent, but they were subsequently abandoned and cancelled.\nThe second group of claims in suit are Nos. 4 and 5. The characteristics of the blade therein described are that the blade must have a non-circular or angularly shaped opening, substantially centrally disposed, to co-operate with the guard and to retain the blade in shaving position on the guard, as well as in shaving relation to the latter; and the blade is also to be provided with means spaced from said opening to co-operate with the backing member and to retain the latter, independently of the guard, in shaving relation to the blade and to the guard.\nIn dealing with these claims, one must remember that they have reference only to the blade. They have nothing to do with the combination of blade, guard and cap covered by the subsequent claims and which is the true subject-matter of the patent. For the purpose of construing the claims, we must assume that the holder is neglected, and the blade must be envisaged, not as an element of the combination, but as a separate article independent of the other component parts of the razor. And the question must be: Is that blade standing alone as described a good and valid subject-matter of a patent?\nIn that view and as presented in the specification, the blade would be an appendant or subordinate invention, which the patentee has chosen to claim in addition to the main or principal invention consisting in the complete safety razor.\nIn such a case, the patentee must describe with particular distinctness the alleged new element for which he asks special protection. He must make plain the metes and bounds of the subsidiary invention and he will be held strictly to the thing in which (to borrow the words of s. 14 of the Act) he has claimed \u201can exclusive property and privilege.\u201d (Ingersoll Sergeant Drill Co. v. Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co. Ltd.[4].)\nThe claims relate to a blade with means to \u201cco-operate\u201d and to \u201cretain.\u201d One of the means is stated: it is the centrally disposed opening. The others are referred to merely as \u201cmeans spaced from said opening.\u201d If we look at the rest of the specification and at the drawings, to assist in comprehending what these means are, we find that what the patentee had in view and what he intended to claim were four notches or openings, at the ends of the blade, adapted to receive projections extending from the backing member of the razor. So that, so far as concerns the blade, the means disclosed throughout are nothing but holes, one set of means being the central hole and the other, the holes or openings in the ends.\nWe would not think the patentee intended to make the broad claim to the monopoly of the right to perforate any and all shapes of holes in a razor blade of the type in question. That alone would be quite sufficient to invalidate the claim, for evidently, having regard to the prior art, the claim would be abnormally wide. Always bearing in mind that the blade alone is now under discussion, we are of opinion that neither could the patentee have claimed the invention of a blade presenting generally the characteristics of a central non-circular opening with spaced corner apertures or recesses. In that connection, many prior disclosures might have to be referred to, including Krusius (U.S. 885,252), Wakeley (U.S. 1,119,132), Van Den Berg (U.S. 1,276,712); and more particularly Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Coutellerie et Orf\u00e8vrerie (Brit. 23,563), where the blade described is strikingly similar to that of the appellant\u2019s specification. If claims 4 and 5 were meant to cover all central non-circular openings with spaced corner apertures in a razor blade, the question how far they are anticipated by these patents would have to be developed.\nBut the appellant argues the openings in the blade he claims as new are openings with certain functions in the holder and the openings in the earlier blades were not intended to function in the same way as the openings described in the claims in suit. A claim for a blade haying openings with certain functions in the holder comes perilously near being a claim for the combination and not a claim for the so-called subordinate invention, for, in such a case, the utility of the holes depends entirely upon their co-operation with the projections in the other members of the razor. In any event, the moment the validity of the subordinate invention is put on that ground, it necessarily limits the form of the holes in the blade to that of holes shaped in the particular way required to function in the holder and that is to say: to holes precisely as described in the specification for the purpose of functioning in the precise holder therein described.\nThe appellant\u2019s patent does not disclose a pioneer invention. It has to do with a certain mechanical improvement in a well-known class of safety razors. Even if there be valid subject-matter of a patent in the blade alone\u2014and our present view would be that there is not\u2014the subject-matter lies in the particular mechanical mode by which the alleged invention is carried into operation (Tweedale v. Ashworth[5]). And the words of Lord Watson in that case are very pertinent (p. 128): The plain object of the invention as described in the specification is to substitute better mechanical equivalents for those already known and used as a means to the same end. It follows that, in construing the appellant\u2019s specification, the doctrine of mechanical equivalents must be left out of view. He cannot bring within the scope of his invention any mechanical equivalent which he has not specifically described and claimed.\nSimilar observations were made in Curtis v. Platt[6], and in the judgment of Lord Davey in Consolidated Car Heating Co. v. Came[7].\nIf the above principles be applied to claims 4 and 5, the appellant is driven to the alternative that: either the claims are to be construed as limited to the precise mechanism described in the specification and shown in the drawings or else they have been designed in order that they might be expanded of contracted as occasion might require in the interest of the patentee and, if that be so, they are bad and void. (See Lord Loreburn\u2019s speech in the House of Lords in Natural Colour Kinematograph Co. Ltd. v. Bioschemes Ltd.,[8]; and also that of the Lord Chancellor in British Ore Concentration Syndicate v. Minerals Separation Ltd.[9].\nThe blade disclosed in the claims in suit is a blade having a non-circular or angularly shaped opening disposed substantially centrally. The specification refers to and the drawings show a diamond shaped opening in the centre\u2014both latitudinally and longitudinally\u2014of the blade. The drawings \u201cform an essential part\u201d of the patent (Patent Act, subs. 4 of s. 14) and they are useful to indicate the invention \u201cas contemplated by the inventor\u201d (s. 14 (1) (a)). It was represented that they are only subsidiary to the Verbal description. In this case, they agree with it and, besides, reading claims 4 and 5 with the body of the specification and with the drawings is giving them a beneficial construction, as otherwise they would lack the distinctness and the precision required in the premises.\nFurther proceeding in the disclosure, we find that the function of the central opening is to co-operate with a projection of a similar shape in the guard, adapted snugly, \u201cso that the blade will * * * be retained * * * in shaving relation to the guard teeth when the parts are assembled.\u201d\nAccording to the evidence, no razor or blade was ever built by the appellant in accordance with the above description. The patent issued in May, 1926. In November, 1929, a safety razor\u2014known as the bar type razor\u2014which might or might not come under the patent\u2014went into production and was put on sale by the appellant in the early part of 1930, but the manufacture of that article was soon abandoned; and, then, another safety razor, known as the Goodwill type, claimed to be made under the patent by the appellant, came on the market in May or June, 1931. We are not called upon to decide whether the Goodwill razor corresponds to the patent. We are concerned only with the blade disclosed in the claims in suit and the question is whether that blade was patentable, whether it was adequately claimed and whether it was infringed.\nThe blade manufactured and sold by the respondent differs from that disclosed in the patent in that, instead of a diamond shaped opening disposed in the centre latitudinally and longitudinally of the blade, it has a long irregularly shaped slot extending for most of its length and that, instead of the notches in the ends, the four corners are perforated with rectangular openings. The central hole in the blade is not adapted to fit snugly over a projection in the guard. In fact, if one takes the whole opening as being a hole\u2014which it is not within the meaning of the patent\u2014that opening is not disposed centrally in the blade, in the sense that, as just mentioned, it extends practically over the whole length of the blade. Assuming the respondent\u2019s blade was used in the Goodwill holder, far from fitting snugly over the projections of the Goodwill guard, there would be no function whatever in the longitudinal slot, nor in the central hole of the respondent\u2019s blade. The means co-operating with the guard of the holder and retaining the blade in shaving relation thereto would then consist in two enlargements, diamond shaped, of the longitudinal slot; and, for that purpose, the rest of the slot and the central hole would be functionless. If one suppressed all the parts of the elongated slot thus being functionless, the blade would remain with the central hole (which has nothing to do with shaving relation), and two diamond shaped apertures spaced from the central hole; or altogether, three openings. The blade as designed by the respondent may fit the razor patented by the appellant, although it would not fulfil the functions intended in claims 4 and 5\u2014or, at least not in the same way\u2014but it will also fit the bar type razor, the Goodwill razor and other holders, according to the evidence.\nThe respondent\u2019s blade does not correspond to the blade described in the specification and in the drawings. There was no infringement. Of course, the appellant urges the respondent\u2019s blade is substantially similar to the blade used in the Goodwill type of razors. The answer is that the Goodwill blade is not the article disclosed in the patent.\nWe have been referred to a judgment rendered in the United States[10], wherein the corresponding United States patent was involved. In that case, the combination claims were sued on. Besides, it is quite apparent from the report that the evidence, the prior art referred to and, in certain aspects, the law to be applied were not the same. The whole trial was conducted on a different footing. We mention the judgment to show that it was not overlooked.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1932] Ex.

The station and tracks were in a field beyond the city limits. It was daytime. The car was going easterly. Passengers waiting at the station to return to the city were allowed to board cars from the south platform, when the cars stopped at the station, before proceeding east to turn west at a loop about 700 feet beyond the station. Plaintiff, before she reached the station, had seen the car coming and persons standing on the south platform. The jury found defendant negligent in not having the car under proper control, and plaintiff negligent in not taking a second look before crossing, and apportioned the blame for the injuries, 90% to defendant and 10% to plaintiff. The trial judge, however, dismissed the action on the ground that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Ont., [1932] O.R. 389. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld (reversing the judgments below): Plaintiff should have judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s findings, which there was evidence to support.\nAs to defendant\u2019s negligence\u2014It was not a question as to its motorman being under a duty to stop at the south platform or to expect that any person desiring to board his car for return to the city would be coming to the south platform; but a question whether, having regard to all the circumstances and conditions obtaining at the time and of which he was or should have been aware, he exercised due care in approaching and rushing through the station at the speed he did. There was clear evidence of negligence in his approaching and passing through the station at a speed which disabled him from exercising that degree of control which, under the circumstances, he should have been able to exercise for the reasonable safety of people whom he might have expected to be passing, as they had a right to do, over the walk to the south platform to board the car.\nThe jury\u2019s apportionment of fault (The Negligence Act, 1930, Ont., 20 Geo. V, c. 27, s. 7) must stand as the basis for the apportionment of the damages, the court not being prepared to hold that it was one which could not fairly and honestly be made in any reasonable view of the evidence. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing her appeal from the Judgment of McEvoy J., dismissing her action, which was brought for damages for personal injuries caused by her being struck by defendant\u2019s street car. The action was tried with a jury, and certain questions were submitted to and answered by them, as set out in the judgment now reported. They found negligence on the part of the defendant and negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and assigned 90% of the blame to defendant and 10% to plaintiff. They assessed the whole damage suffered by the plaintiff at $17,557.15. The trial judge, however, giving effect to a motion for non-suit on which he had reserved judgment, gave judgment dismissing the action, upon the ground that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was allowed and judgment directed to be entered for the plaintiff for $15,801.45 (nine-tenths of the damages as found by the jury), with costs throughout.[2]\nA.W. Beament for the appellant.\nR. Quoin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014The plaintiff brought this action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by her as a result of being struck by one of the defendant company\u2019s electric street cars while crossing a concrete walk traversing the company\u2019s double-tracked right of way from the north passenger platform to the south passenger platform of what is known as the company\u2019s Ottawa Civic Hospital terminal station in the township of Nepean, a suburb of the city of Ottawa, shortly before one o\u2019clock p.m. on January 29, 1931.\nOn the trial before McEvoy J. and a jury, the defendant\u2019s counsel at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case announced that he did not propose to call any witnesses and moved for a non-suit. After a lengthy argument, His Lordship decided that he ought to take the opinion of the jury on questions he proposed to submit to them on the case as it stood, and reserved judgment on the motion in the meantime. He thereupon charged the jury and gave them eight questions to answer. These questions and the jury\u2019s answers thereto are as follows:\u2014\n1. Were the plaintiff\u2019s injuries caused wholly or in part by any negligence on the part of the defendant or of its servants?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n2. If you answer question 1 \u201cyes,\u201d then state fully in what such negligence consisted?\u2014Ans. Car not under proper control. According to evidence submitted car travelled about 400 feet from time brakes were applied until it came to a full stop.\n3. Were the plaintiff\u2019s injuries caused wholly or in part by any negligence on the part of the plaintiff?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n4. If you answer question 3 \u201cyes,\u201d then state fully in what such negligence consisted?\u2014Ans. Plaintiff neglected to exercise due precaution in not taking a second look before stepping on tracks.\n5. If after he became aware, or if he had exercised care he ought to have been aware, that the plaintiff was in a position of danger; could the defendant\u2019s motorman have prevented the accident by the exercise of reasonable care?\u2014Ans. Yes.\n6. If you answer question 5 \u201cyes,\u201d then state fully what he did or omitted to do that would have prevented the accident?\u2014Ans. He should have approached at a slower rate of speed so as to be in a position to stop the car in a reasonable distance.\n7. If you answer questions 1 and 3 both \u201cyes,\u201d what proportion of the blame do you assign to,\u2014\n(a) The plaintiff?\u2014Ans. 10 per cent.\n(b) The defendant or its motorman?\u2014Ans. 90 per cent.\n8. At what amount do you assess the whole damage suffered by the plaintiff?\u2014Ans. $17,557.15.\nThe jury attached a memorandum shewing how they made up this amount. They allowed the amount of the hospital and medical bills at $2,113.15; salary eighteen months at $198 per month, $3,564; 50 per cent. regular salary for ten years, $11,880, making a total of $17,557.15.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved for judgment for the full amount of the damages as assessed by the jury. His Lordship refused this motion and endorsed on the record the following memorandum, which discloses the only reasons assigned for his judgment:\u2014\nAt the close of the argument in this case, I was not able to see any principle of law upon which I could charge the jury in a way that would enable them to find and assess damages to the plaintiff. There was a motion for non-suit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and I reserved the question of non-suit until after hearing further about the matter. I am now of opinion that there should be judgment of non-suit with costs upon the ground that there is no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. This appeal is from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal[3] affirming the dismissal of the action by the learned trial judge.\nWe think there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings upon questions 1 and 2, which, read together, undoubtedly mean that the defendant\u2019s motorman was guilty of negligence in not having the car under proper control when he approached the Civic Hospital station, and that this negligence on his part materially contributed to cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\nThe answer to question 2 not only states the fact of this negligence but it indicates the evidence which proves it, viz: that the car travelled about 400 feet from the time the motorman applied his brakes until the car came to a full stop, and this notwithstanding the fact that the car hit the plaintiff at a point about 90 feet east of the trolley pole where he sounded the gong and presumably applied the brakes, and dragged her along the track under the front guard, a distance of 300 feet. This is established conclusively by the evidence of the witness, Carson. Although there is no definite testimony that the motorman did apply his brakes, it is a fair inference from Carson\u2019s testimony that he did so immediately after sounding the gong when passing the trolley pole, which the evidence and the plan of the locus shewed was 86\u00bd feet west of the west side of the concrete walk connecting the two passenger platforms.\nThe written admission (Ex. 6), signed by the solicitors of both parties, contains the statement that the plaintiff was entitled to come upon the platform or walks at the scene of the accident for the purpose of taking a street car. The purpose of the filing of this admission is not clear, but, apart from it entirely, the evidence leaves no question that passengers waiting at this station for cars to return to the city were allowed to board cars from the south passengers\u2019 platform, when they stopped at the station, before proceeding east to turn west around the loop about 700 feet beyond the station. The witness, Robinson, a motorman in the defendant\u2019s employ, stated not only that there was such a practice, but that an order had actually been issued by the company to that effect when there was an eight or ten minute service around that end of the line, and that he presumed this was done because in the winter it got very cold in the open shelter on the north side of the tracks. There was no evidence that this order had ever been cancelled, or of any notices posted about the station forbidding passengers from boarding the cars when they stopped at the south platform.\nThe plaintiff swore that she saw three people waiting on the south platform to get on the car, two gentlemen and a lady, and that then she started to run across to get the car because she was cold. The witness, Carson, was one of them, and it was while standing on the south platform with the lady and the other gentleman waiting to board the car, that he saw it approaching the station at what he described as a fierce speed, which he estimated to be 30 miles an hour, and hit the plaintiff. He was watching the car as it approached and did not see the plaintiff until he turned his head and saw the plaintiff for the first time at almost the instant she was struck. The car was right on her, he said, before he noticed her, only two paces from the car. When the motorman sounded the gong over 80 feet west of the platform he said he saw from the speed it was going there was no chance of it stopping at the station.\nThe station and the connecting concrete walk between the two platforms, as indicated by the plan, themselves clearly shew that passengers were expected to use the walk as a passage from one platform to the other, and it is clear from the evidence of the plaintiff and Carson that the latter and the lady and other gentleman who were standing on the south platform with him had crossed over from the north platform before the plaintiff started to cross, for the purpose of boarding the car on the south side. There was no road or walk leading to this platform from the south. There were no houses to the south, only a bare open field, so that it is self-evident that the concrete walk across the company\u2019s right of way was ordinarily used only by passengers disembarking from or boarding the company\u2019s cars.\nThe local jurymen were no doubt themselves well aware of the practice which obtained regarding the taking on of passengers at this station, and the danger which might reasonably be anticipated from the running of cars at excessive speed through a station which so many employees of and visitors to such an institution as the Civic Hospital so often frequented. Moreover, the station plan and the oral evidence shew that the north platform, which is of the same length as the south platform (58 feet), and is for about half its length twice as wide, has upon it near its westerly end a roofed shelter enclosed by three walls, 6\u2019 7\u201d high, on the west, north and east sides. It is obvious that the west wall of this shelter would completely hide from the view of the motorman passengers standing behind it, any of whom might at any moment emerge from it, carelessly or otherwise, to cross the walk to the south platform.\nIn the light of all these facts which, on the defendant\u2019s motion for a non-suit, must be taken as admitted, we cannot agree with the learned trial judge that there was no evidence upon which a reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. We think there was clear evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman in approaching and passing through such a station at a speed which disabled him from exercising that degree of control over his car which, under the circumstances, he should have been able to exercise for the reasonable safety of people whom he might have expected to be passing, as they had a right to do, over the concrete walk to the south platform to board his car.\nIf he was keeping a proper look-out and exercising any thought whatever, he must have seen the three passengers standing on the south platform and known that they were there with the expectation that the car would stop to take them on, and that the plaintiff was rushing to the station for the purpose of joining them.\nIt is not a question, however, of the motorman being under a duty to stop at the south platform or under a duty to expect that any person desiring to board his car for return to Ottawa would be coming to the south platform, as is suggested in the reasons for judgment of the Appeal Court, but a question whether the motorman, having regard to all the circumstances and conditions obtaining at the time and of which he was or should have been aware, exercised due care in approaching and rushing through the station at such a rate of speed as above indicated\u2014a rate of speed which undoubtedly made it impossible for him to bring it to a stop in a distance of less than 300 feet after running the plaintiff down. This was a clear question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination and upon which, for the reasons stated, there was abundant evidence to support the finding they made. Whether this negligence of the motorman caused or materially contributed to cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries was also a clear question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination in the light of all the circumstances proved. They found in answer to question 1 that it did, and in answer to questions 3 and 4 that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff as well, which also materially contributed to cause the injuries complained of, such negligence on her part being her failure to look a second time before stepping on the tracks. We think that there was evidence to support this latter finding also.\nThis being the case, the plaintiff is clearly not entitled to rely upon the answers to questions 5 and 6 as a finding of ultimate negligence to which her injuries must solely be attributed. It is evident that the answer to question 6 indicates precisely the same negligence as the jury found in answer to question 2, viz: that at the time he saw or ought to have seen the plaintiff stepping off the north platform to cross the tracks the motorman, by reason of the excessive speed at which he was then running the car towards the station, was unable to stop it within a reasonable distance, i.e., he did not have the car under proper control. Obviously this had no reference to the motorman\u2019s failure to do any particular thing, subsequently to the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, by which he could have avoided its consequences.\nSection 7 of the Ontario Contributory Negligence Act (The Negligence Act, 1930), 20 George V, cap. 27, provides that in any action tried with a jury the degree of fault or negligence of the respective parties shall be a question of fact for the jury. The jury here assigned 10% of the blame to the plaintiff and 90% to the motorman.\nWhere damage is caused by the combined negligence of two or more persons it is by no means an easy task to accurately determine the percentage of fault which should be assigned to each. The Contributory Negligence Act, however, has expressly declared it to be the special function of the jury to do so on a jury trial. The jury in this case has made its apportionment. Unless it is one which we are clearly satisfied could not fairly or honestly be made in any reasonable view of the evidence, we would not be justified in rejecting it. For my part, I can understand how the jury may very well have concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct, in the circumstances, was much less inexcusable than the motorman\u2019s. Leaving the hospital on an apparently very cold day with a hat fitting closely over her ears and her coat collar turned up, she saw to her right as she ran across Carling Avenue, the car turning the corner at Holland Avenue, and at the same time or later, while proceeding along the concrete walk leading from the former street to the railway station, a distance of about 60 feet, observed the lady and two men on the south platform. Naturally assuming that the car would slow up and stop, she rushed across the north platform and on to the walk traversing the right of way, in order to escape the cold and board the heated car with the others at the earliest opportunity.\nWhile upon other considerations it may perhaps seem that the apportionment of fault was unduly favourable to the plaintiff, I am not prepared to hold that the apportionment was one which could not fairly and honestly be made in any reasonable view of the evidence. In this view it must stand as the basis for the apportionment of the damages between the parties under the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act.\nNo exception can be taken to the jury\u2019s assessment of damages, in view of the seriousness of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, which included a fracture of the base of the skull, the fracture of her right thigh, permanent injury to the central nervous system, and complete and permanent deafness in one ear, resulting, according to the medical testimony, in the impairment of her earning capacity as a trained nurse to the extent of at least 50 per cent.\nJudgment should, therefore, be entered for the plaintiff under the provisions of sec. 4 of the Contributory Negligence Act, for $15,801.45\u2014nine-tenths of the damages as found by the jury.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the above amount with costs of the trial and of the appeal to the Appeal Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beament & Beament.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Quain & Wilson.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 389.\n[2] Leave to appeal was refused by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, March 9, 1933.\n[3] [1932] O.R. 389.\n"}

From time to time the respondent delivered to them stocks, shares and bonds as security to finance his transactions with the appellants with whom he carried on an active trading account. In each case, before depositing the shares, the respondent endorsed the certificates in blank, and they became what is known as \"street certificates.\" The respondent, when placing orders to buy or orders to sell, received from the appellants confirmation in the form of a bought or sold note and also during the whole course of his trading, received each month a statement showing the position of his account. The respondent took no exception to the bought and sold notes or to the monthly statements, and, at the time, accepted them as correct. The securities were first transferred over from the partners to the limited company and, when it closed out, they were at the respondent's request turned over to newly employed firm of stockbrokers. Several months later, without making any previous demand upon the appellants, the respondent brought an action for damages for wrongful conversion of the securities so deposited with them. The appellants did not give evidence other than calling the secretary and a member of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, who testified as to the rules and customs of the exchange. The respondent, however, not without objection, secured the production of the appellants' books and documents. An extract of the ledger so produced showed in respective columns the name of the stock deposited by the respondent, the date of the deposit, the number of shares, the number of the certificate and its date, that it was received from the respondent, and then, under the heading \" To whom delivered,\" an indication that delivery had been made either to \" H.O.\" (head office) or to certain brokers whose names were given, together with mention of the date on which such delivery was made. The trial judge held against the appellants on the ground that the entries in the books showed that the appellants \" dealt with these securities as if they were their own property, without notice and regardless of the rights of the plaintiff.\" This judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal: Martin and McPhillips, JJ.A., agreed with the conclusions arrived at by the trial judge, although Martin, J.A., admitted the case was \"not free from doubt,\" and Macdonald, C.J., thought the respondent's evidence was \" insufficient to support the action\"; but he was of opinion that the onus was upon the appellants \" to show that, in accordance with their duty, they had properly disposed of the collateral securities.\"\nHeld (reversing the judgment appealed from) that the respondent's action ought to have been dismissed on the ground that, on the record submitted and upon the evidence, the court could not come to the conclusion that wrongful conversion had been established. Smith v. Great Western Ry [1922] A.C., 178, foll.\nSemble that the onus was upon the respondent to prove wrongful conversion.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Macdonald J.[1], and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. A. MacInnes K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellants were stock brokers and members of the Vancouver Stock Exchange. They carried on their business, at first, as partners; and later they were incorporated into a limited company. The respondent employed them as his brokers; and, between June 14, 1928, and September 14, 1929, he proceeded to place with them orders to buy and sell stock. For this purpose, he delivered certain shares as security to the appellants, with whom he carried on an active trading account. In each case, before depositing the shares, the respondent endorsed the certificates in blank, and they became what is known as \"street certificates.\"\nAs the respondent placed orders to buy or orders to sell, in every instance he got from the appellants confirmation in the form of a bought or sold note. He admits the amounts shown in these confirmations were in accordance with current market prices.\nFurther, during the whole course of his trading, he received each month a statement showing the position of his account. He took no exception to the bought and sold notes, or to the monthly statements, and, at the time, accepted them as correct. In fact, the trading went on between the parties as a continuous account. Incidentally the account was transferred over from the partners to the limited company and, in the end, when it was closed out, the shares and stocks shown in the account (on the assumption that it was correct) were, at the respondent's request, turned over to Branson & Brown, other brokers of Vancouver.\nSeveral months later, without making any previous demand upon the appellants, the respondent brought this action into court for the alleged wrongful conversion of the shares he had deposited with the brokers. Judgment was given in favour of the respondent as against the partners for the period covering the transactions with them, and as against Solloway, Mills & Co. Ltd., for the period covering the remaining transactions. The limited company is not an appellant in this court, and we are concerned only with the dealings between the respondent and the partnership, all gone through within a single month, to wit, from June 14th to July 14th, 1928.\nThe respondent did not sue for an accounting. At the trial, the issues were clearly limited to the question of wrongful conversion; and the trial judge declared all he was going to consider was that question of conversion and the ensuing damages.\nThe appellants did not give evidence. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, they moved for non-suit. When warned by the court that it would be more advisable to reserve this, if they wished to put in further evidence, they contented themselves with calling the secretary and a member of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, who testified as to the rules and customs of the Exchange.\nThe respondent, however, not without discussion and strenuous objections on the part of the appellants' counsel, succeeded in securing the production of the appellants' books and documents. He relied on these for his success. The learned trial judge held against the appellants on the ground that the entries in the books, as he thought, showed that the appellants\ndealt with these securities as if they were their own property, without notice and regardless of the rights of the plaintiff.\nIn the Court of Appeal, two of the judges, Martin and McPhillips, JJ.A., agreed with the conclusions arrived at by the trial judge, although Martin, J.A., admitted the case was \" not free from doubt.\" The Chief Justice thought the respondent's evidence was \" insufficient to support the action \"; but he was of opinion that the onus was upon the appellants\nto show that, in accordance with their duty, they had properly disposed of the collateral securities.\nM. A. Macdonald, J.A., did not write any notes.\nThe holding of the learned trial judge was entirely based on his reading and interpretation of the entries in the books. An extract from the ledger was produced. It showed in respective columns the name of the stock deposited by the respondent, the date of the deposit, the number of shares, the number of the certificate and its date, that it was received from the respondent, and then, under the heading \" To whom delivered,\" an indication that delivery had been made either to \" H.O.\" (head office) or to certain brokers whose names were given, together with mention of the date on which such delivery was made. From those entries, the learned judge gathered that the stock had been delivered as indicated on the several dates stated in the ledger and that the appellants had therefore failed to hold the stock under their control. It is in that respect, we assume, that he held the monthly statements did not agree with the account of the securities as entered in the books; and, for that reason, he came to the conclusion that\nthe disposition of the securities there shown by the (appellants) amounted to a denial of plaintiff's ownership and an assertion on their part of a right to dispose of them as they saw fit. This (he held) clearly was conversion.\nIn our view, the conclusions of the courts below are not consistent with the nature of the contract between the parties, nor with the nature of the action brought by the respondent.\nThis was an agreement for dealing in stocks on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the respondent, who gave authority to the appellants to do business for him on the Exchange, should be deemed to have contracted subject to the rules and customs of the Exchange; and the nature of the powers and the duties of the brokers would be determined by the usage and course of dealing in transactions of this character between broker and customer in Vancouver (Parke B. in Foster v. Pearson[2]; Clarke v. Baillie[3]; Cartwright v. Mac- Innes[4]; Forget v. Baxter[5]. Moreover, it is a fair inference from the evidence that the respondent was pretty familiar with the usages and customs of the stock market.\nThe meaning and effect of the evidence is that the universal practice of brokers\u2014and the prevailing practice in Vancouver\u2014is to treat \" street certificates \" as dollar bills, that is to say: as money to finance the transactions for which the client has given the securities. The physical certificate itself is immaterial; it is used indiscriminately to make deliveries or otherwise, provided the broker, at all times, has on hand or keeps under his immediate control a sufficient quantity of each stock to meet his obligations towards his customers. To borrow the expressions of Mr. Justice Day, delivering the opinion of the United States Supreme Court, in Gorman v. Littlefield[6]:\nthe certificates of stocks are not the property itself, but merely the evidence of it\u00bc a certificate for the same number of shares (represents) precisely the same kind and value of property as another certificate for a like number of shares in the same corporation; the return of a different certificate or the substitution of one certificate for another makes no material change in the property right of the customer *** such shares are unlike distinct articles of personal property, differing in kind and value, as a horse, wagon or harness, and stock has no earmark which distinguishes one share from another, but is like grain of a uniform quality in an elevator, one bushel being of the same kind and value as another.\nAssuming, as was held by the courts below, that the respondent's securities were deposited with the intent that they should be held by the appellants as collateral security for any indebtedness which the respondent might owe them in the course of their employment, the agreement should be taken to have been entered into with reference to the established practice. And, there being no express understanding to the contrary, all that the agreement meant was that a like amount of shares\u2014not the same identical certificates\u2014but a like amount of similar shares would be held by the appellants for the purpose mentioned. One of the objects of giving a blank form of transfer and of transforming the documents into \" street certificates \" must be precisely so that they may be used in the manner referred to.\nNow perhaps it should be emphasized that this was not an action for accounting. The respondent elected to sue in tort and brought an action to recover damages for the alleged wrongful conversion of the shares deposited. On that issue of wrongful conversion the burden, of course, was on the plaintiff. The proof of the entries in the appellants' ledger does not sustain the respondent's cause of action. Certainly, the mere indication, without more, that the certificates had been sent to the head office, did not prove that they had been withdrawn from the control of the appellants and that they had ceased to be held by them. Nor did the indication that the certificates had been delivered to certain brokers establish wrongful conversion. At best, these entries might have shown disposal of the particular certificates to the brokers mentioned, but it does not follow that the appellants did not retain in their possession and hold similar stock, as represented in their monthly statements, and which they could have delivered to the appellant had he demanded the same. (Rogers v. Thomson[7] .) At all events, the respondent did not prove wrongful conversion by showing mere delivery of the physical certificates\u2014an operation quite consistent with the general practice and the well understood usage. The proper inference was that such dealings were authorized by the arrangement between the parties and constituted an implied condition of their agreement. (Clarke v. Baillie[8].) The entries in the books were not per se sufficient evidence of the improper use which it was incumbent upon the respondent to establish.\nContrary to what was stated in the Court of Appeal, we would not think the onus was upon the appellants to show that they had properly disposed of the securities. The respondent had undertaken to establish wrongful conversion. He was bound to prove it. It was no part of the appellants' case to help the respondent in the task he had set out for himself. There are dicta to that effect by Finch J. delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York in Rogers v. Thomson [9]and by Lord Buckmaster in Smith v. Great Western Ry. Co.[10], which would indicate a view contrary to that expressed in the British Columbia Court of Appeal. But, in the present case, it is quite unnecessary to decide the particular question of onus, for the statement made in the Court of Appeal totally disregards the orders to sell which the respondent had to admit in cross-examination. He admitted that, immediately after the orders were given, he got confirmation of the sales, and, in each case, the transactions as shown in the \"sold notes\" agreed with the current market prices. These orders gave complete authority to the appellants and afforded full explanation of the disposal of the shares deposited. The respondent received the \"sold notes\" without taking exception to them. More than that, he acquiesced in them and he acted upon them. He gave orders to buy on the basis of the credits standing in his name in the appellants' books as a result of the sales made pursuant to his orders to sell. He went on, in that way, for a year and a half, receiving confirmations and monthly statements and, in the end, when he closed his account,\nhe admits (as pointed out by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal) that according to the monthly statements rendered to him if they were bona fide, that is to say that if the purchases and sales were actually made as therein stated by defendants, everything which he was entitled to from them was transferred to Branson & Brown.\nall of which goes to show that, when the respondent ordered the sale of the shares deposited, they must have been available, for the proper inference is that the sale was carried out. The proceeds were undoubtedly placed to the credit of the respondent; and, in the end, when he asked for delivery to Branson & Brown of the stock remaining in his name, his demand was complied with.\nOf course, throughout his testimony, the respondent, although admitting these facts and circumstances, keeps on repeating that \"he does not believe them now.\" But that is hardly sufficient to establish his case. We fail to understand how, having received and still retaining the proceeds of the sales, the respondent can be heard to question the reality of those sales.\nThe respondent did intimate a charge of \"bucketting,\" but there is an absolute lack of evidence to substantiate the charge. He suggested the entries or the accounts or the statements were fictitious, but he did not even attempt to prove it. His testimony is built upon suppositions and suspicions and, of course, that comes far short of showing wrongful conversion, which it was the respondent's duty to establish, if he wished to be successful.\nWe are of opinion that the action ought to have been dismissed on the short ground that, on the record submitted, and upon the evidence, the court could not come to the conclusion that wrongful conversion had been established (Smith v. Great Western Ry[11].\nThere remains one point to mention. As already stated, the respondent brought his action both against the partnership and against the company. The defendants joined in their written statement of defence. After having specifically denied each and every allegation of fact contained in the statement of claim, in the alternative, whilst denying liability, they brought into court the sum of $175, saying that, at all events, that sum was enough to satisfy the plaintiff's claim for damages, because, at most, the plaintiff would be entitled only to nominal damages. It follows that the deposit was made on behalf of both defendants. In the result, the respondent fails in his action against the partners, but succeeds against the company.\nUnder the circumstances and upon the record submitted, we are not in a position to make any order in respect of the deposit. The point was not discussed at bar. We trust that the parties will be able to agree between themselves as to its final disposition. Should they be unable to do so, the matter may be spoken to.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fleishman & MacLean.\n[1] (1931) 45 B.C.R. 66\n[2] (1835) I C.M. & R. 849, at 859.\n[3] (1911) 45 Can.

SMITH (Defendant) Respondent.\n1932: October 18, 19; 1933: February 7.\nPresent: Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nContract\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Contract for sale of potatoes to be delivered in carload instalments\u2014Rejection by purchaser of carloads shipped, as being of inferior quality\u2014Question whether these carloads were shipped on account of the contract\u2014Question whether rejection amounted to repudiation of the whole contract\u2014Jury\u2019s findings\u2014Sale of Goods Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 149, s. 28 (2).\nBy contract dated September 3, 1927, respondent agreed to sell and appellant to buy 20 carloads of white potatoes, Cobblers or Green Mountains, Canada Grade A, at 90 cents per 90 pounds, bulk, delivered at rate of 5 cars per week, payment to be made in cash against documents. All cars were to be Government inspected and certificate of grading was to accompany the draft for each car as shipped. The contract did not specify time of shipment, but no Government certificate as to grade could be obtained before October 1 (Root Vegetables Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 181, s. 19). On September 17 the broker who had arranged the contract wired respondent: \u201cThompson and Alix (appellant) would like you ship one car this coming Monday against their contract can you do so if not kindly wire immediately present price and conditions,\u201d to which respondent replied: \u201cWill ship one car Thompson and Alix 90 per bag bulk to-morrow or Tuesday best can do.\u201d A car was shipped on September 21 and was followed by another. Appellant refused to accept and pay for these, claiming they were of inferior quality, whereupon respondent refused to make further shipments. Appellant sued for damages. The jury found that the two cars were shipped under the contract, that the potatoes therein were grade A, that respondent did not commit a breach of the contract, that respondent, by appellant\u2019s statements and conduct, was justified in repudiating the contract and relieved from making further delivery under it; but the trial judge held that, on interpretation of the documents, the two cars were not shipped under the contract, and, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s findings, ordered judgment for appellant. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division (4 M.P.R. 245), set aside the judgment and ordered a new trial. Appellant appealed, and respondent cross-appealed, to this Court, each asking for judgment in its or his favour and (there having been already two trials) for a final decision that would avoid further trials.\nHeld (Lamont J. dissenting): Appellant had not repudiated the contract, and was entitled to damages for non-delivery by respondent.\nPer Smith, J.: Assuming the first car of potatoes was shipped on account of the contract (requirement of certificate of grading being waived as to it), and was of the required quality, appellant\u2019s rejection of it (though making him liable for breach in respect of that car) was not, and there was no evidence on which the jury could find that it was, a refusal to carry out the contract. The second car was never ordered, had not the necessary certificate, and appellant was not bound to accept it, and there was no evidence justifying the jury\u2019s finding in reference to it.\nPer Cannon and Crocket JJ.: Assuming the two cars were shipped on account of the contract (Cannon J. was clearly of opinion they were not; Crocket J. thought there might be justification for a finding that the first was, but none for a finding that the second was), and was of the required quality, appellant\u2019s rejection of them was merely a \u201cseverable breach giving rise to a claim for damages,\u201d and was not, and a jury could not, on the evidence, reasonably find that it was, a repudiation of the contract.\nPer Lamont J. (dissenting): The jury was justified on the evidence in finding that the two cars were shipped on account of the contract and were of the required quality, and, in view of the contract, letters and other evidence, it was open to them to find that appellant\u2019s refusal to accept and pay for them evidenced an intention to repudiate the whole contract unless respondent would ship Green Mountains (instead of Cobblers as shipped) which the contract did not require him to do.\nThe Sale of Goods Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 149, s. 28 (2); Freeth v. Burr, L.R. 9 C.P. 208, at 213, and other cases referred to.\nAs to the Court finally determining on this appeal the issue between the parties, Cannon J. referred to Order 58, Rule 4, and Order 40, Rule 10, of the New Brunswick Rules of Court, and to Skeate v. Slaters, 83 L.J.K.B. 676, at 680-681, 686, and Banbury v. Bank of Montreal, [1918] A.C. 626.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1].\nBy a contract in writing dated September 3, 1927, the defendant agreed to sell and the plaintiff to buy 20 carloads of white potatoes, Cobblers or Green Mountains, Canada Grade A, at 90 cents per 90 pounds, bulk, delivered at Sherbrooke, Quebec, at the rate of five cars per week, payment to be made in cash against documents. All cars were to be Government inspected and certificate of grading was to accompany the draft for each car as shipped. The contract was arranged by a broker in Sherbrooke. No date was specified in the contract as to the time of shipment, but no Government certificate as to grade could be obtained before October 1 (Root Vegetables Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 181, s. 19). On September 17, the broker wired defendant:\nThompson and Alix [the plaintiff] would like you ship one car this coming Monday against their contract can you do so if not kindly wire immediately present price and conditions.\nto which defendant replied:\nWill ship one car Thompson and Alix ninety per bag bulk to-morrow or Tuesday best can do.\nA car of potatoes was shipped on September 21, and was followed by another. The plaintiff refused to accept and pay for these cars, claiming that they were of inferior quality; whereupon the defendant refused to make any further shipments.\nThere was considerable correspondence other than the above, much of which is set out in the judgments now reported.\nThe plaintiff brought action for damages, claiming the sum of $3,290, as being the difference between the contract price and the price paid by the plaintiff in the open market at the time of the alleged breach by defendant.\nThe action was tried twice, each time before Le Blanc J., with a jury. On the first trial, the jury gave a general verdict for the defendant and judgment was entered in his favour. The Appeal Division set aside that verdict and judgment and ordered a new trial[2]. On the second trial the jury answered the questions submitted to them in favour of the defendant, finding (inter alia) that the two cars sent were shipped under the contract, that the potatoes therein were grade A, that defendant did not commit a breach of the contract, and that defendant, by the statements and conduct of the plaintiff, was justified in repudiating the contract and relieved from making any further delivery under it. But the trial judge held that, on interpretation of the documents, the two cars were not shipped under the contract, and, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s findings, ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $3,290. The Appeal Division set aside this judgment and ordered a new trial[3].\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, asking that the judgment of the Appeal Division be set aside and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The defendant cross-appealed, asking that, in so far as the judgment of the Appeal Division ordered a new trial, it be varied and that judgment be entered for the defendant. Both parties asked that this Court, if possible, put an end to the litigation and render a final judgment.\nP. J. Hughes, K.C., and W. J. West for the appellant.\nW. P. Jones, K.C., and G. McDade for the respondent.\nRinfret, J.\u2014There have already been two trials in this case. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick has again ordered a new trial[4]. The parties have requested us, if possible, to put an end to the litigation and to render a final judgment.\nI agree with my brothers Cannon and Crocket that there was no repudiation of the contract by the appellant and that the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed with costs throughout, judgment being entered in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $3,290, the amount of damages assessed by the jury.\nSmith, J.\u2014I agree with my brothers Cannon and Crocket that there was no repudiation by the appellant of the contract.\nThe first car of potatoes shipped was not government inspected and had no certificate of grading, as required by the terms of the contract; but appellant, by his telegram asking for the shipment of this car, waived the requirement as to that particular car because of his knowledge that there could be no such inspection at that time. The appellant was entitled to reject this car if the contents were not in compliance with the terms of the contract. The jury, however, has found that the contents were in fact in compliance with the terms of the contract, and that appellant was not entitled to reject it. Appellant, therefore, remained accountable to the respondent for that car of potatoes at the contract price, or for the loss sustained by its rejection; but that is the full extent of its liability for its refusal to accept that particular car, whether shipped as part fulfilment of the contract or on an independent contract resulting from the telegram. It was not a refusal to carry out the contract, and there was no evidence before the jury on which they could come to any such conclusion. The second car was never ordered, had not the necessary certificate of inspection, and appellant was not bound to accept it; and there is no evidence justifying the finding of the jury in reference to it.\nThe jury has assessed the damages for respondent\u2019s breach of contract at $3,290. I therefore agree that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, with costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Appeal Division to the appellant.\nCannon, J.\u2014The plaintiff\u2019s claim is for damages for non-delivery of potatoes, under a contract dated the 3rd September, 1927, for twenty minimum carloads of white potatoes, Cobblers or Green Mountains, Canada Grade A, at the price of ninety cents per ninety pounds, and ten cents per bag extra, to be delivered at the city of Sherbrooke, in the province of Quebec, or some other point with equal freight, the same to be shipped at the rate of five carloads per week, mostly over the Canadian National Railways. All potatoes were to be Government inspected, and the certificate of the grading was to accompany the draft of defendant and bill of lading for each car shipped. The potatoes were to be paid for by the plaintiff with cash against documents of title and bills of lading. According to the plaintiff, the defendant refused to deliver and compelled the plaintiff to purchase in the open market at an advanced price, whereby the plaintiff suffered damages for $3,290.\nThe defendant pleads in substance that he had the right to fulfil his contract with the plaintiff by shipping Cobbler potatoes or Green Mountain potatoes, or both, at his option, of a certain quality and description; and that defendant, at the request of plaintiff, did ship a portion of said potatoes, being Cobbler potatoes conforming to such quality and description; whereupon the plaintiff refused to accept and pay for such portion so shipped by the defendant, who was entitled to treat the said contract as having been repudiated by the plaintiff. The defendant also pleaded a custom, ancient, general, uniform, certain, notorious and universally recognized and acted upon in the potato trade, that when a carload of potatoes, being a perishable product, is shipped from one province to another province in Canada, as one instalment under a contract providing for the shipment of several instalments, where each instalment is to be paid for separately, and if such carload answers the requirements of the contract, the buyer must take delivery of the carload; and if in doubt as to whether or not the potatoes in such carload answer the requirements of the contract, the buyer must unload the potatoes; and if the buyer does not unload the carload and take delivery of the same, subject to claims, the seller is justified in regarding the whole contract as having been repudiated by the buyer; and the seller may, under such circumstances, refuse to ship the other instalments.\nI may say immediately that there is no evidence of such general and uniform custom. I have quoted this paragraph to show that defendant himself considered that this contract provided for shipment of several instalments where each instalment had to be paid for separately.\nThe case was tried twice before Leblanc, J., with a jury; and the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick has twice ordered a new trial. Both parties come before us requesting that judgment should be rendered on the merits of the case and are both dissatisfied with the order for a third trial. The trial judge, after the second trial, ordered a verdict to be entered in favour of plaintiff, although the jury\u2019s answers to the questions put to them by the trial judge were mostly favourable to the defendant. The Court of Appeal, in its second judgment[5], disapproved of the course followed by the trial judge; but instead of rendering judgment for the plaintiff or for the defendant, as they had the power to do, notwithstanding the verdict of the jury, ordered a new trial.\nWe stand in the position of the Court of Appeal and have power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, under Rule 4 of Order LVIII of the Rules of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which have been numbered to conform, as far as possible, to the English Judicature Rules of 1883.\nIt should be noticed that, under Rule 10 of Order XL, upon a motion for judgment, or upon an application for a new trial, the Court may draw all inferences of fact not inconsistent with the findings of the jury; and, if satisfied that it has before it all the materials necessary for finally determining the questions in dispute or any of them, give judgment accordingly.\nThese two rules have been discussed by the Court of Appeal in England, in the case of Skeate v. Slaters[6], where Lord Reading said:\nThere (under Order XL, Rule 10) the power to draw inferences of fact is limited, when there is a verdict of a jury, to such inferences as are not inconsistent with the finding of the jury. The application before us is not for a new trial, but is an appeal from the decision of the Judge. It is, however, important to consider whether the powers of this Court on appeal from a trial by a jury are limited to those formerly exercised by the King\u2019s Bench Division under Order XL, rule 10. Millar v. Toulmin[7] decided that under Order LVIII, rule 4, greater powers are given to the Court of Appeal than were conferred under Order XL, rule 10, and, in the words of Lord Esher, included \u201cthe power, if all the necessary materials are before the Court, of giving that judgment which in the opinion of the Court ought to be the judgment between the parties, even though such judgment be inconsistent with the findings of the jury.\u201d In that case the Court of Appeal entered judgment for the plaintiff, which was deciding affirmatively the rights of the plaintiff without the assistance of the jury, and left the question (if any) as to the amount to be decided by the Master. Lord Halsbury in the same case in the House of Lords criticised the exercise of this power. The other Lords expressed no opinion upon this point, and the House of Lords did not reverse the judgment upon that ground. In Allcock v. Hall[8], the Court of Appeal again considered the question with the assistance of the observations of Lord Halsbury, and came to the conclusion that they had such powers and exercised them by entering judgment for the defendants. Be it observed that Lord Justice Lindley added that the Lord Justices deciding that case had consulted their colleagues in the other branch of the Court, who had carefully considered the point and agreed with the decision. Lord Loreburn in Paquin, Ltd. v. Beauclerk[9], referring to these two cases, said: \u201cObviously the Court of Appeal is not at liberty to usurp the province of a jury; yet, if the evidence be such that only one conclusion can properly be drawn, I agree that the Court may enter judgment. The distinction between cases where there is no evidence and those where there is some evidence, though not enough properly to be acted upon by a jury, is a fine distinction, and the power is not unattended by danger. But if cautiously exercised it cannot fail to be of value.\u201d\nThe authority of Allcock v. Hall[10] was approved by Lord Loreburn there and is clearly binding upon us; and I am of opinion that this Court, if satisfied that it has all the necessary materials before it, and that no evidence could be given at a re-trial which would in this Court support a verdict for the plaintiff, ought to enter judgment for the defendants. And, in the same case, Lord Phillimore, L.J., said at page 686:\nThe result, I think, is that the cases lay down that when the Court to which the motion for new trial is made sees that the verdict was wrong, and sees also that upon the admitted facts, or the only possible evidence that could be given, the verdict should be the other way, and has all the materials before it, it may conclude the case, dispense with another trial by a jury, which will either result in a verdict for the applicant or be itself set aside and so toiies quoties, and at once give judgment.\nI would also refer to Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[11].\nI believe, in view of the request of both parties, who have, after two trials, adduced all the evidence that they could possibly place before the court, that we should finally determine the issue and put an end to this litigation.\nThe plaintiff carries on business in Sherbrooke, in the province of Quebec, and purchased from the defendant, carrying on business in East Florenceville, in New Brunswick, the potatoes described in their contract for October shipment through Dastous & Company Registered, who were acting as brokers for both parties. After the signing of the contract, 3rd September, 1927, the defendant, on the 8th of the same month, wrote that the only assurance they could give was that they would have potatoes inspected as loaded and each car would carry a certificate of Canada Grade A. Now, it is common ground that no such certificate could be obtained under section 19 of the Root Vegetables Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 181, for new potatoes shipped between the 1st day of June and the 30th day of September, both dates included. It would, therefore, appear clear, to my mind, that the jury could not reasonably find that the two cars shipped in September were shipped under the contract. The telegrams covering the first car satisfy me that they referred to a separate sale independent of the contract. They read as follows:\nSherbrooke, Que., Sept. 17th\/27.\nB. F. Smith,\nEast Florenceville, N.B.\nThompson and Alix would like you ship one car this coming Monday against their contract can you do so if not kindly wire immediately present price and conditions.\nDastous and Co. Regd. Defendant answered as follows:\nEast Florenceville, N.B., Sept. 18.\nDastous & Co. Regd.\nSherbrooke, Que.\nWill ship one car Thompson and Alix ninety per bag bulk to-morrow or Tuesday best can do.\nB. F. Smith.\nAlthough plaintiff, perhaps in ignorance of the impossibility of securing a certificate before the 1st October, asked, on the 17th September, to ship one car against their contract, it is evident that Smith knew that he could not do so and accordingly wired that he would ship one car giving the price and the date. He also shipped on the 23rd of September a car that had never been ordered. Whether or not the potatoes shipped in September were equal in quality to potatoes that might, in October, have been graded by the Government Inspector as Canada One does not, to my mind, affect the issue between the parties. Even assuming, as found by the jury, that these two cars were shipped under the contract and that the plaintiff should have accepted delivery thereof, this does not in law help the defendant in any way to establish his plea of complete repudiation or rescission by the plaintiff of this contract by instalments.\nParagraph 2 of sec. 28 of ch. 149 of the Revised Statutes of New Brunswick, 1927, respecting the sale of goods, reads as follows:\n(2) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments, which are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or whether it is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation, but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.\nI quite agree with the views of Mr. Justice White, in the first judgment of the Court of Appeal[12], where he says:\nNo one, I think, could reasonably infer that the plaintiff would not accept delivery of potatoes under the contract when the same were certified as Grade \u201cA\u201d by the inspector, merely because the plaintiff had refused to accept the potatoes in the car sent, where the question as to whether the potatoes were, or were not, equal in quality to Grade \u201cA,\u201d was one the answer to which must depend upon the opinions of those who had examined the potatoes. The contract provided that each separate shipment was to be paid for in cash.\nWhen defendant, on September 23rd, learned by wire (Exhibit \u201cT\u201d) that plaintiff refused to accept the first car sent and thought that possibly it had been shipped in mistake, he did not inform the plaintiff that the car was shipped against the contract, and that unless the plaintiff accepted it he would treat the contract as repudiated. It was not until September 30th that the plaintiff learned from defendant\u2019s wire (I.2) that he did not propose shipping plaintiff any potatoes. Assuming that the potatoes shipped in the first car were equal in quality to Grade \u201cA,\u201d then from the facts in evidence I myself, sitting as a jury, would have had no hesitation in finding that the breach occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept the potatoes was, in the words of the Sale of Goods Act, \u201ca severable breach giving rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.\u201d\nBut the question is not one of law merely but one of mixed fact and law, and therefore to be determined by the jury under the instructions of the Court as to the law. At the same time, I think, that under the evidence in this case, no jury properly instructed as to the law, could reasonably find that the breach was other than a severable one entitling the defendant to damages but not entitling the defendant to repudiate the whole contract.\nReference was made by defendant to the letter of the 26th September wherein the brokers stated that plaintiff would not accept the car as the buyers in Sherbrooke will not use any more of these potatoes (Cobblers). The defendant claims that this is a repudiation of the contract.\nIt is clear, as pointed out by White, J., that this statement referred to the potatoes shipped in the second carload, which were not shipped under the contract at all; and refusal to accept the same would not imply a repudiation of the contract.\nIn Freeth v. Burr[13], Coleridge, C.J., said:\nIn cases of this sort, where the question is whether the one party is set free by the action of the other, the real matter for consideration is whether the acts or conduct of the one do or do not amount to an intimation of an intention to abandon and altogether to refuse performance of the contract. I say this in order to explain the ground upon which I think the decisions in these cases must rest * * * I think it may be taken that the fair result of them is as I have stated * * * Now, nonpayment on the one hand, or non-delivery on the other, may amount to such an act, or may be evidence for a jury of an intention wholly to abandon the contract and set the other party free.\nThe principle thus stated by Lord Coleridge was accepted and approved in The Mersey Steel & Iron Company v. Naylor, Benzon & Co.[14]. Mr. Benjamin, speaking of this latter case, says:\nAll their Lordships as well as the Lords Justices accepted the principle stated by Lord Coleridge in Freeth v. Burr[15] as the true test; or, as it was expressed in the words of Lord Selborne: \u201cYou must look at the actual circumstances of the case in order to see whether the one party to the contract is relieved from its future performance by the conduct of the other. You must examine what that conduct is, so as to see whether it amounts to a renunciation, to an absolute refusal to perform the contract, such as would amount to a rescission if he had the power to rescind, and whether the other party may accept it as a reason for not performing his part.\u201d\nThe terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case clearly show, without evidence to the contrary, that plaintiff never had the slightest intention of repudiating or rescinding the contract. On September 28, Dastous & Co. wrote to defendant as follows:\nP.S. With regard to shipments against contract for Messrs. Thompson & Alix which are to commence the 1st of October, will you kindly note to ship the first car to them at Sherbrooke and the second two cars to be billed to Magog notify them at Sherbrooke and you will of course make all drafts with bill of lading attached on Messrs. Thompson & Alix at Sherbrooke.\nTo which defendant, on September 30, answered as follows:\nWe do not propose shipping Thompson Alix any potatoes.\n(Signed) B. F. Smith.\nOn the same day, Dastous answered as follows:\nSherbrooke, Que., Sept. 30, 1927.\nB. F. Smith,\nEast Florenceville, N.B.\nYour wire received upon communicating contents to Thompson and Alix they require and insist that you fill contract they have with you they have number cars sold for early October delivery therefore request that you make first shipments as specified our letter twenty-eighth instant and previous wire to-day.\nDastous and Co. Regt.\nSherbrooke, Que., 30th Sept. 1927.\nCanada.\nB. F. Smith, Esq.,\nEast Florenceville, N.B.\nDear Sir,\nWe confirm our wires to-day as per copies attached and specially with reference to your wire in which you state as follows\u2014\u201dWe do not propose shipping Thompson Alix any potatoes,\u201d to which we have wired you as per copy attached advising you that upon communicating contents of your wire to Messrs. Thompson they require and insist that you fill the contract as per our contract form duly signed by them which has been forwarded you.\nMessrs. Thompson & Alix of course presume that your attitude is taken largely on account of the two cars which have arrived at Sherbrooke from you and which they have not accepted. In the first place, only one of these cars was ordered for them as there has evidently been some oversight on the part of your office in billing two cars to Sherbrooke when only one was ordered.\nWith regard to Messrs. Thompson and Alix not accepting either of these cars we would just like to mention that we have been doing business with these friends for a number of years and they are as straight a firm as can be found and certainly would not turn down any shipments unless they had mighty good reason for doing so and they wanted the potatoes very badly too as they had orders awaiting to be filled but after examining these cars and finding so much rot in them the writer personally went with Mr. Thompson and examined second car and in casually picking up at least a dozen of the large size potatoes and even some not as large, when they were cut there were at least ten or eleven which were all rotted in the centre so they said they could not handle these potatoes as they had had a great deal of trouble with the previous shipments already.\nUnder these circumstances we do not see how this has any thing to do with the contract, especially as the contract calls for Grade A Stock and it was understood that these would be government inspected and the Inspector\u2019s certificate would be attached to your draft on the Buyers.\nWe therefore trust that we may hear from you promptly that you are making shipments as we have already specified against contract for Messrs. Thompson & Alix, otherwise they will take immediate action to protect themselves in the matter, especially as we mentioned in our wire they have a number of cars sold for early October delivery.\nWe also mentioned in our wire that we had sent on the bill of lading for the second car which was mailed from here on the 28th by registered mail so that same should have reached you before now. We did all we possibly could to try and get this car sent on, on a diversion order but it was impossible to make this arrangement.\nWe now await your further word and prompt reply also quotation on the five cars we have already mentioned for October shipment.\nYours very truly,\nDastous & Co. Reg.\nPer G. W. Stevenson.\nThen again, on October 3, 1927:\nB. F. Smith,\nEast Florenceville, N.B.\nReferring our letter twenty-ninth ultimo Please wire if car for Veilleux has been shipped if not will you be sure get it away to-morrow Thompson and Alix request immediate reply our wire and letter thirtieth ultimo you have not replied our request for quotations five cars October shipment.\nDastous and Co. Reg. and next day:\nOct. 4-1927\nB. F. Smith\nEast Florenceville NB\nThompson and Alix requests immediate wire advice as to whether or not you have shipped cars against their contract as per instructions contained in our letter twenty eight ultimo will you therefore kindly wire us immediately advising.\nDastous and Co. Reg.\nThese two telegrams were confirmed by letter. Smith, the defendant, on October 5, notwithstanding this request, wired as follows:\nDastous & Co. Regd.\nSherbrooke, Que.\nSee my telegram thirtieth decision final.\nB. F. Smith.\nOn October 6, through their solicitors, the plaintiffs notified the defendant that they were proceeding to purchase potatoes in the open market to supply their demand and would hold him responsible for all damages that they might suffer by reason of the breach of contract.\nI therefore reach the conclusion that with the material before us, and even admitting that there might be sufficient evidence to support the finding of the jury that the first and second carloads of potatoes had been shipped under the contract and equalled Grade A potatoes and should have been accepted by the plaintiff, this would not be sufficient in law to support defendant\u2019s contention, which he had to establish, that the whole contract had been repudiated. Nowhere in the record is found an absolute refusal by plaintiff to perform the contract such as would amount to a rescission, according to the test adopted by Lord Selborne in Mersey Steel & Iron Co. case above quoted. The onus has not been and could not be legally satisfied under the contract and the circumstances of the case, while the plaintiff has proven clearly: 1. the existence of the contract; 2. the breach of the contract; and 3. the quantum of damages.\nNo car was ever shipped with the required certificate. This certificate could be secured only in October and on the 30th September the defendant took upon himself to repudiate his obligation. I am not prepared to say that there was no evidence to go to the jury. But I am perfectly satisfied that the findings of the jury as to the two cars shipped (questions 2-3-4-5), as to the breach of the contract (question 6), as to the alleged custom (questions 7-8-9-10), as to part of question 11 that the contract was broken by plaintiff, as to justification and the absence of damages (questions 12-13), were either against the evidence or against the weight of evidence, and were such as no jury could reasonably find. We therefore remain with the written agreement, whose existence is affirmed by the jury in their first answer, and the damages which the jury assessed at $3,290, after the judge\u2019s special request. The defendant, having failed to establish that he was legally justified in repudiating the whole contract as he did, must suffer the consequences of his conduct and reimburse to the plaintiff the difference between the amount paid for the twenty carloads which they purchased and the price they would have paid to the defendant under the contract for the same potatoes.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal and restore the order of the trial judge that judgment be entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant for $3,290, with costs throughout.\nCrocket, J.\u2014The whole substance of the defence to this action lies in the alleged repudiation of the contract of sale by the plaintiffs before the defendant\u2019s admitted refusal to deliver the twenty carloads of potatoes contracted for. The decisive question, therefore, on this appeal is as to whether there was any evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find that the plaintiffs did in fact repudiate the contract and thereby relieve the defendant from his obligation thereunder.\nWhether the car which the defendant shipped to the plaintiffs after receiving their telegram of September 17 constituted a delivery under the contract, as the jury found in answer to question 2, or was an independent shipment outside the contract, is open to serious question, as the cogent reasoning of my brother Lamont in this regard so clearly demonstrates. It is apparent from the learned trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on that point that the words \u201cunder the contract\u201d as used in the question merely meant against or on account of the contract, and had no reference to its being shipped in compliance with all its terms. The jury could have understood nothing else. The question involved not only the interpretation of the defendant\u2019s reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 telegram of September 17, which, if it was in any way ambiguous, was a question for the court, but the consideration as well of the conduct of both parties in connection with the plaintiffs\u2019 rejection of the shipment, which was a question for the jury. If the decision of the appeal depended on the validity of the jury\u2019s answer to this question, I am not at all sure, upon a consideration of the terms of the two telegrams, and the conduct of the parties regarding the rejection and disposition of the shipment, that this finding could not be fully justified.\nBe that as it may, the shipment by the defendant of one of the twenty carloads of potatoes and its refusal by the plaintiffs after their own inspection as being of unsatisfactory quality, falls far short, in the circumstances of this case, of satisfying the onus which lay on the defendant to prove a repudiation of the whole contract by the plaintiffs or an intimation to the defendant of their intention to abandon it entirely. Assuming that the first car was shipped against the contract and the second car as well\u2014though there is, to my mind, no justification whatever for the finding that the second car was so shipped\u2014the question as to whether the rejection of one or both these cars amounted to a repudiation of the whole contract or was a severable breach giving rise to a claim for damages, is one, which, under the provisions of subsec. 2 of sec. 28 of the New Brunswick Sale of Goods Act, depends on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, as pointed out by my brother Cannon.\nAlthough no time for delivery was mentioned in the contract itself, it is perfectly clear from the correspondence between the parties and from the fact that the contract provided for government inspection and that the defendant\u2019s draft for each car as shipped should be accompanied by an official government certificate of grading, which was not possible under the terms of sec. 19 of the Root Vegetables Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 181, before October 1, that the intention of the parties was that shipments under the contract should not begin before that date. Both parties must be taken to have known that no cars inspected and certified in accordance with the terms of the contract could be refused by the plaintiffs as of unsatisfactory quality upon their own inspection, as in the case of the two cars referred to. No question could arise between them as to quality, once a car was shipped, officially inspected and certified as the contract required. How the rejection of two cars shipped in the month of September, uninspected and uncertified, before the time for the performance of the contract had arrived, could be treated by the defendant as an absolute refusal on the part of the plaintiffs to accept and pay for inspected and certified cars, in accordance with the terms of the contract, or as an intimation of an intention on their part to wholly abandon the contract, I find it difficult to understand, when the terms of the contract itself and the circumstances of the case are considered.\nI can find nothing in the letters or telegrams of the plaintiffs\u2019 brokers (Dastous & Co.) to the defendant between September 23, when they advised him by wire of the rejection of the first car, and October 1, which could fairly or reasonably be taken to indicate any intention on the part of the plaintiffs of renouncing the contract. Having received an invoice for the second car after their telegram advising rejection of the first, they at once, in confirming this telegram, called the defendant\u2019s attention to what they assumed to be an error in billing two cars to them as \u201cthere was only one ordered and possibly the one which has already arrived was not intended for Sherbrooke at all\u201d. The defendant having wired them the following day that if the plaintiffs refused the first car, he would release to them and have them forward it to Montreal, they telegraphed that plaintiffs would not accept the first car but that they would accept the second if quality was satisfactory. On September 26 they wired the defendant again, advising him that they had diverted the first car to Montreal as instructed by him and that the second car had arrived and the plaintiffs would not accept as 90% of the large potatoes cut rotten inside, and requesting wired instructions, to which the defendant simply replied on September 27 that he was releasing second car to them and requesting them to forward this to Toronto. On the same date they telegraphed him asking if he could offer a car of good sound potatoes for immediate shipment and to wire price and what kind. To this defendant replied: \u201cMy experience Sherbrooke cannot book further orders\u201d.\nIt is true that in a letter dated September 26, confirming their wire regarding the diversion of the first car and the plaintiffs\u2019 refusal of the second, Dastous & Co. stated: \u201cThey (plaintiffs) will not accept the car as they state the buyers here will not use any more of these potatoes \u201c, and added a statement of their own that \u201cthere have been several cars of these Cobblers come into Sherbrooke and they have been distributed around pretty well and no body wants any more of them\u201d. Also that in a letter, dated September 27, referring to their telegraphic request of that date for an offer for a car of good sound potatoes, they spoke of the Cobblers which had come in to the Sherbrooke market having caused a lot of trouble, and stated that they hardly thought the retail trade there would take any more of them unless they were sure that there would be no more potatoes with rot in the centre. There is, too, another letter, dated September 28, referring to the diversion of the second car to Toronto, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, which contains the following paragraph and postscript:\nTrusting the above is satisfactory- and regretting the trouble there has been over these cars but Messrs. Thompson & Alix needed the potatoes very badly and would gladly have taken them if it was not for the trouble they have had on the previous cars which were rotted the same way and which the Trade here will not accept any further lots of the same stock.\nP.S. With regard to shipments against contract for Messrs. Thompson & Alix which are to commence the 1st of October, will you kindly note to ship the first car to them at Sherbrooks and the second two cars to be billed to Magog notify them at Sherbrooks and you will of course make all drafts with bill of lading attached on Messrs. Thompson & Alix at Sherbrooke.\nThis was followed by the following telegram of September 30, Dastous to defendant:\nWith reference two cars ordered to Magog for Thompson as per our letter twenty-eighth instant please be sure ship these in bags all others unless specially instructed to be shipped bulk try ship two Magog cars same day early as possible next week mailed blading second released car Thompson twenty eighth wire lowest price five cars Grade A October shipment.\nto which defendant replied on the same day:\nWe do not propose shipping Thompson Alix any potatoes. Several further telegrams and letters from Dastous & Co. insisting upon the defendant delivering the potatoes under the contract brought no response from the defendant until October 5, when he telegraphed:\nSee my telegram thirtieth decision final.\nFar from indicating an intention on the part of the plaintiffs to abandon the contract these letters and telegrams, I think, point quite the other way, and afford no ground whatever for the jury\u2019s finding on question 13, that the defendant was justified by the statements and conduct of the plaintiffs in repudiating the entire contract before the time for its performance had arrived and relieved from making any further delivery thereunder.\nThe contract and the breach by the defendant having been conclusively proved, judgment should, therefore, be entered in favour of the plaintiffs for $3,290\u2014the amount assessed by the jury as the difference between the contract price of the twenty carloads contracted for and the amount paid by them for the potatoes which they were required to purchase to replace them.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be allowed and the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal dismissed with costs and judgment entered in favour of the plaintiffs for the amount above stated with costs of the action and of the appeal to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nLamont, J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[16] directing a new trial. The facts are very simple: By a contract in writing, dated September 3, 1927, the respondent agreed to sell and the appellant to buy twenty car loads of white potatoes, Cobblers or Green Mountains, Canada Grade A, at 90 cents for ninety pounds, delivered at Sherbrooke, Quebec, at the rate of five cars per week. Payment was to be made in cash against shipping documents. All cars were to be Government inspected and a certificate of grading was to accompany the draft for each car as shipped. The contract was arranged by one G. W. Stevenson, a broker in Sherbrooke, who was trading under the name of Dastous & Co., Reg\u2019d. No date was specified in the contract as to the time of shipment, but, as, under the Root Vegetables Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 181, Government certificates as to grade could not be obtained for new potatoes shipped between the 1st day of June and the 30th day of September, the parties may have expected the shipments to be made not earlier than October. Be that as it may, on September 17, 1927, Stevenson, acting for the appellant, wired the respondent as follows:\nThompson and Alix would like you ship one car this coming Monday against their contract can you do so if not kindly wire immediately present price and conditions.\nTo this the respondent on the following day replied:\nDastous & Co. Regd.\nSherbrooke, Que.\nWill ship one car Thompson and Alix ninety per bag bulk tomorrow or Tuesday best can do.\nB. F. Smith.\nOn September 21 the first car was shipped, and was followed by another before the respondent had received any acknowledgement of the receipt of the first. Both cars, which contained Cobbler potatoes, were rejected on the ground that the potatoes were of inferior quality. The cars were re-shipped\u2014one to Montreal and the other to Toronto\u2014where they sold as Canada Grade A potatoes.\nOn the appellant\u2019s refusal to accept and pay for these two cars, the respondent refused to make any further shipments, claiming that the appellant had repudiated the contract and that he was no longer bound by it. The appellant, after notification, proceeded to buy twenty car loads of potatoes in the open market to fulfill its engagements. These it purchased at a cost of $3,290 above the respondents contract price. To recover this $3,290 as damages for breach of contract this action was brought.\nAt the first trial the jury brought in a general verdict for the respondent. This was set aside by the Appeal Division[17] and a new trial ordered on the ground that, even if the first car load was improperly rejected, it would not justify the respondent\u2019s refusal to deliver the balance of the twenty cars. In its judgment the court construed the telegrams of September 17 and 18 as a refusal on the part of the respondent to ship the first car on account of the contract. At the second trial questions were submitted to the jury who answered them all in favour of the respondent. They found that both cars had been shipped under the contract; that both contained Grade A potatoes; that the respondent had not committed a breach of the contract, and that, owing to the statements and conduct of the appellant, the respondent was justified in considering the contract to be at an end and he was, therefore, relieved from making further delivery under it.\nThe trial judge was very strongly of opinion that the jury\u2019s finding that the two cars were delivered under the contract was in conflict with the construction placed on the telegrams by the Appeal Division. He, therefore, refused to give effect to the finding but, instead, entered judgment for the appellant. This judgment the Appeal Division set aside and again a new trial was ordered[18]. Against that order the appellant now appeals to this Court and asks to have the judgment of the trial judge restored; while the respondent asks that effect be given to the verdict of the jury.\nThe prolongation of this litigation has been due, in my opinion, to an erroneous construction placed by the Court of Appeal upon the telegrams of September 17 and 18. The Court held that from the respondent\u2019s telegram the appelant \u201cnot only might reasonably have inferred, but was bound to infer, that the defendant (respondent) had refused to send the car against the twenty car contract.\u201d The car referred to was the first car shipped.\nWith deference, I am unable to spell out of the respondent\u2019s telegram a refusal on his part to ship against the contract. Where is the refusal? He is asked if he can ship one car as against the contract on the coming Monday. He replies that he will ship on Monday or Tuesday. That is no refusal, nor is it evidence of an intention to make a new contract. It is only because he mentions the price of 90 cents per bag that any plausible argument for the court\u2019s interpretation is possible. But the price he mentioned is the contract price. If he was not willing to ship under the terms of the contract he was to wire present price and conditions. This, to my mind, implies that \u201cthe present price\u201d would be one different from the contract price and that the conditions called for would be a statement of the kind and quality of the potatoes and the terms of payment; in fact all the information necessary upon which to base a new contract. No conditions whatever are mentioned in the respondent\u2019s telegram. Does, then, the fact that he mentioned in his wire the contract price justify the conclusion that he was refusing to ship against the contract of September 3, and was making a new contract for this car load? In my opinion it does not. The respondent testified that he shipped both cars against the contract; and Mr. Stevenson, who was called for the appellant, gave this testimony:\u2014\nQ. Now speaking of this first car that was shipped up there by Mr. Smith, * * * if that had been Canada Grade A in the judgment of the plaintiff would it have been applied to the contract?\u2014A. Not necessarily.\nQ. Why wouldn\u2019t it have been?\u2014A. We didn\u2019t know how we might apply it, we didn\u2019t know from that wire if it was to apply.\nQ. You remember giving evidence on another trial do you?\u2014A. Yes. * * * * *\nQ. \u201cSupposing that it had been for the sake of argument of Canada Grade A, it would have been a shipment on the contract, wouldn\u2019t it\u201d and your answer \u201cWell, the car would have been applied in that case.\u201d Didn\u2019t you make that answer at the last trial, didn\u2019t you make that statement?\u2014A. If it is there I must have made it.\nBut more than that, if the respondent was not going to ship under the written contract his telegram of the 18th would be a proposal only, and would have to be accepted before he had a contract at all. The appellant acted as if they construed the respondent\u2019s reply to mean that he would ship against the contract. When the car arrived the appellant was on hand to inspect it and it was rejected\u2014not because there was no contract for it, but because it was not Grade A in quality. If it was shipped under a new and independent contract there was no stipulation that the potatoes were to be Grade A, and the appellant had no right to reject it because it did not come up to that grade. I, therefore, think the jury were right in finding that the first car was shipped under the contract.\nAs to the second car the respondent says: that having been requested to ship one car under the contract, he concluded that shipments under the contract had begun with the first car delivered, and that he was called upon by the contract to ship five cars per week, of which this was one. The jury accepted his evidence and, in my opinion, were right in finding that the second car was also shipped under the contract.\nThe appellant rejected both cars and refused to pay for them against the shipping documents. There was abundant evidence that both these cars contained Grade A potatoes. Both cars answered the contract in every respect save one, namely, that they had not been Government inspected and no certificate of grading accompanied the draft. Is this an objection of which the appellant can take advantage? In my opinion it is not. As I have already pointed out, Government inspection of new potatoes did not commence under the statute until after September 30. The obtaining of the certificate of grading was, therefore, impossible. Both parties are presumed to know the law and to know that certificates of grading could not be obtained at the date these cars were shipped. The request for shipment against the contract prior to October, therefore, constituted a waiver of the right to require Government inspection and the certificate, as was pointed out by White, J. in giving the first judgment of the Appellate Division. It cannot, therefore, be said that the respondent was in default under the contract in not having the Government certificate as to grade.\nThe last question is, was there evidence to support the jury\u2019s answer to Question 13? That question reads:\n13. Q. Was the defendant by the statements and conduct of the plaintiffs, justified in repudiating the contract and relieved from making any further delivery under the contract?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe Sale of Goods Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, ch. 149, section 28 (2), provides as follows:\n(2) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments, which are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or whether it is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation, but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.\nIn Freeth v. Burr[19], Coleridge, C.J., said:\nIn cases of this sort, where the question is whether the one party is set free by the action of the other, the real matter for consideration is whether the acts or conduct of the one do or do not amount to an intimation of an intention to abandon and altogether to refuse performance of the contract. I say this in order to explain the ground upon which I think the decisions in these cases must rest. * * * I think it may be taken that the fair result of them is as I have stated * * * Now, non-payment on the one hand, or non-delivery on the other, may amount to such an act, or may be evidence for a jury of an intention wholly to abandon the contract and set the other party free.\nIt is not contended that in every case a refusal to accept and pay for a partial delivery would of itself constitute a repudiation of the contract. The rule on this point is dealt with in Millars\u2019 Karri & Jarrah Co. v. Weddel, Turner & Co.[20], where, at page 29, Bigham J., with whom Walton J. agreed, said:\nIt is argued that it (the award) violates the well-known rule of law that where goods are sold to be delivered in different instalments a breach by one party in connexion with one instalment does not of itself entitle the other party to rescind the contract as to the other instalments. But I do not agree. The rule, which is a very good one, is, like most rules, subject to qualification. Thus, if the breach is of such a kind, or takes place in such circumstances as reasonably to lead to the inference that similar breaches will be committed in relation to subsequent deliveries, the whole contract may there and then be regarded as repudiated and may be rescinded. If, for instance, a buyer fails to pay for one delivery in such circumstances as to lead to the inference that he will not be able to pay for subsequent deliveries; or if a seller delivers goods differing from the requirements of the contract, and does so in such circumstances as to lead to the inference that he cannot, or will not, deliver any other kind of goods in the future, the other -contracting party will be under no obligation to wait to see what may happen; he can at once cancel the contract and rid himself of the difficulty. This is the effect of section 31, subsection 2 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893.\nThat section is identical with the New Brunswick section in question here. See also Munro v. Meyer[21]. In the case at bar the appellant not only refused to accept and pay for either of the cars shipped, although they contained Grade A potatoes, but also stated that all deliveries of such potatoes would be refused. This is made clear by the evidence of Mr. Thompson himself who gave this testimony:\nQ. This car of potatoes that you saw you say in your opinion wouldn\u2019t pass as Grade A?\nQ. And even if it had been bought on the contract you would have rejected it just the same?\u2014A. Yes.\n* * * * *\nQ. If that was the only kind and quality that Smith had to ship although he had shipped you wouldn\u2019t have taken them on the contract?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You would have rejected car after car?\u2014A. Why yes, that kind of stuff.\nThe jury had before them the contract and the communications between the parties. The appellant did not communicate with the respondent directly but only through Stevenson. The evidence shews that in sending the letters and telegrams Stevenson was acting for the appellant.\nThe contract, as the jury knew, provided that either Cobblers or Green Mountains might be shipped at the option of the respondent who had on hand enough Cobblers to fill the entire contract and was ready and willing to ship them. The jury had also before them the following communications from Stevenson:\nLetter of September 3rd, in which he asked:\nWill you also kindly advise if you will be able to ship mostly Green Mountain potatoes against the contracts as our Trade prefer this variety if possible.\nThe evidence shews that Green Mountains, as a rule, brought from ten to twenty cents per barrel more than Cobblers.\nLetter of September 6, which contained the following:\nWith reference to contracts booked for October shipment, our Buyers would like some assurance regarding the quality of the potatoes you will ship as in shipments of the new crop of Cobblers from New Brunswick which have recently arrived we find that while the outside of the potatoes look very nice and sound, a very large per cent of them on being cut shows a large hole and rot right in the centre of the potatoes.\nThis is a very serious defect and if it prevails generally in the crop of Cobblers throughout New Brunswick our Trade would not want this variety shipped against contract.\nWould you therefore be in a position to ship all Green Mountains and are they free from blight or any disease of a serious nature.\nLetter of September 10, in which he says:\nYou did not mention in your letter whether you would be able to supply mostly Green Mountains and as these are much preferred by our Trade would ask that you kindly bear this in mind and arrange to ship as many cars of Green Mountains as possible against contract we are enclosing for twenty cars for Messrs. Thompson & Alix.\nIn a letter dated September 26, he says:\nWe regret to say that the second car of potatoes which was on the way to Sherbrooke has not turned out satisfactory and Messrs. Thompson & Alix will not accept these as on inspection and cutting some of the potatoes they found almost every one of the large ones to be rotten inside and quite a few of the medium size are the same way. They will not accept the car as they state the Buyers here will not use any more of these potatoes.\nThere have been several cars of these Cobblers come into Sherbrooke and they have been distributed around pretty well and nobody wants any more of them.\nIn addition Stevenson reported, on September 23, that on inspection Thompson & Alix found more than half the first car to be very poor stock: very small, also wet and full of mud. The jury, on abundant evidence, found these statements to be far from the truth, so far indeed that they may well have concluded that the appellant had some ulterior motive for making them, and, from the correspondence above quoted, may have considered the motive to have been a desire to obtain Green Mountains instead of Cobblers. That the appellant wanted the twenty car loads of potatoes delivered is, I think, clear, but he did not want to take Cobblers as these were not desired by the trade.\nIn view of the terms of the contract, the declaration of the appellant Thompson that all cars containing similar potatoes would have been rejected, and the letters, it was, in my opinion, open to the jury to find that the refusal by the appellant to accept and pay for the two cars shipped evidenced an intention to repudiate the whole contract unless the respondent would fulfil it by shipping Green Mountains instead of Cobblers.

McColl Frontenac Oil Co., Ltd., [1933] S.C.R. 197\nDate: 1933-02-27\nJoseph Dorzek, by His Next Friend John Dorzek, the Said John Dorzek, and Clementine Dorzek (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nMcColl Frontenac Oil Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1933: February 20, 27.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Amount in controversy in appeal\u2014Claims for damages, by infant suing by father as next friend, and by father, in same action\u2014Appeal by them from judgment reversing judgment at trial in their favour for a sum to each of less than $2,000, the sums together exceeding $2,000\u2014Alternative motion for special leave to appeal.\nThe action was for damages resulting from the infant plaintiff being struck by defendant\u2019s motor truck. The infant, suing by his father as next friend, claimed for personal injuries, and his father claimed for hospital and medical expenses and loss of work. At trial the infant recovered $1,875, and the father $284.25. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the judgment and dismissed the action. Plaintiffs appealed de plano to this Court. The present motion was by way of appeal from the Registrar\u2019s refusal to affirm jurisdiction.\nHeld: This Court had not jurisdiction. To give jurisdiction in regard to either appellant, the amount in controversy in the appeal with regard to him must exceed $2,000. Each cause of action was complete in itself and distinct from the other. Appellants were in the same position (as to jurisdiction) as if separate actions had been brought and separate judgments rendered. The amounts recovered at trial could not be added to give jurisdiction. \u201cL\u2019Autorit\u00e9\u201d Limit\u00e9e v. Ibbotson, 57 Can. S.C.R. 340, Armand v. Carr, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 575, and McKee v. City of Winnipeg, [1930] Can. S.C.R. 133, cited.\nAn alternative motion for special leave to appeal was refused.\nOn an application for special leave to appeal, within s. 41 (f) (amount exceeding $1,000) of the Supreme Court Act, the mere fact that an important point of law is involved in the appeal is not in itself a sufficient reason for granting leave, if the point has already been the subject of a decision in this Court or in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\nMOTION by way of appeal by the plaintiffs from the order of the Registrar declaring that the Supreme Court of Canada has not jurisdiction to hear and determine their appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which reversed the judgment at trial in favour of the plaintiffs, and dismissed the action, which was for damages resulting from the infant plaintiff being struck by defendant\u2019s motor truck.\nThe material facts of the case for the purpose of this motion are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote.\nIn the alternative, the plaintiffs moved for an order granting them special leave to appeal (leave having been refused by the Court of Appeal).\nThe motion was dismissed with costs.\nW.F. Schroeder for the motion.\nG.F. Henderson K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014This motion is made on behalf of the appellants by way of appeal from an order of the Registrar refusing to affirm the jurisdiction of this Court de plano.\nIn the alternative, the Court is moved for an order granting the appellants special leave to appeal.\nAs stated in the judgment of the Registrar, there are three plaintiffs-appellants: 1. The infant Joseph Dorzek, suing by his next friend John Dorzek; 2. John Dorzek, the father of the infant; 3. Clementine Dorzek, the mother of the infant.\nBy the trial judgment, the infant recovered from the defendant $1,875; and it was ordered that the sum should be brought into court and remain there until he attains the age of twenty-one years, the income thereon, in the meantime, to be paid to him; John Dorzek recovered $284.25; and Clementine Dorzek recovered $46.87.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the trial judgment and dismissed the action.\nAs pointed out by the Registrar, the claims of the three plaintiffs were separate and distinct, each claiming in respect of loss personal to each. The infant\u2019s claim was for damages resulting from the physical injuries suffered by him as a consequence of the accident. The father\u2019s claim was for damages made up of hospital and doctors\u2019 fees and charges, including two weeks\u2019 loss of work. The mother\u2019s claim was for loss of one month of her wages. Each plaintiff recovered for the separate damages they respectively suffered.\nNo amount recovered individually by the plaintiffs is sufficient to give jurisdiction to this court; but the appeal from the order of the Registrar is asserted upon the ground that the action was in the nature of a joint action brought by the father on behalf of himself and his infant son and that the two amounts awarded to the infant and to the father must be regarded as one for the purposes of an appeal to this court.\nIn circumstances such as the above, although there be but a single judgment, the appellants, for purposes of jurisdiction, are in the same position as if separate actions had been brought and separate judgments had been rendered. Each cause of action is complete in itself and distinct from the other. The amount of the matter in controversy in the appeal to this court must therefore exceed the sum of $2,000 with regard to each individual appellant. (\u201cL\u2019Autorit\u00e9\u201d Limit\u00e9e v. Ibbotson & others[1]; Armand v. Carr[2]; McKee v. City of Winnipeg[3].\nIn the present case, the next friend by whom the infant sued also recovered against the defendant. The decision of the Registrar was that this did not \u201cjustify the contention that the two (amounts recovered) may be added for the purpose of giving this Court jurisdiction.\u201d We are of opinion that the Registrar has correctly stated the rule applicable in such cases. The appeal from the order of the Registrar refusing to affirm jurisdiction ought, therefore, to be dismissed.\nDealing now with the alternative motion for an order granting special leave to appeal: Leave having been refused by the Court of Appeal of Ontario, the Supreme Court may grant such leave only if the matter in controversy in the appeal comes within one or the other of subsections a, b, c, d, e and f of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The only subsection applying here is subsection (f): where \u201cthe amount * * * in controversy in the appeal will exceed the sum of $1,000\u201d; and the subsection applies only to the case of the infant plaintiff. Moreover, section 41 provides for \u201ca special leave to appeal,\u201d which implies the existence of special reasons for granting leave.\nIn the premises, the special ground put forward by the appellant is stated as follows:\nThis is a motor car accident. In such cases, the statute (The Highway Traffic Act\u2014sec. 42 of ch. 251 of R.S.O., 1927) places upon the defendant the onus of proving that the loss or damage complained of did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct. In the face of a definite finding made by the jury that the defendant has failed to discharge the onus, a court of appeal has no right to disturb such finding and to substitute for it its own view of the facts. If, on the other hand, the court of appeal was of opinion that the verdict of the jury was perverse, the proper judgment was not to dismiss the action, but to order that there should be a new trial. It is submitted that, having regard to the large number of motor car cases throughout Canada, these are matters of public importance and would afford a sufficient reason to grant the special leave prayed for.\nThe question as to the effect of the provisions of sec. 42 of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act and of similar statutes has more than once been considered by the Supreme Court and by the Privy Council. Only recently, in the case of Winnipeg Electric Co. v. Geel[4], this Court and the Judicial Committee had occasion to state the law in this respect very fully and, at all events, with regard to each of its aspects in relation to the questions now sought to be discussed by the appellant. The Court should not grant special leave to appeal for the mere purpose of reasserting the law it has already expounded. The principles which are to govern were clearly exposed in the Geel case4 and we have no doubt that the courts of this country are fully aware of their duty to apply them where occasion arises.\nIn this particular case, we do not find in the judgment of the Court of Appeal any statement in conflict with the judgment re Winnipeg v. Geel4, or any intention of disregarding the law as it was there laid down.\nBut this further ought to be said: The mere fact that a point of law\u2014important though it may be\u2014is involved in the appeal is not in itself a sufficient reason why special leave should be granted, if the point has already been the subject of a decision in this Court or in the Judicial Committee.\nThe motion of the appellant should accordingly be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Chown & Chown.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\n[1] (1918) 57 Can.

One C. had been invited with his wife, but she had been unable to come as she found the distance too great for walking. The appellant then offered to C. the use of his automobile to go and get her. C. took the car, but stopped on his way. One R.M., nephew of the appellant but not his employee as chauffeur or otherwise, happened to pass on the street where the car was parked, and, seeing nobody in charge, thought fit to notify his uncle by telephone. The appellant then gave the following instructions to his nephew: \u201cTake my automobile and bring it back here immediately and don\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201d The nephew took the car, but, instead of bringing it back immediately to his uncle\u2019s home, he left the direct route towards it and drove off to a neighbouring town, with friends. After having left them there, he started his return trip alone; and, on his way back, he overtook a sleigh driven by the respondent, hit it from the rear and upset all the passengers including the respondent\u2019s minor daughter, who had to be extricated from under the sleigh and suffered serious injuries. The accident occurred before R.M. had reached the intersection of the road which would have been the direct road between the place where the appellant\u2019s car was parked and the latter\u2019s home. The respondent\u2019s action in damages was maintained for $4,000 by the trial judge, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 52 K.B. 183), that the appellant was not liable, for, at the time of the accident, the appellant\u2019s nephew was not \u201cin the performance of the work\u201d which had been entrusted to him. (Art. 1054 C.C.).\nIn interpreting the meaning of the last paragraph of article 1054 C.C., it would be an error in law to assimilate to an offence committed by a servant or workman \u201cin the performance of the work for which they are employed,\u201d a similar offence committed \u201cduring the period\u201d of that work.

Nous en empruntons le r\u00e9cit au jugement de premi\u00e8re instance:\nLe d\u00e9fendeur donnait un d\u00eener chez lui le soir du Jour de l\u2019An. Il avait invit\u00e9 entre autres un nomm\u00e9 Charron avec son \u00e9pouse. M. Charron \u00e9tant venu seul parce que Madame Charron n\u2019avait pu se rendre \u00e0 pieds, le d\u00e9fendeur demanda \u00e0 M. Charron de l\u2019aller chercher avec son auto. M. Charron prit l\u2019auto, mais arr\u00eata en chemin. Le nomm\u00e9 R\u00e9n\u00e9 Moreau, neveu du d\u00e9fendeur, passant pr\u00e8s de l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 Charron avait laiss\u00e9 l\u2019auto et la voyant sans conducteur, en avertit son oncle par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Celui-ci lui r\u00e9pondit de la ramener tout de suite et de ne pas aller ailleurs. Le neveu prit l\u2019auto, mais au lieu de la ramener au d\u00e9fendeur tout de suite, alla reconduire quelques amis \u00e0 Hull. C\u2019est sur le retour, qui eut lieu sans plus de retard, que conduisant son auto \u00e0 une tr\u00e8s grande vitesse ou de fa\u00e7on absolument aveugle et imprudente, et venant dans la m\u00eame direction que le demandeur (\u00e8s-qualit\u00e9), il frappa sa voiture \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re, o\u00f9 \u00e9tait assise (sa fille) mineure avec quelques autres personnes qui n\u2019eurent pas le temps de sauter et furent projet\u00e9es sur le pav\u00e9;\nComme cons\u00e9quence de cet accident, Lucienne Labelle eut les deux jambes fractur\u00e9es; et la preuve indique qu\u2019elle restera infirme.\nLa faute et la responsabilit\u00e9 de Ren\u00e9 Moreau, le neveu du d\u00e9fendeur, ne fait aucun doute. La question est de savoir si, dans les circonstances qui viennent d\u2019\u00eatre relat\u00e9es, le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame peut \u00eatre tenu responsable.\nLe demandeur, qui a poursuivi en qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 sa fille mineure, a invoqu\u00e9 contre le d\u00e9fendeur le dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1054 du code civil:\nLes ma\u00eetres et les commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nLe proc\u00e8s s\u2019est d\u00e9battu et a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 uniquement sur le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans ce paragraphe.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi[2] en appel ont maintenu l\u2019action. Le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019est port\u00e9 appelant devant cette Cour, et nous avons \u00e0 examiner les deux jugements qui nous sont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nPour mieux comprendre la situation, il est n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9ciser certains d\u00e9tails:\nRen\u00e9 Moreau, le neveu, n\u2019\u00e9tait ni l\u2019employ\u00e9, ni le chauffeur du d\u00e9fendeur appelant.\nPour les fins de cette cause, les seules relations entre Ren\u00e9 Moreau et l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient celles qui r\u00e9sultaient du fait que l\u2019appelant avait dit \u00e0 son neveu de lui ramener sa voiture \u201ctout de suite et de ne pas aller ailleurs.\u201d\nAu moment o\u00f9 ces instructions furent donn\u00e9es, la voiture de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait arr\u00eat\u00e9e devant la \u201cstation de pompes\u201d (\u201cpower house\u201d) du village de la Pointe Gatineau, o\u00f9 demeurait l\u2019appelant. La r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant o\u00f9 le neveu devait conduire la voiture, \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame rue que la \u201cstation \u00e0 environ un demi-mille de l\u00e0; et cette rue \u00e9tait l\u2019unique chemin pour s\u2019y rendre: \u201cIl n\u2019y a pas m\u00eame un coin de rue \u00e0 faire pour s\u2019en revenir droit\u201d. La ville de Hull, o\u00f9 le neveu s\u2019est rendu avec ses amis, au lieu de ramener la voiture directement chez l\u2019appelant, est situ\u00e9e dans une direction oppos\u00e9e, \u00e0 une certaine distance du village de la Pointe Gatineau. En laissant la \u201cstation de pompes\u201d du village pour se rendre chez l\u2019appelant et en suivant le chemin qui conduisait chez ce dernier, le neveu avait \u00e0 d\u00e9passer l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 se trouve le point de d\u00e9part de la route qui relie le village de la Pointe Gatineau \u00e0 la ville de Hull. Ce point de d\u00e9part est un pont, sur lequel la route vers Hull franchit d\u2019abord la rivi\u00e8re Gatineau. C\u2019est en arrivant au point de rencontre du pont et de la rue conduisant chez l\u2019appelant que le neveu aper\u00e7ut ses amis et qu\u2019il se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 prendre avec eux la direction de la ville de Hull\u2014direction tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente de celle qu\u2019il lui fallait suivre pour ramener la voiture chez l\u2019appelant, suivant les instructions de ce dernier. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une simple d\u00e9viation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire: il ne s\u2019agissait pas simplement du cas d\u2019un conducteur qui, ayant \u00e0 se rendre d\u2019un endroit \u00e0 un autre, a plusieurs routes \u00e0 sa disposition et en choisit une qui est plus longue, au lieu de prendre la voie la plus directe. Ren\u00e9 Moreau, le neveu, ne pouvait pas se rendre de la \u201cstation de pompes\u201d \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de son oncle en passant par Hull, m\u00eame en supposant une d\u00e9viation anormale. La preuve d\u00e9montre que, apr\u00e8s \u00eatre all\u00e9 \u00e0 Hull, il avait \u00e0 refaire le m\u00eame trajet en sens inverse et \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 son point de d\u00e9part, le pont sur la Gatineau, pour prendre ensuite la rue qui conduisait \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant.\nC\u2019est en revenant de Hull, et alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore \u00e0 une certaine distance du pont, que l\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9.\nLes seuls autres faits qu\u2019il pourrait y avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 mentionner sont que Ren\u00e9 Moreau avait dix-neuf ans et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de permis de conducteur d\u2019automobile; mais ces deux faits ne peuvent affecter le r\u00e9sultat de la cause telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u2019avoir commis une faute ou une imprudence en confiant sa voiture \u00e0 une personne inexp\u00e9riment\u00e9e ou maladroite et qui ne connaissait pas le fonctionnement d\u2019une automobile. Il n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article 1053 du code civil. D\u2019ailleurs, Ren\u00e9 Moreau avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e2ge requis par la loi pour \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule-moteur, et il est prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il savait conduire et \u00e9tait habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire. Le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de permis ne d\u00e9montre pas, en soi, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inhabile. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli en preuve qu\u2019un permis lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9. (City of Vancouver v. Burchill[3]).\nL\u2019appelant ne pouvait \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 que si les circonstances que nous venons de relater entra\u00eenaient l\u2019application du dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9 plus haut.\nIl n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le ma\u00eetre de Ren\u00e9 Moreau, et ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait ni son domestique, ni son ouvrier; mais l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un commettant; et, bien que notre code emploie le mot \u201couvriers\u201d au lieu du mot \u201cpr\u00e9pos\u00e9s\u201d (qui se trouve dans l\u2019article correspondant du Code Napol\u00e9on: 1384), il ne saurait y avoir de doute que, suivant l\u2019esprit de la loi et de la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, Ren\u00e9 Moreau, lorsqu\u2019il fut charg\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant de lui ramener sa voiture, s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie de ceux qui engagent la responsabilit\u00e9 de leurs commettants pour\ntout dommage caus\u00e9 * * * dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers (i.e. les domestiques et les ouvriers) sont employ\u00e9s.\nD\u2019autant plus que les r\u00e8gles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 1054 C.C. s\u2019appliquent de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des mandants pour les dommages caus\u00e9s par la faute de leurs mandataires (Art. 1731 C.C.)\nLa condition de la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant ou du mandant, telle qu\u2019elle est pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 1054 C.C., c\u2019est que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 ou le mandataire ait caus\u00e9 le dommage \u201cdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il est employ\u00e9\u201d.\nLa port\u00e9e de cette disposition du code civil a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9e \u00e0 fond par cette Cour dans la cause de Curley v. Latreille[4]. Les notes des juges qui ont rendu ce jugement sont compl\u00e8tes et nous dispensent d\u2019avoir \u00e0 revenir sur la discussion de l\u2019aspect g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de cette question. Tant que le texte du code civil demeurera la m\u00eame, ou tant que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e dans cet arr\u00eat n\u2019aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur, cette Cour devra consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elle est li\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a rendue; et il restera seulement \u00e0 appliquer les principes qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9s aux faits particuliers de chaque cause qui nous sera soumise.\nEn effet, comme l\u2019a fort bien vu le savant juge qui a rendu le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui nous est soumis: \u201cChaque cause en cette mati\u00e8re devient, en consequence, une question d\u2019esp\u00e8ce\u201d. Et c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Duff, dans son jugement dissident re The Governor and Company of Gentlemen Adventurers of England v. Vaillancourt[5]. Nous nous permettrons de citer de copieux extraits de ce jugement parce qu\u2019il explique clairement le point de vue auquel nous nous pla\u00e7ons; quoique, dans la cause de Vaillancourt5, son appr\u00e9ciation personnelle de la preuve et des circonstances avait conduit M. le juge Duff \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent de celui de la majorit\u00e9. Notre coll\u00e8gue commence par mettre en regard les textes du dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais; puis il dit:\nThere does not appear to be any necessary inconsistency between the French text and the English text. They are to be read together, and (if interpretation be necessary) each as explanatory of the other. City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott Ltd.[6]. I doubt myself if exposition could make the meaning of the language used in either text plainer than it is. Le fait dommageable must be something done in the execution of the servants\u2019 functions as servant or in the performance of his work as servant. If the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employed to perform or the class of things falling within l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer. Whether that is so or not in a particular case must, I think, always be in substance a question of fact, and although in cases lying near the border line decisions on analogous states of fact may be valuable as illustrations, it is not, I think, the rule itself being clear, a proper use of authority to refer to such decisions for the purpose of narrowing or enlarging the limits of the rule.\nI am emphasizing this because, in cases arising under these paragraphs, as in other cases under article 1054 C.C., counsel are accustomed to fortify their arguments by copious references to decisions of the French courts, many of which appear to be of little value either as illustrations of the application of the text or otherwise. In France the doctrine has been widely accepted and was more than once affirmed by the highest tribunal that the employer is responsible for acts done by his employee \u00e0 l\u2019occasion of his service. It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that an act done by an employee \u00e0 l\u2019occasion of his service may or may not be one for which the employer is responsible under article 1054 C.C., depending in every case upon the answer to the question: \u201cWas the act done in the execution of the employee\u2019s service or in the performance of the work for which he was employed?\u201d Puis, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques arr\u00eats, M. le juge Duff poursuit:\nOn the other hand, if. the act of the servant causing the injury complained of is an act having no relation to the duties of his employment as, for example, where two servants momentarily discontinue their work to engage in some sort of a frolic, then, although it might not improperly be said that the injurious act is something done \u00e0 l\u2019occasion of their employment, it would appear to be an abuse of language to describe it as done dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des jonctions or in performance of the work for which they were employed.\nSuch cases are no doubt near the line, and the nearer the line one gets the greater the room of course for difference of opinion as to the application of the words of the text. But in substance the solution of the point involves nothing more than an accurate appreciation of the facts in their relation to the rule. There seems to be an increasing tendency in France (see Planiol, Revue Critique de L\u00e9gislation, vol. 38, pp. 298, 301) to refer the paragraph under discussion as well as the opening paragraph of Article 1384 C.N. to a doctrine of social responsibility, according to which the risk of injury arising from the prosecution of an enterprise, should fall upon the entrepreneur or proprietor because he enjoys the profits arising from it. I do not think considerations derived from this mode of reasoning can legitimately be applied in controlling the interpretation or the application of the text now under consideration.\nDes citations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, il convient de rapprocher une partie du jugement de M. le juge Mignault dans la m\u00eame cause. Elle nous para\u00eet d\u2019autant plus importante qu\u2019elle d\u00e9finit l\u2019opinion du savant juge en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au jugement qu\u2019il avait rendu dans la cause de Curley v. Latreille[7]. De cette fa\u00e7on, nous avons l\u2019avantage de trouver dans les termes qu\u2019il a lui-m\u00eame employ\u00e9s l\u2019exposition de la doctrine qui d\u00e9coule des deux jugements rendus dans Curley v. Latreille7 et dans Governor &c v. Vaillancourt[8], auxquels ont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, dans leurs notes sur la cause actuelle, la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Voici le passage en question (p. 427):\nDans Curley v. Latreille7, apr\u00e8s avoir rapport\u00e9 certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et fait observer que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la faute d\u2019autrui est de droit strict, je me suis exprim\u00e9 comme suit sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 1054 C.C., avec le plein concours de mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin:\u2014\n\u201cEtant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation stricte s\u2019impose en cette mati\u00e8re, je ne puis me convaincre que le texte de notre article nous autorise \u00e0 accueillir toutes les solutions que je viens d\u2019indiquer. Ainsi, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le ma\u00eetre et le commettant sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s, ou, pour citer la version anglaise de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. \u2018in the performance of the work for which they are employed.\u2019 Ceci me para\u00eet clairement exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour un fait accompli par le domestique ou ouvrier \u00e0 l\u2019occasion seulement de ses fonctions, si on ne peut dire que ce fait s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si le fait dommageable est accompli dans l\u2019exercice des fonctions ou seulement \u00e0 leur occasion, mais, s\u2019il appert r\u00e9ellement que ce fait n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du domestique ou ouvrier, nous nous trouvons en dehors de notre texte. l\u2019abus des fonctions, si le fait incrimin\u00e9 s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces fonctions, entre au contraire dans ice texte et entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre.\u201d\nJe suis encore du m\u00eame avis, et il ne me semble pas inutile de le dire encore \u00e0 raison de certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise qu\u2019on a invoqu\u00e9es pour donner \u00e0 l\u2019article 1054 C.C., quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants, une interpr\u00e9tation extensive qu\u2019il ne comporte pas dans mon opinion. Il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise a pris depuis quelques ann\u00e9es une orientation qui l\u2019\u00e9carte de plus en plus de la doctrine traditionnelle. Elle admet de nouvelles th\u00e9ories en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 civile, comme l\u2019abus du droit, l\u2019enrichissement sans cause et la responsabilit\u00e9 des irresponsables, enfants en bas \u00e2ge et insens\u00e9s (Phaniol, t. 2, no. 878). On peut m\u00eame dire qu\u2019elle tend \u00e0 faire abstraction de la faute et \u00e0 la remplacer par une conception du risque. Mais n\u2019oublions pas que nous avons un code dont le texte doit nous servir de r\u00e8gle, et que si les opinions des auteurs et les d\u00e9cisions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise ne peuvent se concilier avec ce texte, c\u2019est le texte et non pas ces opinions et ces d\u00e9cisions que nous devons suivre. Je ne serais certainement pas partisan d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de notre code qui en ferait pr\u00e9valoir la lettre sur l\u2019esprit, mais quand le texte est clair et sans \u00e9quivoque on n\u2019a pas besoin de chercher ailleurs.\nNous inspirant des principes pos\u00e9s et de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par cette Cour au texte du Code qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause n\u2019est pas responsable du dommage qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la fille de l\u2019intim\u00e9 par Ren\u00e9 Moreau parce que ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, au moment de l\u2019accident, \u201cdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles\u201d il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nNous devons suivre le jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de Curley v. Latreille[9]. Nous ne consid\u00e9rons pas que la loi concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants a re\u00e7u, de la part de cette Cour, une interpr\u00e9tation plus extensive dans la cause de Vaillancourt[10]. Et nous sommes d\u2019ailleurs d\u2019avis que les faits de la cause actuelle sont encore plus favorables \u00e0 Moreau qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient favorables \u00e0 Latreille dans la cause de Curley9.\nBien respectueusement, nous allons t\u00e2cher de le d\u00e9montrer en faisant l\u2019analyse des jugements de Curley v. Latreille9 et de Governor &c v. Vaillancourt10, \u00e0 laquelle nous sommes d\u2019ailleurs contraints par suite de la port\u00e9e qui nous para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 ces arr\u00eats dans le jugement qui nous est maintenant d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9.\nOn se rappelle les faits dans la cause de Latreille[11]. En voici le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s le rapport du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi11.\nLatreille demeurait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il avait \u00e0 son service, depuis \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s six mois, un chauffeur du nom de Lauzon, qui lui donnait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement satisfaction. Le soir du 4 d\u00e9cembre 1915, le fils de Latreille, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre fait conduire par le chauffeur, lui ordonna de reconduire l\u2019automobile au garage. La preuve \u00e9tait contradictoire sur la question de savoir si le chauffeur conduisit l\u2019automobile au garage et la reprit ensuite, ou s\u2019il se contenta de se rendre pr\u00e8s du garage puis de proc\u00e9der dans une autre direction. Apr\u00e8s une \u00e9tude attentive des jugements de la Cour du Banc du Roi et de ceux de cette Cour, nous croyons pouvoir affirmer que cette diff\u00e9rence de d\u00e9tails n\u2019a pas influ\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision concordante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par les deux cours. Ni l\u2019une, ni l\u2019autre des cours n\u2019ont cru n\u00e9cessaire de fixer exactement ce point de fait. Dans la soir\u00e9e, \u00e9tant rest\u00e9 en possession de l\u2019automobile, le chauffeur partit avec des amis; et, entre minuit et une heure du matin, alors qu\u2019il descendait le Boulevard Saint-Laurent \u00e0 grande vitesse, arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la rue Saint-Viateur, o\u00f9 un tramway \u00e9tait stationn\u00e9, au lieu d\u2019arr\u00eater pour ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 la loi, il continua son chemin sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche de la rue et frappa le fils de Madame Curley, lui infligeant des blessures graves dont il mourut quelques heures plus tard. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, Lauzon abandonna sa victime et fila \u00e0 toute vitesse. Le jury d\u00e9cida que le chauffeur \u00e9tait, au moment de l\u2019accident, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Le juge pr\u00e9sident le proc\u00e8s r\u00e9f\u00e9ra la cause \u00e0 la Cour de R\u00e9vision, qui donna effet au verdict, et maintint l\u2019action[12].\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi en appel infirma le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision et d\u00e9bouta la demanderesse de son action11.\nLa Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada confirma ce dernier jugement[13]. L\u2019action se trouva donc d\u00e9finitivement rejet\u00e9e. Dans cette cause, toute la question de l\u2019abus dans les fonctions fut carr\u00e9ment pos\u00e9e par le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du juge au jury et fit l\u2019objet de la discussion dans les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi[14], et de la Cour Supr\u00eame[15].\nEn Cour Supr\u00eame, l\u2019honorable juge Brodeur \u00e9tait dissident; mais la lecture de son jugement est tr\u00e8s importante, parce qu\u2019elle fait voir qu\u2019il s\u2019appuie sur la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019abus, telle qu\u2019elle s\u2019est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence contemporaine en France, et que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le point de divergence entre lui et ses coll\u00e8gues de la cour. Il voulait envisager la promenade de Lauzon somme un simple abus des fonctions du chauffeur, qui n\u2019avait pas eu pour effet de soustraire le cas \u00e0 l\u2019application du dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. Pour cette raison, il aurait maintenu l\u2019action contre Latreille.\nEn somme, la Cour du Banc du Roi et la Cour Supr\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent que Latreille, le propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019automobile, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable de l\u2019accident caus\u00e9 par la faute de son chauffeur, parce que, au moment de l\u2019accident, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. L\u2019accident avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 au cours d\u2019une promenade que le chauffeur effectuait avec ses amis hors la connaissance de son ma\u00eetre; et il n\u2019existait aucune relation entre cette promenade et les fonctions du chauffeur.\nA cause de la tournure prise par la cause actuelle devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, il est int\u00e9ressant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 certains passages des jugements dans la cause de Latreille15. Ils font sentir d\u2019une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s nette l\u2019erreur qui assimilerait au d\u00e9lit commis dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 le d\u00e9lit commis pendant le temps de ces fonctions.\nL\u2019honorable juge Cross, qui a rendu le principal jugement en Cour du Banc du Roi, rapporte certains exemples qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par le pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de R\u00e9vision et fait remarquer qu\u2019il y a des cas o\u00f9 une simple d\u00e9viation de la route que le chauffeur a re\u00e7u instruction de suivre \u201cdoes not amount to a getting out of the scope of the service\u201d; mais que c\u2019est \u201ca fundamental misconception\u201d de dire que, dans le cas du chauffeur de Latreille, the master left the chauffeur in possession of the car and that possession did not, on the evening in question, cease until long after ten o\u2019clock, although perhaps it ought to have done so.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s M. le Juge Cross, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que, dans les circonstances\nLauzon\u2019s use of the car * * * while he was driving (his friends) here and there through the streets of the city, was no continuation of the possession which his master had given him, but was as much a. new and distinct exploit as if he had first housed the car in the garage and had afterwards broken into the garage and taken it out. It does not appear that the learned judges who gave judgment in review addressed themselves to the question whether Lauzon\u2019s tort was done in the performance of the work for which he was engaged, though it is true that they say, with the jury, that it was done while he was doing that kind of work (p. 396).\nLa distinction qu\u2019il faut faire nous para\u00eet marqu\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on \u00e0 la fois claire et concise dans un passage du jugement de Lord Dunedin dans la cause de Plump v. Cobden Flour Mills Company[16], cit\u00e9 par M. je juge Martin, et que nous aimons \u00e0 reproduire parce qu\u2019il nous para\u00eet d\u00e9finir la situation d\u2019une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s heureuse:\nthere are prohibitions which limit the sphere of employment, and prohibitions which only deal with conduct within the sphere of employment. A transgression of a prohibition of the latter class leaves the sphere of employment where it was, and consequently will not prevent recovery and compensation. A transgression of the former class carries with it the result that the man has gone outside the sphere.\nEt nous pouvons terminer cette revue de la cause de Curley v. Latreille[17] par la conclusion que tire M. le juge Mignault. Apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les circonstances de la cause, il continue:\nJe suis forc\u00e9 de dire qu\u2019aucun jury ne pouvait, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, raisonnablement arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que Lauzon, lors de l\u2019accident, \u201cwas performing work for which he was engaged by the defendant.\u201d Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un cas d\u2019abus, par le serviteur, des fonctions que son ma\u00eetre lui a confi\u00e9es, mais d\u2019un acte accompli enti\u00e8rement en dehors de ces fonctions, etc.\nLa cause de Latreille fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi en 1918, et par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada en 1920. Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, la Cour du Banc du Roi fut saisie d\u2019un cas semblable dans la cause de Cox v. Hall[18]: (MM. les juges Dorion, Tellier, Rivard et Hall, M. le juge-en-chef Lafontaine \u00e9tant dissident). L\u2019honorable juge Demers, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action du demandeur. M. le juge Tellier (maintenant juge-enchef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec), au cours de ses notes, dit ceci (p. 233):\nLe chauffeur n\u2019allait pas aux affaires de son ma\u00eetre, mais \u00e0 ses amusements \u00e0 lui. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. M\u00eame cas absolument que celui de Curley v. Latreille[19], dans lequel la Cour Supr\u00eame a exon\u00e9r\u00e9 le ma\u00eetre. Cette d\u00e9cision doit \u00eatre suivie, elle fait jurisprudence.\nComme on l\u2019aura remarqu\u00e9, M. le juge Tellier d\u00e9clare que, dans cette cause de Cox v. Hall[20], il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u201cm\u00eame cas absolument que celui de Curley v. Latreille\u201d19.\nM. le juge Dorion fait le m\u00eame rapprochement et dit (p. 234):\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, qu\u2019il est inutile de discuter, Hall n\u2019a pas encouru la responsabilit\u00e9 du dernier paragraphe de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. Brooks (le chauffeur) n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, au moment de l\u2019accident, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 M. le juge Rivard, il commence par faire allusion aux arr\u00eats des tribunaux d\u2019Angleterre et \u00e0 la cause de Harparin v. Bulling, cause venue du Manitoba20, puis il ajoute ce qui suit:\nCes d\u00e9cisions ne sauraient nous affecter; mais le jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame, dans la cause de Curley v. Latreille19, nous concerne; et sp\u00e9cialement pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par M. le juge Mignault, je pense qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre suivi dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce.\n* * * * *\nAlors que la doctrine fran\u00e7aise \u00e9tend l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle \u00e0 tout ce qui se rattache aux fonctions par quelque mani\u00e8re, et cela en conformit\u00e9 du texte du Code Napol\u00e9on, la r\u00e9daction de notre article 1054 nous force \u00e0 restreindre les cas de responsabilit\u00e9 aux faits qui constituent l\u2019exercice m\u00eame des fonctions.\nEncore un peu plus tard, en 1928, la Cour du Banc du Roi est de nouveau saisie de la m\u00eame question dans la cause de Clermont Motors Ltd. v. Joly22 (MM. les juges Howard et Cannon, M. le juge L\u00e9tourneau dissident). Les faits de cette cause sont quelque peu diff\u00e9rents; mais les jugements rapport\u00e9s sont int\u00e9ressants parce qu\u2019ils contiennent la discussion des arr\u00eats re Curley v. Latreille19 et re Cox v. Hall20 et la comparaison avec l\u2019arr\u00eat re Governor &c. v. Vaillancourt23 qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 par cette Cour quelque temps auparavant. Le jugement re Clermont Motors22 souligne le fait que, dans cette cause, l\u2019employ\u00e9\nhad taken the Hudson car not for any purpose connected with the business of the (master) but expressly for a purpose of his own (p. 266). Monsieur le juge Cannon, maintenant notre coll\u00e8gue, et qui faisait partie de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, nous para\u00eet indiquer correctement la distinction qu\u2019il faut faire entre la cause de Latreille24 et la cause de Vaillan-court25:\nIl me semble que l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle diff\u00e8re essentiellement de la cause de Vaillancourt25, car ce dernier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 d\u2019un coup de revolver par l\u2019agent de la compagnie de la Baie d\u2019Hudson dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement m\u00eame de cette derni\u00e8re, et, comme le dit le juge Mignault, l\u2019abus de son autorit\u00e9 par l\u2019agent de la compagnie entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re, si le fait incrimin\u00e9 s\u2019est produit dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\nLe savant juge r\u00e9f\u00e8re ensuite au passage du jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Rivard dans la cause de Cox v. Hall26, que nous venons de citer; et, apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen des faits et de la doctrine, il conclut, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, que Morency (l\u2019employ\u00e9) n\u2019\u00e9tait certainement pas dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions suivant le sens de l\u2019article 1054 du code civil et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il convient de lui donner conform\u00e9ment au jugement de Cox v. Hall26.\nLa r\u00e9f\u00e9rence faite par M. le juge Cannon \u00e0 Governor &c v. Vaillancourt25 nous am\u00e8ne maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de ce jugement qui, \u00e0 moins que nous ne fassions erreur, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019un grand poids dans la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause actuelle.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler les faits de cette cause, qui sont relat\u00e9s au long dans le rapport25. Ils sont tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents des faits de la cause actuelle. Un point de divergence important est que, comme le fait remarquer M. le juge Mignault (p. 429); dans les esp\u00e8ces o\u00f9 un chauffeur d\u2019automobile a caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une tierce personne un dommage dont cette derni\u00e8re veut tenir le ma\u00eetre responsable,\non ne trouve pas la particularit\u00e9 que pr\u00e9sente la cause (de Vaillancourt,25), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la subordination entre la victime et le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 qui a commis le d\u00e9lit, le ma\u00eetre commun ayant plac\u00e9 cette victime sous les ordres de ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9.\nMais ce qui est essentiel, dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on tente de faire un rapprochement entre la cause de Vaillancourt25 et la pr\u00e9sente cause, c\u2019est de voir le motif qui a induit la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour \u00e0 rendre le jugement qui a condamn\u00e9 la compagnie de la Baie d\u2019Hudson, et le principe sur lequel, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son appr\u00e9ciation des faits, cette majorit\u00e9 s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e. M. le juge Idington a vu, dans l\u2019acte de Wilson\nthe mode of discipline the drunken agent in charge of the premises and all therein, including respondent, sought to apply to his subordinate (p. 415).\nM. le juge Brodeur dit que Wilson, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses fonctions, avait le supr\u00eame commandement; qu\u2019il a vu dans l\u2019acte de son subalterne un m\u00e9pris de son autorit\u00e9; et qu\u2019il a voulu, en faisant usage de son arme \u00e0 feu, affirmer cette autorit\u00e9.\nC\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment pour lui un acte d\u2019autorit\u00e9 devenu d\u00e9sirable pour le prestige de la compagnie qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sentait. (Et plus loin:) Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a cru n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la force brutale pour accomplir les fonctions qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es.\nQuant \u00e0 M. le juge Mignault (pp. 426-432), il d\u00e9clare que\nen rapport avec sa g\u00e9rance, (Wilson) avait autorit\u00e9 sur l\u2019intim\u00e9 et sa m\u00e8re, \u00e9galement employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante, qui \u00e9taient tenus d\u2019ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 ses ordres l\u00e9gitimes.\nIl dit qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un d\u00e9lit dont le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 s\u2019est rendu coupable en dehors de ses fonctions, puisque Wilson pouvait r\u00e9primer l\u2019injure ou le manque de respect par des remontrances ou autres moyens raisonnables. Il a voulu les r\u00e9primer par des voies de fait. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019exercice abusif de son autorit\u00e9; mais c\u2019\u00e9tait, quand m\u00eame, de sa part, un acte par lequel il entendait exercer son autorit\u00e9.\nApr\u00e8s cette analyse peut-\u00eatre longue, mais n\u00e9cessaire, des deux arr\u00eats prononc\u00e9s par cette cour et auxquels la Cour du Banc du Roi s\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e en rendant le jugement qui nous est soumis, il nous reste \u00e0 appliquer aux faits de la cause actuelle les principes que nous avons trouv\u00e9s expos\u00e9s au cours de la revue que nous venons de faire.\nLe savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, dans les circonstances, l\u2019accident qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la fille de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute de Ren\u00e9 Moreau \u201cqui \u00e9tait alors le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur et dans le cours de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\u201d Nous ne pensons pas qu\u2019en employant l\u2019expression: \u201cdans le cours de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution,\u201d le savant juge ait voulu indiquer une interpr\u00e9tation extensive de l\u2019article du Code civil qui se lit: \u201cdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions.\u201d Cependant, dans ses notes, le savant juge dit que\nd\u2019apr\u00e8s la doctrine et la jurisprudence, le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une auto est responsable de l\u2019acte dommageable commis par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au cours de la possession qu\u2019il en a l\u00e9galement eue, si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 continue et ininterrompue, \u00e0 moins que le propri\u00e9taire ne prouve qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accident son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 avait absolument fait sienne cette possession en convertissant l\u2019auto \u00e0 son usage exclusif. Nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce il faut d\u00e9cider que la possession l\u00e9gale du neveu de l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 continue et ininterrompue. Elle a cess\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est dirig\u00e9 vers la ville de Hull, car, \u00e0 partir de ce moment, il ne se servait plus de l\u2019automobile pour les fins de son commettant mais il s\u2019en emparait pour ses propres fins. Pour employer les expressions qu\u2019on rencontre au cours des jugements de Curley v. Latreille27:\nhe was not performing the work which had been entrusted to him; * * * it was no continuation of the possession which his employer had given him; but it was a new and distinct exploit.\nIl n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\nEn plus, nous devons faire remarquer, comme nous l\u2019avons mentionn\u00e9 au commencement, que le cas de l\u2019appelant en cette cause-ci est plus favorable que celui de Latreille. Lauzon, qui a caus\u00e9 l\u2019accident au fils de Madame Curley, \u00e9tait le chauffeur, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier de Latreille. Toutes les causes qu\u2019on nous a cit\u00e9es sont des causes o\u00f9 le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par le chauffeur ou l\u2019employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier.\nIci, le neveu n\u2019\u00e9tait ni le chauffeur ni l\u2019employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier. Il \u00e9tait seulement charg\u00e9 d\u2019une t\u00e2che sp\u00e9ciale et pr\u00e9cise. Il devait ramener la voiture de la \u201cstation de pompes\u201d \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant. Cette distinction a son importance pour d\u00e9cider si le jeune Moreau \u00e9tait dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. En effet, un employ\u00e9 qui n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas les ordres de son ma\u00eetre ne cesse pas pour cela d\u2019\u00eatre son employ\u00e9; mais il ne manque pas de cas o\u00f9 un simple pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, investi d\u2019un mandat sp\u00e9cial, qui n\u2019ex\u00e9cute pas les ordres qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us, cesse par le fait m\u00eame d\u2019\u00eatre un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Cela va de soi: les fonctions d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial sont beaucoup plus restreintes que les fonctions d\u2019un employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier. Pour rapprocher cette id\u00e9e du cas qui nous occupe: Les fonctions d\u2019un chauffeur r\u00e9gulier sont \u00e9videmment plus \u00e9tendues que l\u2019\u00e9taient, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, celles de Moreau, qui avait simplement re\u00e7u instructions de conduire la voiture de la \u201cstation\u201d \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de son commettant tout de suite, et de ne pas aller ailleurs.\nNotre probl\u00e8me nous para\u00eet donc se ramener aux questions suivantes:\nQuelles sont les fonctions d\u2019un chauffeur qui est un employ\u00e9 r\u00e9gulier? Elles consistent \u00e0 prendre soin de la voiture de son ma\u00eetre et \u00e0 conduire cette voiture pour les fins de son ma\u00eetre.\nLauzon, au moment de l\u2019accident qui a caus\u00e9 la mort du fils de Madame Curley, ne conduisait pas la voiture pour les fins de son ma\u00eetre. Il \u00e9tait en dehors de ses fonctions et Latreille a \u00e9t\u00e9 exon\u00e9r\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9.\nQuelles \u00e9taient les fonctions de Wilson, l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la compagnie de la Baie d\u2019Hudson? Elles consistaient \u00e0 g\u00e9rer l\u2019entrep\u00f4t et \u00e0 exercer son autorit\u00e9 sur les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie. Dans l\u2019acte qu\u2019il a commis, il a voulu exercer son autorit\u00e9; et bien qu\u2019il l\u2019ait fait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on abusive et exag\u00e9r\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait quand m\u00eame dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions; et c\u2019est l\u00e0 le principe en vertu duquel la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable.\nQuelles \u00e9taient les fonctions de Ren\u00e9 Moreau? Elles consistaient uniquement \u00e0 ramener l\u2019automobile de la \u201cstation de pompes\u201d \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant. Il n\u2019y avait qu\u2019une mani\u00e8re de remplir cette fonction, en tenant compte de l\u2019\u00e9tat des lieux: c\u2019\u00e9tait de suivre l\u2019unique route qui conduisait de la \u201cstation\u201d \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant. Il n\u2019y en avait pas d\u2019autres. Encore une fois, ce n\u2019est pas le cas o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a plusieurs routes \u00e0 sa disposition, o\u00f9 le commettant lui donne instructions de suivre l\u2019une d\u2019elles, et o\u00f9, en d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance \u00e0 ces instructions, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 suit une route diff\u00e9rente qui m\u00e8ne au m\u00eame but. Le jeune Moreau a abandonn\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement la route qu\u2019il devait suivre pour rester dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions et il en a pris une autre pour des fins enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rentes et qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec la fonction dont il \u00e9tait charg\u00e9. Il agissait donc en dehors de ses fonctions et, comme l\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode de temps, les conditions exig\u00e9es par l\u2019article 1054 C.C. ne se rencontrent pas et le commettant (ou l\u2019appelant) n\u2019est pas responsable du dommage qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9.\nNous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence du cas o\u00f9 le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 accomplit mal ou d\u2019une fa\u00e7on abusive une charge qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9e. Ici, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 n\u2019accomplissait pas ce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de faire. Il faisait quelque chose de diff\u00e9rent et qui n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec ce qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de faire.\nIl nous faut dire un mot du jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Greenshields dans la cause de Prain v. Bronfman28 sur lequel le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a appuy\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision. Nous ne sommes pas d\u2019avis que les circonstances de cette cause en font une esp\u00e8ce semblable \u00e0 celle qui nous occupe. Lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, le chauffeur avait disparu et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retrac\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin; et personne n\u2019a pu raconter ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 entre le moment o\u00f9 il avait laiss\u00e9 son ma\u00eetre et le moment de l\u2019accident. Au moment m\u00eame de l\u2019accident, dit M. le juge Greenshields,\nhe was proceeding to the garage to complete the performance of the work for which he was employed, viz: the storing of the car in the garage.\nCette circonstance nous para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cisive dans le jugement de cette cause, puisque l\u2019honorable juge y dit, au cours de ses notes:\nAgain, I concede that the extent of the deviation (i.e. celle d\u2019un chauffeur qui s\u2019\u00e9carte de sa route r\u00e9guli\u00e8re) may be and should be considered.\nDans la cause actuelle, la preuve ne permet pas de d\u00e9cider si, au moment de l\u2019accident, le jeune Moreau avait l\u2019intention de se rendre \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de son oncle. Il se dirigeait peut-\u00eatre vers la route qui y conduisait et qu\u2019il avait laiss\u00e9e dans le but d\u2019aller \u00e0 Hull; il revenait peut-\u00eatre vers le point o\u00f9 il avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions, mais il ne les avait pas encore reprises; et, au contraire, il se trouvait \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il n\u2019avait aucune affaire \u00e0 aller pour accomplir la mission que l\u2019appelant lui avait confi\u00e9e et pour rester dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\nNous avons t\u00e2ch\u00e9 d\u2019exposer l\u2019enseignement qui, suivant nous, se d\u00e9gage des jugements dans les causes de Latreille29 et de Vaillancourt30. C\u2019est cet enseignement que cette Cour doit suivre; et, en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu et l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dessaulles, Garneau & H\u00e9bert.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alphonse Fournier.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 52 K.B. 183.\n[2] (1932) Q.R. 52 K.B. 183.\n[3] [1932] S.C.R. 620.\n[4] (1920) 60 Can.

Even although no actual amount may be in controversy, such, an appeal involves the future rights both of the creditor and of the debtor, which are directly affected by the bankruptcy proceedings following as a consequence of the order.\nAPPLICATION for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming (two judges dissenting), the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy by which the debtor was adjudged a bankrupt. The material facts of the case, for the purposes of the present judgment, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The application was granted, costs to be costs in the appeal.\nT. Brosseau K.C. for the motion.\nD. Baril contra.\nRinfret J.\u2014The debtor was adjudged a bankrupt by a judgment of the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy in the district of Montreal. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) by a majority of three judges against two. The debtor applies for special leave to appeal from those judgments to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAt the outset, the point was raised that the appellate court was not competent to entertain the appeal and, therefore, no authority vested in a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the appellate court.\nThere were two issues in this case. The main issue was whether the debtor had committed any act of bankruptcy and whether, as a consequence, a bankruptcy order should be made against him. The court of first instance made the order, and this was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nWhile no amount of money was directly involved in the judgment of the latter court refusing to set aside the bankruptcy order (The Cushing Sulphite Fibre Company v. Cushing[1]), a second issue was whether the debtor was indebted to the petitioner in the sum of $2,741.24, as alleged in the petition. This was contested; and the resulting controversy, it is argued, concerned a sum of money amounting to more than $500. However, in the nature of the proceedings, the amount could not be made the subject of a demand in the conclusions of the petition; and it may yet be a question whether, under the circumstances, the petitioner\u2019s claim ought truly to be considered a matter involved in the appeal.\nIt is not necessary for me to decide that point. Even if it should not be said that any sum of money is involved, the bankruptcy order is an order from which, in my opinion, an appeal will lie to the appellate court under section 174 of the Bankruptcy Act, because the appeal involves the future rights both of the creditor and of the debtor, which are directly affected by the bankruptcy proceedings following as a consequence of the order. (In re Union Fire Insurance Company[2]; In re J. McCarthy & Sons Co.[3], and cases there referred to; Marsden v. Minnekahda Land Co.[4].)\nI think, therefore, the objection to the jurisdiction of the appellate court as well as to my authority to grant leave must be overruled.\nIt remains to consider the special reasons for granting leave in the premises.\nThe question whether, on the facts established in this case, the applicant was rightly decided to be a debtor of the petitioner presents, in my view, a question of law of certain importance. Other questions are raised in the appeal involving the interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act in respect to the character of the debt essentially required to entitle a creditor to present a bankruptcy petition; in respect to the debtor\u2019s occupation and whether he was a trader according to the Act; also in respect to the true meaning of the word \u201cgoods\u201d in subsection (t) of section 2 of the Act and whether it includes immovable property, having regard to the apparent discrepancy between the French and the English version of the Act. These questions, in my opinion, afford special and sufficient reasons why leave to appeal should be granted to the applicant.\nThere will therefore be an order granting the application and a stay of proceedings. The appellant will not be required to provide security for costs; but should he elect to give security so as to get the benefit of subsection 4 of section 174 of the Act, I fix the amount of the security at $500. Any security already provided when the appeal was lodged in the Court of King\u2019s Bench shall remain in force in any event. Costs of this application to be costs in the appeal.\nApplication allowed.\n[1] (1906) 37 Can. S.C.R. 427.\n[2] (1886) 13 Ont. App. Rep. 268, at 295.\n[3] (1916) 38 Ont.

If he continues to carry out the contract, he cannot later, on the ground of such fraud or false representations, ask for payment on a basis different from that provided for in the contract or on quantum meruit or as damages arising from the fraud or misrepresentations. United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet ([1909] A.C. 330) followed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, S\u00e9vigny J., and maintaining the appellant\u2019s action in part.\nThe respondent, The Quebec Streams Commission, is an instrumentality of the Crown in the right of the province of Quebec and has been incorporated to build improvements in the rivers and streams of the province; and, under statutory provisions, it was authorized to erect certain structures designed to raise the high water level of Lake Kenogami to a certain height and to regulate and control the discharge of the lake at its outlet. The respondent called for tenders, after preparing plans and specifications. The appellant put in a tender much lower than the other offers received by the Commission which had estimated the cost at $1,324,513, its tender being for $880,682, a difference of more than $225,000 between it and the lowest of the other tenders submitted which had been prepared on the same estimates and quantities. The Chief Engineer of the Commission warned the appellant that he considered their price too low and that he did not feel that the Commission should accept their tender. However the appellant insisted to do the work and signed a contract by which it agreed to do the work embraced by its tender and contract for the sum of $880,682 and to proceed at such rate of progress as to enable the waters of Lake Kenogami to be raised to elevation 108 on April 1st, 1924, for the further sum of $105,000, making a total of $985,682, and further agreed that all subsequent additions to or deductions from the quantities indicated in the said form of tender should be figured at the rates appearing in its said tender. The trial judge found that the Commission paid upon the progress estimates the sum of $1,176,994.84, and that it also paid $351,451.59 of which it advanced $168,992.34, guaranteed by plaintiff\u2019s deposit of $150,000, or $18,992.34 more than the deposit. The appellant, however, was not satisfied with the payments made and sued to recover either as extras under the contract, or as damages arising from misrepresentations, or on the basis of quantum meruit, an additional sum which had been transferred to the mise-en-cause, The Royal Bank of Canada, of $442,600.60. The trial judge granted, on different heads, a total sum of $30,756.91. As the Commission should be credited with the sum of $18,992.34 which it advanced to appellant in excess of $150,000, it left to the credit of appellant a sum of $11,764.57, for which judgment was given by the trial judge. That judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C., O. L. Boulanger K.C. and H. Hansard for the appellant.\nChs. Lanctot K.C. and Louis St.-Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by Cannon J., and the judgment of Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by Smith J.\u2014The Court was unanimous in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nMr. Justice Cannon, after stating the facts as concisely as possible (the case being printed in seventeen volumes), added the following remarks:\nCannon J.\u2014* * * Can a, quantum meruit be recovered in this case?\nThe contract would first have to be set aside either by mutual consent of the parties or by a judgment. Arts. 1022 (3) and 1138 C.C. The works have been executed and the case of United Shoe Machinery v. Brunet[1] is authority to the effect that, even in case of false and fraudulent representations, a contract is not void, but merely voidable at the election of the person defrauded, after he has had notice of the fraud.\nUnless and until he makes his election, and by word or act repudiates the contract or expresses his determination not to be bound by it (which is but a form of repudiation), the contract remains as valid and binding as if it had not been tainted with fraud at all.\nIn the present case, the appellant asked for an extension of time, as provided in the contract, to complete the works, which was granted; but never at any time did elect to have the contract cancelled for the error alleged in the declaration, and the action itself does not pray for such cancellation by the Court. On the contrary, appellant elected to treat the contract as subsisting, claiming that it executed it in its entirety and cannot and does not now asked to avoid it. Art. 1000 C.C. Error, fraud and violence or fear are not causes of absolute nullity in contracts. They only give a right of action, or exception, to annul or rescind them.\n* * *\nMoreover, in this case, clause 37 protects the respondent completely and binds the appellant to suffer the consequences of any miscalculation or misinformation bona fide contained in the call for tenders or plans. We have here a \u201cmarch\u00e9 sur devis\u201d defined as follows by Planiol and Ripert, \u201cTrait\u00e9 de droit civil fran\u00e7ais,\u201d 1932, tome XI, p. 163, no. 917:\n917. Suite. March\u00e9 sur devis\u2014Au lieu de fixer d\u00e9finitivement par avance la somme globale \u00e0 payer, les parties peuvent se contenter de simples pr\u00e9visions, bas\u00e9es sur le co\u00fbt d\u2019ex\u00e9cution des divers d\u00e9tails. L\u2019entrepreneur pr\u00e9sente ces pr\u00e9visions dans un \u00e9crit appel\u00e9 devis, et le march\u00e9 est dit \u201cmarch\u00e9 sur devis.\u201d Le prix total d\u00e9pendra le l\u2019ensemble des travaux accomplis conform\u00e9ment au devis. Il peut donc varier par l\u2019addition de d\u00e9tails nouveaux, de travaux suppl\u00e9mentaires. On peut dire que dans ce cas encore il y a march\u00e9 \u00e0 prix fait, mais article par article, et non plus en bloc; chaque d\u00e9tail du travail a son prix particulier, et le total \u00e0 payer ne pourra \u00eatre connu qu\u2019apr\u00e8s ex\u00e9cution, suivant que tels ou tels travaux auront \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. Il est fix\u00e9 apr\u00e8s coup, et non d\u2019avance comme dans le forfait. Le march\u00e9 sur devis concerne presque exclusivement les entreprises de travaux mat\u00e9riels.\nIf appellant had wished to protect itself and secure a possible increase in the unit price, it should have done what its witness Swan says at page 120, line 28, vol. III:\nIn actual practise myself, I invariably stipulate if there is some question of depth that we do not know about and that there is likely to be a variation in the depth of the foundation, we invariably put in a clause to the effect that unit rates under the contract would be applicable down to five feet below what is shown on the plans, and anything beyond that, then you have got to take the matter into consideration and try and meet the cost and work out what is a fair and reasonable price to allow for the additional cost. That is my own personal practice and has been with my chiefs for all my career.\nNothing of the sort happened; appellant took a chance and its speculation brought it a loss. Who is to suffer for its miscalculation? Article 1012 C.C. enacts:\nPersons of the age of majority are not entitled to relief from their contracts for cause of lesion only.\nWhat I have said disposes, in my opinion, of any attempt to recover for the alleged tort, under 1053 of the Code, because the information that the appellant says it relied upon was, in its view, grossly inaccurate and misleading. Grant v. The Queen[2], under circumstances more favourable to the petitioner, was decided in favour of the Crown. It should have consulted an experienced engineer to prepare a well considered tender and understood that the honest belief and hope of the Respondent\u2019s engineer did not amount to a warranty as to plans and quantities; forsooth, it could have found that out by reading, with enough attention to understand them, the specifications and standard form of contract placed at its disposal. This case is distinguishable from Pearson & Sons v. Dublin Corporation[3], as it is impossible to find here fraudulent representations. The contract in this case stands as the law of the parties. In Bush v. Whitehaven Trustees, reported in Hudson\u2019s On Building contracts, vol. 2, p. 122, there was a finding by the jury, that the conditions of the contract were so completely changed, in consequence of the defendants\u2019 inability to hand over the sites of the work as required as to make the special provisions of the contract inapplicable. Here the contract was made with anticipation of the circumstances of which the appellant complains and provided for them; it is therefore applicable and must be applied. I refer to these English cases because they have been quoted and discussed before us and below, although this case must be, and our decision is governed by the law of Quebec.\n* * *\nThese findings, on matters of fact, unanimously concurred in by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, cannot be disturbed by us, unless we reach the conclusion that they are clearly wrong or against the evidence. The appellant has failed to establish either of these two conditions.\nUnder the statute 3 Geo. V, c. 6, secs. 6 and 16, any change in the consideration or price of the contract for extra work, not covered by the terms of the contract or the unit price, had to be approved by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The engineer, even if acquiescing to any change, could not bind the Crown and change the contract. See De Galindez v. The King[4].\nThe province paid appellant large sums over and above the price of its tender. It is not entitled to more, unless the respondent agrees to it. We cannot, by a judgment, order a thing, which, under the contract, can be done only by mutual consent, expressed by Order in Council, according to the special statute limiting the capacity to contract of the respondent. Arts. 360-364-366 C.C. We agree with the arguments and conclusions contained in the very able and complete judgment of the learned trial judge and the clear cut exposition of the law of contracts of the province of Quebec of the ex-Chief Justice Lafontaine and we concur when he says:\nun principe primordial doit dominer tout le litige. C\u2019est celui de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des contrats que les tribunaux ont pour mission de maintenir, et non pas de refaire pour venir en aide \u00e0 un contractant malheureux.\nPlaintiff can get no relief from the courts. His case might bring further adjustments by mutual consent, if the respondent agrees to reconsider the matter. On the evidence, it is impossible to differ from the conclusions unanimously arrived at by the provincial courts and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nMr. Justice Smith agreed with Mr. Justice Cannon that the appeal should be dismissed, being of the opinion that \u201cin view of the provisions of the contract, there was no misrepresentation and no difference of conditions to warrant the setting aside of the contract entered into by the parties, and that the appellant must be paid for the work done according to the terms of the contract, except as varied by mutual consent.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Boulanger, Marquis & Lessard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Louis St. Laurent.\n[1] [1909] A.C. 330, at 339.\n[2] (1891) 20 Can.

Appellant remained in occupation and a yearly rental of 111,292.60 was fixed. At that time the law in Ontario permitted free sale of intoxicating liquors by licensed persons. After the Ontario Temperance Act (1916, c. 50) came into force, which prohibited sale for beverage purposes in Ontario of products such as appellant manufactured, a lease to appellant was made, and renewed in 1921, at rentals lower than the sum aforesaid. At expiry of the renewal lease in 1926, appellant continued in occupation, thereby becoming a yearly tenant on the terms in the lease. The lease contained a clause that, should the provincial legislature pass any Act amending or repealing the Ontario Temperance Act, \u201cso as to allow or facilitate the manufacture or sale of the products manufactured by the said lessee,\u201d the Crown should have the right to increase the yearly rent to $11,292.60, or to any figure which might be agreed upon, the increased rental to become due from the date of the repeal or amendment. On June 1, 1927, the Liquor Control Act, Ont. (1927, c.70) came into force, and on June 13, 1027, a notice, signed by the Assistant Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works (Dom.), was sent to appellant, stating: \u201cAs the Ontario Temperance Act has been repealed, your company according to the above quoted clause [that above mentioned] is liable for rental from 1st June, 1927, at the annual rate of $11,292.60.\u201d After unsuccessful negotiations by appellant to fix the rental at what it was; paying or at less than the sum claimed, the Crown brought action for the balance due for rent on the basis set out in said notice, and recovered judgment in the Exchequer Court ([1932] Ex. c.r. 171). On appeal:\nHeld: (1) The words \u201cproducts manufactured by the said lessee\u201d in said clause in the lease, on proper construction, meant, not the actual products of appellant\u2019s brewery, but products of the kind manufactured by appellant.\n(2) The change effected in the law by the Liquor Control Act was such as to facilitate the \u201csale of the products manufactured by\u201d appellant (construed as above) within the meaning of said clause in the lease, and justified the increase of rent.\n(3) The notice given was effective for the purpose of increasing the rent. Judgment of the Exchequer Court (supra) affirmed. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Angers J.)[1], holding that the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $13,478.56, and interest, the said sum being a balance alleged to be due to the plaintiff from the defendant for rent. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ. Shirley Denison K.C. and A. M. Latchford for the appellant.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014In 1912, the Crown expropriated certain lands and premises in the city of Ottawa belonging to the appellant, on which the appellant carried on a brewing business. The compensation allowed by the Exchequer Court in 1914 was $233,852.83, and, the appellant having remained in occupation, the judgment fixed the yearly rental at the rate of five per cent, on this sum, less a reduction of $400 for a small portion of the lands not occupied by the appellant, thus making the yearly rental $11,292.60.\nAt that time there was in force in Ontario a statute known as An Act respecting the Sale of Fermented or Spirituous Liquors (R.S.O., 1914, ch. 215), which permitted free sale of intoxicating liquors by all persons licensed under the Act.\nIn the year 1916, the Ontario Temperance Act (6 Geo. V, ch. 50) came into force on the 20th of September, which prohibited the sale in the province of products such as were being manufactured by the appellant, for beverage purposes, thereby curtailing the output of appellant\u2019s products in Ontario.\nOn representation to the government to this effect, an Order in Council was passed on the 28th day of December, 1916, authorizing a lease to the appellant of the premises, for a term of five years, from the 10th August, 1916, at an annual rental of $5,000. The lease contained the following clause: Should the Legislature of the Province of Ontario pass any act amending or repealing the Ontario Temperance Act, Chapter 50 of Provincial Statutes of Ontario, 1916, so as to allow or facilitate the manufacture or sale of the products manufactured by the said Lessee, the Lessor shall have the right to increase the rent hereby reserved to the sum of eleven thousand, two hundred and ninety-two dollars and sixty cents ($11,292.60) per annum or to any such figure which may then be agreed upon by the parties to these presents, the increased rental to become due from the date the said act is repealed or the amending act is passed and goes into effect whichever first happens.\nAt the expiry of this lease, the appellant applied for a renewal for another term of five years from the 10th of August, 1921, and a renewal lease for this term was made accordingly, but at a rental of $8,000 instead of $5,000 per year. This lease also contains the clause set out above, and expired on the 10th of August, 1926. The lessee continued to occupy the lands, and thereby became a yearly tenant on the same terms.\nOn the 1st day of June, 1927, the Liquor Control Act (Statutes of Ontario, 1927, Ch. 70) came into force, and on the 13th day of June, 1927, a notice, signed by the Assistant Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works, was sent to the appellant, setting out the fact that the appellant was a yearly tenant of the premises, and that the lease contained the clause already quoted. The notice then proceeds:\nAs the Ontario Temperance Act has been repealed, your Company according to the above quoted clause is liable for rental from 1st June, 1927, at the annual rate of $11,292.60.\nThis notice was followed by negotiations by the appellant for the fixing of the rental at either the same amount then being paid, or at a lesser amount than the amount claimed. These negotiations were not successful, and the present action is to recover $13,478.56, with interest, representing the balance due for rent on the basis set out in this notice of the 13th of June, 1927. The appellant contends that it is not liable for any rent beyond the $8,000 per year mentioned in the lease.\nThe first contention is that the notice of the 13th of June, 1927, was not a sufficient notice under the terms of the clause of the lease quoted above, because not signed with the formalities required by law to bind the Department, and because the language of the last clause of the notice, quoted above, is not a definite statement that the rental will be increased, but merely that it is liable to be increased. We were all of opinion, on the argument, that this objection could not prevail.\nThe appellant\u2019s further contention is that the clause quoted refers only to products actually manufactured by the appellant, and that it was therefore incumbent upon the respondent to establish as a fact that the change in the law had actually allowed or facilitated the manufacture or sale of the appellant\u2019s own products, and that no evidence had been offered to establish this fact.\nIn my view, the appeal turns upon the construction to be placed upon the language of the clause of the lease in question. I was much impressed by the argument that the words \u201cproducts manufactured by the said lessee\u201d must mean the precise products manufactured by the lessees themselves, but on fuller consideration I have concluded that this language refers to products of the kind manufactured by the lessee. On behalf of the appellant it was argued that, to arrive at the true meaning of this language as used in the lease, the surrounding circumstances, under which the lease was made, ought to be taken into consideration, and that these circumstances would point to the conclusion that the language of the clause deals only with the actual products of appellant\u2019s brewery, particularly as the lease should be regarded as dealing only with the rights and interests of the parties to it.\nIt was further argued that what was contemplated by the parties by the introduction of this clause was a change in the law of Ontario such as would permit a free sale of these products for beverage purposes to the public under conditions similar to those that prevailed prior to the Ontario Temperance Act, whereas the Liquor Control Act, that came into force on the repeal of the Ontario Temperance Act, permits a sale only to a single customer, namely, the government, represented by the Liquor Sale Commission, and therefore does not facilitate a sale of these products to the general public.\nIn my view, the parties had not in mind, in placing this clause in the lease, any particular kind of change in the law of Ontario that might take place, and were not in a position to foresee what change, if any, might take place; and therefore undertook to define, by the terms of the lease, the nature of the legislation that they had in view; and we must be guided by the description that the parties have adopted. Looking at the surrounding circumstances we have, at the time the lease was made, an Act of the Ontario Legislature in force, which absolutely prohibited the sale in Ontario for beverage purposes of products of the kind manufactured by the lessee. That Act, in the language of the clause of the lease, has been repealed, and a new law has been substituted, which expressly permits a practically unlimited sale of these products in Ontario for beverage purposes. This change necessarily opens in Ontario a general market for these products that did not exist at all under the Ontario Temperance Act. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Act itself, as compared with the Ontario Temperance Act, discloses that the sale of such products in Ontario has been facilitated. The appellant argues that the change of law does not allow or facilitate the manufacture of the products referred to, but it is sufficient, by the language of the clause, if the sale alone is facilitated.\nFor these reasons I have concluded that the judgment appealed from is right, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

The patentee must show an inventive step. Commercial success is nothing more than a question of fact depending upon several factors; and although it may assist in determining whether there is invention, it cannot afford a basis for controverting the conclusion that the alleged improvements of a known article are not of such a character as to show invention in a pertinent sense.\nThe making or the selling, without more, of an element of a patented combination does not of itself constitute an infringement of the combination.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an action by the plaintiff appellant to have it ordered and adjudged that the defendant respondent is infringing its patents No. 246,547 and No. 237,913.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and A. J. Thomson K.C. for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and R. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellant, who is the owner of two letters patent nos. 237,913 and 246,547, brought this action to restrain the respondent from infringing certain claims of the first patent and the whole of the second patent.\nThe particulars of breaches were that the respondent, at its factory, in the city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, had manufactured and sold manifolding books or pads covered by the claims of these patents.\nThe defence was a denial of the alleged infringement; and, moreover, that, having regard to the common knowledge of the art and to the prior patents, publications and uses set forth in the particulars of objection, there was nothing new and there was no invention in the letters patent invoked by the appellant.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissed the action on the grounds of anticipation and lack of subject-matter.\nPatent 237,913 is a patent for an alleged new and useful improvement in manifolding devices. The specification discloses a machine adapted to receive and handle manifold sales-books, pads, etc., and especially multiple form books and pads of the type employing continuous zigzag folded sheets.\nThe machine is said to be especially designed for the reception and handling of books or multiple forms of this character and involves means for receiving and supporting a manifolding book, a writing tablet or support, means for advancing the several sheets of the book over the surface of the tablet, means for separating the sheets as they leave the book, means for interleaving the sheets with carbon paper, means for manually registering the printed forms on the several sheets when the first set of forms is to be written upon, means for automatically maintaining such registry on the succeeding forms, means for separating the sheets after they have been written upon, and for transferring one or more sheets to a locked secret compartment, and means for severing the remaining sheets to permit removal for recording, filing or otherwise. The only claims under this patent in respect of which infringement is alleged are claims nos. 1, 13 (a), 14 and 15.\nThe other patent is for an alleged new and useful improvement in a \u201cManifolding book.\u201d The specification relates to record supply devices for use with manifolding machines and, with respect to its more specific features, to a manifolding book or pad for use in manifolding autographic registers and other machines which are adapted for the feeding of paper strips into position for the making of two or more records simultaneously by impression transfer to a lower strip of a record made on an upper strip. The supply pad is described as consisting in a plurality of similar continuous strips of printed forms superposed, interengaged, zigzag folded, each strip being provided with one or more apertures adjacent the longitudinal margin of the leaf and in transverse alignment. It is stated that the apertures serve a dual purpose: first, to arrest the feed of the forms in the register; and, second, to assist in maintaining registry between the different sheets of the form and between sets of forms throughout the pad. The pad, which is flat, is placed in a compartment at one end of the autographic register, and the leaves of the top set of the pad are threaded over the plates and engaged with the feeding mechanism. In operation, each set of leaves is serially advanced as a unit across the plates (or writing tablet) by the disc feed mechanically operated by a lever or handle until the apertures in the form are reached, when feeding stops because of the cessation of the friction between the discs and the forms. The form, which usually consists of sets of three or more superposed strips on all of which appears printed matter, is then in proper writing position on the platen and the various strips of the form are in registry one with the other.\nThe writing on the top strip is reproduced on the lower strips by means of sheets of carbon paper transversely inserted between the strips of the form; so that one invoice, for instance, can be made out on the top strip and the strips underneath it are fac-similes of the written strip. Then, by means of the mechanism, the strips are passed along the top of the apparatus to a place where the top strips come out and can readily be detached from the remainder of the strips.\nBut the lowermost strip of the completed form, commonly called the audit form, is ordinarily deflected downwardly into a locked compartment which is beyond the control of the operator; and such audit strip is there refolded and retained integrally connected across the platen with the unused portion of the supply pad.\nThis patent contains thirteen claims, upon all of which the appellant relied. Claim no. 2 may however be selected as typical and as describing the essential characteristics of the pad in question. It is in the following terms:\u2014\n2. A supply pad for manifolding machines including, in combination, a plurality of record strips folded zig-zag, the folds of one interengaged with those of the other so as to provide superposed sets of superposed leaves connected end-to-end, each strip having a longitudinal series of printed forms and a series of form-registering apertures in fixed relation to said forms, respectively.\nThe only infringement alleged in the particulars of Breaches is the manufacture and sale of the book or pad (or in other words of the record \u201csupply device\u201d alone); the action is not for an infringement of the machine.\nThe utility of the pad is admitted and it will not therefore be necessary or useful to discuss its advantages. The questions are anticipation and subject matter.\nThe learned trial judge examined in detail and with the most minute attention the prior patents and uses alleged as anticipations. He gave particular attention to Sherman (U.S.A., 1922), Holmes (U.S.A., 1902), Bentel (U.S.A., 1899) and Shirek & al (U.S.A., 1901), all anterior to patent no. 237,913 issued on February 19, 1924; and to patent no. 246,547, on 3rd February, 1925. In the course of a careful analysis of these patents, the learned President said (N. B. Wiswall, to whom he refers, was the original applicant for the patents in suit): (Here follow quotations from the judgment of the learned President)[2].\n* * *\nIn fact, the appellant, both in its factum and at bar, conceded that\nthe principle of superposed, inter-engaged zig-zag folded forms was old and the principle of feed-arresting, form-registering apertures was also old;\nbut the appellant claimed\nthe combination of the two was new, so that the various patents relating to the first principle and the Shoup-Oliver patent relating to the second principle are not anticipations of Wiswall.\nFor the better appreciation of the situation, the Shoup-Oliver patent (Can. no. 225,649), just referred to, should now be described. This patent issued on the 7th day of November, 1922, on an application filed on the 23rd day of February, 1921. It covers a special type of autographic register in which the feed of the continuous strips depends upon the co-operation with the strips of two pairs of circular discs which grip the strips together between them and, upon the manual operation of a handle, cause them to be drawn forward. In the paper strips designed for use in this device, there are a series of holes in appropriate relation to each form and in register with one another. These holes are in the track of the discs, which, upon the holes reaching them, lose their grip and cause the progress of the strips to stop, notwithstanding that the discs continue to be turned. The holes are so placed that stoppage occurs at points such that the last set of forms used is in a position for ready detachment and the next following set in a position for use on the writing plate. A special arrangement is provided whereby, after this fresh set of forms has been written upon, the strips are moved slightly forward by a simple mechanism, so that the gripping discs escape from the holes and renew their traction on the strips until they are reached by a fresh set of holes in the latter.\nUnder the corresponding United States Shoup-Oliver patent, the American Sales Book Company Limited, with which the plaintiff company is associated, had obtained a licence from the Autographic Register Company, of which the defendant is a subsidiary, and both companies had, from about 1918 on, been manufacturing and selling in competition autographic registers incorporating the Shoup-Oliver invention and supplies of paper for use in such registers. During these years, the paper supply made and sold by both companies was in the form of rolls; but, in or about 1923, the appellant commenced selling flat stationery and, in 1925, the respondent began to sell a similar zig-zag folded flat paper supply, either this form or the rolled form being adapted for use in its machines by the mere omission of the spindles, when the first form was used.\nBearing in mind the above facts and the purport and object of the Shoup-Oliver patent, we may now return to the appellant\u2019s contentions.\nIn a supplementary memorandum, the appellant declared he did\nnot claim as Wiswall\u2019s invention either (a) The interleaving of a number of strips of printed paper forms. Numerous counter sales book and register supply pad patents show this, including the U.S. patents to Law-son, Rogers, Shoup 561,350, Sherman, and Smith; or (b) The zigzag folding of interleaved; printed forms into a book or pad. This is shewn in the U.S. patents to Copeland, Bentel, Begg, Brakespear, McDowell, Holmes and Shirek; or (c) A record strip having a longitudinal series of form-registering feed-controlling, apertures. This is shewn in the U.S. patents to Konerman, Shoup and Oliver, and Schlichter.\nBut the appellant does claim as Wiswall\u2019s invention\nThe combination of interleaved strips of printed forms folded zigzag, having form-registering, feed-controlling apertures in fixed relation to the printed forms on the strips, the apertures in one strip being interlocked or interengaged with the corresponding apertures in the other strips of the forms before they are placed in the autographic register, and maintain such registration during the passage of the forms through the register.\nThe combination of elements, the interlocking of a number of series of form-registering apertures, and such interlocking in alternate sets of forms constitute novel subject matter.\nThe invention as now defined, however, differs from that defined in the patent and goes beyond the patent claims, to which it adds new characteristics not to be found in the claims themselves. It need not be repeated that the claim in a specification is primarily designed for delimitation and that the monopoly is confined to what the patentee has claimed as his invention. (Mailman v. Gillette Safety Razor Company[3], and cases there referred to). If we turn to the patent claims; and if we look at claim no. 2 already set out above and selected as fairly describing the essential characteristics of the pad in question, we find that the thing or combination which the applicant regarded as new and in which he claimed an exclusive property and privilege (Patent Act, s. 14 (c)) was a supply pad including, in combination,\n(a) A plurality of record strips;\n(b) Strips folded zigzag;\n(c) The folds of one strip interengaged with those of the other, so as to provide superposed sets of superposed leaves connected end to end;\n(d) Each strip having a longitudinal series of printed forms;\n(e) Each strip having a series of form-registering apertures in fixed relation to said forms.\nThe specification in the patent in suit refers to the \u201cform-registering\u201d apertures in this way:\nAs hereinafter explained, the apertures serve not only as form-registering apertures but also as feed-control apertures, and are of sufficient diameter to accommodate the feeding and registering mechanism of the machine with which the pad is used as will appear hereinafter.\n* * * * * * *\nBy placing the apertures clear of the weakened lines at the folds, the tearing off of the leaves does not affect the apertures, and hence the succeeding set of leaves will be retained with their apertures in engagement with the discs and consequently with their forms in registry relation.\n* * * * *\nFor filing purposes this is a great convenience because a pointed filing pin may be readily thrust through the interrupting leaf material whereas it would be more difficult to thrust such a pin through the thickness of the pad were there no apertures.\nThe expression \u201cfeed-control aperture\u201d does not appear in the claims.\nNow, if one compares the characteristics described in the patent claims with the disclaimers made by the appellant in its memorandum, it will at once become apparent that there was nothing new in the pad as described in the specification and that the only claim of novelty consisted in the so-called combination of elements, every one of which was old and every one of which had been designed and used for a purpose which was old and well known in the art.\nAssuming the maintenance of an integral connection between the refolded strip in the locked compartment and the supply pad as a whole was not previously claimed as new, it was suggested and disclosed in the prior publications. The prior art completely disclosed the pad as claimed in the patent in suit, with the possible exception of the provision for apertures or holes in the pad (although it might be contended that the apertures in Bentel\u2019s or Sherman\u2019s supply pads were sufficiently within the terms of the appellant\u2019s patent). But be that as it may, the combination now claimed by the appellant would consist, if we understand it correctly, in the addition to the flat pad of apertures already known and already in use for the same purpose in the roll type of paper supply for autographic registers of the same character; and the question which the learned President had to determine and which is now submitted to us, is whether there is in the so-called combination sufficient novelty to support the patent.\nGranting this was a new combination\u2014and, in our view it discloses a composite article rather than a combination in the patent sense\u2014novelty and utility, without something more requiring the exercise of an inventive faculty, would not be sufficient to make it invention. The patentee must shew an inventive step. In this case, admittedly, the idea of the supply pad was lying ready in the prior art, the form-registering feed-controlling apertures were already disclosed and in use in the roll form of supply paper. The pad was there and the apertures were there. And the patentee added the apertures to the pad for the identical and analogous purpose for which these apertures had been disclosed and were being used in the rolls. Moreover, these holes or apertures would be necessary to co-operate with a machine equipped with disc rollers for purposes of traction. Obviously they would be required to adapt them to the Shoup-Oliver type of disc feed. That is something which would follow of necessity from the device of the mechanism. (Lamson Paragon Supply Co. Ltd. v. Carter-Davis Ltd.[4].) We think it impossible to ascribe to the adaptation of the apertures to the flat packet the character of patentable invention. No doubt mere smallness or simplicity will not prevent a patent being valid; but if you apply a known device in the ordinary way to an analogous use, without any novelty in the mode of applying it, you may get a useful article, you may get an article which, in a sense, is improved and novel, but unless you shew invention, that is to say, that in adapting the old device there were difficulties to overcome or there is ingenuity in the mode of making the adaptation, you do not shew a valid subject-matter of a patent. Such we take it to be the law as laid down by Lord Halsbury in Morgan v. Windover[5], by Lindley L.J. in Elias v. Grovesend Tinplate Co.[6], by Romer J. in Wood v. Raphael, the well-known eye-glass case[7], and finally by the House of Lords in Riekmann v. Thierry[8] (Lord Halsbury L.C., Lord Macnaghten, Lord Shand and Lord Davey), where Lord Davey referred to the decisions of the House, in Harwood v. Great Northern Railway Company[9], and said that the law upon this subject was all to be found in that case.\nThe appellant pointed to the commercial success of the pad covered by the patent. In any event, commercial success would not afford a basis for controverting the conclusion that the alleged improvements were not of such a character as to shew invention in the pertinent sense (Guettler v. Canadian International Paper[10].) The relation, however, between commercial success and the novelty or the merit of an invention is nothing but a question of fact. In this case, the finding of fact of the trial judge is that the commercial success was due, not to the invention itself, but to several other extraneous causes. We would be unable to disagree from that finding, for the evidence points strongly as factors of success, to the awakening of new demands in the commercial enterprises and to the fact that the appellant was specially energetic in business.\nWe were referred to a judgment of the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, in a case of American Sales Book Company Limited v. Autographic Register Company[11], and which upheld the United States patent for what was stated before us as being a similar pad. While that judgment is certainly entitled to great respect, the claims in the United States patent are somewhat different from those in the Canadian patent; and it is apparent that the facts presented must have been different, for we can find no foundation in the present case for some of the holdings of the learned judge presiding in the District Court. But there is yet a more important point of distinction which must be emphasized. It would appear from the reasons of judgment that, in the New York court, the case was fought and submitted almost exclusively, if not entirely, upon the question of anticipation and that there was no legal contest on the point of subject-matter\u2014which was the main ground for the judgment rendered by the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nWe would be disposed to go a step further than the learned President and to say that there was sufficient anticipation in the prior art to defeat the validity of the patent no. 246,547; but we are content to rest our judgment on the objection upheld by him and which is: that if there be distinction between what Wiswall claimed and what other patentees had previously described, published and used, it is nowhere suggested that there was any technical difficulty to overcome and, at all events, the advance\nis so slight as not to call for that degree of inventive genius as to justify a monopoly.\nIt remains to consider patent no. 237,913 in respect of which the learned President said:\nI fail to conceive of any ground upon which the plaintiff should succeed in its claim that there was infringement of this patent.\nThe patent was granted for an improvement in a manifolding machine.\nThe claims of the patent alleged to have been infringed by the respondent cover a combination of the machine and a \u201cpad of the type employing continuous zigzag folded sheets.\u201d The application for the patent was filed almost two years before the application for the pad patent in suit (246,547). The specification states that the machine is adapted to receive and handle * * * multiple form books and pads of the type employing continuous zigzag folded sheets\nand, to that extent, it supplies cogent evidence of the fact that this type of books and pads were already in use in the trade; but the specification expressly declares that the machine \u201cforming the subject-matter of the invention\u201d is designed for the handling of manifold books\nregardless of whether the several sheets are zigzag folded, interfolded, separately folded, rolled or otherwise,\nso that it is entirely immaterial what the form of paper supply is. The respondent is not charged with infringement of the machine nor with infringement of the combination of the character described. The learned President declares that these conditions were not put in issue at the trial. The particulars of breaches limit the issues to the manufacture and sale of the books or pads. Nor could we readily understand, in the circumstances, a charge for infringement of the combination based solely on the manufacture and sale of a pad used in the respondent\u2019s machine which is not in any way in issue here, and more particularly where the subject-matter of the appellant\u2019s invention is described as a device absolutely\nregardless of whether the several sheets are zigzag folded, inter-folded, separately folded, rolled or otherwise.\nIt was urged upon us, in the appellant\u2019s supplementary memorandum, that the claims of patent no. 237,913, on which the appellant relied, describe the combination of the machine and supply pad as including a locked compartment at the forward end of the register to take the refolded audit copy of the forms after they have passed over the writing platen. It was further urged that in the advertising matter issued by the respondent, the use of similar registers with the flat packet supply pads and with the locked compartment is illustrated and its advantages are emphasized. It is now argued from that that the respondent has invited prospective customers to purchase and use the pads of their manufacture with a similar machine of the disc feed type, which they also manufacture and, thus, to induce the purchasers to infringe the combination claims of the appellant in the patent in question.\nWe think the respondent is justified in answering that the trial did not proceed on that footing and that it was not called upon to meet that kind of a case. Had such a charge of infringement been made in limine litis it would have been open to the respondent to adduce evidence and to shew reasons why it was not available to the appellant company.\nThe infringement, as defined by the appellant, was stated to consist in the manufacture and sale of the pad; and no evidence was directed towards shewing, on the part of the respondent, an intention of manufacturing and selling the pad for the purpose of using it in the appellant\u2019s register or, generally, of infringing the appellant\u2019s combination described in the claims referred to.\nThe question whether, under Canadian Patent law, the making or selling of a separate element of a combination constitutes, under given circumstances, an infringement of the invention, does not arise here. In our view, that question was not raised by the appellant; nor could it properly be raised on the record submitted. Surely, under the patent in question, it could not be contended that using any flat packet pad supply with any manifolding machine (even fitted with the secret compartment) would constitute infringement of the combination protected by the claims relied on. The invention which is claimed and which is protected, assuming the claim is valid\u2014consists in the combination of the manifolding machine described in the relevant claims with the manifolding pad therein described. Making or selling the machine alone, without more, is not of itself infringing the combination. Making or selling the pad alone is not of itself infringing the combination (Townsend v. Haworth[12]; The Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Limited v. David Moseley & Sons, Ltd.[13]), confirmed in appeal[14]; and neither does the making or selling of the pad for use with another similar machine constitute infringement of the combination (and that is to say: of the invention claimed and protected), unless indeed it be also shewn that the other machine is itself an infringement of the particular machine described in the combination. That is not the sort of infringement charged by the appellant or made part of the issues in the present case. The right of the respondent to make, use or sell its autographic register of the disc feed type was not in dispute.\nIn our opinion the action as brought was rightly dismissed. The appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1932] Ex.

S\u2019il n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu, il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 permis de faire appeler les deux autres t\u00e9moins qui assistaient \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration, mais il a us\u00e9 de sa discr\u00e9tion, suivant son droit.\nDans la cause de Seabrooke[1], la cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, le 9 ao\u00fbt 1932, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nIn considering whether statements made by an accused to the police are admissible in evidence, it is the duty of the trial judge to inquire thoroughly into their voluntary character, using all available sources of information, and where on the evidence of only one detective, the trial Judge admits statements made before five detectives and a clerk without questioning the others as to their voluntary character or examining the written report, a new trial was ordered.\nJe crois que les deux cours d\u2019appel sont d\u2019accord que, en principe, toutes les circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration doivent \u00eatre scrut\u00e9es par le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s, avant qu\u2019il exerce sa discr\u00e9tion quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9venu.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi croit que le juge pouvait se contenter des t\u00e9moignages de Lemire et de Mitchell pour satisfaire sa conscience, s\u2019il \u00e9tait convaincu que ces deux t\u00e9moignages lui fournissaient toutes les circonstances. La cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, au contraire, se basant sur le jugement de cette cour dans Sankey v. The King[2], a dit que le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s\nshould have had before him the evidence of the other detectives and the clerk who were present during the interrogation of the accused and also the written record of the examination made by the clerk, and should also have afforded the accused the option of giving his version of the occurrences connected with his examination and the substance of his statements.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le greffier Chouinard apr\u00e8s une mise en garde par le sous-chef Tremblay. R\u00e9pondant aux interrogations du chef Lemire, le pr\u00e9venu a sign\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration en pr\u00e9sence de deux t\u00e9moins, Mitchell et Tremblay. C\u2019est cette d\u00e9claration portant sa signature qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite au proc\u00e8s, au cours du t\u00e9moignage de Lemire, avant d\u2019entendre Mitchell.\nL\u2019on reproche au juge d\u2019avoir permis cette production et la lecture de cette d\u00e9claration aux jur\u00e9s avant d\u2019avoir entendu le t\u00e9moin Mitchell, et sans entendre Tremblay, qui aurait mis en garde le pr\u00e9venu, ni le greffier Chouinard, qui aurait clavigraphi\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses de l\u2019appelant, alors d\u00e9tenu comme t\u00e9moin important pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate du coroner, mais n\u2019\u00e9tant pas encore en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation, ni accus\u00e9 du meurtre de sa femme.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a-t-il eu tort de se d\u00e9clarer satisfait de la preuve faite par le seul Lemire pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite sign\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9venu, ou aurait-il d\u00fb \u00e9puiser d\u2019abord toutes les sources d\u2019information, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire examiner, non seulement Lemire, mais aussi Mitchell, Tremblay et le greffier Chouinard?\nA premi\u00e8re vue, la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire de Seabrooke[3], qui est une cause de m\u00eame nature, m\u00eame si l\u2019analogie n\u2019est pas parfaite avec celle qui nous occupe, semble oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure suivie par le juge en la pr\u00e9sente cause avec l\u2019approbation de la cour d\u2019appel. La question a beaucoup d\u2019importance. Le conflit apparent de ces deux points de vue au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, ou de la nature et de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de preuve que le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s doit imposer \u00e0 la Couronne, \u00e0 qui incombe totalement ce fardeau, avant de permettre la preuve d\u2019admissions ou de d\u00e9clarations faites par l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne en autorit\u00e9 devrait, je crois, \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 cette cour pour \u00e9tablir une pratique uniforme pour toutes les provinces. Il est important de d\u00e9cider si, oui ou non, la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e par cette cour re Sankey[4] est d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e comme condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de la discr\u00e9tion du juge quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration. Voici ce que disait le juge-en-chef Anglin \u00e0 la page 441:\nWe think that the police officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the occasions when he \u201cinterviewed\u201d the prisoner; and, if another policeman was present, as the defendant swore at the trial, his evidence should have been adduced before the statement was received in evidence. With all the facts before him, the learned judge should form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made \u201cvoluntarily and freely.\u201d\nIt should also be borne in mind that while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown. The King v. Bellos[5]; Prosko v. The King[6]. That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.\nPour exercer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 que me conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 1025 du Code criminel, je ne me pr\u00e9occupe en aucune fa\u00e7on du bien ou du mal fond\u00e9 du jugement a quo; mais on doit me d\u00e9montrer que ce jugement entre en conflit avec l\u2019arr\u00eat d\u2019un autre tribunal d\u2019appel. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que cet arr\u00eat ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 dans une cause identique; mais il faut, au moins, qu\u2019une question de droit analogue, servant de base \u00e0 chacun des arr\u00eats, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par chaque cour d\u2019appel dans un sens diff\u00e9rent. Barr\u00e9 v. The King[7]; The King v. Boak[8]; Liebling v. The King[9].\nLa question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, o\u00f9 il para\u00eet y avoir conflit, serait donc la suivante:\nLe juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s doit-il, pour se rendre compte de toutes les circonstances qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et accompagn\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration de l\u2019accus\u00e9, \u00e9puiser toutes les sources d\u2019information, examiner tous les t\u00e9moins disponibles, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9claration \u00e2 \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par l\u2019accus\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame et commence par une mise en garde de ne tenir compte d\u2019aucune promesse ou menace qui aurait pu lui \u00eatre faite et un avertissement du danger que cette d\u00e9claration pourrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s contre lui? Ou bien, peut-il se contenter de cette d\u00e9claration \u00e9crite apr\u00e8s avoir entendu un t\u00e9moin pour prouver les circonstances de l\u2019interrogatoire, la prise et la lecture de la d\u00e9claration et l\u2019apposition de la signature du pr\u00e9venu devant t\u00e9moins, sans entendre l\u2019officier qui aurait mis le prisonnier en garde, ni le greffier qui aurait pris la d\u00e9claration, ni l\u2019officier ayant eu sous sa garde le pr\u00e9venu apr\u00e8s son arrestation et avant son interrogatoire?\nJe n\u2019exprime aucune opinion quant au m\u00e9rite; mais je crois devoir accorder et j\u2019accorde la permission d\u2019appeler. Cette cause devra \u00eatre inscrite pour audition en t\u00eate de la liste de la province de Qu\u00e9bec au prochain terme de cette cour.\nMotion granted.\n[1] (1932) 58 Can. Cr.

The nature of the property in question is described in the judgment now reported. Subject to a certain variation of the judgment below, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nSection 1 (h) of the said Act provides:\n\u201cLand,\u201d \u201cReal Property\u201d and \u201cReal Estate\u201d shall include:\u2014\n* * *\n(4) All buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures, erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land; Section 4 provides:\nAll real property in Ontario * * * shall be liable to taxation, subject to the following exemptions:\u2014\n* * *\n(19) All fixed machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes, including the foundations on which the same rests; but not * * *\nJ.B. Aylesworth for the appellant.\nN.C. MacPhee for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The appellant carries on business at Walkerville as a distiller and vendor of whiskies, and requires the subjection of its products to a process known as maturing and aging, and, for the carrying on of this process, has had constructed what are known as racks, by which each barrel of liquor is held in suspension with free circulation of air and ready accessibility to every barrel.\nThe question which arises is whether these racks and certain electrical and other equipment in two of these racks are assessable under the Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 238, as land. The racks in question consist of upright timbers in parallel rows, so designed that between each two such rows the barrels of liquor can be suspended on their sides on wooden cross pieces, or barrel slides bolted to the uprights. On either side of each such pair of rows, and separating them from the next pair, sufficient room remains for a walkway from which each barrel may be inspected or identified. The uprights in all the lowest or first rows are \u201cdowelled\u201d to an oak sill which supports them, which sill in turn rests upon a concrete ridge or wall underneath the row. To each pair of uprights are three tiers of barrels. Superimposed on the rows of uprights is a second storey of similar rows, with similar cross pieces and barrel slides, and so on until there are in all nine storeys or tiers of these uprights, with their cross pieces and barrel slides, reaching a height of some 86 feet.\nThis network of timbers and cross-pieces is all bolted or spiked together in such a way that, when completed, it makes a strong structure, one of those in question accommodating 55,000 barrels of whisky. This structure, and the walls surrounding it, are erected together, the outer wall being fastened to the uprights of the rack next the walls by means of bolts protruding inwardly from the wall on each side of an upright, across which bolts a strap of iron is placed and fastened on the inner side of the upright. This fastening is repeated at proper intervals throughout the length of the walls and at each storey. The outer walls are of brick, 22 inches thick at the bottom, tapering to 12 inches at the top. The roof of the building rests, not on the walls, but upon the rack.\nI am of opinion, notwithstanding the able argument of appellant\u2019s counsel, that the Court of Appeal was right in concluding that the rack and building constitute a single structure, so interlaced and bound together that one cannot be separated from the other so that it may be said that the rack is a chattel separate from the building.\nIt is no doubt true, as argued, that the rack could be dismantled by unbolting the various pieces that are bolted together, and withdrawing the spikes or nails so that the material might be reconstructed into a similar rack upon another site. Before this could be done, it would be necessary to take the roof off, because the rack is its only support. Then it would be necessary to unfasten all the bolts by which the walls are tied to the uprights of the rack. The final result would be that there would be left a building 173 feet long by 142 feet wide and 86 feet high, without a roof. These walls, of course, without internal connections or external buttresses, would necessarily collapse ultimately through wind pressure.\nI am unable to conclude that this process of removing the racks could be done without damaging the building, which, it is admitted, is part of the land.\nIt is argued, however, that these racks are fixed machinery, used for manufacturing purposes, and therefore exempt from assessment under subsection 19 of section 4 of the Act, which is in part as follows:\nAll fixed machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes, including the foundations on which the same rests; * * *\nI am of opinion that maturing and aging is part of the process of manufacture of the whisky, as the liquor is not in condition to be placed upon the market until that process is completed, but I agree with the Court of Appeal that the racks are not machinery, within the meaning of the Act. In the case of Chamberlayne v. Collins[2], quoted in the reasons by the Court of Appeal, Davey, L.J., defined machinery:\n* * * to be the adaptation of mechanical means to a particular end by the application of natural forces.\nI agree with what is said by the Court of Appeal that it would be straining the word \u201cmachinery\u201d out of its true significance as used in the statute to apply it to this system of racks for the storage of barrels of liquor. The section is one providing for an exemption, and the word \u201cmachinery\u201d should not be given a wider meaning than its ordinary signification.\nI am unable, however, to agree with the opinion expressed in the Court of Appeal and by the learned county judge that the use of the elevator has nothing to do with the process of manufacture. In my view, as already stated, the maturing and aging of the whisky is a part of the process of manufacture. The placing and keeping of the barrels in these racks with the necessary attention to a circulation of heated air is all in connection with the manufacturing process, and any fixed machinery used for the carrying on of that process is, in my view, fixed machinery used for manufacturing purposes. The elevator therefore is, I think, exempt.\nThe circulation of heated air throughout the building is carried on by means of a fan, which distributes the heated air throughout the building, and causes circulation. The fan is certainly fixed machinery and is used in connection with the aging process, and therefore for manufacturing purposes, so that this heating apparatus also is, in my view, exempt.\nThe sprinkling system and the electric wiring are not machines, and have therefore been rightly held to be not exempt.\nWith the slight variation indicated, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, subject to a certain variation in judgment below.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bartlet, Aylesworth & McGladdery.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacPhee & Riordan.\n[1] (1931) 41 Ont.

Respondent (believed by the trial judge) testified that M. made the note on the occasion of one of their yearly settlements to fix the balance due respondent on wage account, that the balance found due for wages was $206.87, that respondent, asked by M. if he needed the money, replied that he did not as long as he remained there, that M. then said that he wanted to give respondent something, referred to services for M. of respondent\u2019s mother (who had recently died) and had respondent fill out (on M.\u2019s directions) a note form and signed it, but stated that he wanted to keep it for a while, to which respondent agreed; that M. kept the note until January, 1928, when he handed it to respondent, asking him not to tell anyone that he had it, and not to produce it until after M.\u2019s death and then only if there was more than enough in M.\u2019s estate to support M.\u2019s sister, and if he would remain on the farm at his present wages until M. died; to all of which respondent agreed. M. died in February, 1929, leaving an estate of $50,000. His sister died soon after. Respondent then presented the note and sued thereon.\nHeld: Respondent\u2019s evidence that the note was signed by M. was abundantly corroborated in the evidence. The note was a promissory note within the Bills of Exchange Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 16, s. 176) and respondent was entitled to recover thereon.\nRespondent\u2019s acceptance of M.\u2019s requests amounted to no more than a collateral engagement not to enforce his rights until the requests had been complied with. That did not make the document any the less an unconditional promise in writing by M. to pay at a fixed time a sum certain in money to respondent. The agreement not to enforce payment while M. lived was no part of the note. The terms of the note imported a present and unqualified obligation, and there was nothing in the evidence to justify the conclusion that its delivery by M. was conditional upon the fulfilment of his requests. Even if respondent could have been enjoined from enforcing payment in M.\u2019s lifetime, the document was still a promissory note within the meaning of the Act. As such, it imported that valuable consideration had been given for it (s. 58), and the onus (thus shifted) to establish want of consideration had not been met. Consideration being presumed until the contrary was shewn, M.\u2019s obligation on the note was contractual, and not by way of testamentary gift.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, the sole surviving executor of the estate of Archibald McCormick, deceased, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of His Honour, Judge Ross, Acting Judge of the County Court of the County of Kent, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action, which was brought to recover upon an alleged promissory note given by the said deceased to the plaintiff. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nA.G. Slaght K.C. and J.H. Clark for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and G.P. Campbell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014The questions involved in this appeal are, (1) whether the document handed to the respondent under the circumstances detailed by him, by the late Archibald McCormick (hereinafter called the Deceased) is a promissory note within the Bills of Exchange Act, and (2), whether there was corroboration of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that the document was signed by the deceased, sufficient to satisfy the requirement of section 11 of the Ontario Evidence Act?\nA promissory note is defined by section 176 of the Act as follows:\u2014\n176. A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified person, or to bearer.\nSection 11 of the Evidence Act provides:\u2014\n11. In an action by or against the heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party shall not obtain a verdict, judgment, or decision, on his own evidence, in respect of any matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other material evidence. The document in question here is:\u2014\n$5000.\nDue Jan. 13th 1928\nJan. 13th 1927.\nOne year after date I promise to pay to the order of Martin Luther Five Thousand Dollars at The Royal Bank of Canada for value received with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum as well after as before maturity.\nA. McCormick.\nThe respondent had lived with the deceased on his farm during his whole life, some 43 years. After he quit attending school he received wages which were increased until he was getting $500 a year, a free house and garden, with liberty to pasture and feed his stock without charge if there was feed for them. The respondent worked the farm under the deceased\u2019s direction and took care of the stock. He lived in the house with the deceased and his sister Kate until he got married some fifteen years ago, and from that time he lived in the tenant\u2019s house which was close by. During the year it was customary for the deceased to give the respondent, from time to time as he required them, advances on account of his wages and an account of these sums was kept by each of the parties. Then, in the early part of January in the following year, they had a final settling up. The deceased\u2019s sister Kate kept the accounts for him.\nOn January 13, 1927, the respondent went to the deceased\u2019s house for a settling up of the accounts for the year 1926. Both account books shewed that there was a balance of $206.87 due to the respondent. According to the respondent\u2019s testimony the deceased asked him if he needed the money and he replied that he did not as long as he remained there. The deceased then said that he wanted to give him something; that he owed his mother something; that he had not given her anything for the last two years and only $1.50 per week at any time; that he was going to give him a note and if he did not need the money he would let it go on the note. The deceased went to an adjoining room and got a note form and gave it to the respondent to fill up, as the deceased could only write his name; that he filled it out, the deceased telling him to make it for $5,000 and to put in 5% interest. This he did, and the deceased signed it. It might here be pointed out that the respondent\u2019s mother had worked for the deceased for over forty years, and that she had died in 1926.\nThe respondent further testified that the deceased stated he wanted to keep the note for a while. To this the respondent was agreeable, and the deceased kept the note until January, 1928, when the respondent went over to settle up for the year 1927. On that occasion the question of the note was brought up and the deceased said that, as he was repairing the buildings on the place from which the respondent would obtain considerable benefit, he did not think he should pay interest on the note for that year. Whereupon the respondent indorsed on the back of the note a receipt for the payment of one year\u2019s interest. The interest had not been paid. The deceased then handed the note to the respondent and asked him not to tell anyone that he had it and not to produce it until after his (deceased\u2019s) death, and then only if there was more than enough in his estate to support Kate. The deceased also asked him if he would remain on the farm at his present wages until the deceased died. To all these requests the respondent agreed.\nThe deceased died on February 8, 1929, leaving an estate worth $50,000. Six weeks later his sister Kate died. The respondent then presented his note to the appellant who is the sole surviving executor of the deceased\u2019s estate. The appellant required strict proof of the respondent\u2019s claim. The respondent then brought this action on the note.\nThe County Court Judge, before whom the matter came, believed the story of the respondent and found that the note had been duly executed by the deceased, and delivered to the respondent as stated by him. He, however, thought that, on the respondent\u2019s own evidence, the note was not to be paid until the death of the deceased. From this he concluded that the respondent was setting up a parol agreement entirely different from that disclosed by the note on its face. Furthermore he was unable to find any corroboration of the statement of the respondent that he had given valuable consideration for the note, namely, the unpaid balance of his wages for 1926, and his promise to continue working on the farm, at his then wages, until after the death of the deceased. For these reasons he dismissed the action. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. Before this Court the burden of the argument on behalf of the appellant was that, according to the respondent\u2019s evidence, the real agreement between the parties was that the note was to be paid only after the deceased\u2019s death and then only conditionally; that this was not the agreement set out on the face of the note; that the note was, therefore, a false and misleading document, the falsity of which prevented it from being a promissory note within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act and, therefore, no presumption could arise, under section 58 of the Act, that the respondent was a holder for value.\nIn my opinion this contention cannot be upheld. What the respondent agreed to when the note was handed to him was: (a) that he would not mention to anyone the fact that he held it; (b) that he would not produce it until after the death of deceased; and (c) then only if there was in the deceased\u2019s estate more than sufficient to support his sister.\nThe deceased\u2019s reason for making the requests contained in (a) and (b) presumably was to prevent any unpleasantness with those nephews and nieces who will be entitled to the money if respondent does not succeed in establishing his claim, and to whose importunity he may have feared he would be exposed if it were known that he had benefited a stranger to the prejudice of his own blood relations. The reason for requiring (c) was a desire to make sure that his sister would not come to want.\nIt will be observed that nowhere did the deceased suggest that the note was not to be a present obligation in favour of the respondent. All he does is to request the respondent not to enforce his rights until after he himself has passed away, leaving an estate more than sufficient to support his sister. The acceptance by the respondent of these requirements amounts, as the Court of Appeal held, to no more than a collateral engagement on his part not to enforce his rights until the requests had been complied with. That does not make the document any the less an unconditional promise in writing by the deceased to pay at a fixed time a sum certain in money to the respondent. There is no ambiguity in the note itself. The respondent\u2019s agreement not to enforce payment while the deceased was living, was no part of the note, the terms of which import a present and unqualified obligation, and there is nothing in the evidence to justify the conclusion that the delivery of the note by the deceased was conditional upon the fulfilment of his requests. He was satisfied that the respondent would respect his wishes.\nWhether the agreement of the respondent not to enforce the note in the deceased\u2019s lifetime would have afforded any defence to the note had action been brought upon it before the deceased\u2019s death, we need not inquire, for, even if it would and the respondent could have been enjoined from enforcing his rights, the document was still a promissory note within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act, and, as such, it imports that valuable consideration has been given for it (section 58). This shifts to the appellant the onus of establishing want of consideration, as was pointed out by Riddell J. in Mercier v. Campbell[2]. That onus the appellant has not met. Consideration being presumed until the contrary is shewn, the deceased\u2019s obligation on the note was contractual, and not by way of testamentary gift, as the trial judge held.\nThe respondent\u2019s evidence, that the note was signed by the deceased, was abundantly corroborated by the testimony of experts in handwriting, and by Dr. MacPherson, who testified that, before his death, the deceased told him that he had seen the respondent well provided for by a note, and had divided the rest of his estate between Colin and Kate.\nIt was also argued for the appellant that if the document was a promissory note importing that it had been given for value and was thus an enforceable contract, there should be a new trial for the reason that the claim had been framed and the action had been conducted throughout on the basis that the respondent was seeking to enforce a gift and not a contractual right. There is no substance in this contention. The appellant knew, from the statement of claim and the examination for discovery of the respondent, just what the respondent was claiming and the grounds upon which he based his claim, and was not in any way taken by surprise.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McTague, Clark, Springsteen, Racine & Spencer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Shaw & Shaw.\n[1] (1981) 40 Ont.

(Ward v. Sharpe, 53 L.J. Ch. 313, at 319).\nWhere (as found by this Court) the solicitor for a loan company had benefited from a loan made by the company to B., by receiving out of the proceeds of the loan payment of certain mortgages from B. to the solicitor and certain commissions and fees in connection with said mortgages, it was held, under the circumstances of the case, that the solicitor must be held to have been guilty of a breach of duty to the company and that he was liable to it for loss suffered through the transaction.\nThe majority of the court (Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) held that the company was entitled to recover from the solicitor (with right of the solicitor to subrogation) the full amount of damages sustained (Nocton v. Lord Ashburton, [1914] A.C. 932), this being (the loan turning out to be a highly improvident one) the full amount of the loan and interest less the amount of a bonus retained by the company out of the loan and less an amount based on a reduction (for the purpose of calculating the damages) of the interest rate payable to the company under its mortgage. Cannon and Crocket JJ. were in favour of limiting, under the circumstances, the amount recoverable to the amount which the solicitor had received out of the proceeds of the loan and interest at said reduced rate (with right of the solicitor to subrogation). APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which, in respect of the matter in issue in the present appeal, reversed the judgment of Raney J.[2] Raney J. had held that the interest of the defendant by counterclaim, Brickenden, in a certain loan transaction was in conflict with his duty as solicitor for the London Loan and Savings Company of Canada, one of the plaintiffs by counterclaim, and that under the circumstances in question he was liable for loss suffered by the company in connection with the loan, and gave judgment against him for the balance owing on the mortgage given to the company to secure the loan, the mortgage to be assigned to him upon payment by him.\nThe material facts of the case, as found by this Court, for the purposes of the present judgment, are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Crocket J. now reported.\nThe appeal to this Court was allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of Raney J. restored with a variation as set out in the judgment of Smith J. (Cannon and Crocket JJ. differed from the majority of the court as to the amount recoverable, being in favour of further limiting the amount, as set out in the judgment of Crocket J.)\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and G.T. Walsh K.C. for the appellants.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and G.F. Macdonell K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014I am in agreement with what my brother Crocket has written in this case, except as to the remedy.\nI am of opinion that the appellant Loan Company should be placed as nearly as possible in the position in which the appellants would have been had there been no breach of duty on the part of Brickenden; that is, that the appellant Loan Company is entitled to the full amount of damages sustained. Nocton v. Lord Ashburton[3]. Under this case, I do not think the amount to which the appellant is entitled can be limited to the amount that the respondent received out of the transaction, but is to be measured by the amount of loss sustained by the appellant.\nI am of opinion, however, that the $1,000 bonus retained by the appellant Loan Company out of the loan, and the full 8% interest mentioned in the mortgage, are not losses sustained by the appellant Loan Company. If the transaction had not gone through, they would have received no such bonus, nor would they have been able to invest the $12,500 on proper security at 8%. Properly speaking, there should, perhaps, be a reference to ascertain the actual rate of interest that could have been earned on proper security; but, to avoid the delay and expense of such a reference, I am of opinion that justice would be done by allowing the legal rate of 5%.\nThere should, therefore, be a reference back for recalculation of the amount payable by respondents on the mortgage, by deducting the $1,000 from the principal and calculating the interest at 5%, instead of 8%.\nWith this variation, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs to the appellant of both appeals.\nThe judgment of Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCROCKET J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario setting aside a judgment of Raney J., which held the respondents liable for all moneys due upon two mortgages made by one Walter H. Biggs and his wife, of London, on November 8, 1924, in favour of the appellant, The London Loan and Savings Company, to secure a loan to Biggs amounting to $13,500.\nThere is really but one respondent, G.A.P. Brickenden, \u201cG.A.P. Brickenden & Co.,\u201d being merely a firm name under which he practised law. Notwithstanding the joinder of so many parties in the counterclaim and the numerous charges of fraud and collusion stated therein against him in conjunction with Mr. and Mrs. Biggs and George G. McCormick, his father-in-law and president of the Loan Company, in respect of two previous mortgage loans of $18,000 and $12,000 made by the Company to Biggs, as well as in respect to the later one of $13,500, this appeal concerns only his conduct as an interested solicitor in connection with the last mentioned loan, the learned trial judge having based his judgment against him on the ground that he had a personal interest in the transaction which was in clear conflict with his duty as solicitor for the Company and did not make a full disclosure of all material facts in connection therewith. He held that there was no legal claim against Brickenden in respect of the two earlier mortgages, and dismissed the counterclaim as against McCormick.\nThat Brickenden was the general solicitor of The London Loan and Savings Company and acted as solicitor for the Company as well as solicitor for Biggs in connection with the putting through of the two previous mortgage loans as well as the $13,500 loan directly in question, is not disputed. Neither is it disputed that when he sought this loan from the Company for Biggs he held four registered mortgages in his own name, as security for three loans which he had personally made to Biggs, for $5,000, $2,000 and $1,200 respectively, after the Loan Company itself had declined an application for a further loan of $8,400 in addition to its $18,000 and $12,000 loans, which mortgages covered the properties Mr. and Mrs. Biggs had previously mortgaged to the Loan Company. The $5,000 loan was secured by two mortgages dated July 13, 1923, and the $2,000 and $1,200 loans by mortgages dated respectively August 24, 1923, and January 13, 1924. The $5,000 loan was payable, under the terms of the two mortgages by which it was secured, in two years from date, and the interest quarterly, with the privilege to the mortgagors of paying the whole or any part of the principal on any interest day. The $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages provided for the re-payment of the principal moneys in monthly instalments with interest payable quarterly. All three loans bore interest at eight per cent. Brickenden admitted, in his discovery examination, having exacted a bonus or commission of $1,000 from Biggs on the $5,000 loan, $120 commission on the $2,000 loan in addition to $73.85 for fees and disbursements, and $300 on the $1,200 loan, and that he settled a claim which Mr. and Mrs. Biggs subsequently brought against him for these bonuses and commissions and other overcharges by paying them back $1,000.\nThe record also conclusively shews that when Biggs sought the $13,500 loan from the Company through Brickenden in November, 1924, he had fallen behind in his interest payments on the Company\u2019s $18,000 and $12,000 mortgages to the amount of $1,636.14, but had kept down the interest on the three Brickenden mortgages and had made all his monthly payments as they fell due on the principal of the $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages, so that these had been reduced to $800 and $600 respectively; and that, when the loan was put through, Brickenden received from its proceeds $1,993.33, in payment of the balance due on the two last mentioned mortgages and a charge he made of $500 for fees, commissions and disbursements (the disbursements amounting to but $8.85) for putting through this latest loan, while the Loan Company retained $5,000, for which it assumed his $5,000 mortgage, besides a bonus payment of $1,000, which it exacted from Biggs on the loan, and $1,636.14 in payment of the overdue interest on its $18,000 and $12,000 mortgages.\nBrickenden\u2019s position as the solicitor of both the borrower and the lender in the negotiation and completion of a mortgage loan in which he was so directly and largely interested, was one which could only be justified by the observance on his part of the utmost frankness and good faith towards both parties. That it was his imperative duty in such circumstances to fully disclose to his clients all material facts within his knowledge in relation to the transaction and treat with them upon a perfectly equal footing cannot be doubted. Moreover, it must now be taken as an established rule of law that when a solicitor acts for a client in a matter in which he is himself financially interested the onus rests upon him, if the propriety of the transaction is called in question, to shew that the negotiations were honestly conducted and that the transaction was fair and just and in no way disadvantageous to his client. This is the clear effect of the judgments in Gib- son v. Jeyes[4]; Edwards v. Meyrick[5]; McPherson v. Watt[6]; Ward v. Sharpe[7]; and In re Haslam & Hier-Evans[8]. The law for the purposes of this case is perhaps most concisely summed up in the following extract from the judgment of North, J., in Ward v. Sharpe7:\u2014\nA transaction between solicitor and client, in which the latter [former] takes a benefit, cannot be supported unless the solicitor has taken care that his client is fully acquainted with the facts and properly advised upon them; and the onus of proving this is upon the solicitor.\nAnother passage which may usefully be quoted in the present case is the following from the judgment of Lord O\u2019Hagan in McPherson v. Watt6:\u2014\nAn attorney is not affected by the absolute disability to purchase which attaches to a trustee. But, for manifest reasons, if, he becomes the buyer of his client\u2019s property he does so at his peril. He must be prepared to shew that he has acted with the completest faithfulness and fairness; that his advice has been free from all taint of self interest; that he has not misrepresented anything or concealed anything; that he has given an adequate price, and that his client has had the advantage of the best professional assistance which, if he had been engaged in a transaction with a third party, he could possibly have afforded. And, although all these conditions had been fulfilled, though there has been the fullest information, the most disinterested counsel and the fairest price, if the purchase be made covertly in the name of another without communication of the fact to the vendor, the law condemns and invalidates it utterly. There must be uberrima fides between the attorney and the client, and no conflict of duty and interest can be allowed to exist.\nNotwithstanding the grave charges made against him in the counterclaim, Brickenden refrained on the trial from even so much as attempting to vindicate his conduct in the negotiation and completion of the loan transaction, and left the case for decision upon the testimony offered in behalf of the appellants, which included portions of the evidence he had given on his examination on discovery. He left quite unsolved the mysterious fact that while the two mortgages to the Loan Company, by which the $13,500 loan was secured, were executed and acknowledged by Mr. and Mrs. Biggs on November 8, on which date he obtained from Biggs an order on the Loan Company to pay him his $1,993.33, covering the balances due on his $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages and his $491.15 bonus or commission and other charges, the application for the loan was laid over by the Board of Directors for consideration on November 11, and was not actually authorized by the Board until November 17, as shewn by the Company\u2019s minute books, during which interim, on November 12, he registered the two new mortgages to the Loan Company, and the certificates discharging his $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages and signed his certificate of title to the Loan Company before presenting for payment on November 13, his $1,993.33 order from Biggs.\nThe application for the loan is unsigned, but the record shews that there is no doubt it was made through Brickenden. It bears no date on its face, but has the following memorandum endorsed upon it:\u2014\nNov. 17, 1924. E. & W. Biggs $13,500. Wanted. Lend at 8% with bonus of $1,000. Geo. C. McC., President.\nPresumably the application was prepared before the new mortgages were executed. It stated that the money was to be applied to pay the arrears of interest on the Company\u2019s present mortgages of $18,000 and $12,000, and sundry accounts amounting to $7,500, and a second mortgage of $5,000 held by Brickenden which will mature about March, 1925, and that as security the Company would receive a new mortgage for $13,500 on the property already mortgaged to the Company.\nAlthough the properties proposed as security were stated in the application to be subject to two other mortgages than those which the Loan Company already held, one by Ed. Barrell for $7,000 and the other by Huron and Erie for $10,000, no mention was made therein of either the Brickenden $2,000 or $1,200 mortgages, which were not discharged on the records until November 12, or of the fact that any portion of the proceeds of the loan was to be applied towards paying off the amounts due Brickenden upon them, though it is stated that $5,000 of the loan money is to be applied to the payment of the $5,000 mortgage. No mention is made either of the fact that Biggs was to be required to pay Brickenden $500 for fees, commissions and disbursements in addition to the $1,000 bonus he promised to pay the Company.\nThe result of the transaction, so far as Brickenden is concerned, was that he got his $5,000 mortgage loan, and the balances due on two subsequent mortgages paid off by the London Loan & Savings Company, besides receiving a bonus or commission of $491.15 and legal fees from the proceeds of the loan\u2014a total of $6,993.33. The Loan Com- pany received a bonus of $1,000 and $1,636.14 overdue interest on its $18,000 and $12,000 mortgages, leaving $3,870.53 for Biggs with which to pay the \u201csundry accounts amounting to $7,500\u201d mentioned in the application. Apparently the \u201csundry accounts\u201d covered not only the balance of Biggs\u2019 mortgage indebtedness to Brickenden but his bonus and commission as well.\nBrickenden\u2019s certificate of title was dated, as already stated, on November 12, the day on which his $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages were discharged before his order of November 8 for $1,993.33 had been accepted by the Company, and made no mention of these two mortgages, though it set out nine different mortgages, which were on that date outstanding against different parcels of the lands comprised in the new mortgages to the Loan Company, amounting in all to $61,300, including his own $5,000 mortgage, numbered the ninth, and which last mortgage he stated in the certificate the London Loan was assuming. To his certificate of title he added a note to the Loan Company, stating that all the mortgages listed were to be removed except the Barrell and Huron & Erie mortgages for $7,000 and $10,000 respectively, and the Loan Company\u2019s $18,000 and $12,000 mortgages. If all other mortgages than those indicated were removed, there would still remain on the mortgaged premises five mortgages for a total of $47,000, to which the Company was to add two more to secure the new loan of $13,500, making a grand total of $60,500.\nIt is perfectly obvious that the intention from the beginning was that Brickenden was not only to unload his $5,000 mortgages upon the Loan Company, but that he was to be paid the balances of principal and interest due on his two subsequent mortgages out of the proceeds of the proposed loan, as well as his exorbitant commission money. Brickenden has not testified that he advised the manager of the Loan Company or any of its directors or officers of this fact, which was surely a very material fact, having regard to the much encumbered state of the title of the properties of Mr. and Mrs. Biggs. On the contrary, the application itself would seem to have concealed both these material facts by the statement that $7,500 of the proceeds of the loan was to be applied to the payment of \u201csundry accounts.\u201d This statement the record shews was untrue. Why did the application not mention the $2,000 and $1,200 Brickenden mortgages as well as the $5,000 mortgage? Why was it that the application was laid over at the Directors\u2019 meeting on November 11, and the certificate of title held back till November 12\u2014four days after the execution of the new mortgages, and until Brickenden discharged his third and fourth mortgages, before presenting his order from Biggs for $1,993.33 to the Company\u2019s manager for payment? Brickenden has chosen not to explain any of these things and must be held to have been guilty of a breach of duty to his client, the London Loan and Savings Company.\nIt is quite apparent that Brickenden must have obtained the consent of the managing director (Kent) to put the loan through, cash his $1,993.33 order from Biggs and arrange for the Company\u2019s assumption of his $5,000 mortgages, without waiting for the authorization of the Board of Directors. How he did so is left entirely to conjecture. Unfortunately Kent passed away before the trial of the action and Brickenden vouchsafes no information. The consent of the managing director does not help him unless it is shewn that it was obtained upon full disclosure of all material facts and this is not shewn. Kent himself may or may not have been influenced to violate his own duty to the Company, and it may be that, but for a breach of duty on his part and on the part of other directors and officers of the Company, the loan would not have been made. The learned trial judge has found that at the time of the loan there was no equity in the mortgaged properties above the prior mortgages, not including Brickenden\u2019s $5,000 mortgages. I take this to mean he held the new mortgages to be worthless, which would surely point to a marked laxity and dereliction of duty on the part of the managing director and other officers of the Company, for the record shews that the managing director was advised by Brickenden\u2019s certificate of title before the completion of the loan of the prior mortgages, including the Brickenden $5,000 mortgages, though not of his $2,000 and $1,200 mortgages. While it may for this reason well be said that Brickenden was not wholly responsible for the unfortunate transaction, he cannot invoke the connivance or dereliction of others as an excuse for his own breach of duty. It only renders his own breach of duty the more indefensible. He assuredly ought not to be allowed in such circumstances to excuse himself on the ground that the managing director or any other director or officer of the Company with whom he negotiated ought not in any event to have accepted his proposal.\nThat the transaction was highly improvident and one which was fraught with disaster to both Biggs and the Loan Company, and advantageous only to himself, is perfectly obvious from the documentary evidence concerning the transaction itself and the subsequent history of the mortgages and the Loan Company. The Loan Company was obliged by the Provincial Government Inspector to clear off its first two mortgages for $18,000 and $12,000, and it did so by arranging in December, 1927, with the Consolidated Trusts Corporation, of which McCormick and Brickenden were also president and solicitor respectively, to make a new loan to Biggs to the amount of $33,600 on two fresh mortgages at six and one-half per cent. on the same properties, for $20,000 and $13,600, of which $33,542.26 was paid to the London Loan for the amounts then due it for principal and interest, and by itself guaranteeing the new loans and giving additional security. The $13,500 mortgages the London Loan retained until it assigned all its remaining assets to the Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation on July 3, 1929. On November 1 of the latter year the total indebtedness of Mr. and Mrs. Biggs on these three mortgage loans was found by the local master, to whom the mortgage accounts were referred for investigation, to amount to $56,887.23.\nOn November 6, 1929, the Consolidated Trusts Corporation transferred all its assets to the Canada Trust Company, this transfer covering the $20,000 and the $13,600 Biggs mortgages above referred to, as replacing the original $18,000 and $12,000 Biggs mortgages, guaranteed by the Loan Company as aforesaid. Both these corporations were joined with the London Loan and Savings Company as co-plaintiffs in the counter-claim, together with the Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation and the London Loan Assets Limited. The last mentioned company was incorporated under the provisions of the Ontario Loan and Trust Corporations Act for the particular purpose of carrying out the terms of an agreement which was entered into on July 3, 1929, between the London Loan and Savings Company, the Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation and the newly created company, for the liquidation of the affairs of the London Loan and Savings Company, and which provided for the transfer of all its assets, first, to the mortgage corporation and then to the new company, including all rights of action which were capable of assignment.\nThere can be no doubt of Brickenden\u2019s breach of duty to the London Loan and Savings Company or that the Company suffered a serious loss in consequence thereof.\nThe difficulty is to determine the amount of that loss which is fairly attributable to him. Having regard to the subsequent transfer of these two $13,500 mortgages, together with all the Company\u2019s other assignable assets, to the Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation and the London Loan Assets Limited, for the liquidation of its indebtedness, under the agreement of July 3, 1929, and to the large increase of the mortgage indebtedness which the accumulation of the mortgagors\u2019 interest, taxes and other arrearages have since produced while these mortgages have remained in the hands of the assignees unrealized and presumably unrealizable, I cannot satisfy myself that Brickenden can justly be charged with all of these arrearages as the learned trial judge has decreed.I am satisfied that he should not be charged with the $1,000 which the Loan Company withheld out of the proceeds of the loan in payment of its bonus charge, nor, in the circumstances, with the $1,636.14, which it also withheld to pay itself the arrears of interest on its two prior Biggs mortgages. The latter amount cannot, in my opinion, fairly be said to have been lost to the Company as a result of the loan.\nThat Brickenden, on the other hand, ought not in the circumstances to be allowed to retain any of the benefits which he personally derived from the transaction and should indemnify the Loan Company to this extent at least is clear to my mind. As already stated, he received $6,993.33 of the proceeds of the loan, including the $5,000 for the first two of his four Biggs mortgages. It is true that he cannot now be restored precisely to his former position in respect of these mortgages, but these were in effect all merged in the larger $13,500 mortgages, which, it must be taken, the Loan Company was induced by his breach of duty to accept, and which, it is clear from the Master\u2019s report and the evidence throughout, were practically worthless as a security for the moneys advanced.\nWhile in strictness of law the right of action for damages resulting from Brickenden\u2019s breach of duty lay in the London Loan and Savings Company and did not pass to its assignees under the agreement of July 3, 1929, the worthless mortgages did pass, with all other assignable assets of that Company, but only for the purpose of liquidation in the Company\u2019s interest. The Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation and the London Loan Assets Limited are both parties to the counter-claim and before the Court on this appeal, and I can see no objection to treating the moneys which improperly came into Brickenden\u2019s hands out of the proceeds of the loan for his own use and benefit as moneys of the London Loan and Savings Company, for which he is still liable to account to that Company or to its assignees under the agreement referred to, or in subrogating him, to the rights of that Company or its assignees under these mortgages to the extent of the moneys he may be required to pay back. One or other of the corporations named is entitled to the fruits of the action, and, having regard to the terms of the assignment, it makes no difference in the result which of them actually receives the money. In the end it goes to the London Loan and Savings Company or to the London Loan Assets Limited for its benefit.\nIn my opinion, the ends of justice would, in the circumstances, best be served by a decree requiring Brickenden to restore to the London Loan and Savings Company or to the Huron & Erie Mortgage Corporation or the London Loan Assets Limited the $6,993.33, which he improperly received out of the proceeds of the loan, together with interest at the statutory rate from November 12, 1924, the date of the completion of the loan, until judgment, and declaring that upon payment of the said sum and interest, he shall be subrogated to that extent to the rights of the London Loan and Savings Company or its assignees under the said mortgages. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge varied as here indicated, costs throughout to be paid by the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and judgment of trial judge restored with variation as set out in judgment of Smith J.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Braden & McAlister.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Slaght & Cowan.\n[1] (1932) 41 Ont.

Williams contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014We have to give our opinions in answer to certain Interrogatories addressed to us by His Excellency the Governor General in Council. They are as follows:\u2014\n1. Is it competent to the Governor General in the exercise of His Majesty\u2019s royal prerogative of mercy, to release from prison without his consent a convict undergoing sentence for a criminal offence (a) conditionally, (b) unconditionally?\n2. Would a convict so released, whether with or without his consent, be deemed to have \u201cendured the punishment adjudged,\u201d within the meaning of section 1078 of the Criminal Code?\n3. Would the sentence or term of imprisonment of a convict so released be deemed to have expired, within the meaning of section 43 of the Immigration Act, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, chapter 93?\n4. If such a convict be other than a Canadian citizen, and be, by reason of having been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, subject to be deported under the provisions of section 42 of the Immigration Act, would he cease to be so subject\n(1) upon serving his sentence in full,\n(2) upon release from prison in the exercise of the royal prerogative prior to the expiration of his sentence (a) conditionally, (b) unconditionally? These Interrogatories, speaking broadly, concern the effect of the release of a convict from prison who is undergoing a sentence for a criminal offence by an act of clemency in exercise of the royal prerogative. We will first say a word about the legal character of such a release.\nThe terms of Art. 5 of the Instructions to His Excellency suggest that all remissions, total or partial, of penalties, other than pecuniary penalties or forfeitures of property, take effect as \u201cfree\u201d pardons or pardons \u201csubject to lawful conditions.\u201d It has been more than once held in the United States that an unconditional release from prison (unconditional, that is to say, in the sense of being subject to no express condition) by the President of the United States in exercise of the pardoning power with which he is invested under the constitution necessarily implies a \u201cfree\u201d pardon of the offence. (For example, Hoffman v. Coster[1]; Jones v. Harris[2].\nOn the other hand, there is the great authority of Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown that the act of clemency may be limited to pardoning the \u201cexecution.\u201d \u201cIt hath been clearly adjudged,\u201d it is said (Book 2, ch. 37, s. 12), \u201cthat the King may, if he think fit, pardon the execution, and no more.\u201d In this view it would appear that the effect (as regards the offence) of the unconditional remission of the punishment, or of a conditional remission where the condition has been performed, is a question of intention; and it is upon this assumption that the practice in Canada has proceeded. A release from prison, pursuant to a valid act of clemency, necessarily involves a remission, total or partial, of the punishment awarded, but we see no reason to think that the assumption alluded to above on which the Canadian practice has been based is not well grounded.\nThe Interrogatories speak of releases which are conditional and releases which are unconditional. In the case of a conditional release, the condition may be of such a character as to involve the voluntary act of the convict himself. In other words, such that the performance of it can only be effected with the consent of the convict. We assume from the course of the argument before us that the real purpose of the Interrogatories is to elicit the opinion of the court as to the effect, in respect of the matters set forth therein, of a release from prison of a convict before the expiration of the term of imprisonment imposed by his sentence in pursuance of a valid exercise of the royal prerogative; and it would serve no useful purpose in these circumstances to explore the various hypotheses suggested by the term \u201cconditional release\u201d; and we beg the leave of Your Excellency to limit our answers accordingly.\nInterrogatory numbered one we shall treat as addressed to the question whether or not the act of clemency in releasing a convict from prison prior to the completion of the term of his sentence may be valid and effective in law without the consent of the convict. The answer to the interrogatory so put is in the affirmative.\nThe contention that a free pardon of a convict takes effect, as in the case of a private gift, only upon acceptance by the grantee has been based upon passages in books of authority which seem to say that a free pardon can be waived by the grantee, e.g., in 2 Hawkins P.C., ch. 37, ss. 58-9:\nAs to the third general paint, viz. Whether a pardon may be waived.\n58. I take it to be agreed, that a general pardon by parliament cannot be waived, because no one by his admittance can give a court a power to proceed against him, when it appears there is no law to punish him.\n59. But it is certain, that a man may waive the benefit of a pardon under the great seal; as where one who has such a pardon doth not plead it, but takes the general issue, after which he shall not resort to the pardon.\nWe think the passages in the books in which it is laid down that a pardon can be waived, strictly turn upon the necessities of pleading, and that a doctrine more consonant with the true nature of the King\u2019s prerogative is set forth in a decision of the reign of Edward IV, reported in Jenkins, 145 Eng. R., No. 62, p. 90. The report is in a paragraph and is in these words:\nIf the King pardons a felon, and it is shewn to the court; and yet the felon pleads not guilty, and waives the pardon, he shall not be hanged; for it is the King\u2019s will that he shall not; and the King has an interest in the life of his subject. The books to the contrary are to be understood, where the charter of pardon is not shewn to the court.\nThe nature of prerogative is, in our opinion, rightly set forth by Mr. Dicey at p. 420 of his Law of the Constitution (8th ed.):\nThe \u201cprerogative\u201d appears to be both historically and as a matter of actual fact nothing else than the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority, which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the Crown. The King was originally in truth what he still is in name, \u201cthe sovereign,\u201d or, if not strictly the \u201csovereign\u201d in the sense in which jurists use that word, at any rate by far the most powerful part of the sovereign power.\nBy the terms of the Instructions to His Excellency he is directed, before pardoning or reprieving an offender, to receive first, in capital cases, the advice of the Privy Council, and in other cases, of one at least of his Ministers; and in modern times all such advice is, of course, given subject to the accountability of the Council or the Ministers to the House of, Commons. A sentence in the judgment of Holmes J., speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States in Biddle v. Perovich[3] applies equally to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in Canada. A pardon, said that most learned and eminent judge,\nis a part of the Constitutional scheme. When granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed.\nWe think it is not consistent with this view of the nature of the prerogative in question to regard an unconditional pardon as in the same category, in point of law, as an act of benevolence proceeding from a private person.\nWe do not think the authorities require us to hold that an unconditional pardon of an offence can take effect only upon acceptance by the grantee; and that, for example, a convict under the capital sentence can, in point of law, insist on being hanged, so that the only escape from such a result is by statute or by a colourable and unconstitutional exercise of the prerogative in granting successive reprieves.\nIt has been suggested that partial remissions of punishment can validly take effect only as conditional pardons. This view was advanced by Mr. Taney, Attorney-General (afterwards Chief Justice) of the United States, in his very able argument in United States v. Wilson[4]. But, although the learning on the subject of pardon seems to have been very diligently collected for the purposes of the argument in that case, no authority was adduced in support of this proposition; and we have found none.\nMoreover, the statements in the books to the effect that a conditional pardon is operative only with the consent of the grantee are illustrated by references to cases in which the condition is in the nature of a substituted punishment. At common law, the King cannot commute the sentence of the court by the substitution of another and different penalty, because he has no power at common law to compel the convict, against his will, to submit to a punishment which has not been imposed upon him by a court of law. (See the opinion of Sir A. E. Cockburn and Sir Richard Bethell, May 3d, 1854, Forsyth, 462,3.) Obviously, in the simple case of a partial remission, which is, in terms, unconditional, the convict is not subjected to any penalty or punishment beyond that which the sentence of the court has awarded against him. We do not pursue the discussion further.\n\u201cSo far as a pardon legitimately cuts down a penalty,\u201d said Holmes J. in the judgment[5] already quoted in part,\nit affects the judgment imposing it. No one doubts that a reduction of the term of an imprisonment or the amount of \u00e0 fine would limit the sentence effectively on the one side and on the other would leave the reduced term or fine valid and to be enforced, and that the convict\u2019s consent is not required.\nWe think this is indisputable.\nAs to the second Interrogatory, we think it is clear that the phrase \u201cpunishment adjudged\u201d in s. 1078 of the Criminal Code does not describe a punishment reduced by an act of the royal clemency but is intended to designate the punishment nominated by the original sentence.\nFor the purpose of considering the questions raised by the Interrogatories numbered 3 and 4, it will be necessary to refer briefly to the enactments of the Immigration Act.\nBy s. 40 (R.S.C., 1927, ch. 93) provision is made for complaint to the Minister of Immigration of the presence in Canada of persons of specified descriptions (\u201cother than a Canadian citizen or person having Canadian domicile\u201d) by \u201cany officer cognizant thereof\u201d and by \u201cthe clerk, secretary or other official of any municipality in Canada wherein such person may be.\u201d Such classes of persons include (inter alia) the inmates and managers of houses of prostitution, persons practising or sharing in the earnings of prostitution, persons importing or attempting to import any person for the purpose of prostitution or other immoral purpose, and any person who \u201centers or remains in Canada contrary to any provision of this Act,\u201d and any person \u201cwho has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada,\u201d or who \u201chas become an inmate of a penitentiary, gaol, reformatory, prison.\u201d\nSection 42 empowers the Minister of Immigration or his Deputy to order any person, in respect of whom a complaint has been received alleging such person to belong to \u201cany prohibited or undesirable class,\u201d to be taken into custody and detained for an investigation of the facts alleged in the complaint by a Board of Inquiry. By the same section, if the Board is satisfied that such person belongs to \u201cany of the prohibited or undesirable classes\u201d mentioned in ss. 40 and 41, such person \u201cshall be\u201d deported forthwith, subject to a right of appeal to the Minister.\nIt seems to be clear that any one of the classes of persons in respect of whom it is the duty of the proper official \u201cto send a written complaint to the Minister\u201d pursuant to the provisions of s. 40 is a \u201cprohibited or undesirable\u201d class within the meaning of s. 42. Ex facie, therefore, a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada, and a person who is an inmate of a penitentiary, jail, reformatory or prison in Canada and in respect of whom \u201ca written complaint\u201d has been \u201csent\u201d to the Minister pursuant to s. 40, is a person in relation to whom the powers of the Minister and Deputy Minister, under the first subsection of s. 42, may be exercised. That is to say, such person may be placed in custody and detained for an investigation of the facts alleged in the complaint against him. Furthermore, as observed above, if the allegations are established to the satisfaction of the investigating tribunal the statute directs that, subject to an appeal to the Miniser, such person shall be deported.\nS. 43 is in these terms:\nWhenever any person other than a Canadian citizen, or a person having Canadian domicile, has become an inmate of a penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, the Minister of Justice may, upon the request of the Minister of Immigration and Colonization, issue an order to the warden or governor of such penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, which order may be in the form F in the schedule to this Act, commanding him after the sentence or term of imprisonment of such person has expired to detain such person for, and deliver him to, the officer named in the warrant issued by the Deputy Minister, which warrant may be in the form G in the schedule to this Act, with a view to the deportation of such person.\n2. Such order of the Minister of Justice shall be sufficient authority to the warden or governor of the penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, as the case may be, to detain and deliver such person to the officer named in the warrant of the Deputy Minister as aforesaid, and such warden or governor shall obey such order, and such warrant of the Deputy Minister shall be sufficient authority to the officer named therein to detain such person in his custody, or in custody at any immigrant station, until such person is delivered to the authorized agent of the transportation company which brought such person into Canada, with a view to deportation as herein provided.\nThis section, it will be noticed, deals specifically with the procedure applicable where the person to be deported is an inmate of a penitentiary, jail, reformatory or prison. In such case the Minister of Justice is, in a word, authorized, upon the request of the Minister of Immigration, to direct the warden or governor of the place of detention to detain the inmate after \u201cthe sentence or term of imprisonment of such person has expired,\u201d and to deliver such person to the officer named in a warrant issued by the Deputy Minister of Immigration with a view to deportation.\nAs to Interrogatory No. 3, it appears to us that, according to a natural reading of the words, the phrase \u201csentence or term of imprisonment,\u201d in s. 43, is intended to embrace both the case where the convict has undergone the full term of imprisonment imposed by the sentence and the case where the term of imprisonment imposed has been reduced by the operation of some general statutory provision or by a valid act of clemency. In this view the order of the Minister of Justice under s. 43, in form F, may, where the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentence has been brought to an end by an act of clemency, authorize the detention of the person to whom the order relates by the warden or governor and delivery of him to the officer named in the warrant.\nThe answer to Interrogatory No. 3, ought, therefore, to be in the affirmative.\nThe question to which Interrogatory No. 4 is directed is whether or not a convict, after serving his sentence in full, or upon his release prior to the expiry of his sentence under a conditional or unconditional act of clemency in exercise of the royal prerogative, becomes removed from the category of persons belonging to that one of the \u201cprohibited or undesirable classes\u201d mentioned in ss. 40 and 41 which is defined by the words \u201cany person who has been convicted of a criminal offence in Canada.\u201d\nThe neat point is whether the service of the term of the sentence, or the release pursuant to the exercise of the royal clemency, has the effect of making inappropriate to such person the description found in the words quoted from s. 40. In examining this question, three sections of the Criminal Code are material,\u2014ss. 1076, 1078 and 1080, the relevant parts of which it will be convenient to reproduce textually:\n1076. The Crown may extend the royal mercy to any person sentenced to imprisonment by virtue of any statute, although such person is imprisoned for non-payment of money to some other person than the Crown.\n2. Whenever the Crown is pleased to extend the royal mercy to any offender convicted of an indictable offence punishable with death or otherwise, and grants to such offender either a free or conditional pardon, by warrant under the royal sign manual, countersigned by one of the principal Secretaries of State, or by warrant under the hand and seal-at-arms of the Governor General, the discharge of such offender out of custody, in case of a free pardon, and the performance of the condition in the case of a conditional pardon, shall, as to the offence of which he has been convicted, have the same effect as a pardon of such offender under the great seal.\n1078. When any offender has been convicted of an offence not punishable with death, and has endured the punishment adjudged, or has been convicted of an offence punishable with death and the sentence of death has been commuted, and the offender has endured the punishment to which his sentence was commuted, the punishment so endured shall, as to the offence whereof the offender was so convicted, have the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal.\n1080. Nothing in this Part shall in any manner limit or affect His Majesty\u2019s royal prerogative of mercy.\nWhere the convict has served his sentence in full he falls within s. 1078 as a person who \u201chas endured the punishment adjudged\u201d and it follows, therefore, that the \u201cpunishment so endured\u201d has, \u201cas to the offence whereof the offender was * * * convicted * * * the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal.\u201d\nWhere the convict has been released by an unconditional act of clemency, or by a conditional one in respect of which the condition has been performed, it is argued that, here again, this has, as to the offence in respect of which the conviction was obtained, \u201cthe same effect as a pardon\u201d of the offender \u201cunder the great seal.\u201d\nIt may be conceded, for the purpose only of simplifying the immediate discussion, that the release from custody involves a free pardon or a conditional pardon (the condition of which has been purged) within the meaning of s. 1076; so that the precise point to which we are to address ourselves is whether or not a pardon under the great seal of a person convicted of a criminal offence within the meaning of s. 40 has the effect of exempting such person from the provisions of ss. 42 and 43.\nA pardon under the great seal\nif general in its purport and sufficient in other respects, obliterates e very stain which the law attached to the offender. Generally speaking, its puts him in the same situation as that in which he stood before he committed the pardoned offence; and frees him from the penalties and forfeitures to which the law subjected his person and property. (Chitty, Prerogatives 3. of the Crown, p. 102);\ntakes away poenam et culpam; (2 Hale P.C. 278);\ndoes so far clear the party from the infamy and all other consequences of his crime, that he may not only have an action for a scandal in calling him traitor or felon after the time of the pardon, but may also be a good witness * * * (2 Hawkins P.C., s. 48).\nThe question before us is, in truth, a question of statutory construction. We have to consider whether, having regard to the scope and purpose of the Immigration Act, the literal meaning of the words in s. 40 is displaced by force of the rule of law that a pardon under the great seal wipes out the offence of the grantee in the sense conveyed in the passages quoted.\nIt is, perhaps, almost unnecessary to observe that the group of sections under consideration is not concerned with the penal consequences of the acts of individuals. They are designed to afford to this country some protection against the presence here of classes of aliens who are referred to in the statute as \u201cundesirable.\u201d The broad conception upon which they are based is indicated by the summary already given of the enactments of s. 40. Persons convicted of crime in this country, persons who are inmates of prisons in this country, are classed with persons who are inmates of asylums for the insane, with persons implicated in the trade of prostitution, with persons known to have been convicted elsewhere of offences involving moral turpitude, with persons who are remaining in this country in defiance of the prohibitions of the Immigration Act.\nMoreover, the results which follow from proceedings under s. 42 are not attached to the criminal offence as a legal consequence following de jure upon conviction for the offence or imposable therefor at the discretion of a judicial tribunal. They follow, if they follow at all, as the result of an administrative proceeding initiated at the discretion of the Minister at the head of the Department of Immigration. The terms of s. 43, it should be observed, are general. They apply to every person, other than a Canadian citizen or a person having a Canadian domicile, who has become an inmate of any of the institutions mentioned. The authority given to the Minister of Justice, according to the ordinary meaning of the language employed, is exercisable where the inmate is incarcerated pursuant to a sentence under a conviction for a criminal offence within the meaning of s. 40. If this be the effect of s. 43, then that section contemplates the operation of s. 42 by an order for deportation founded on a conviction for a criminal offence in Canada which is to take effect after the expiration of the sentence or term of imprisonment resulting from such conviction has been fully endured or, in the view already expressed as to the meaning of the words \u201csentence or term of imprisonment,\u201d after such term of imprisonment has been terminated pursuant to an act of clemency.\nThere is nothing in the language of the statute, or in the object or purpose of the statute, inconsistent with this view of s. 43. Any other view, indeed, would greatly restrict the scope of the section, leaving it operative only in a probably not very numerous class of cases where the convict, while serving a sentence of imprisonment for one criminal offence, has standing against him a conviction for another offence in respect of which he has neither endured the punishment adjudged nor been lawfully relieved from that punishment.\nThis view of section 43 is, of course, inconsistent with the contention that a conviction in respect of which the punishment has been endured or remitted by an act of clemency cannot be a foundation for proceedings under s. 42.\nAs to the effect of s. 40, some authorities were cited which we proceed to discuss. The first is The Queen v. Vine[6]. In that case it was held that a person who had been convicted of felony and had served his sentence was disqualified from holding a licence for the selling of spirits under a statute which disqualified \u201cevery person convicted of felony.\u201d The statute of 9 Geo. IV (s. 1078, Cr. C.) was not referred to, but it is difficult indeed to suppose that the statute could have escaped the attention both of Mr. Poland, who acted as counsel for the applicant, and of the court. The point especially discussed was whether or not the disqualification applied to persons convicted before the Act was passed. That was held to be so upon the explicit ground that the disqualification was not penal in its nature but was intended to protect the public from having persons of doubtful character engaged in the sale of spirits by retail.\nIn a subsequent case, Hays v. Justices of the Tower[7], a closely similar question arose. There, the applicant for a licence had been convicted of a felony. He had served part of his sentence and then received a \u201cfree pardon\u201d under Her Majesty\u2019s sign manual. It was held that the statutory disqualification was inoperative by force of 7-8 Geo. IV, c. 28, s. 13, the parent enactment of s. 1076, by which a pardon under the royal sign manual has \u201cthe effect of a pardon under the great seal.\u201d\nHawkins, J., who with Pollock, B., constituted the Divisional Court before which the appeal was heard, treats the disqualification (in contradiction to the view of the court in Regina v. Vine[8]) as one of the penal consequences of the conviction and bases his judgment principally on the reason that the legislature could not have intended to impose disqualification in the case of a pardon granted upon the ground that the conviction was wrongful.\nNeither of the learned judges disagrees with the decision in Regina v. Vine8. Indeed, Hawkins J. emphatically concurs with it, and, with regard to both these licensing decisions, it should be observed that the point is considered as entirely a question of the proper construction of the licensing statute. The enactment imposing the disqualification in question there differed radically from the enactment now under consideration. In that case the disqualification took effect ipso jure. Here, as already observed, the existence of the conviction marks the convict as belonging to a class of persons in respect of whom the Minister of Immigration has a discretion to institute proceedings under s. 42. The legislature could hardly have conceived the possibility of such proceedings being instituted pursuant to such a conviction if there had been a pardon in consequence of established innocence. The other case is Leyman v. Latimer[9], in which the passages cited above from Chitty, Hale and Hawkins were given effect to by holding that a person convicted of felony, after enduring the punishment, is, in law, no longer a \u201cfelon,\u201d by force of 9 Geo. IV, c. 32, s. 3, which is in substance re-enacted in s. 1078 of the Criminal Code.\nThe action was for libel, the alleged libel being in the description of the plaintiff, the editor of a newspaper, as a \u201cfelon editor.\u201d To the defendant\u2019s allegation, in justification, that the plaintiff had been convicted and sentenced to twelve months\u2019 hard labour, the plaintiff replied that, after his conviction, he underwent his twelve months\u2019 imprisonment and so \u201cbecame as clear from the crime and its consequences as if he had received the Queen\u2019s pardon under the great seal.\u201d The case was, for convenience, tried before Lord Blackburn (then Mr. Justice Blackburn) sitting as judge without a jury, and his decision was expressed in this sentence (p. 22):\nI think that the statement in the newspaper means that he was convicted, and is literally true, and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover damages.\nIn the Divisional Court, Cleasby and Pollock BB. held that, in contemplation of law, the plaintiff was not at the time of the libel a \u201cfelon\u201d and that, therefore, the allegations in the defence were no justification. But they considered it would have been a different matter if the libeller had simply declared he has been convicted of felony. The judgment reads (p. 21):\nIt would have been a different matter if the defendant had written of the plaintiff that he had formerly committed a felony or been convicted of felony. That would have been strictly true, and could have been justified, although the fact of the sentence having been suffered was withheld.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Bramwell, L.J., agreed with Lord Blackburn that the defendant had a valid justification in respect of the phrase \u201cconvicted felon\u201d because it was literally true. Brett, L.J., and Cotton, L.J., disagreed upon the point of the construction of the words, holding that the question was one of fact for the jury, but Brett, L.J., is plainly in agreement with the two other distinguished common law judges in holding that, if Lord Blackburn\u2018s interpretation of the words were correct, the fact of the conviction was a sufficient justification. These three eminent judges are plainly in agreement with the view that, prima facie, the service of a sentence under a conviction for felony does not, by force of the statute of 9 Geo. IV, take the person convicted out of the category of persons who have been convicted of felony although, in point of law, it does remove him from the category of \u201cfelon.\u201d\nThe judgments in that case are useful in illuminating the points now before us. They seem to establish conclusively, if authority be needed for that purpose, that neither s. 1076 nor s. 1078 of the Criminal Code in declaring in the one case that a free or conditional pardon under the sign manual, and, in the other case, that the \u201cenduring of the punishment adjudged,\u201d shall have the like effect and consequence as a pardon under the great seal, lays down a rigorous rule of construction which requires us to restrict the words of s. 40 by excluding from their scope cases where the punishment adjudged has been endured or where it has been remitted through an exercise of the royal clemency. Effect was given to this view by our brother Smith in his judgment in Marion v. Campbell[10].\nAdverting to the consideration that the question before us is a question of the proper meaning of the language of s. 40, it seems to us, in view of the fact that the liability to proceedings under s. 42 is not contemplated by the statute as one of the penal consequences of a conviction for a criminal offence, that this liability is not attached de jure to the fact of conviction but is placed by the statute under the control of an administrative discretion, and in view of the unrestricted language of s. 43, there is no admissible ground for a construction effecting such an exclusion.\nThe answer, therefore, to the first branch of the Interrogatory numbered four is in the negative; and to the second branch, remodelled so as to read:\n(2) upon release from prison under a valid exercise of the royal prerogative prior to the expiration of his sentence?\nin the negative also. The Court unanimously answered the questions as follows:\n\u201cWe interpret the interrogatory numbered one as presenting the question whether or not the act of clemency in releasing a convict from prison prior to the completion of the term of his sentence may be valid and effective in law without the consent of the convict.\n\u201cThe answer to the question so framed is in the affirmative.\n\u201cThe answer to the interrogatory numbered two is in the negative.\n\u201cThe answer to the interrogatory numbered three is in the affirmative.\n\u201cThe second branch of the interrogatory numbered four we read as presenting case (2) in these terms,\n\u201c(2) Upon release from prison under a valid exercise of the royal prerogative prior to the expiration of his sentence?\n\u201cUpon this reading, the interrogatory, in both branches, is answered in the negative.\u201d\n[1] (1837) 2 Whar. 453.\n[2] (1846) 1 Strob. 160.\n[3] (1927) 274 U.S. 480, at 486.\n[4] (1833) 7 Peters 150, at 155-8.\n[5] Biddle v.

Voici en quels termes le transport est exprim\u00e9 dans l\u2019article I de l\u2019acte:\nArticle I. The donor, subject to the conditions hereinafter expressed, hath by these presents given as a donation inter vivos and irrevocable unto the trustees thereof accepting the following property, namely: three million dollars face value of the twenty-year-six-per-cent notes of Sir Mortimer Davis Incorporated.\nWhich said property so donated and any property which may take the place thereof is hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \u201ctrust property.\u201d\nWhich said trust property the trustees acknowledge to have received and undertake to hold the same in trust for the purposes and on the conditions and for the benefit of the persons as herein expressed.\nL\u2019acte stipule que les \u201ctrustees\u201d devront payer au donateur sa vie durant les revenus annuels nets provenant de la \u201ctrust property\u201d; et que, apr\u00e8s la mort du donateur, ces revenus seront pay\u00e9s, sous forme de rente annuelle viag\u00e8re, \u00e0 trois personnes: Lady Henriette Marie Meyer Davis, \u00e9pouse du donateur; Mortimer B. Davis (fils du donateur); et Philippe Meyer Davis (fils adoptif du donateur). Ce dernier est le demandeur en la pr\u00e9sente cause; et il convient de reproduire la clause qui le concerne:\nThe trustees shall pay the revenues derivable from the trust property as follows:\n(4) To the donor\u2019s adopted son Philip Meyer Davis an annuity during his lifetime at the rate of three thousand dollars per annum until he reaches the age of twenty-one years; and after he reaches the age of twenty-one years and until he reaches the age of twenty-five years the annual sum of five thousand dollars; and after he reaches the age of twenty-five years the sum of ten thousand dollars per annum. After his death the annuity which he would Have received had he been alive shall continue in favour of his widow so long as she remains such and after her death or remarriage shall be paid in equal shares to his lawful children, the lawful issue of any predeceased child to take the parent\u2019s place and share, but such annuity shall in any event cease on the death of the last surviving child of the said Philip Meyer Davis in the first degree.\nApr\u00e8s avoir ainsi pourvu \u00e0 l\u2019emploi des revenus, l\u2019acte stipule que\nsubject to the terms, provisoes and substitutions hereinbefore and hereinafter contained, the capital of the trust property and any accumulated revenues are hereby bequeathed to the son of the donor, the said Mortimer B. Davis.\nMais ce capital est l\u2019objet de toute une s\u00e9rie de dispositions. Il est pourvu qu\u2019il demeurera\nabsolutely vested in the hands of the trustees for a period of at least fifty years from the date of the death of the donor and during that period no beneficiary shall be entitled to demand any partition thereof.\nDiscr\u00e9tion absolue et sans contr\u00f4le est cependant attribu\u00e9e aux \u201ctrustees\u201d de proc\u00e9der au partage partiel ou total de la \u201ctrust property\u201d avant l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de cinquante ans, s\u2019ils le jugent \u00e0 propos.\nLes revenus qui ne seront pas requis pour pourvoir aux rentes pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019acte doivent s\u2019accumuler et \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s au capital. Apr\u00e8s avoir atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de trente ans, le fils, Mortimer B. Davis, aura droit aux revenus annuels nets de la \u201ctrust property\u201d, d\u00e9duction faite des rentes stipul\u00e9es en faveur de Lady Henriette Marie Meyer Davis et de Philippe Meyer Davis.\nA la mort du fils, Mortimer B. Davis, le capital devient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ses enfants l\u00e9gitimes, \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales par souches, puis il va aux enfants de ses enfants. Cependant ce capital continue de demeurer \u201cvested in the hands of the trustees\u201d, et seuls les revenus qui en proviennent leur sont pay\u00e9s par les \u201ctrustees\u201d.\nL\u2019acte contient ensuite des stipulations en faveur des veuves du fils, Mortimer B. Davis, et de ses enfants (les petits-enfants du donateur). Il pourvoit \u00e0 l\u2019accroissement, au cas o\u00f9 l\u2019un des petits-enfants mourrait sans laisser de descendance l\u00e9gitime; puis il contient la clause suivante, qui est importante et qu\u2019il faut reproduire textuellement:\nSubject to the payments to the said Lady Davis and to Philip M. Davis required to be made herein the donor stipulates the right of taking back the trust property and any accumulated revenues so given should the said Mortimer B. Davis and his lawful descendents die before him, the donor, and subject to like payments should the said Mortimer B. Davis survive the donor and die without lawful issue or lawful children as representing such issue then the capital and any accumulated revenue shall revert to the estate of the donor and be governed by the terms of his will.\nLa clause suivante pourvoit \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction des rentes respectives en cas d\u2019insuffisance des revenus, et d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elles seront incessibles et insaisissables.\nLe reste de l\u2019acte r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux \u201ctrustees\u201d; leur nombre est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre tant que Mortimer B. Davis vivra. Apr\u00e8s sa mort, ce nombre sera r\u00e9duit \u00e0 trois. Toute la proc\u00e9dure pour remplir une vacance parmi les \u201ctrustees\u201d est minutieusement arr\u00eat\u00e9e. Suivant le cas, ce sont les autres \u201ctrustees\u201d ou un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans le district de Montr\u00e9al, qui doivent proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette nomination. La seule r\u00e9serve \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du donateur est exprim\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\nDuring the lifetime of the donor, vacancies in the trust shall be filled with hie approval.\nLa majorit\u00e9 des \u201ctrustees\u201d a le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider toute question. En cas d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des voix entre eux sur une question particuli\u00e8re, il est pourvu \u00e0 la nomination d\u2019un tiers pour les d\u00e9partager.\nChaque \u201ctrustee\u201d est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 renoncer, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir accept\u00e9 sa charge; et, dans ce cas, il n\u2019est tenu \u00e0 rendre compte que de l\u2019argent ou des valeurs qui ont pass\u00e9 entre ses mains.\nLes \u201ctrustees\u201d ne sont responsables que de leur bonne foi dans l\u2019administration et sont relev\u00e9s de toute autre responsabilit\u00e9.\nVient ensuite l\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9ration des pouvoirs des \u201ctrustees.\u201d En plus de tous ceux qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux \u201ctrustees\u201d en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par la loi ou par les statuts, l\u2019acte leur attribue les plus amples pouvoirs de vendre ou d\u2019\u00e9changer, d\u2019acquitter ou de radier les hypoth\u00e8ques, de faire le placement des fonds (\u201cand from time to time to sell, alter and vary \u201cinvestments\u201d), d\u2019emprunter, de pr\u00eater ou avancer au trust, le tout \u00e0 leur gr\u00e9 et suivant la plus enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion, de former le compte du capital ou des revenus.\nIls sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 requ\u00e9rir l\u2019assistance professionnelle ou autre d\u00e8s qu\u2019ils jugent \u00e0 propos, et\nto determine all questions and matters of doubt which may arise in the course of their administration, realization, liquidation, partition, or winding up of the trust; and their discretion, whether made in writing or implied from their acts, shall be conclusive and binding on all beneficiaries. La clause qui conf\u00e8re les pouvois ci-dessus aux \u201ctrustees\u201d se termine comme suit:\nThe powers hereinabove given to the said trustees shall be exercised by them with the consent of the donor during his lifetime, and after his death in their own and absolute discretion.\nPar la clause VIII, le fils, Mortimer B. Davis, intervient et accepte la donation pour lui-m\u00eame et pour ses enfants n\u00e9s et \u00e0 na\u00eetre.\nLe 10 octobre 1927 (\u00e0 savoir environ cinq ans apr\u00e8s Facte dont nous venons de donner le r\u00e9sum\u00e9), Sir Mortimer Davis comparut devant ma\u00eetre Edward Phillips, notaire \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al; et, par un acte unilat\u00e9ral, pr\u00e9tendit r\u00e9voquer, canceller et annuler \u201c in the most effective manner possible\u201d ce qu\u2019il appelle dans ce document\nthe said donation in favour of the said Philip Meyer Davis and his widow and his children and any of them,\n\u00e0 savoir: la rente annuelle viag\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue en faveur de ces derniers \u00e0 Facte du 21 octobre 1922 dans la clause qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e textuellement.\nSir Mortimer Davis est mort le 22 mars 1928. Par son testament, il a nomm\u00e9 les appelants ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires, \u00e0 qui il a l\u00e9gu\u00e9 tous les biens qui composaient sa succession lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action pour faire d\u00e9clarer nul et de nul effet Facte de r\u00e9vocation du 10 octobre 1927. Il a dirig\u00e9 son action contre les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires nomm\u00e9s par le testament de Sir Mortimer Davis, bien que, dans le bref de sommation, il les ait d\u00e9sign\u00e9s seulement comme l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires.\nIl a mis en cause les \u201ctrustees\u201d nomm\u00e9s par Facte du 21 octobre 1922, ou leurs rempla\u00e7ants. Il a conclu aux frais seulement contre les d\u00e9fendeurs.\nLes mis-en-cause n\u2019ont pas plaid\u00e9. Seuls les d\u00e9fendeurs (ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires) ont contest\u00e9 Faction en pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient nullement concern\u00e9s en cette affaire et qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun lien de droit entre eux et le demandeur \u00e0 raison des all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration. Ils n\u2019en ont pas moins plaid\u00e9, au surplus, que la stipulation invoqu\u00e9e par le demandeur (\u201cthe so-called gift\u201d) \u00e9tait nulle, comme ne devant avoir effet qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la mort de Sir Mortimer Davis; mais que, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la r\u00e9vocation que ce dernier en avait faite \u00e9tait efficace et valide parce que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la stipulation n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le demandeur; et l\u2019acceptation que les \u201ctrustees\u201d avaient pr\u00e9tendu faire \u00e9tait, insuffisante pour lui donner effet.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le contrat du 21 octobre 1922 \u00e9tait parfait sans acceptation de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que sa r\u00e9vocation partielle par le donateur \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale et de nul effet. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue et l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9.\nLes ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires, l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires, en appellent de cette d\u00e9cision, et soumettent \u00e0 l\u2019encontre les arguments suivants:\n1. L\u2019action est mal dirig\u00e9e. Elle devait s\u2019adresser aux \u201ctrustees\u201d charg\u00e9s de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019acte du 21 octobre 1922, et non pas aux l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires nomm\u00e9s dans le testament;\n2. La lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 en faveur de Philippe Meyer Davis \u00e9tait une donatio mortis causa, et, comme telle, absolument nulle;\n3. Tout le contrat du 21 octobre 1922 constitue une stipulation au profit d\u2019un tiers qui est la condition d\u2019un contrat fait par Sir Mortimer Davis pour lui-m\u00eame ou d\u2019une donation faite \u00e0 un autre; et Sir Mortimer Davis pouvait la r\u00e9voquer tant que le tiers (Philippe Meyer Davis) n\u2019avait pas signifi\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019en profiter;\n4. Si le contrat du 21 octobre 1922 doit \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 uniquement comme un contrat de fiducie, il est, comme tel, en vertu de la loi, soumis express\u00e9ment aux conditions de la donation du code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec; et seule l\u2019acceptation par Philippe Meyer Davis pouvait rendre irr\u00e9vocable la donation dont il \u00e9tait le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nNous allons examiner chacun de ces points dans l\u2019ordre o\u00f9 ils sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nLe moyen r\u00e9sultant du fait que l\u2019action est dirig\u00e9e contre les l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires fut partiellement accueilli par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a maintenu le plaidoyer des d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, quant aux frais seulement, mais en ordonnant que ces frais seraient tax\u00e9s comme ceux d\u2019une inscription en droit.\nEn Cour du Banc du Roi, monsieur le juge Hall \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucun lien de droit entre le demandeur et les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9, et il aurait rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action de ce seul chef. Les autres juges n\u2019ont pas parl\u00e9 de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense.\nIl n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de cette partie du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui le condamnait aux frais d\u2019une inscription en droit; mais nous ne pouvons ignorer ce premier point de la d\u00e9fense, parce que les appelants l\u2019ont de nouveau fait valoir \u00e0 l\u2019audition devant cette cour.\nA notre humble avis, l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e contre ses v\u00e9ritables contradicteurs. Rappelons, en effet, les conclusions de cette action: Elle demande simplement l\u2019annulation de l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation, et elle met en cause les \u201ctrustees\u201d de l\u2019acte du 21 octobre 1922 pour entendre prononcer le jugement.\nLa r\u00e9vocation fut l\u2019acte de Sir Mortimer Davis cinq ans apr\u00e8s le contrat de fiducie accept\u00e9 par les \u201ctrustees\u201d et par le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du capital de la \u201ctrust property\u201d. Ni ces \u201ctrustees\u201d, ni ce b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 parties \u00e0 l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation; ni les uns, ni les autres ne l\u2019ont adopt\u00e9. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, ce fut l\u2019acte uni-lat\u00e9ral de Sir Mortimer Davis. Si l\u2019action e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e du vivant de ce dernier, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il e\u00fbt fallu la diriger contre lui. Apr\u00e8s sa mort, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour le demandeur de diriger son action contre les repr\u00e9sentants de Sir Mortimer Davis. Ces repr\u00e9sentants sont ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires en vertu de son testament. Les \u201ctrustees\u201d de l\u2019acte du 21 octobre 1922 ne le sont pas; ou, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, ne le sont que pour les fins sp\u00e9ciales mentionn\u00e9es dans cet acte. C\u2019est la succession de Sir Mortimer, et non pas la \u201ctrust property\u201d, qui doit r\u00e9pondre des cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation, si cet acte est ill\u00e9gal.\nNous croyons donc que les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires \u00e9taient les seuls l\u00e9gitimes contradicteurs et que c\u2019est contre eux que l\u2019action devait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e.\nNous n\u2019avons pas besoin d\u2019ajouter que nous ne nous arr\u00eaterons pas pour un seul instant \u00e0 l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e par les appelants que, dans le bref de sommation, ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s seulement\nin their quality of trustees under the will of the said late Sir Mortimer B. Davis.\nL\u2019objection est que, dans cette d\u00e9signation, on aurait omis de les d\u00e9signer \u00e9galement comme ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. Ce sont les m\u00eames personnes qui sont \u00e0 la fois ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et l\u00e9gataires fiduciaires. Ce sont elles qui sont devant la cour \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fendeurs. Tout au plus, s\u2019il y avait insuffisance de d\u00e9signation, cette objection aurait-elle pu faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une exception \u00e0 la forme devant la cour de premi\u00e8re instance. Nous n\u2019avons aucun doute, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9es les conclusions de cette action, que les appelants \u00e9taient les v\u00e9ritables d\u00e9fendeurs que le demandeur devait assigner, et que c\u2019est contre eux que le jugement annulant l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation devait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9.\nD\u2019ailleurs, il n\u2019y a pas, en vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, de diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre des d\u00e9fendeurs et des mis-en-cause. Tout d\u00e9pend des conclusions qui sont prises dans l\u2019action. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la cour a devant elle toutes les parties qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour prononcer la nullit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte \u201cen d\u00e9claration de jugement commun\u201d.\nCe premier moyen des appelants doit donc \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9. En ce qui concerne le second moyen des appelants, admettons pour les besoins de la discussion que la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doive \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e comme une donation entre vifs subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e8gles du code civil (titre 2, c. 2). Nous constatons au contrat que nous avons r\u00e9sum\u00e9 au commencement que Sir Mortimer a transport\u00e9 aux \u201ctrustees\u201d des biens pr\u00e9sents:\nthree million dollars face value of the twenty-year-six-per-cent notes of Sir Mortimer Davis Incorporated,\nque les \u201ctrustees\u201d ont accept\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils ont reconnu avoir re\u00e7us. Il n\u2019y a pas eu donation directe d\u2019une rente \u00e0 Philippe Meyer Davis. Les \u201ctrustees\u201d ont accept\u00e9 la mission de lui payer une rente \u00e0 prendre sur les revenus de la \u201ctrust property\u201d. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Sir Mortimer, le d\u00e9saisissement de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u201c$3,000,000 notes\u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 actuel et complet d\u00e8s la signature de l\u2019acte. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des \u201ctrustees\u201d il est vrai que la rente \u00e0 Philippe Meyer Davis est payable seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Sir Mortimer Davis; mais cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement est mentionn\u00e9 uniquement pour fixer la date o\u00f9 la rente commencera \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9e. D\u00e8s le transport de la \u201ctrust property\u201d, l\u2019obligation des \u201ctrustees\u201d de payer la rente est n\u00e9e et est devenue une dette \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Philippe Meyer Davis. Par l\u2019acte constitutif, l\u2019obligation de la rente est stipul\u00e9e, non-seulement envers ce dernier, mais envers sa veuve et ses enfants l\u00e9gitimes. L\u2019existence de cette dette \u00e9tait certaine; seule l\u2019\u00e9poque du paiement \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement futur certain.\nEn vertu du dernier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019article 777 du code civil:\nLa donation d\u2019une rente cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019acte de donation, ou d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent ou autre chose non d\u00e9termin\u00e9e que le donateur promet payer ou livrer, dessaisit le donateur en ce sens qu\u2019il devient d\u00e9biteur du donataire.\nA fortiori doit-on d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il y a eu dessaisissement actuel dans le cas d\u2019une rente stipul\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re que nous venons de d\u00e9crire. Il n\u2019y a pas eu donatio mortis causa.\nLe troisi\u00e8me moyen des appelants s\u2019appuie sur l\u2019article 1029 du code civil, qui se lit comme suit:\n1029. On peut pareillement stipuler au profit d\u2019un tiers, lorsque telle est la condition d\u2019un contrat que l\u2019on fait pour soi-m\u00eame, ou d\u2019une donation que l\u2019on fait \u00e0 un autre. Celui qui fait cette stipulation ne peut plus la r\u00e9voquer si le tiers a signifi\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019en profiter.\nPour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cet argument des appelants, il suffirait de dire qu\u2019il est manifeste que Sir Mortimer Davis n\u2019a nullement eu l\u2019intention de faire une stipulation au profit de Philippe Meyer Davis en vertu de l\u2019article dont nous venons de reproduire le texte. Il est absolument clair que le contrat du 21 octobre 1922 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en vertu du chapitre IV (A), \u201cDe la fiducie\u201d, (articles 981a \u00e0 981n du code civil). Si le \u201ctrust deed\u201d pouvait \u00eatre fait et s\u2019il rencontre les exigences du chapitre IV (A), il importe peu de se demander si les parties contractantes auraient pu \u00e9galement se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019article 1029 C.C.\nMais, incidemment, nous ne voyons pas comment la stipulation dont il s\u2019agit pourrait entrer dans le cadre de cet article. Elle n\u2019est pas la condition d\u2019un contrat que Sir Mortimer Davis a fait pour lui-m\u00eame. Il s\u2019est dessaisi de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux \u201cnotes\u201d qu\u2019il a transport\u00e9es aux \u201ctrustees.\u201d Il s\u2019en est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 l\u2019usufruit ou les revenus pendant sa vie. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas transport\u00e9 l\u2019usufruit pour cette p\u00e9riode de temps, et c\u2019est tout. Cet usufruit, d\u00e8s lors, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet du contrat. A l\u2019\u00e9gard de la chose qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet, le dessaisissement a \u00e9t\u00e9 absolu et le contrat n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201cfait pour\u201d Sir Mortimer.\nD\u2019autre part, ce contrat ne tombe pas non plus sous la seconde alternative pr\u00e9vue par l\u2019article 1029 C.C. Il faudrait pour cela que le transport des \u201cnotes\u201d f\u00fbt une donation que Sir Mortimer e\u00fbt faite aux \u201ctrustees\u201d et dont la stipulation de rente au profit de Philippe Meyer Davis serait l\u2019une des conditions. L\u2019id\u00e9e que le transport des \u201cnotes\u201d constituerait une donation aux \u201ctrustees\u201d est exactement aux antipodes de la conception que se font les appelants du contrat consenti par Sir Mortimer. La base m\u00eame de leur argumentation est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas donation aux \u201ctrustees\u201d, mais donation aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 cause de cette pr\u00e9tention qu\u2019ils soumettent que les r\u00e8gles d\u2019acceptation en mati\u00e8re de donation s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle. Les appelants ne peuvent donc logiquement pr\u00e9tendre que la stipulation au profit de Philippe Meyer Davis est la condition d\u2019une donation qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite aux \u201ctrustees.\u201d\nAjoutons d\u2019ailleurs que, sur ce point, nous sommes d\u2019avis que les appelants ont raison. Il n\u2019y a pas eu, en faveur des \u201ctrustees\u201d une donation dans le sens du chapitre 2 du titre 2 du code civil. \u201cIl est de l\u2019essence de la \u201cdonation\u201d, telle qu\u2019elle est envisag\u00e9e par ce chapitre, \u201cque le donateur se dessaisisse actuellement de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la chose donn\u00e9e en faveur du donataire\u201d (Arts. 755 et 777 C.C.).\nLes droits des \u201ctrustees\u201d, leur nature et leur caract\u00e8re sont \u00e9videmment diff\u00e9rents de ceux du donataire pur et simple. C\u2019est ce qui nous reste \u00e0 examiner en discutant le dernier moyen des appelants.\nComme nous l\u2019avoms d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le contrat du 21 octobre 1922 est de toute \u00e9vidence, dans l\u2019intention des parties, un contrat fait en vertu des dispositions du chapitre \u201cDe la fiducie\u201d (art. 981a jusqu\u2019\u00e0 981n du code civil), et la v\u00e9ritable question dans ce litige est:\nUne stipulation dans un contrat de fiducie (\u201ctrust deed\u201d), comme celui qui est en cause, peut-elle \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e par l\u2019acte unilat\u00e9ral du donateur, apr\u00e8s que ce contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par les fiduciaires (\u201ctrustees\u201d) et sous pr\u00e9texte que le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019a pas encore accept\u00e9 la stipulation \u00e0 son profit?\nPour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il faut d\u2019abord s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 bien saisir l\u2019intention des parties contractantes. C\u2019est dans les termes du contrat que l\u2019on doit chercher cette intention; et, pourvu que la forme qu\u2019ils ont donn\u00e9e \u00e0 leur contrat soit permise par la loi (ce qui revient \u00e0 dire: pourvu qu\u2019elle ne soit pas prohib\u00e9e), les tribunaux doivent donner effet \u00e0 cette intention telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e. Ici, les parties ont entendu faire un contrat de fiducie, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un contrat r\u00e9gi par les articles 981a et suivants du code. Personne ne pr\u00e9tend que le contrat qu\u2019ils ont fait est contraire \u00e0 la loi. Il faut donc se demander quelle est exactement la nature du contrat que Sir Mortimer Davis a volontairement adopt\u00e9 pour accomplir ce qu\u2019il entendait faire, et quelles \u00e9taient, en vertu de la loi, les obligations des parties clans le but de le rendre complet et efficace.\nSi l\u2019on prend le contrat \u00e0 la lettre, Sir Mortimer a donn\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de donation entre vifs et irr\u00e9vocable, aux \u201ctrustees\u201d, qui les ont accept\u00e9es, les \u201cnotes\u201d qui ont fait l\u2019objet du contrat. L\u2019article I est explicite:\nThe donor subject to the conditions hereinafter expressed hath by these presents given as a donation inter vivos and irrevocable unto the trustees thereof accepting the following property, namely: three million dollars face value of the twenty-year-six-per-cent notes of Sir Mortimer Davis Incorporated.\nCette donation aux \u201ctrustees\u201d, ou, si l\u2019on veut, ce transport (pour employer l\u2019expression de l\u2019article 981a C.C.), est, dans les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019acte, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u201cirr\u00e9vocable\u201d par le donateur lui-m\u00eame. Les conditions auxquelles cette donation est subordonn\u00e9e sont que le \u201cchose donn\u00e9e\u201d, appel\u00e9e \u201ctrust property\u201d, sera d\u00e9tenue en fiducie par les \u201ctrustees\u201d pour les fins et pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des personnes en faveur de qui le \u201ctrust\u201d est constitu\u00e9. Les \u201ctrustees\u201d n\u2019en seront cependant pas propri\u00e9taires, dans le sens absolu du mot. Les \u201ctrustees\u201d, bien que seuls propri\u00e9taires apparents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers, n\u2019auront ni l\u2019 usus, ni le functus, ni l\u2019abusus de la \u201ctrust property\u201d. Cette \u201cproperty\u201d toutefois est \u00e0 leur nom; et, dans le cas particulier qui nous occupe, elle ne sera jamais au nom de Philippe Meyer Davis. Ce dernier n\u2019a aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la chose donn\u00e9e. Au moment de la cr\u00e9ation du \u201ctrust\u201d, il a simplement acquis une cr\u00e9ance contre ce \u201ctrust\u201d. A son \u00e9gard, il y a eu une stipulation qui participe de la constitution de rente, bien qu\u2019elle ne corresponde pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu\u2019en donne l\u2019article 1786 du code civil, parce qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9sulte pas d\u2019un contrat fait entre le constituant et le cr\u00e9direntier, ni d\u2019une convention par laquelle le constituant s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer la rente au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Cet engagement est pris par les \u201ctrustees\u201d, et, de leur part, n\u2019est pas une obligation personnelle, mais un engagement de payer sur les revenus de la \u201ctrust property\u201d. En cons\u00e9quence, Philippe Meyer Davis n\u2019a aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur la \u201ctrust property\u201d. Il n\u2019a que des droits conservatoires; et l\u2019on peut se demander s\u2019il a le droit de suite, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider pour les fins de ce litige. Par la signature de l\u2019acte, un droit de cr\u00e9ance lui est d\u00e9volu. Il est devenu cr\u00e9direntier, s\u2019il veut se pr\u00e9valoir de la stipulation.\nLe propri\u00e9taire de fait de la \u201ctrust property\u201d est le fils du donateur, Mortimer B. Davis, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du capital; mais il n\u2019est qu\u2019un propri\u00e9taire nominal. Il est stipul\u00e9 que\nthe capital of the trust property shall remain absolutely vested in the hands of the trustees,\nnon-seulement pendant la vie de ce b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, mais \u00e9galement qu\u2019il continuera d\u2019\u00eatre \u201cvested in the hands of the trustees\u201d pendant la vie des petits-enfants de Sir Mortimer Davis, et, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019au moins cinquante ans \u00e0 dater du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier. A la mort de chacun des petits-enfants, sa part du capital est d\u00e9volue aux arri\u00e8re petits-enfants du donateur \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales et par souches.\nPendant toute cette p\u00e9riode de temps, les \u201ctrustees\u201d ont v\u00e9ritablement tous les droits du propri\u00e9taire sur la chose donn\u00e9e, sauf qu\u2019ils ne peuvent en tirer aucun avantage personnel, et avec, en plus, cette particularit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont l\u2019obligation d\u2019administrer les biens au profit des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires; nous voulons dire: qu\u2019ils ne sauraient les laisser d\u00e9p\u00e9rir sans s\u2019exposer \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9mis par la cour. Ils ont le devoir de remplir les fonctions qu\u2019ils ont accept\u00e9es et de faire fructifier la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e. Les \u201ctrustees\u201d, en vertu du contrat qui nous est soumis, ont la saisine de la \u201ctrust property\u201d, et les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ne peuvent revendiquer contre eux ni la possession de la \u201cproperty\u201d, ni m\u00eame, pendant la dur\u00e9e de la fiducie, aucun autre droit que celui du paiement de leur cr\u00e9ance, ou ceux qui r\u00e9sulteraient de la dissipation ou du gaspillage de la \u201ctrust property\u201d. Mais, dans ce dernier cas, le trust ne prendrait pas fin, et les \u201ctrustees\u201d seraient remplac\u00e9s par d\u2019autres. Dans l\u2019intervalle, ils peuvent vendre, \u00e9changer, remplacer, emprunter, hypoth\u00e9quer \u00e0 leur gr\u00e9, sans l\u2019intervention des b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, et suivant la discr\u00e9tion la plus absolue. Ils ont le pouvoir pratiquement illimit\u00e9 \u201cof administration, realization, liquidation, participation or winding up\u201d, et toutes leurs d\u00e9cisions, expresses ou implicites, \u201cshall be conclusive and binding on all beneficiaries\u201d.\nIl est \u00e9vident que la situation cr\u00e9\u00e9e par ce contrat n\u2019avait pas d\u2019\u00e9quivalent dans le droit de la province de Qu\u00e9bec avant l\u2019introduction et l\u2019adoption du statut 42-43 Vict. ch. 29, intitul\u00e9: \u201cActe concernant la fiducie\u201d. Cette constatation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avant nous par les juges qui ont rendu jugement dans la cause de Mathison v. Shepherd[2], M. le juge Lynch dit (p. 42):\nThis is not a deed of donation within the meaning of our civil law. * * * We must, of course, have recourse to the law under which alone such a deed as the one under consideration could be passed, namely articles 981a and following C.C.\nEt M. le juge Hutchinson dit (p. 52):\nOf course, previous to the Act 42-43 Vict., chap. 29 (1879), a trust deed of the kind in question could not have been made.\nCe n\u2019est pas le fideicommissum du droit romain, non plus que la fiducie du droit fran\u00e7ais, dont Laurent (vol. 14, p. 444) disait que l\u2019usage s\u2019est perdu. Ce n\u2019est ni la donation, ni le mandat, ni le d\u00e9p\u00f4t du code civil. Il participe de chacun de ces contrats auxquels il emprunte sans doute quelques-uns de leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments; mais il ne les contient en entier ni les uns, ni les autres, et il se s\u00e9pare de chacun d\u2019eux sur plus d\u2019un point essentiel. Sir Mortimer Davis n\u2019a pas voulu faire une donation, ni constituer un mandat ou un d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Il a entendu cr\u00e9er un \u201ctrust\u201d ou une fiducie telle qu\u2019elle est pr\u00e9vue dans le statut de Qu\u00e9bec 42-43 Vict., qui est maintenant incorpor\u00e9 au code civil dans les articles 981a et suivants. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un contrat particulier, avec ses stipulations et son caract\u00e8re essentiellement diff\u00e9rents des contrats ant\u00e9rieurement connus au code.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des articles concernant la fiducie qu\u2019il nous faut interpr\u00e9ter le contrat que Sir Mortimer a fait et que ce chapitre particulier du code l\u2019autorisait de faire.\nLa question vient pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant cette cour. Dans Valois v. DeBoucherville[3] nous avons eu \u00e0 examiner l\u2019effet d\u2019une fiducie cr\u00e9\u00e9e par testament et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 869 C.C. Dans Lalibert\u00e9 v. Larue[4], nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la loi des pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux de certaines corporations contenue au chapitre 227 des statuts refondus de Qu\u00e9bec de 1925, et nous avons eu alors l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au chapitre de la fiducie dans le code civil (Voir pp. 17 \u00e0 20). Mais cette cour n\u2019a pas encore eu \u00e0 se prononcer sur un cas comme celui qui nous occupe.\nDans la jurisprudence de la province Qu\u00e9bec, on nous a cit\u00e9 quatre jugements:\nI. Smith v. Davis[5].\nL\u2019acte qui fait l\u2019objet de ce litige \u00e9tait une transaction \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un jugement en s\u00e9paration de corps, par laquelle le mari assurait le pension alimentaire de sa femme, au moyen d\u2019une somme de $20,000 remise en fid\u00e9icommis, dont le revenu \u00e9tait payable \u00e0 la femme et le capital aux enfants issus du mariage.\nEn ce qui nous concerne ici, il suffit d\u2019en retenir que la cour d\u2019appel fut d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu donation parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu dessaisissement actuel de la part du mari; que les fid\u00e9icommissaires \u00e9taient de simples administrateurs; et que la convention \u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs annul\u00e9e par l\u2019effet de la r\u00e9conciliation entre les \u00e9poux. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le jugement tel qu\u2019il est rapport\u00e9, il faut conclure que les parties contractantes n\u2019avaient pas fait un contrat en vertu des articles 981a et suivants du code civil. Il n\u2019est nullement question de ces articles dans les \u201craisons\u201d de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ou dans celles de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nIl est \u00e9vident que ces jugements ne peuvent servir de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sur la question qui nous est soumise, vu qu\u2019elle n\u2019y est nullement discut\u00e9e et ne para\u00eet m\u00eame pas y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e.\n2. Mathison v. Shepherd[6], que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9. Dans cette cause, le donateur avait transport\u00e9 \u00e0 des fiduciaires une certaine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re, avec mission qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt d\u00e9tenue par eux pour qu\u2019on y \u00e9rige\u00e2t un \u201cpersonnage\u201d. Le donateur demanda la r\u00e9vocation du contrat, en all\u00e9guant \u00e0 la fois renonciation et inex\u00e9cution des obligations.\nEn Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, M. le juge Lynch conclut sur la question de fait qu\u2019il y avait eu inex\u00e9cution des obligations, et sur la question de droit que la r\u00e9vocation pouvait \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence, sans qu\u2019il f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019une stipulation \u00e0 cet effet dans l\u2019acte, nonobstant l\u2019article 816 du code civil. Il dit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une convention de fiducie qui tombe sous l\u2019effet de la loi 42-43 Vict., c. 29, introduite dans le code sous les num\u00e9ros 981a et suivants. Avant cette loi, une stipulation de ce genre pouvait se faire par testament (articles 869 et 964 C.C.); Abbott v. Fraser[7]. Il ajoute:\nBut the power to do so by gift inter vivos is not covered by the code, either directly or indirectly; in fact, such a power would seem to be repugnant to the spirit of our civil law on that subject which required acceptance by the donee in order to render the contract perfect.\nIl examine alors successivement les diff\u00e9rents moyens invoqu\u00e9s par le donateur pour faire prononcer la r\u00e9siliation judiciaire de son contrat. Et il est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander s\u2019il peut y avoir r\u00e9vocation pour cause d\u2019inex\u00e9cution des obligations vu que ce droit de r\u00e9vocation n\u2019est pas stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acte et que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 816 du code civil, cette stipulation est n\u00e9cessaire dans le cas d\u2019une donation entre vifs ordinaire. Il r\u00e9pond (p. 42):\nMy view is that our law respecting gifts inter vivos does not apply to trusts such as these which are governed by arts. 981a to 981n C.C.\nIl fait la d\u00e9claration que nous avons reproduite plus haut \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une donation \u201cwithin the meaning of our civil law\u201d; qu\u2019une convention de ce genre ne pouvait \u00eatre consentie qu\u2019en vertu des articles 981a C.C. et suivants, puis il ajoute:\nThose articles merely lay down general principles on the subject; and for their elucidation we must refer to the authorities and precedents which have grown up under like systems in other countries, and notably England and United States.\nLa cause fut port\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour de R\u00e9vision, o\u00f9 elle fut entendue par MM. les juges Mathieu, Robidoux et Hutchinson.\nM. le juge Mathieu partagea l\u2019opinion de la cour de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 l\u2019effet\nque ces dispositions de la fiducie viennent du droit anglais et qu\u2019on doit les interpr\u00e9ter d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles du droit anglais.\nMais il fut d\u2019avis d\u2019infirmer le jugement parce qu\u2019il lui parut\n\u00e9tabli dans la cause que la fiducie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore devenue caduque.\nM. le juge Hutchinson arriva \u00e9galement \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, mais pour la raison que l\u2019article 816 du code civil contenu dans la chapitre des donations devait lui \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 et qu\u2019en vertu de cet article la r\u00e9vocation des donations n\u2019a lieu pour cause d\u2019inex\u00e9cution des obligations contract\u00e9es par le donataire, comme charges ou autrement, que si cette r\u00e9vocation est stipul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acte, etc.\nSon raisonnement peut \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9 comme suit: Les articles 981a C.C. et suivants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduits par les statuts refondus comme amendements au titre second du troisi\u00e8me livre du code civil qui traite des donations entre vifs et testamentaires, en y ajoutant comme chapitre 4A le chapitre de la fiducie. En cons\u00e9quence, dit-il, ces articles font maintenant partie, dans leur ordre r\u00e9gulier, de l\u2019ensemble des articles du code group\u00e9s sous le titre \u201cDes donations entre vifs et testamentaires\u201d.\nAnd there is not a word in the whole Act to indicate that it introduces a new system incompatible with our prior law on the subject of gifts inter vivos and that for the elucidation of this Act recourse must be had to the law and practice in England; and this being the case, it must be presumed to be read and elucidated with the help of and in conformity with the provisions of our code.\nIl fait ensuite l\u2019admission que nous d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9e:\nOf course, previous to the Act 42-43 Vict., c. 29 (1879), a trust deed of the kind, in question could not have been made.\nPuis il en vient au fond de son raisonnement: Certains articles du chapitre des donations s\u2019appliquent n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 un contrat de fiducie,\nand consequently there must be a connection between the provisions of our code respecting gifts inter vivos and the provisions contained in this statute.\nEn tout respect, ce raisonnement nous para\u00eet p\u00e9cher par plus d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9. Aucune pr\u00e9somption ne r\u00e9sulte du seul fait que la loi 42-43 Vict., c. 29, a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment incorpor\u00e9e au code comme un chapitre du titre des donations entre vifs et testamentaires. La loi concernant la revision des statuts repousse cette pr\u00e9somption (Statuts de Qu\u00e9bec, 50 Vict., c. 5, art. 8).\nEn outre, il est sans doute exact de dire que certains articles du code concernant les donations ou les testaments (tels que les articles 763, 768, 771, 776 et 778, auxquels le savant juge r\u00e9f\u00e8re sp\u00e9cialement) s\u2019appliquent au contrat de fiducie; mais c\u2019est parce que cette application s\u2019impose en vertu du texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 981a, que nous n\u2019avons pas encore cit\u00e9 au cours du jugement et qu\u2019il convient de reproduire maintenant:\n981a. Toute personne capable de disposer librement de ses biens, peut transporter des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res ou immobili\u00e8res \u00e0 des fiduciaires, par donation ou par testament, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des personnes en faveur de qui elle peut faire valablement des donations ou des legs. Il ne s\u2019ensuit donc pas du tout que tous les autres articles du code doivent r\u00e9gir un contrat qui transporte des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 des fiduciaires par donation. Le fait est que, si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019article 816 du chapitre des donations, qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en discussion dans la cause de Mathison v. Shepherd[8], nous voyons quelque difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 dire, avec M. le juge Hutchinson, que la r\u00e9vocation n\u2019a lieu pour cause d\u2019inex\u00e9cution des obligations contract\u00e9es que si cette r\u00e9vocation est stipul\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acte, vu que l\u2019article 816 C.C. parle d\u2019obligations \u201ccontract\u00e9es par le donataire comme charges ou autrement\u201d et que, dans la fiducie, on ne peut assimiler le fiduciaire \u00e0 un donataire. Le code lui-m\u00eame (art. 981b) donne plut\u00f4t cette d\u00e9signation (donataire ou l\u00e9gataire) au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nQuant au rapprochement qu\u2019il fait entre les articles 869 et 964 C.C., d\u2019une part, et les articles 981a jusqu\u2019\u00e0 981n C.C., d\u2019autre part, il y a tout de m\u00eame cette distinction que les premiers sont contenus dans le chapitre des testaments et en font partie int\u00e9grale, tandis que les autres sont contenus dans un chapitre distinct, avec des dispositions particuli\u00e8res et qui r\u00e9f\u00e8rent aux autres chapitres du code chaque fois que le l\u00e9gislateur l\u2019a cru n\u00e9cessaire.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on dans la loi des pouvoirs sp\u00e9ciaux de certaines corporations (S.R.Q., 1925, c. 227) que nous avons \u00e9tudi\u00e9e dans la cause de Lalibert\u00e9 v. Larue[9], et, en autorisant l\u2019extension de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle aux biens mobiliers et aux biens futurs, et l\u2019extension du nantissement ou du gage \u00e0 des biens qui peuvent \u00e9galement \u00eatre futurs, mais surtout \u00e0 des biens dont le d\u00e9biteur conservait la possession et l\u2019usage, il a express\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (art. 12, c. 227):\nLes droits que conf\u00e8rent sur les immeubles l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que et le nantissement (en question) sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s d\u2019ans le code civil.\nOn ne peut donc d\u00e9duire une conclusion du fait que la loi 42-43 Vict. est devenue un chapitre du code, ni que certains articles du chapitre des donations et des testaments s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la fiducie. On ne peut certainement pas en tirer une conclusion in\u00e9vitable (\u201cunavoidable\u201d), suivant l\u2019expression de M. le juge Hutchinson. Le fait que le chapitre de la fiducie r\u00e9f\u00e8re express\u00e9ment \u00e0 quelques-unes des parties du chapitre des donations et des testaments conduirait plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la conclusion contraire et serait susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme voulant dire que les autres parties de ces chapitres ne s\u2019appliquent pas. Or, l\u2019article 981a C.C. ne fait aucune mention de l\u2019acceptation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire.\nPour revenir au rapport dans la cause de Mathison v. Shepherd[10], il n\u2019indique pas si le troisi\u00e8me juge, M. le juge Robidoux a adopt\u00e9 le raisonnement de M. le juge Hutchinson. La seule information qu\u2019il nous donne est le jug\u00e9, qui est calqu\u00e9 sur les notes de ce dernier, en ajoutant: \u201cMathieu J. dissentiente\u201d. Comme les trois juges \u00e9taient unanimes \u00e0 refuser le droit de r\u00e9vocation, cela laisse supposer que M. le juge Robidoux avait accept\u00e9 les vues de M. le juge Hutchinson. Mais, au point de vue jurisprudence, le r\u00e9sultat serait seulement que les opinions des quatre juges se sont partag\u00e9es \u00e9galement.\n3. City of Westmount v. Bishop[11]. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le rapport, l\u2019action demandait l\u2019annulation d\u2019un contrat de fiducie inter vivos parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en la forme notari\u00e9e. L\u2019action fut maintenue par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Philippe Demers, J.). Ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de R\u00e9vision (Archibald, C.J., St-Pierre et Mercier, JJ.).\nLe jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019une fiducie ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie que par donation ou par testament (c\u2019est le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 981a C.C.) et que si elle est \u00e9tablie par donation, le contrat doit \u00eatre fait en la forme notari\u00e9e, suivant l\u2019article 776 du code civil. Le jugement ajoute que le fiduciaire n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019accepter la donation pour les enfants mineurs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et que\nhis pretended acceptance is null and without effect and the said minors should not be considered as parties to the deed.\nCe jugement ne nous aide pas. Le motif que l\u2019acte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en la forme notari\u00e9e \u00e9tait suffisant pour justifier la conclusion. L\u2019autre motif est surr\u00e9rogatoire; et il est, en plus, ambigu. Il peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme voulant dire que l\u2019acceptation du fiduciaire \u00e9tait inefficace parce que les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires \u00e9taient mineurs. C\u2019est ce que semble indiquer la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, faite dans ce \u201cconsid\u00e9rant\u201d, aux articles 789, 790, 792 et 793 du code civil. Si le contrat \u00e9tait nul par d\u00e9faut de forme essentielle, il importait peu qu\u2019il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 ou non.\n4. Il ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 mentionner le jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[12]. On se rappelle que, dans cette cause, le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire d\u00e9cida qu\u2019on ne pouvait pr\u00e9tendre que la conception du trust tel qu\u2019il existe en droit anglais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9e dans son entier par l\u2019adoption de la loi de fiducie. Lord Buckmaster, qui pronon\u00e7a le jugement, s\u2019appuya principalement sur l\u2019emploi du mot \u201ctransporter\u201d (\u201cconvey\u201d) dans l\u2019article 981a C.C., et fit remarquer que cela \u00e9cartait, au moins, la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un trust par un acte unilat\u00e9ral bien connu en droit anglais sous la d\u00e9signation de \u201cdeclaration of trust\u201d.\nCe jugement est pr\u00e9cieux pour appuyer l\u2019opinion, d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mise par cette cour dans Lalibert\u00ea v. Larue[13] que le trust anglais, avec sa complexit\u00e9 et ses multiples aspects, n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 dans le syst\u00e8me l\u00e9gal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, sauf dans la forme restreinte o\u00f9 on le trouve au chapitre de la fiducie. Mais, en outre, ce jugement est int\u00e9ressant parce qu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 un passage de Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 5, p. 157, d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 par M. le juge Lynch dans Mathison v. Shepherd[14]. Lord Buckmaster cite ce pasage pour d\u00e9montrer davantage que le trust unilat\u00e9ral est \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie du droit de Qu\u00e9bec. Mais nous voulons insister surtout sur le fait que la citation est celle o\u00f9 Mignault \u00e9met l\u2019opinion que l\u2019acceptation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019est pas requise en vertu de l\u2019article 981a du code.\nCette question de l\u2019acceptation ne se posait pas dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett12. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire pour Lord Buckmaster d\u2019approuver l\u2019opinion \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Mignault. On peut toutefois remarquer qu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 ce passage de l\u2019ouvrage; et le moins qu\u2019on puisse dire, c\u2019est qu\u2019il ne le d\u00e9sapprouve pas. Il est, en tout cas, certain que Mignault, en traitant du chapitre de la fiducie dans le code civil (vol. 5, p. 151 \u00e0 171), affirme:\nOn se tromperait si on cherchait ailleurs qu\u2019en Angleterre la source des dispositions de ce chapitre. * * * et il est \u00e9tabli que notre l\u00e9gislateur s\u2019est, en grande partie, inspir\u00e9 des dispositions anglaises (pp. 153 & 154).\nL\u2019auteur est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter les conditions de validit\u00e9 de la fiducie et il conclut que la fiducie est parfaite par l\u2019acceptation du fiduciaire et que, d\u00e8s ce moment, elle ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e par le donateur.\nApr\u00e8s la revue que nous venons de faire de la jurisprudence et de la doctrine dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec sur la mati\u00e8re de ce litige, il est difficile de ne pas conclure que le chapitre de la fiducie dans le code est vraiment d\u2019inspiration anglaise. Il est certain que le droit romain ou le droit fran\u00e7ais ne nous ont rien transmis d\u2019identique; et, comme l\u2019admet lui-m\u00eame M. le juge Hutchinson dans la cause de Mathison v. Shepherd[15], un contrat de ce genre n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible en vertu du code, avant l\u2019adoption de la loi de 1879. Il est donc conforme aux principes ordinaires d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, tels qu\u2019ils sont constamment admis dans la jurisprudence des tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec, lorsqu\u2019ils sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la port\u00e9e d\u2019un article du code, de l\u2019envisager en fonction de son origine et de son histoire et de chercher la solution des difficult\u00e9s dans la jurisprudence o\u00f9 notre propre l\u00e9gislation a pris sa source. Dans le trust anglais, l\u2019acceptation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la formation du contrat. Comme cons\u00e9quence logique, il faudrait d\u00e9cider que, dans le trust du Qu\u00e9bec, cette acceptation n\u2019est pas, non plus, exig\u00e9e.\nMais nous voudrions appuyer cette conclusion en nous basant, en plus, sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation interne de la loi. Nous nous inspirons par-l\u00e0 de l\u2019avis du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Company Ltd. v. Vandry[16]:\nStill the first step, the indispensable starting point, is to take the Code itself and to examine its words, and to ask whether their meaning is plain. Only if the enactment is not plain can light foe usefully sought from exterior sources. Of course it must not be forgotten what the enactment is, namely, a Code of systematized principles and rules, not a body of administrative directions or an institutional exposition. Of course also the code, or at least the cognate articles, should be read as a whole, forming a connected scheme; they are not a series of detached enactments. Of course, again, there is a point at which mere linguistic clearness only masks the obscurity of actual provisions or leads to such irrational or unjust results that, however clear the actual expression may be, the conclusion is still clearer that no such meaning could have been intended by the Legislature. Whether particular words are plain or not is rarely susceptible of much argument. They must be read and passed upon. The conclusion must largely depend on the impression formed by the mind that has to decide. Si l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te le chapitre de la fiducie suivant ce conseil et si l\u2019on conclut que l\u2019acceptation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire n\u2019est pas requise pour compl\u00e9ter le contrat, l\u2019on n\u2019est conduit \u00e0 aucun r\u00e9sultat d\u00e9raisonnable (\u201cirrational or unjust results\u201d). Au contraire, ce r\u00e9sultat se produirait si l\u2019on exigeait l\u2019acceptation du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire; et, dans bien des cas, l\u2019usage de la fiducie serait rendu impossible pour donner effet \u00e0 la libre volont\u00e9 du stipulant. Dans un contrat comme celui-ci, par exemple, et en supposant que les fils b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ne seraient pas mari\u00e9s\u2014ce dont nous ne savons rien\u2014la stipulation en faveur de leurs veuves et la stipulation en faveur des enfants n\u00e9s ou \u00e0 na\u00eetre seraient compromises par la difficult\u00e9 pour elles ou pour eux d\u2019en faire une acceptation qui serait conforme aux r\u00e8gles concernant l\u2019acceptation dans le chapitre des donations entre vifs. En effet, il est bon de faire remarquer qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019un contrat de mariage; et, par cons\u00e9quent, ce contrat ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas de la faveur que le code accorde aux donations par contrat de mariage.\nL\u2019article fondamental, dans le chapitre de la fiducie, est l\u2019article 981a C.C. Il est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 avec soin. Il para\u00eet bien contenir tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9finir le contrat de fiducie. Il indique d\u2019une fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise les personnes et l\u2019objet du contrat. Il faut \u201cune personne capable de disposer librement de ses biens\u201d et \u201cdes fiduciaires.\u201d Ce sont l\u00e0 les deux parties contractantes. L\u2019objet est de\ntransporter des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mobili\u00e8res ou immobili\u00e8res * * * pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de personnes en faveur de qui elle peut faire valablement des donations ou des legs,\nindiquant implicitement qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas donation \u00e0 ces personnes.\nR\u00e9capitulons maintenant et comparons. Dans la donation, pour avoir un \u201ccontrat parfait\u201d, il faut\n(a) un donateur\n(b) qui se d\u00e9pouille de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre gratuit\n(c) en faveur d\u2019un donataire\n(d) dont l\u2019acceptation est requise.\nCe qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est la prescription imp\u00e9rative des articles 755, 765, 777, 787, 795, 821 et 823 du code civil. Et l\u2019on remarquera comme chacun de ces articles insiste sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019acceptation du donataire. Sans elle, il n\u2019y a pas de contrat. La donation \u201cd\u00e9pouille le donateur\u201d seulement \u201cau moyen de l\u2019acceptation\u201d, et elle \u201cne produit d\u2019effet \u201cqu\u2019\u00e0 compter de l\u2019acceptation\u201d.\nAu contraire, en adaptant la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse \u00e0 l\u2019article 981a du code, pourvu que l\u2019on ait\n(a) une personne capable de disposer librement de ses biens,\n(b) un transport des biens,\n(c) des fiduciaires,\n(d) un document fait en la forme d\u2019une donation ou d\u2019un testament,\n(e) une stipulation de b\u00e9n\u00e9fice au profit de personnes en faveur de qui on peut faire valablement des donations ou des legs,\non a la fiducie parfaite, telle qu\u2019elle est requise par l\u2019article du code.\nL\u2019accord des volont\u00e9s est fait entre le stipulant et les fiduciaires et le contrat est form\u00e9. Le lien se cr\u00e9e avec les fiduciaires. Ce n\u2019est pas pour le stipulant, c\u2019est pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qu\u2019ils s\u2019engagent \u00e0 administrer et \u00e0 qui ils doivent compte. C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qu\u2019ils assument les obligations impos\u00e9es par l\u2019acte. M\u00eame si l\u2019on envisage comme une pollicitation la stipulation au profit du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, cela nous ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 l\u2019article 1029 du code civil et au raisonnement que nous avons fait plus haut en \u00e9tudiant ce moyen invoqu\u00e9 par les appelants.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de rapport direct entre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le donateur, qui ne prend personnellement aucun engagement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et qui a accompli tout ce qu\u2019il devait faire d\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 il a transport\u00e9 les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s aux fiduciaires. Pour prendre un exemple concret, il n\u2019y a pas de rapport direct entre Sir Mortimer Davis et Philippe Meyer Davis. Sir Mortimer oblige les \u201ctrustees\u201d \u00e0 payer une rente \u00e0 Philippe Meyer sur les fonds provenant des biens qu\u2019il transporte aux \u201ctrustees\u201d. D\u00e8s que ces derniers acceptent, Sir Mortimer est dessaisi de ces biens et ce sont les \u201ctrustees\u201d qui en \u201csont saisis\u201d (9816 C.C.). Tel est le cas dans tout contrat de fiducie fait en vertu des articles 981a C.C. et suiv. Le transport se fait \u201cpar donation ou par testament\u201d; mais il suffit d\u2019envisager la nature de ce transport pour voir qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une donation ou d\u2019un legs dans le sens jusque l\u00e0 compris dans le code, et encore moins d\u2019une donation ou d\u2019un legs auxquels on peut appli- quer les r\u00e8gles ordinaires du code civil. La personne qui cr\u00e9e le trust ne se d\u00e9pouille pas du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 entre les mains du fiduciaire, ce qui est essentiel dans la donation entre vifs ou dans le testament, tels qu\u2019on les comprend ailleurs dans le code (articles 755, 756, 777 et 873 C.C.).\nIl n\u2019y a donc pas donation ou legs aux fiduciaires, suivant l\u2019acceptation ordinaire des mots. Ce que l\u2019article 981a C.C. veut v\u00e9ritablement dire par l\u2019emploi des mots \u201cpar donation ou par testament\u201d, c\u2019est que le contrat de fiducie doit \u00eatre fait en la forme requise pour une donation ou pour un testament.\nC\u2019est l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que lui a donn\u00e9 M. le juge Demers et la Cour de R\u00e9vision dans la cause de City of Westmount v. Bishop[17], et le Conseil priv\u00e9, dans la cause de O\u2019Meara v. Bennett[18]. De m\u00eame lorsque l\u2019article 981a C.C. r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux fiduciaires comme \u201cd\u00e9positaires et administrateurs\u201d, et aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires comme \u201cdonataires ou l\u00e9gataires\u201d, il est impossible d\u2019entendre ces mots dans la pleine et enti\u00e8re acception qu\u2019ils ont dans les autres chapitres du code. Il est \u00e9vident que les fiduciaires sont toute autre chose que des d\u00e9positaires ou des administrateurs ordinaires. En fait, ils poss\u00e8dent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tous les droits du propri\u00e9taire sans en avoir le titre; et il serait oiseux de d\u00e9montrer que le titre du d\u00e9p\u00f4t, du code civil, n\u2019a qu\u2019une bien lointaine analogie avec la situation cr\u00e9\u00e9e aux \u201ctrustees\u201d par le chapitre de la fiducie.\nQuant aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires, il est clair qu\u2019ils ne sont pas des donataires ou l\u00e9gataires comme on les comprend habituellement. Ils sont, \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, des tiers au profit desquels le cr\u00e9ateur du trust a fait une stipulation. Et ce que nous venons de dire de la fiducie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral s\u2019applique tout particuli\u00e8rement au contrat en litige.\nIl est important de signaler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point, dans ce contrat, Sir Mortimer Davis s\u2019\u00e9tait, d\u00e8s la signature de l\u2019acte, compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9pouill\u00e9 et dessaisi entre les mains des \u201ctrustees\u201d de tous ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de contr\u00f4le sur les biens qu\u2019il a transport\u00e9s. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, il d\u00e9clare que ce transport est irr\u00e9vocable, et les \u201ctrustees\u201d l\u2019acceptent comme tel. De ce moment, les \u201ctrustees\u201d son absolument investis de tous les droits et de tous les pouvoirs possibles sur les biens transport\u00e9s, sauf du titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame; et Sir Mortimer leur transmet actuellement tous ces droits et pouvoirs pour \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s \u00e0 leur gr\u00e9 et suivant la plus enti\u00e8re discr\u00e9tion. Il fait seulement la r\u00e9serve que, de son vivant, les pouvoirs seront exerc\u00e9s avec son consentement; mais il ne peut plus prendre lui-m\u00eame la moindre initiative. Il ne stipule aucune condition r\u00e9solutoire. Il d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment, en vertu des termes de l\u2019acte, que le droit de retour de la \u201ctrust property\u201d ne pourra plus \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en sa faveur que si son fils, Mortimer B. Davis, et les descendants l\u00e9gitimes de ce dernier meurent avant lui, ou en faveur de sa succession, si son fils lui survit mais meurt sans laisser d\u2019enfants ou de petits-enfants.\nDisons, en passant, que l\u2019av\u00e8nement de ces conditions ne s\u2019est jamais produit en fait.\nIl ne peut m\u00eame pourvoir lui-m\u00eame au remplacement des \u201ctrustees\u201d au cas o\u00f9 il y aurait vacance. Il mentionne seulement que le rempla\u00e7ant devra recevoir son approbation.\nA tous les points de vue, les biens sont sortis de son patrimoine d\u2019une fa\u00e7on absolue et sont d\u00e9finitivement affect\u00e9s aux fins qu\u2019il a d\u00e9finies dans le contrat que les \u201ctrustees\u201d se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 accomplir. Il n\u2019est plus le ma\u00eetre. Bien plus, dans le cas particulier, le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le droit aux revenus accumul\u00e9s sont attribu\u00e9s au fils, Mortimer B. Davis et \u00e0 ses enfants n\u00e9s ou \u00e0 na\u00eetre; et Mortimer B. Davis intervient et accepte, tant en son nom qu\u2019au nom de ses enfants. En sorte que si la r\u00e9vocation de la rente constitu\u00e9e en faveur de Philippe Meyer Davis devait \u00eatre efficace, ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 Sir Mortimer que le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice devrait en retourner, mais ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice devrait aller au fils \u00e0 qui il avait c\u00e9d\u00e9 le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il s\u2019ensuit donc que, par l\u2019acte de r\u00e9vocation qui est attaqu\u00e9 dans cette cause, Sir Mortimer a pr\u00e9tendu exercer un contr\u00f4le et un droit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait plus sur les biens qu\u2019il avait transport\u00e9s, contr\u00f4le et droit incompatibles avec l\u2019acte qu\u2019il avait consenti, et dont il s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9parti sans r\u00e9serve par la force m\u00eame de cet acte.\nDans la donation ordinaire, le contrat est r\u00e9vocable tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par le donataire, parce que, dans la nature m\u00eame des choses, le donataire est alors l\u2019autre partie contractante; et tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas signifi\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 de l\u2019accepter, le contrat n\u2019est pas form\u00e9; la chose n\u2019est pas sortie du patrimoine du donateur. Il a donc encore le droit de changer d\u2019avis et de garder sa chose.\nDans le contrat de fiducie, l\u2019autre partie contractante est le fiduciaire ou le \u201ctrustee\u201d. D\u00e8s que ce dernier accepte, le transport est effectu\u00e9, complet et d\u00e9finitif. Le cr\u00e9ateur du trust est dessaisi de la chose qui en a fait l\u2019objet. Cette chose ne fait plus partie de son patrimoine. Elle est d\u00e8s lors subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019affectation qu\u2019il en a faite. Il ne peut plus la reprendre. Il ne peut avoir le droit de r\u00e9vocation que suivant les termes et les conditions qu\u2019il a fix\u00e9es.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019avis que, en vertu du contrat du 21 octobre 1922, la \u201ctrust property\u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e irr\u00e9vocablement aux \u201ctrustees\u201d, qui l\u2019ont accept\u00e9e; que le contrat s\u2019est form\u00e9 par cette acceptation sans que l\u2019intervention du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire; que la rente a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e8s lors constitu\u00e9e au profit de Philippe Meyer Davis, s\u2019il voulait s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir; et que Sir Mortimer Davis, qui s\u2019\u00e9tait dessaisi de tous ses droits et qui n\u2019avait pas stipul\u00e9 de r\u00e9serve \u00e0 cet effet, n\u2019avait pas le droit de r\u00e9vocation qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9tendu exercer.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAnother judgment was delivered by this court the same day on another appeal between the same appellants and Dame Beatrice Davis. The decision is similar as to the questions of law. This judgment is published below, as the words in the trust deed and the mode of transfer are somewhat different from those in the other deed.\nThe judgment of the court in that second appeal was delivered also by\nRinfret J.\u2014No distinction in the legal sense can be made between this case and that of Curran v. Philippe Meyer Davis in which the Court is giving judgment at the same time.\nThe words in the trust deed whereby Sir Mortimer Davis conveys the trust property and, to a certain extent, the mode of transfer itself are somewhat different from those used or adopted in the other deed. In our view, however, the legal effect is the same. The material articles of the deed read as follows:\nArticle 1. The donor subject to the conditions, payments and provisos hereinafter expressed hath by these presents given as a donation inter vivos and irrevocable unto the donee and to his children as hereinafter set out the sum of one million two hundred thousand dollars which he promises to pay and to deliver for the purposes of this gift to the said trustees on demand and any part thereof which may remain unpaid at his death shall then immediately become due and exigible. The donor reserves the right in place of paying cash to pay and to deliver to the trustees securities satisfactory to the trustees and of the value in their opinion at the time of delivery equal to the amount in cash which such securities are to take place of and in like manner the trustees may at the death of the donor should any part of the said amount hereby donated remain unpaid accept in lieu of cash securities under like conditions, all of which said property so donated is hereinafter called the \u201ctrust property.\u201d\nArticle II. Por the purposes of this gift the donor hereby promises to pay and to deliver the said trust property to the trustees in the manner expressed in the preceding paragraph and the trustees are to hold the trust property on the terms and conditions as in this donation expressed.\nArticle III. The trustees shall reduce the trust property as and when received and as demanded by them under their control and shall pay the net annual revenues derivable therefrom to the donor during his lifetime.\nArticle IV. After the death of the donor the trustees shall provide and pay as regards the trust property as follows:\n* * * * *\n\u201cTo pay to the sister of the donor, Dame Beatrice Davis, widow of the late S. Lustgarten, an annuity at the rate of five thousand dollars per annum payable during her lifetime.\u201d\nAs will have been observed, according to the terms of these articles, the donation is made \u201cunto the donee and to his children.\u201d In the Philippe Meyer Davis\u2019 case, the trust property was \u201cgiven as a donation * * *, unto the trustees.\u201d But, in both cases, the property is delivered to the trustees and held by them for the purposes of the trust \u201con the terms and conditions * * * expressed,\u201d which, so far as concerns the pertinent questions involved in the suit, are identical in the two deeds.\nThere is no doubt, therefore, that here as in the other case, Sir Mortimer Davis intended to constitute a trust under articles 981a and following of the civil code.\nUnder those articles, however, the donor must \u201cconvey\u201d the trust property; and one of the dissenting judges in the Court of King\u2019s Bench pointed out that, by the present deed, Sir Mortimer did not \u201cconvey,\u201d he only promised to pay and to deliver * * * to the said trustees, on demand; and any part thereof which may remain unpaid at his death shall then immediately become due and exigible.\nThen, again, the exact nature of the trust property is not definite. In place of paying cash the donor reserves the; right\nto pay and to deliver to the trustees securities satisfactory to the trustees and of the value in their opinion, at the time of delivery, equal to the amount in cash which such securities are to take the place of, etc.\nOn that account, the learned judge concluded there was no actual transfer of the trust property, at the time of the deed, and, therefore, no valid trust was created by the deed.\nWe have not to express any opinion as to what would be the legal situation, if matters were left in that state.\nBy article III of the deed, the trustees agreed and undertook to reduce the trust property under their control and to hold it for the purposes mentioned, \u201cas and when received and as demanded by them.\u201d It follows that the trust property would, immediately upon being received, become subject to all the terms and conditions of the trust, which would at once be binding upon the trustees. One of these conditions, whereby the trustees would be bound, is the obligation to pay to the respondent, Beatrice Davis, the annuity provided for in the deed and in respect of which she brought her action.\nNow, it must be noticed that nowhere in the written pleadings, nor throughout the trial, was it even suggested that the money was not paid to the trustees or that the securities were not delivered or, in other words, that the trust property was not conveyed to them. In fact, the trustees filed no plea and the only contestation in the proceedings was made by the testamentary executors on altogether different grounds\u2014indeed on grounds which assumed that the trust deed had taken effect. The reasons stated for opposing the action were not that the trust deed was invalid or had never become operative; but, on the contrary and amongst other points raised, the defence was that the deed had been revoked by the donor and the trustees had acquiesced in the revocation.\nWhen the point was raised in this court, Mr. Geoffrion, counsel on behalf of the respondent, stated that \u201cthe whole case must be argued on the assumption that the trustees got the money\u201d. The assertion did not bring any adverse reply from counsel for the appellants. We, therefore, take this to be the fact and, in our view, subsequent payment of the money or subsequent delivery of the securities, in compliance with the deed, was sufficient to make the trust effective and to bring it into operation. \u201cAs and when received\u201d by the trustees, the trust property became affected ipso facto by the terms and conditions of the deed. This made the trust complete and all that was said in the Philippe Meyer Davis case\u2014and which need not be repeated here\u2014thereby applied. But there is, here, a further reason to strengthen our conclusion. The persons designated as donees in the deed are Mortimer B. Davis (son of the donor), and his children. By article IX of the deed, Mortimer B. Davis\naccepts the present gift in his favour as well also in favour of his children born or to be born.\nThe acceptance by Mortimer B. Davis for himself, alone was sufficient to render the gift perfect (Art. 755 C.C.) so far at least as he was concerned and\u2014what is still more important\u2014to actually divest the donor \u201cof his ownership of the thing given\u201d (Art. 777 C.C.) and to make the gift irrevocable. By force of article 777 of the code\nthe gift of an annuity created by the deed of such gift, or of a sum of money or other indeterminate thing which the donor promises to pay or to deliver, divests the donor in the sense that he becomes the debtor of the donee.\nThrough the acceptance of Mortimer B. Davis, the promise to pay the money or to deliver the securities according to the term of the trust deed was a complete gift under the Quebec law. The consent of the parties was sufficient without the necessity of delivery (Art. 777 C.C.). The gift became a debt enforceable at the instance of Mortimer B. Davis, who thereafter had the absolute right to compel the payment or the delivery into the hands of the trustees, where it became at once subject to all the conditions of the trust. That situation persisted throughout, even if we assumed that the money was not subsequently paid to the trustees. If not paid during the life of Sir Mortimer, it became a debt of his estate. In the eye of the law Sir Mortimer was absolutely divested (Art. 777 C.C.) and could no longer hold back or retake the trust property (Arts. 779, 811 C.C.), as he attempted to do by his own unilateral act. The trustees signed the deed purporting to revoke the stipulation in favour of the respondent. They declared they were doing so for the purpose of \u201caccepting notification\u201d. They did not acquiesce. Once they had accepted the trust and, always on the assumption that it had become effective, they could not acquiesce, at least without the concurrence of all parties concerned. They were \u201cobliged to execute the trust which they (had) accepted\u201d, unless they renounced their position of trustees in accordance with the provisions of the deed or with the prescriptions of the law (Art. 981h C.C.).\nFor these reasons and also for those given in the case of Philippe Meyer Davis, we think the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, Holden, Heward & Holden.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 53 K.B. 231.\n[2] (1908) Q.R. 35 C.C. 29.\n[3] [1929] S.C.R. 234.\n[4] [1930] S.C.R. 7.\n[5] (1893) Q.R. 2 K.B. 109.\n[6] (1908) Q.R. 35 S.C. 29.\n[7] (1874) 20 L.C.J. 197.\n[8] (1908) Q.R. 35 C.C. 29.\n[9] [1931] S.C.R. 7.\n[10] (1908) Q.R. 35 S.C. 29.\n[11] (1915) 22 R.L. n.s. 355.\n[12] [1922] 1 A.C. 80.\n[13] [1931] S.C.R. 7, at 18.\n[14] (1908) Q.R. 35 S.C. 29.\n12 [1922] 1 A.C. 80.\n[15] (1908) Q.R. 35 S.C. 29.\n[16] [1920] A.C. 662, at 672.\n[17] (1915) 22 R.L. n.s. 355.\n[18] [1922] 1 A.C. 80.\n"}

V, c. 23, s. 5), 88\u2014Exchequer Court Rules 234 to 241.\nThe Crown took action in the Exchequer Court to recover from the defendant bank the amounts of certain cheques signed by the Crown\u2019s proper officers and paid by the bank and charged by it to the Crown\u2019s account, the Crown alleging that the payees\u2019 endorsements on the cheques were forged. The bank, purporting to act under rules 234 to 241 of the Exchequer Court, served a third party notice on another bank, claiming indemnity (for which claim it relied on s. 50 of the Bills of Exchange Act) against any liability, alleging that the cheques (purporting to be duly endorsed by the payees) were presented by the other bank to the defendant bank and paid by the defendant bank to it. The third party notice was set aside in the Exchequer Court. The defendant bank appealed.\nHeld (affirming the judgment below): The Exchequer Court had not jurisdiction in respect of the claim in the third party notice. Sec. 30 (d) of the Exchequer Court Act, by which that court possesses \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction\u201d in actions \u201cof a civil nature * * * in which the Crown is plaintiff\u201d did not make it competent for that court to deal with the claim in question. The proceeding against a third party on such a claim is a substantive proceeding and not a mere incident of the principal action. Rules for third party procedure are in essence rules of practice, not of law, introduced for the purposes of convenience and to prevent circuity of proceedings. Sees. 87 and 88 of the Exchequer Court Act, notwithstanding their comprehensive language, do not invest the judges of that court with power, by promulgating a rule, to enlarge the scope of the subject matters within that court\u2019s jurisdiction. Nor was the claim in question within the intendment of s. 30 (a), giving jurisdiction \u201cin all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada.\u201d\nAPPEAL by the defendant, the Bank of Montreal, from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, setting aside the third party notice herein.\nThe action was brought by the Crown, by information in the Exchequer Court of Canada, against the defendant to recover from the defendant the amounts of certain alleged cheques alleged by the plaintiff to have been wrongfully and improperly charged during the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 against the account kept by the plaintiff with the defendant, on the alleged ground that, although the cheques were signed by the proper officers of the plaintiff, the signatures of such officers were obtained by fraudulent means and that, although the cheques purported to be endorsed by the parties to whom they were made payable, the endorsements of the payees were forgeries; and that the cheques were therefore not properly chargeable against the plaintiff\u2019s account; and on the further alleged ground that by a special agreement with the plaintiff the defendant was an absolute guarantor of endorsements on all Government cheques drawn on and paid by the defendant. By third party notice, the defendant claimed, if it should be adjudged liable to the plaintiff in respect of all or any part of the amount mentioned in the information, to be indemnified by the Royal Bank of Canada (hereinafter called the \u201cthird party\u201d) against such liability and to be entitled to relief over against it, and to recover such amount from it; alleging that the cheques were presented for payment by the third party to the defendant and were paid by the defendant to it, the cheques when so presented and paid purporting to be regularly drawn upon the plaintiff\u2019s account with the defendant and purporting to be duly signed by the duly authorized officers of the plaintiff and purporting to be duly endorsed by the respective payees thereof.\nOn motion by the third party, Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court, made an order setting aside the third party notice, without prejudice to any existing right of indemnity which the defendant might have against the third party. From this order the defendant appealed to this Court.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nM. G. Powell K.C. and F. D. Hogg K.C. for the appellant.\nE. G. Gowling and D. K. MacTavish for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The Crown is proceeding by way of information for the recovery from the defendant, the Bank of Montreal, of certain sums charged by the defendant to His Majesty\u2019s account as disbursed in payment of cheques purporting to be drawn by the authority of His Majesty and duly endorsed. These cheques were signed by the proper signing officers, but the endorsements are alleged to be forged. The appellant, the Bank of Montreal, claims indemnity from the Royal Bank of Canada under section 50 of the Bills of Exchange Act:\n50. If a bill bearing a forged or unauthorized endorsement is paid in good faith and in the ordinary course of business, or by or on behalf of the drawee or acceptor, the person by whom or on whose behalf such payment is made shall have the right to recover the amount so paid from the person to whom it was so paid or from any endorser who has endorsed the bill subsequently to the forged or unauthorized endorsement if notice of the endorsement being a forged or unauthorized endorsement is given to each such subsequent endorser within the time and in the manner in this section mentioned.\n2. Any such person or endorser from whom said amount has been recovered shall have the like right of recovery against any prior endorser subsequent to the forged or unauthorized endorsement.\n3. Such notice of the endorsement being a forged or unauthorized endorsement shall be given within a reasonable time after the person seeking to recover the amount has acquired notice that the endorsement is forged or unauthorized, and may be given in the same manner, and if sent by post may be addressed in the same way, as notice of protest or dishonour of a bill may be given or addressed under this Act.\nThe appellant, accordingly, purporting to act under the Rules, 234 to 241, of the Exchequer Court, served a third party notice on the Royal Bank of Canada. The learned President of the Exchequer Court set aside this notice on the application of the Royal Bank. From this order the Bank of Montreal appeals.\nThe rule making authority exercised by the Exchequer Court is derived from sections 87 and 88 of the Exchequer Court Act, which are as follows:\n87. (1) The Judges of the Court may, from time to time, make general rules and orders,\n(a) for regulating the practice and procedure of and in the Exchequer Court;\n(b) for the effectual execution and working of this Act, and the attainment of the intention and objects thereof;\n(c) for the effectual execution and working in respect to proceedings in such Court or before such Judge, of any Act giving jurisdiction to such Court or Judge and the attainment of the intention and objects of any such Act;\n* * * *\n88. Such rules and orders may extend to any matter of procedure or otherwise, not provided for by any Act, but for which it is found necessary to provide in order to ensure their proper working and the better attainment of the objects thereof.\n2. Copies of all such rules and orders shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament within ten days after the opening of the session next after the making thereof.\n3. All such rules and orders and every portion of the same not inconsistent with the express provisions of any Act shall have and continue to have force and effect as if herein enacted, unless during such session an address of either the Senate or House of Commons shall be passed for the repeal of the same or of any portion thereof, in which case the same or such portion shall be and become repealed: Provided that the Governor in Council may, by proclamation, published in the Canada Gazette, or either House of Parliament may, by any resolution passed at any time within thirty days after such rules and orders have been laid before Parliament, suspend any rule or order made under this Act; and such rule or order shall, thereupon, cease to have force and effect until the end of the then next session of Parliament.\nWe have no doubt that, notwithstanding the comprehensive language of these sections, they do not invest the judges of the Exchequer Court with power, by promulgating a rule, to enlarge the scope of the subject matters within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. The question of substance is whether the claim of the appellant set forth in the third party notice under section 50 of the Bills of Exchange Act is a claim in respect of which the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is defined by section 30 of the Act which, in so far as material, is in these words:\n30. The Exchequer Court shall have and possess concurrent original jurisdiction in Canada\n(a) in all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada, including actions, suits and proceedings by way of information to enforce penalties and proceedings by way of information in rem, and as well in qui tam suits for penalties or forfeiture as where the suit is on behalf of the Crown alone;\n* * * *\n(d) in all other actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner.\nThe principal contention of counsel for the appellants was that, the proceeding under the information being an action or suit \u201cof a civil nature * * * in which the Crown is plaintiff * * *,\u201d the Court has, by the explicit words of the section, \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction\u201d with the courts of the provinces,\u2014in this case with the Supreme Court of Ontario, in which province the cause of action arose. In such an action, that court would have jurisdiction to try and give judgment upon such a claim as that presented by the third party notice, and it is argued therefore that the Exchequer Court is invested with a like jurisdiction.\nWe cannot accede to this ingenious argument. The Supreme Court of Ontario has jurisdiction, by virtue of the statutes and rules by which it is governed, to entertain and dispose of claims in what are known as third party proceedings. Claims for indemnity, for example, from a third party, by a defendant in respect of the claim in the principal action against him, can be preferred and dealt with in the principal action. But there can be no doubt that the proceeding against the third party is a substantive proceeding and not a mere incident of the principal action. These rules are in essence rules of practice, not of law, introduced for the purposes of convenience and to prevent circuity of proceedings. We think, therefore, that section 30, in virtue of the sub-paragraph mentioned, by which the Exchequer Court possesses \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction * * * in * * * actions * * * of a civil nature * * * in which the Crown is plaintiff,\u201d does not make it competent to the Exchequer Court to deal with the claim in question.\nThe remaining point concerns the language of sub-paragraph (a) by force of which the Court is given jurisdiction\nin all cases relating to the revenue in which it is sought to enforce any law of Canada * * *\nWe do not doubt that the words \u201cto enforce any law of Canada\u201d would have, standing alone, sufficient scope to include a claim under section 50 of the Bills of Exchange Act. No doubt the principal action is strictly within the words \u201ccases relating to the revenue.\u201d There is also, no doubt, a sense in which the third party claim relates to the revenue since it is a claim to have the third party indemnify the defendant in respect of a debt which the defendant is called upon to pay to the Crown. There is a great deal to be said also on grounds of convenience in favour of investing the Court with jurisdiction to entertain such claims for indemnity. On the whole, however, we think, having regard to the context, that this claim is not within the intendment of sub-paragraph (a).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Powell & Matheson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n"}

Hyland, [1933] S.C.R. 317\nDate: 1933-02-07.\nCity of Halifax and Harry Kitz (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nMary Hyland (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1932: October 17, 18; 1933: February 7.\nPresent: Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Land offered at tax sale bid in by municipality \u2014Alleged offer of redemption\u2014Alleged misrepresentation by municipal official preventing redemption\u2014Claim to have conveyance by municipality set aside and for right of redemption\u2014Conflict of testimony.\nAPPEAL by the defendants the City of Halifax and Kitz from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] which reversed the judgment of Graham J.1 in favour of the defendants.\nCertain property owned by the plaintiff, on which taxes were in arrear, had been, pursuant to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter, offered for sale by public auction by the Collector of Taxes for the City of Halifax and, there being no bidders, had been bid in for the City by the Collector, pursuant to s. 466 of the Charter. The last day for redemption, under s. 458 (1) of the Charter, was July 6, 1929.\nOn July 5, 1929, (the day before the last day for redemption), the defendant Kitz, who wished to purchase the property, attended at the Collector\u2019s office, gave his cheque for the amount which the City would require for redemption of the property, and an assignment of the City\u2019s rights in the property was made out to him, and signed by the Mayor and City Clerk. The assignment was not delivered to Kitz at that time but was kept in the Assistant Collector\u2019s desk. Receipts were given to Kitz for the amount, reading as follows: \u201cReceived from Mary Hyland per H. Kitz the sum of * * * dollars.\u201d\nAt a time subsequent to the last day for redemption the City conveyed the property to Kitz. On the morning of July 6, 1929, the last day for redemption, the plaintiff\u2019s son, William Hyland, went to the City Hall. One Smith, who, it was stated, was going to put up the money to redeem the property, also went there. Hyland met the Collector\u2019s Assistant, Young, in the hallway and asked him about the property, and said he wanted to redeem it. Young asked him to go inside, when he would look up the sale book and give him full information on it. Hyland and Young went into the office, Smith remaining out in the hall, and there was a conflict of evidence between Young and Hyland as to what occurred in the office. In the appeal to this Court, the case turned on the question, on conflicting evidence, as to what was said in the conversation in the office between Hyland and Young.\nThe plaintiff alleged that her agent attended at the Collector\u2019s office on the forenoon of the last day for redemption and stated that the plaintiff was prepared to pay the amount required for redemption, but was informed that it was too late to redeem, that the property had been already sold to Kitz; and that as a result of this false representation the amount required for redemption was not paid. These allegations were denied. Young, in his evidence, stated that he got the sales book out, turned up the page where the sale of the property was recorded, told Hyland that a transfer had been made out to Kitz, and that if they did not redeem before the time expired, a deed would be made out and given to Kitz afterwards, that he made out a full memorandum of the amount necessary to redeem and gave it to Hyland.\nThe action was brought for a declaration that the conveyance of the property by the City to Kitz was null and void and for a declaration giving the plaintiff the right to redeem on payment of the amount owing for taxes, and (by amendment) alternatively for damages.\nThe trial had been commenced before Harris C.J., who heard all the witnesses except Young. Harris C.J. having been taken ill during an adjournment of the trial, the case was taken over by Graham J., who decided it upon the record of the trial as far as it had proceeded before Harris C.J., and upon the evidence of Young heard by himself. He accepted Young\u2019s version, rather than Hyland\u2019s, of what was said, as being the more probable. He dismissed the action[2]. His judgment was reversed by the Court en banc, which gave judgment for the plaintiff (Ross J. dissenting)2.\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing argument of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment, allowing the defendants\u2019 appeal and restoring the judgment of the trial judge. Crocket J. dissented.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by Smith J., who, after discussing the evidence at length, stated that he could see no reason for reversing the finding of the trial judge, who heard Young\u2019s testimony as to what was said, and accepted it; looking at the whole situation, it was difficult to find any reason for doubting the accuracy of Young\u2019s testimony. (In the course of his discussion of the evidence, and dealing with the remark in the judgment of the Court en banc that \u201cThis is certain, that Hyland and Smith went to the City Hall on the morning of July 6 for the purpose of redeeming the property and Smith was prepared and ready to pay the amount,\u201d Smith J. stated that he was satisfied upon the evidence that Smith and Hyland, on the morning of the 6th, went to the Collector\u2019s office merely for the purpose of ascertaining the correct amount required, and not for the purpose of then and there paying it, that Smith was not prepared or ready to pay it, and had no intention of paying it on that particular visit.)\nDealing with the assignment made out to Kitz on July 5, Smith J. agreed with the Court en banc that the City had no power to make it, but pointed out that the transaction was in accordance with a not unusual practice which was thought by the city officials to be legal and proper, and did not indicate any ill motive; the assignment was a mere nullity, and, whether a nullity or not, had no bearing on the right to redeem. As to the particular form of the receipts given to Kitz, in view of the undoubted facts of the matter no weight should be attached to it; there was no ground for holding that the payment by Kitz was made for the benefit of the owner.\nCrocket J. dissented. He discussed the facts at length. He pointed out that, having regard to the fact that the learned trial judge did not have the advantage of person- ally hearing the testimony of Hyland or of Smith and professedly based his finding wholly on the balance of probability, there was no objection to the Court en banc freely reviewing that finding on a pure question of fact or to this Court now doing so. He stated that, after carefully considering the evidence in all its details and the reasons stated in the judgments of the learned trial judge and of the Court en banc for their opposite findings upon the question, he had reached the same conclusion as the majority of the appeal judges that Hyland\u2019s was the true version of what took place, and that Young by his statements prevented Hyland from paying the money to redeem the property; a tender was unnecessary under the circumstances. (Nocton v. Lord Ashburton[3], cited). Derry v. Peek[4] is not an authority for the proposition that an action for damages for misrepresentation without an actual intention to deceive may not lie in a proper case (Nocton v. Lord Ashburton[5]) (Swinfen v. Lord Chelmsford[6] cited). If Young made the false representation and prevented Hyland from paying the money to redeem the property, the City ought to be required to make good whatever loss the plaintiff had thereby suffered; that the City was liable for the misrepresentation and its consequences admitted of no doubt in the circumstances disclosed (Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[7]; Percy v. Glasgow Corporation[8]).\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nF. H. Bell K.C. for appellants.\nB.

(Definition of \u201cconcentrator,\u201d within s. 40 (4), in Re Mclntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd. and Morgan, 49 Ont. L.R. 214, at 218, adopted and applied). The Act aims at exempting such means as may be adopted at the mining location to aid in the concentrating of the ore mass.\nThe scope of the exemption in said s. 40 (4) of \u201cthe buildings, plant and machinery in, on or under mineral land, and used mainly for obtaining minerals from the ground,\u201d discussed, with regard to the general scheme of taxation as disclosed in s. 40 (4), (5) and (6). Held, that said exemption covers all buildings, plant and machinery (situated upon mineral lands) which form an essential part of the system actively in operation in obtaining the minerals, and is not confined to what is used directly in getting out the minerals.\nBuildings, plant and machinery held exempt in the present case included (inter alia): a \u201cchange house,\u201d boiler house and heating system, power line, electric railway, powder magazine, and a \u201cconveyor system\u201d (to transport sand or gravel to fill in the space left in the mine by extraction of rock; and including, inter alia, compressor house, locomotive and cars, electric shovel, railway track, power transmission lines, and conveyor equipment, including steel towers, cables, buckets, etc.)\nNo appeal lies from a decision of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board under s. 83 of said Act on a question of fact; therefore where the Board has found as a fact that lands in question were mineral lands within the meaning of s. 40 (4), an appellate court (if finding no error of law or of statute construction involved in the Board\u2019s finding) is precluded from interfering with such finding.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., [1931] O.R. 640, affirmed, on above grounds. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario [1] dismissing an appeal by the present appellant and allowing an appeal by the present respondent from an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board on appeals to the said Board from decisions of His Honour Judge Caron, Judge of the District Court of the District of Temiskaming, in respect of assessment by the appellant township for the year 1929 of certain property of the respondent mining company.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in dispute are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nPeter White K.C. and G.H. Gauthier for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and P.C. Finlay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the First Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario1 dismissing an appeal by the present appellant and allowing an appeal by the present respondent from an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board delivered on the 28th of October, 1930, on appeals to the said Board by both the appellant and the respondent from decisions of His Honour Judge Caron, delivered in September, 1929, in respect of assessment by the appellant township for the year 1929 of certain property of the respondent mining company.\nSection 83 (6) of chap. 238, R.S.O., 1927, enacts that\nAn appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law or the construction of a statute, * * *.\nThe disputed assessments are in respect to land, including the buildings, plant and machinery thereon.\nThe respondent claims:\n(1) that it is not assessable under section 40, subsection 4, of same Act, which reads as follows:\n40 (4). The buildings, plant and machinery in, on or under mineral land, and used mainly for obtaining minerals from the ground, or storing the same, and concentrators and sampling plant, and, subject to subsection 8, the minerals in, on or under such land, shall not be assessable.\nand (2) that it is not assessable with respect to chattel property, and\n(3) that, in any case, property situated on the land of other owners was not legally assessed at all by the appellant.\nThe questions as to whether or not the buildings, plant and machinery are in or on mineral land, and are used mainly for obtaining minerals from the ground, or form part of the concentrators, are not exclusively of fact. The Ontario Railway and Municipal Board having found that the property attempted to be assessed is situate on \u201cmineral land,\u201d it seems, as found by the Supreme Court of Ontario, that, upon the evidence adduced and the findings of the Board, we would be precluded from interfering therewith, if we agree, in law, with their view as to the meaning of the statute. The construction of a statutory enactment is a question of law, while the question of whether the particular matter or thing is of such a nature or kind as to fall within the legal definition of its term is a question of fact.\nThe County Judge and the Board have also found that the slimes disposal system formed part of the \u201cconcentrators,\u201d which are not defined by the Act, but were defined by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, in Re Mclntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd. and Morgan [2], as follows: Any process the purpose of which is the separation of the valuable mineral from the dross is a concentrating process, and the buildings and plant used for that purpose are, within the meaning of subsection 4, a concentrator. We feel that this should also apply to the machinery used to dispose of the refuse in this case. The Assessment Act, in this particular, aims at exempting such means as may be adopted at the mining location to aid in the concentrating of the ore mass. It is for the court to interpret the statute as best they can.\nNow, upon the evidence and the unanimous findings of the District Judge, the Railway Board and the Appellate Division, the fact must be recognized that this disposal system of the slimes from which the mineral has been extracted is an absolutely essential part of the effective separation of the minerals from the dross. Without such system, it would be impossible to continue operating the mine, which would become choked with refuse; and the obtaining of minerals from the ground would be stopped.\nAnother large item in dispute is the conveyor system and the buildings, plant and machinery in connection therewith, which is $147,614, $140,389 of which assessment is in appeal, the respondent accepting the assessment of $6,770 on three buildings and the assessment of $454 on the change house at the gravel pit. The respondent excavates 4,400 tons of mineral bearing rock per day; and, in order to avoid a collapse of the whole work, they have to fill the vacant space left by the rock excavated, in order to continue the mining operations. In view of the nature of the tailings which are slimes the respondent has to fill back with sand or gravel, which is carried by an overhead conveyor from sand claims located at more than two miles from the workings.\nThe sand is mined on the \u201cSand Claims,\u201d being dug out of the side of the bank by an electrically operated shovel, as the bank recedes it is moved nearer the bank so as to be always near enough to load the sand from the face of the bank to the cars on the other side. The cars into which the sand is loaded are a special type of side dump cars which are heated in the winter time. These cars are on a narrow gauge railway track laid on ties and sleepers, and as the sand bank recedes the track must be moved continuously towards the bank. These cars are drawn along the railway by the dinky locomotive from the electrically operated shovel to the lower hopper into which the sand is dumped. From this hopper there is a belt conveyor which inclines down to another hopper which is covered with bars for screening, and a belt comes from the under side of one hopper to the upper side of the other in order to elevate the sand and get it in the bottom of the hopper. The sand is loaded from the hopper by machinery into the buckets which are attached to the conveyor and carried to the central shaft.\nThe compressor house referred to in the Assessment Schedule houses the compressor which is used for the purpose of operating the loading gate and the gate in the hopper that loads the buckets. The oil house on the \u201cSand Claims\u201d is used for storing oil in drums. The gravel load- ing station, face of gravel bin, is a galvanized iron shed placed in front of the bin to protect men from the weather and rain. The 6 H.T. Transformers are used for transforming the high tension current to 500 V. for use by the electric shovel and driving the compressor. The one\u2011third power transmission line to the shovel is carried on poles with a short piece of cable from the pole to the electric shovel. This is movable as of necessity as the electrically operated shovel is a caterpillar type and moves around under its own power.\nThe sand is transported from the \u201cSand Claims\u201d to the central shaft in detachable buckets carried on an endless cable hung over wheels attached to two sides of four cornered steel towers. The full bucket runs along one side to the central shaft where it is dumped and returns along the other side to the \u201cSand Claims\u201d to be refilled. The steel towers are approximately 350 feet apart and rest on small concrete foundations to which they are bolted, all of which is movable.\nThe power transmission line to the plant, including poles, insulators and all overhead equipment, all of which is movable, parallels the conveyor system and runs between the Hollinger Mines and the transformer station at the \u201cSand Claims\u201d and furnishes the power to operate the conveyor and the necessary power used to mine and load sand in the buckets.\nThe owners of the mining properties between the \u201cSand Claims\u201d and the central shaft have never given the respondent permission to install, operate or maintain the conveyor system and power transmission line. The respondent intended to purchase a right-of-way but to date has not done so.\nThe question as to whether the properties assessed or on which the buildings, plant and machinery are found are \u201cmineral lands\u201d is one of fact, as well as that whether or not any particular substance is a \u201cmineral\u201d within the meaning of the statute in which the word is used, there being no definition in the Act. (Union Natural Gas Company of Canada v. Corporation of the Township of Dover[3].) We agree with the late Mr. Justice Grant of the Appellate Division, when he says[4]: Upon the evidence which was adduced, and upon the findings made by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, it appears to me quite clear that the Board must be taken to have decided that the lands in question were mineral lands, within the meaning of section 40, subsection 4; and as their finding in that regard is one of fact, this Court is precluded from interfering therewith.\nThe respondent\u2019s buildings, plant and machinery, although being on mineral lands, must also, to be exempted, unless they form part of the concentrators or sampling plant, be \u201cused mainly for obtaining minerals from the ground or storing the same.\u201d\nThe Appellate Division reached the conclusion that the Legislature intended to relieve from municipal taxation all buildings, plant and machinery, situate upon mineral lands, which form an essential part of the system actively in operation in obtaining the minerals. Counsel for the appellant contends that the section covers only that which was used directly in getting out the minerals.\nThe provisions of subsections 4, 5 and 6 of section 40 indicate that the Legislature, in enacting them, provided a plan of taxation which would be equitable and just as between the owner of agricultural land and the owner of mineral lands. It is not mineral lands which are made non-assessable, but the minerals in, on or under such lands. Both farming lands and mineral lands are assessable at their actual value; but, in the case of mineral lands, their assessed value must not include anything of the value of buildings, etc., used for the purposes mentioned in subsection 4 nor of the value of minerals in, on, or under such land; provided also that they must be assessed at not less than the value of farming land in use in the neighbourhood.\nIn lieu of the assessment of such buildings, concentrators, minerals, etc., at their actual value, it is provided by subsection 6 that the income from a mine or mineral work shall be assessed by, and the tax leviable thereon shall be paid to, the municipality in which such mine or mineral work is situated. Therefore, under the general scheme of the Act, mineral land, whether worked or unworked, is taxable without reference to the minerals in them; but, when worked, the minerals as such are taxable indirectly on the basis of the income derived from the mine or mineral work, and therefore the exemption clause covers all buildings, plants and other elements of the system used to obtain such income from the mining property. Having explained our view of the law, we now have to dispose accordingly of the assessments in controversy before us:\nI.\n(a) The Change House, $2,900, is a building erected on the respondent\u2019s property to provide accommodation for the men employed in the mine conveniently to dry and change their clothes and for washing, in pursuance of rule 113 of sec. 161 of the Mining Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 45. This being required by law in order to properly conduct its mining operations, we agree with the Appellate Division that, being used solely by workmen who obtain minerals from the ground, this Change House is not assessable.\n(b) Boiler House and Heating System, $1,500. This is located near the Change House for the purpose of providing it with heat and water and to provide heat for the Shaft House and the Hoist Room, at the head of the shaft. At the argument, this Court agreed with the Appellate Division that these items also came within the exemption.\nII.\nSlimes Disposal System, Electric Railway, Powder Magazine, etc.\n(a) Pump House and machinery, transformers, pipe line and installation, $34,430.\nThis assessment was disallowed by the District Judge, by the Railway Board and by the Appellate Division, for the reasons above stated; and we see no reason to change their finding.\n(b) Power Lines and Equipment, $3,387.\n(c) Electric Railway to Pump House and Powder Magazine, $6,726.\n(d) Powder Magazine, $5,011.\nHeating System, $2,262.\nTelephone System to disposal plant, $50, (not in appeal).\nThe power line carries power to operate the electrically operated shovel; the powder magazine is used to store explosives used to obtain minerals from the ground; the electric heating system is used for keeping the powder maga- zine at a constant temperature. The electric railway was erected to furnish transportation from the main shaft of the Hollinger Mine to the McKay Veteran Claim; it parallels the Launder and is used principally to transport explosives from the powder magazine to the mining shafts and supplies to the pump house and other apparatus on the McKay Veteran Claim. These items must be considered as non-assessable as forming part of the plant and machinery used for obtaining minerals from the ground or as part of the concentrator.\nIII.\nGravel Conveyor System\n(a) We are not concerned with the assessment of three dwellings ($6,770) and Change House ($455), as no appeal was taken from these assessments.\n(b) Compressor House, Right of Way, Oil House, Gravel Loading Station, Transformers, Locomotive and Cars, Electric Shovel, Railway Track, Power Transmission Lines and Conveyor Equipment, including steel towers, cables, buckets., etc., $140,389.\nAs explained above, all the items included in the assessment known as the Conveyor System are necessary to transport sand or gravel to the grounds to fill in the vacant space left in the mine by the rock extracted; and it was clearly proven that the mining operation could not be carried on unless the excavations were filled. R.E. Dye, mining engineer, swears that\nit would be impossible to mine the ore entirely out without filling the openings made by removal of the ore. Otherwise the walls would collapse, and the ore could not * * * be reached without sand or some suitable filling work.\nAnd Mr. J.H. Stovel, General Superintendent of the Dome Mine, also states that the sole purpose of these operations is to enable the respondent\nto extract the ore or mineral-bearing rock from the mine.\nThis conveyor system is therefore not liable to assessment, as it is on mineral land; and the evidence is conclusive that it is necessary to the extraction of mineral by the respondent. It is not necessary, in view of our decision on the first point, to deal with the other grounds urged by the respondent.\nWe therefore reach the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gordon H.

This certainty as to duration must appear from the express limitation of the parties or from reference to some collateral matter\u2014itself certain or capable of being made so before the renewal lease takes effect\u2014which may, with equal certainty, be applied in measurement of the continuance of the term.\nIn the present case (where the lease was of certain rooms and hallway in the lessor\u2019s building which adjoined the lessee\u2019s hotel, the leased premises being used in connection with the hotel) it was held that the language used shewed that the intention was to provide for a right of renewal for such period as the lessees should need the use of the rooms for purposes specified, and that, as there was nothing in the covenant which enabled the court to determine the duration of the lessees\u2019 need for the rooms, the covenant was too indefinite to be enforced, and was therefore void for uncertainty. (Semble, had the provision been for renewal \u201cfor such further term as the lessees may request or demand,\u201d it would not have offended against the rule requiring certainty, for the duration of the term would be made certain by the request or demand for renewal.)\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Orde J.A.) held that the renewal provisions contained in a certain lease were too indefinite to be of legal effect. The renewal provisions in question are set out in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.W. Pickup for the appellants.\nG.W. Mason K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is a friendly action and the facts are not in dispute. The question involved in the appeal is the proper construction of a covenant in a lease made between the appellants and the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title which provides for its renewal. The covenant reads as follows:\u2014\nIt is hereby agreed that this Lease and the term hereby created shall at the option of the Lessees be renewed (1) for such further term as the Lessees may require the said bedrooms and the hallway for use in connection with the said hotel, and whether used as an hotel, boarding-house or apartment house; (2) and for such further term as shall correspond with the term of any lease that may be given by the said Lessees to any tenant in respect of the said hotel premises and (3) thereafter from time to time so long as the said bedrooms may be required for hotel, boarding-house or apartment house purposes at a rental equivalent to one-eighth part or portion of the rental received from time to time for the said hotel, boarding-house or apartment house.\nThe numbers (1), (2) and (3) set out above are not in the covenant but were inserted by the trial judge for convenience, and have been here retained.\nThe leased premises consist of sixteen bedrooms and a hallway in the respondent\u2019s building immediately adjoining the appellants\u2019 hotel in the Town of Lindsay, Ontario, and have, for some years, been used in connection with the hotel.\nThe respondent contends that \u201cthe covenant is too vague and indefinite to create a right of renewal, that it does not give the appellant any such right and is void for uncertainty.\u201d On the other hand the appellants submit that so long as the term of each renewal lease can be made certain at the time the lessees call for it, that is sufficient to meet all the requirements of the law regarding certainty.\nIt has been long established that a covenant in a lease, which provides for a renewal of the term, in order to be valid must designate with reasonable certainty the date of the commencement and the duration of the term to be granted. This certainty as to duration must appear from the express limitation of the parties or from reference to some collateral matter\u2014itself certain or capable of being made so before the lease takes effect\u2014which may, with equal certainty, be applied in measurement of the continuance of the term.\nThe trial judge construed the clause as being sufficiently certain to give the appellants, as lessees, a right of renewal. He said:\u2014\nI think a reasonable and proper construction to put upon this language is that the lessees are entitled, and, of course, bound, to indicate, so far as this particular part of the covenant is concerned, when applying for the renewal, the precise period during which they will \u201crequire\u201d the demised premises for use in connection with the hotel.\nHe thus construed the first part of the covenant, that is (1), as though it read: \u201cFor such further term as the lessees may request or demand.\u201d Had that been the language of the clause, it would not, in my opinion, have offended against the rule requiring certainty, for the duration of the term would be made certain by the request or demand for renewal. That, however, is not the language of the clause. The term provided for in (1) is\nsuch further term as the lessees may require the said bedrooms and the hallway for use in connection with the said hotel,\nwhether it is used as a hotel, boarding-house or apartment house. While that provided for in (2) and (3) is the period covered by a lease or leases granted by the lessees from time to time so long as the bedrooms may be required for hotel, boarding-house or apartment house purposes. It is the phrases \u201crequire * * * for use\u201d and \u201cmay be required for hotel, boarding\u2011house or apartment house purposes\u201d which manifest the purport of the words \u201crequire\u201d and \u201crequired,\u201d and shew that the notion expressed is rather that of \u201cneed\u201d than that of \u201crequest\u201d or \u201cdemand.\u201d I think it is quite clear from the language used that what the parties had in mind was to provide for a right of renewal for such period as the lessees should need the use of the rooms for the purposes specified. As there is nothing in the covenant which enables us to determine the duration of the lessees\u2019 need for the rooms, the covenant is too indefinite to permit of its being enforced. It is therefore void for uncertainty.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: R.I.

In this cove the respondent had set a salmon trap net under licence from the Department of Marine and Fisheries, the leader of the net being attached to the breakwater. Dredging operations were being carried on in the vicinity of the Department of Public Works under the supervision and direction of one of its officers. The tug A., hired by the Crown, whilst moving a loaded scow to the dumping grounds, came into contact with the respondent\u2019s net, seriously damaging it. The action is to recover the value or cost of repairing the net and the loss of its use for about one month.\nHeld that the Exchequer Court of Canada had jurisdiction to hear the case. According to the circumstances, the master and crew of the tug A., the crew of the scow and the master and crew of the dredge were servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their \u201cduties of employment\u201d upon a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nHeld, also, that the accident was attributable to the negligence of the servants of the Crown in the management of the tug and scow under the circumstances and conditions existing at the time of the accident, and that the respondent was entitled to damages for the injury caused to his net and damages for the loss of its use. Held, further, that, upon the evidence, the respondent\u2019s net was not an interference with navigation within the meaning of section 33 of the Fisheries Act. That section should not be interpreted as relieving those in charge of any vessels of the duty to exercise due care to avoid damage to the property of others, whether that property constitutes an obstruction to navigation or not.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1933] Ex. C.R. 1) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1), maintaining the respondent\u2019s petition of right with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nH. McInnes K.C. and F. P. Varcoe K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], adjudging that the suppliant was entitled to recover from His Majesty the King the sum of $1,500 and costs as compensation for damages claimed to have been sustained by him through the partial destruction of a salmon trap-net by a tug boat and scow while employed in dredging operations in the vicinity of a breakwater at Livingston\u2019s Cove, Antigonish Co., N.S., during the summer of 1930.\nAlthough the jurisdiction of the court does not appear to have been challenged on the trial or in the appellant\u2019s factum on this appeal, objection was taken on the argument before us that the case was one which did not fall within the terms of clause (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C., c. 34. If it did not there is no other clause or provision of the Act which empowers that court to entertain a petition in such a case as the evidence discloses. The jurisdictional point, therefore, turns entirely upon the construction of that clause, which, enumerating one of the matters the court \u201cshall have original jurisdiction to hear and determine,\u201d reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nMr. Varcoe contended that the captain and crew in charge of the tug and scow were not in the circumstances servants of the Crown, and that the work in which they were engaged was not a public work within the meaning of this clause.\nIt was expressly admitted by counsel for the Crown at the trial before the learned president of the court that the breakwater in question was owned by the Crown in right of the Dominion; that the dredging operations were being carried on by the Federal Department of Public Works under the supervision and direction of an officer of that department, and that the tug and crew were employed in the operation and under the direction of the officer in charge. John Nickerson, an officer of the Public Works Department, testifying as a witness for the Crown, stated that the tug was hired by the department, and was acting in this operation under the direction of the man in charge of the dredge for the department. In view of the course taken at the trial, we do not think it is now open to the Crown to contend that the captain and crew of the tug and the men on the scow were not, at the time of the grievance complained of, servants of the Crown acting within the scope of their \u201cduties or employment,\u201d within the meaning of section 19 (c).\nIt was in reference, however, to the contention that the work in which they were engaged was not a public work within the meaning of clause (c) that the objection was chiefly stressed. The case of Paul v. The King[2], relied upon by the appellant, considered the clause before the amendment of 1917 (7-8 Geo V, c. 23) effected a very material change in its meaning, as pointed out by Mignault J. in The Wolfe Company v. The King[3], and by the same learned judge in delivering the judgment of this court in The King v. Schrobounst[4]. The latter case decides that the words \u201cupon any public work,\u201d as they now appear in the subsection, are not to be given the restricted meaning which they bore before the amendment, and that a claim for personal injuries caused by the negligence of the driver of a motor truck, the property of the Crown, while transporting workmen in the employment of a department of the Government of Canada to a public work being carried on by that department, fell within the meaning of the subsection. We think that this claim also falls within its terms, and that the words \u201cupon any public work,\u201d as now used in the clause, are not to be limited to a physical structure belonging to the Government, and that they are broad enough to comprehend, at least, a dredging operation such as that with which we are concerned, and which was being carried on in a defined area.\nIt was not disputed that the tug and scow on the occasion in question came into contact with the net and so damaged it as to render it altogether useless until repaired and to necessitate the suspension of the suppliant\u2019s fishing operations until he could replace it, so that, with the admissions above referred to, the whole controversy between the parties on the trial as to liability may be said to have been confined substantially to the question of the alleged negligent navigation of the tug, and whether or not the suppliant in a conversation he had with the captain of the dredge a few days before the accident, when the latter asked him to move his net, had agreed to accept the risk of any injury resulting from the collision of the tug with the net in its then existing position.\nAlthough the Crown contended that the suppliant\u2019s net was an unlawful hindrance to navigation, no question was raised that the suppliant had not a valid licence, issued under the authority of the Dominion Fisheries Act, for the berth in which it was placed, or that the net was set off the Government wharf in practically the same position and in precisely the same manner as it had been under similar licences issued to the suppliant annually since the year 1923. The fishery inspector for the district, whose duty it was to countersign all licences issued in the district and to see to the observance of all fishery laws and regulations therein, testified that he saw the net and leader set and that they were set absolutely in the manner prescribed in the licence, though some question appears to have been raised as to whether the licence itself authorized the attachment of the rope to the wharf and as to the precise direction the rope and leader thence followed, the captain of the tug having sketched a plan shewing the direction more northwesterly than the suppliant claimed.\nA departmental plan in evidence shews the breakwater running almost due west from the shore line with the wharf at the westerly end, the length of the whole structure being about 376 feet. The wharf is about 40 feet wide and forms a rectangular jog on the southerly side of the breakwater about 90 or 100 feet east of the face of the wharf.\nThe dredging was being done along the south side of the wharf and breakwater to secure a depth of 8 feet at low water O.S.T., for the purpose, it seems, of affording shelter for boats and crafts of shallow draught.\nOn the day in question the dredge was working behind the jog close to the south side of the breakwater. It had a scow filled with dredged material ready for towing to the dumping ground more than half a mile northwest of the breakwater. The tug, which had been employed in the work for about two weeks for the purpose of towing the scows to the dumping ground and returning them to the dredge, and which drew about 9 feet aft and 5 feet forward, having received its signal from the dredge during the afternoon when the tide was within about half an hour of dead low water, as the evidence clearly shews, proceeded into the breakwater, bow on, and, after getting its anchor line fastened to the laden scow, backed out beyond the west end of the wharf with her tow in a northwesterly direction to get into position to pull the scow around the outer end of the breakwater and out to the deep water for dumping. There was no dispute about these facts, and it was common ground that it was during this manoeuvring that the scow drifted or swung down on the net.\nThe tug captain swore that only the scow ran into the net, but another witness, McEachern, a local seaman, employed in the operations, who saw the accident, swore that the scow and tug both ran into it.\nThere was a tide of 4 feet in the cove. The plan, prepared by the department for the dredging operations, shewed two lines of soundings running from the southwest corner of the wharf a distance of 300 feet\u2014one in prolongation of the south side of the wharf almost due west, and the other southwest. The first of these lines shewed depth markings varying from 7 feet 8 inches at the face of the wharf to 13 feet 3 inches and the second from 8 feet 2 inches to 9 feet 8 inches. There was evidence that between these two courses there was a channel of 12 feet depth, and that this and the other tugs previously employed in the work usually backed out in a westerly or southwesterly direction and that in such a movement there would be no danger of the tug or scow running into the net; that there was ample sea-room for both tug and scow to move out from inside the breakwater towards the southwest, and that had they done so they would not have drifted on the net as they did. There was also the evidence of one of the two men employed on the scow that the scow\u2019s anchor first caught the net and that the tug swung around on top of the net at a point roughly half way out on the leader.\nThe contention of the Crown, of course, was that there was no negligence in the management of the tug or scow, and that the damage was wholly attributable to the conditions of tide, current and wind prevailing at the time.\nThe learned president found that if the conditions of wind, current and tide were such as described by the tug captain, the tow should not have commenced when it did, and that in any event, when it was found that the tug and tow were likely to drift upon the net, the scow, which was equipped with anchors, at least should have anchored, and that the collision would thereby have been avoided.\nI am rather disposed to think (His Lordship states in his reasons), that conditions were not quite so unfavourable as described by the master of the tug; I do not think they were very unusual or occasioned any real difficulty in handling the tow. I am unable to appreciate just why the tug and tow could not emerge from behind the breakwater upon such a course as would compensate for the counteracting forces of wind and current, and had this been done, and I believe it might have been done, the accident would have been avoided. Upon this aspect of the case, I therefore think the accident was attributable to the negligence of the servants of the respondent,\nwhich sufficiently shews that the negligence to which he attributed the damage was negligence in the management of the tug and scow in the circumstances and conditions as he believed them to exist. We are of opinion that the evidence discloses ample justification for this finding. This being so, it is a matter of no consequence whether the suppliant had or had not the right to attach his leader to the wharf in the manner above indicated. It was contended by the Crown that he was not authorized to do so, and that his net was therefore an unlawful obstruction to navigation. It is quite evident, as the learned president points out, that the fact of the rope being tied to the wharf had no causal connection with the damage, and that the same thing as did happen would have happened had the leader been attached to a rock or pole in the water immediately adjacent to the wharf, as the suppliant undoubtedly had a right to attach it.\nThe fact of the damage having been proved to have been caused by the negligent navigation of the tug also renders it unnecessary to consider the argument which Mr. McInnes addressed to us on his submission that the licence conferred no right to put the leader and trap in such a position as to interfere with navigation, and that the tug\u2019s rights of navigation in the waters in question were paramount to the suppliant\u2019s rights of fishery under his licence from the Fisheries Department of the Government. It is sufficient to say that the learned president found upon the evidence that the suppliant\u2019s net was not an interference with navigation, and that in no view can s. 33 of the Fisheries Act be properly interpreted as relieving those in charge of any vessels of the duty to exercise due care to avoid damage to the property of others, whether that property\u2014be it a fishing net or anything else\u2014constitutes an obstruction to navigation or not. We pronounce no opinion upon the suggestion of the learned president that if the conditions were as described by the captain of the tug, the latter, acting under the orders of the superintendent in charge of the dredging operations, owed a duty to the owners of the same to delay the departure of the dredge to await better conditions of wind and weather.\nAs to the defence founded on the maxim volenti non fit injuria, it is plain that the maxim has no application here. The proximate cause of the damage complained of was the negligent navigation of the tug. There is nothing in the evidence to indicate the acceptance of the risk attending such negligence. The conversation narrated had no relation to any such contingency. Counsel for the Crown also contended that compensation must be confined in any event to the damage to the net itself, and that no damages were recoverable for loss of profits resulting therefrom. We are of opinion that this contention is inadmissible. Under the language of ss. (c) of s. 19 above quoted, the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine,\u2014and to award of course appropriate compensation for\u2014\u201cany claim (for damages) arising out of any * * * injury to * * * property resulting from the negligence of any officer,\u201d etc. There is clearly nothing in these words to restrict the compensation for the injury to the property itself, if any further damage can be proved to have resulted from the negligence as the natural and direct consequence thereof under the well established rule governing the award of damages for wrongful injuries, whether to person or to property. It may be true that in some cases, as in The Anselmo, De Larranga[5], cited in the appellant\u2019s factum, and in The Columbus[6], where a vessel or other property used in the earning of business profits is totally destroyed and full value is given as for a total loss, the claimant could not recover anything more to compensate him for the loss of the use of his vessel, but it has never been held, so far as I know, in a case where a vessel or any other chattel used for the carrying on of business has been damaged to such an extent as to render it useless until repaired and as to necessitate the suspension of the business in the carrying on of which it was used, that the owner is not entitled to recover any and all damages which he sustains as a natural and direct consequence of the injury complained of. See Owners of Steam, Sand Pump Dredges v. The owners of SS. \u201cGreta Holme\u201d[7]. In this case where the dredge was injured owing to a collision with a ship, the House of Lords held that its owners, though they were not out of pocket in any definite sum, were entitled to recover damages for the loss of the use of the dredge. Lord Herschell said:\u2014\nI take it to be clear law that in general a person who has been deprived of the use of a chattel through the wrongful act of another is entitled to recover damages in respect thereof, even though he cannot prove what has been called \u201ctangible, pecuniary loss,\u201d by which I under- stand is meant that he is a definite sum of money out of pocket owing to the wrong he has sustained.\nThe suppliant here claimed $1,000 for the damage to the net and $1,500 for the resultant loss of its use. The learned president awarded $1,000 as the cost of restoring the net and $500 as compensation for the loss of its use for one month.

(City of Toronto v. Village of Forest Hill, [1932] Can. S.C.R. 602). In the present case it was held that the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada had no jurisdiction to order the appellant city to pay a portion of the cost of a subway wholly situate within the limits of the respondent town and at some distance from the limits of the appellant city, notwithstanding that access to and from the appellant city (having a large population) from and to other municipalities might be largely through said subway. APPEAL, by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, from an order of that Board (No. 48,736, of June 14, 1932)[1], by which it ordered that a certain portion of the cost of constructing and maintaining a subway under the Pere Marquette Railway lines, which subway was wholly situate within the limits of the Town of Walkerville (respondent), be paid by the appellant, the City of Windsor.\nThe question upon which leave to appeal was granted by the Board, which, in the opinion of the Board, was a question of law, read as follows:\nHad the Board, in the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act to provide in Order No. 48736, dated, June 14, 1932, that the Corporation of the City of Windsor should contribute to the cost of constructing and maintaining the work therein mentioned and as therein provided?\nThe appeal was allowed with costs, and the question answered in the negative.\nB. J. S. Macdonald for the appellant.\nN. C. MacPhee for the respondent the Town of Walkerville.\nE. C. Awrey K.C. for the respondents The Pere Marquette Ry. Co. and The Lake Erie and Detroit River Ry. Co.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014This is an appeal, by leave of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, from an order of that Board, by which a portion of the cost of a subway under the Pere Marquette Railway lines, wholly situate within the town of Walkerville, was assessed against the appellant City of Windsor.\nWyandotte street runs east and west through the town of Sandwich, the city of Windsor and the town of Walkerville, and connects at the easterly limit of the latter town with. Ottawa street, in the city of East Windsor, which latter street runs easterly through the city of East Windsor and through the adjoining town of Riverside. These two streets, therefor form a continuous highway, running through these five municipalities. The subway in question is near the easterly limit of the town of Walkerville, and, consequently, nearly the full width of the latter town from the easterly limit of the appellant City of Windsor.\nThe sole question involved in the appeal is whether or not, under these circumstances, the City of Windsor is \u201cinterested or affected\u201d by the order in question, within the meaning of sec. 39 of the Railway Act, which is as follows:\n39. When the Board, in the exercise of any power vested in it, in and by any order directs or permits any structure, appliances, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs to be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used or maintained, it may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by what company, municipality or person, interested or affected by such order, as the case may be, and when or within what time or upon what terms and conditions as to the payment of compensation or otherwise, and under what supervision, the same shall be provided, constructed, reconstructed, altered, installed, operated, used and maintained.\n2. The Board may, except as otherwise expressly provided, order by whom, in what proportion, and when, the cost and expenses of providing, constructing, reconstructing, altering, installing and executing such structures, equipment, works, renewals, or repairs, or of the supervision, if any, or of the continued operation, use or maintenance thereof, or of otherwise complying with such order, shall be paid.\nThe argument is that the City of Windsor, with a very large population, has its eastern boundary only a little over 3,000 feet from the subway, and that access to and from that city, from and to the four other municipalities, is largely through the subway in question.\nThis was the precise argument urged in The City of Toronto v. The Village of Forest Hill[2]. In that case, the order of the Board had reference to a bridge, which carried a street of the village of Forest Hill over a railway. This bridge was situate wholly within the limits of the village of Forest Hill, and the point nearest to this bridge in the limits of the city of Toronto is the westerly limit of that part of the city of Toronto that was formerly North Toronto, which is 500 feet away.\nIt was argued there that, by reason of the large population in that part of Toronto formerly called North Toronto, and the still larger population of that part of Toronto lying south of Forest Hill, there was a great deal of traffic to and from these particular portions of the city of Toronto passing over the bridge in question. The submission by Mr. Grant on behalf of the railway company was that all municipalities in which traffic passing over the bridge in question would normally originate, in substantial magnitude, would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Board as being \u201cpersons interested or affected by the order.\u201d\nMr. Justice Duff, as he then was, after quoting this argument, says, at p. 605:\nThat is a principle, in my opinion, not laid down or contemplated by the statute.\nAgain, in the reasons, the following appears at page 609:\nCounsel for Forest Hill complained that because of what was said by Mr. Geary, as quoted by the Chairman of the Board, he was precluded from offering evidence as to the origin and volume of traffic likely to use the bridge. He thought he could have established that traffic over the bridge would originate largely with people of the northern and western part of the city, making use of this avenue and Spadina Road as a main connecting link between these parts of the city. In my opinion this, if a fact, would not affect the question in the slightest degree, as the matter of where traffic over the structure originates and the volume of it from various districts is not a factor in deciding whether or not a particular municipality is interested or affected by the works within the meaning of the Act.\nCounsel for the respondent, the Town of Walkerville, referred to The Highway Improvement Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 54. I have looked through this somewhat lengthy Act, but do not find that it has any application to the question involved in the present case. It provides for establishing, in the manner set out, provincial and county highways and suburban roads, and for apportioning the cost of constructing and maintaining such highways between the province and the county, town or city municipalities through which they pass.\nSection 37 provides for payment of the expenditure upon all work on such suburban roads outside of the limits of a city or town, in part by the county, in part by the city or town, and in part by the province.\nAll that need be said here is that the streets in question are not provincial or county highways or suburban roads, so that the effect of the Act in reference to railway crossings on such highways or roads need not be dealt with.\nThe appeal must be allowed, with costs; and the answer to the question submitted is in the negative.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

The scope of the phrase discussed, and the opinion indicated that it is restricted, pursuant to the formula noscitur a sociis, to matters involving something in the nature of a pecuniary or economic interest.

A. Beament K.C. for the applicants.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014Section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, under which the application for leave to appeal is made, is, so far as pertinent, in these terms:\n41. Special leave *** may be granted in any case *** by the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province *** Provided that in any case whatever where the matter in controversy on the appeal will involve\n(a) the validity of an Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the legislature of any province of Canada or of an Ordinance or Act of the council or legislative body of any territory of Canada; or\n(b) any fee of office, duty, rent or revenue, or any sum of money payable to His Majesty; or\n(c) the taking of any annual rent, customary or other fee, or, other matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected; or\n(d) the title to real estate or some interest therein; or\n(e) the validity of a patent; and\n(f) in cases which originated in a court of which the judges are appointed by the Governor General and in which the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal will exceed the sum of one thousand dollars;\nif a special leave to appeal has been refused by the highest court of final resort in the province the Supreme Court may nevertheless grant such leave ***.\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia has refused leave. The preliminary question arises as to our jurisdiction to grant leave under the proviso of section 41. The immediate point upon which our decision must turn is whether \"other matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected \" comprehend all such matters, or whether the scope of the phrase is restricted pursuant to the formula noscitur a sociis to matters involving something in the nature of a pecuniary or economic interest.\nThe present section applies to appeals from all the provinces. But the phrase \"other matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected\" or a phrase not distinguishable in any relevant sense appeared in section 29 (b) of the old statute of 1886 as amended in 1892 which affected exclusively appeals from the province of Quebec. Section 29 excluded appeals from that province except in cases where the matter in controversy amounted to the sum or value of $2,000 or involved the validity of some legislative enactment or\n(b) *** relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nThe effect of the words in this section \" unless the matter in controversy *** (b) relates to *** other matters or things where rights in future might be bound \" was, long prior to the enactment of s. 41 (in 1920), considered by this Court in a series of decisions which have never been departed from.\nIt was held (inter alia) that these words, in the collocation in which they were there placed, did not invest this Court with jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment in an action by a husband for \"s\u00e9paration de corps\" from his wife (O'Dell v. Gregory[2], and Talbot v. Guilmartin[3] ; in an action \"en declaration de paternit\u00e9\" (Macdonald v. Galivan[4]; in a petition for cancellation of the respondent's appointment as tutrix to her minor children (Noel v. Chevrefils[5].\nIt is true that under another enactment of the Supreme Court Act (now sections 36 and 42) this Court may be called upon to deal with questions touching the right to the custody of children when such questions are raised in appeals in habeas corpus. But the current of decision (apart from the special cases of mandamus, habeas corpus, certiorari and prohibition and cases in which the validity of some legislative Act is in controversy) has, subject to the authority to give leave to appeal under s. 48 in appeals from Ontario, been uniformly in the sense that no appeal would lie unless the matter in controversy involved or affected something in the nature of a pecuniary or economic interest present or future.\nSection 41 does not profess in terms to introduce any change in this respect. With the single exception of matters touching legislative jurisdiction, all the matters specifically enumerated in that section as affording a foundation for the jurisdiction of this Court to grant leave are matters involving some kind of interest of an economic character. It seems reasonable to assume that if the legislature had intended to enlarge the jurisdiction of this Court by introducing a radical change, that intention would have been more explicitly set forth. Since the decisions in O'Dell v. Gregory in 1895[6] and the other cases mentioned, the statute has been re-enacted many times; and there is no evidence in any of those re-enactments that the interpretation of s. 46 by which appeals were excluded from judgments in proceedings of the character exemplified in those cases was not regarded as conforming to the legislative intention. Indeed, by the Act of 1920 the authority of this Court was, in any view of s. 41, restricted in one important respect. The authority to grant leave under the old s. 48 (which dealt with appeals from Ontario) was, as already mentioned, unlimited, except probably by implied reference to s. 36. By s. 41 as enacted in 1920, that unlimited authority in respect of Ontario appeals was confined to those cases enumerated in s. 41.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in Davis v. Shaughnessy[7] was not concerned with the effect of the Supreme Court Act. The passage quoted from the judgment involves, it is true, a ruling that the rights contemplated by the words \" other matters in which the rights in future of the parties may be affected \" are not \" necessarily,\" in the context in which they appear in Art. 68 of the C.C.P. of Quebec, ejusdem generis with \" titles to lands or tenements, annual rents \"; in other words, they are not necessarily limited to rights of a character similar to rights in or issuing out of land. This does not necessarily involve a decision that, in construing them, the whole text of the article (which includes other matters) is to be disregarded. In truth, their Lordships hold that\nthe future rights of the appellants are affected since, if the judgment stands, the respondents may again vote themselves sums of money contrary to their duty as ex hypothesi they have already done.\nThere is here no suggestion that \"rights in future \" even in Art. 68, with which, strictly, we are not at all concerned, comprehend rights of the character the applicants desire to assert in the proposed appeal.\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the applicants: C.

On motion by appellant to affirm the jurisdiction of this Court:\nHeld: This Court had not jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, as the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal was not a final judgment in the sense that it bound the parties to it and concluded them from taking exception to any ultimate award by the arbitrator founded thereon. In re Knight and Tabernacle Permanent Bldg. Soc., [1892] 2 Q.B. 613; British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Underground Electric Rys.

Hill, 5 App. Cas. 342, at 344-345, as to the authority which in this Court should be ascribed to the decision of the Court of Appeal in England upon the construction and effect of an English statutory enactment which has been reproduced in a Canadian statute, commented on as being a little too absolute. (Robins v. National Trust Co., [1927] A.C. 515, at 519, referred to.)\nMOTION on behalf of the Corporation of the City of London for an order affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear its appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]. The motion was referred by the Registrar to the Court, under the enabling provision in Rule 1 of the Rules of the Court.\nThe proceedings arose out of a claim of the respondent (Holeproof Hosiery Co. of Canada Ltd.) for $50,000 for compensation for damages resulting from its lands being injuriously affected by reason of grade separation of the Canadian National Ry. Co.\u2019s tracks through the city of London, resulting in street-closing and other acts. The respondent applied to the Senior Judge of the County Court of the County of Middlesex for an appointment to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded to it in pursuance of the Municipal Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 233, and the Municipal Arbitrations Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 242.\nIn the arbitration proceedings the learned County Court Judge stated a case for the opinion of the Court, pursuant to the Arbitration Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 97, and particularly s. 26 thereof; and submitting two questions for the opinion of the Court.\nThe parties to the arbitration agreed, but only for the purpose of having settled the questions of law raised, that it be presumed that the lands of respondent had been injuriously affected by the acts referred to in certain admissions of fact set out in the stated case.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, stating the facts, the questions submitted, and its answers thereto, was as follows:\nThe City of London, Ontario, having requested the C.N.R. to build a new station in that city, the C.N.R. agreed to do so, and an agreement to that effect was entered into, January 6, 1930; on the application of the city this was given statutory authority by the Act (1930), 20 Geo. V, cap. 86 (Ont.), the agreement appearing as Schedule \u201cB\u201d to that Act.\nIn and by this agreement, the C.N.R. was obligated to do certain work; and the statute empowered the city to \u201cpass the necessary by-laws for carrying out the terms and conditions of the agreement\u201d sec. 4.\nThe C.N.R. proceeded to implement its agreement, thereby as is on this motion admitted, occasioning injury to the Holeproof property\u2014the city, however, did not pass the by-laws which were technically necessary for the formal closing of certain streets required for the work. There was, however, no interference with the practical and effective closing of the streets on the ground by the C.N.R.; nor, indeed, could there be, if the C.N.R. was to carry out its agreement.\nThe Holeproof Hosiery Company claimed compensation from the city; and the matter came on before His Honour Judge Wearing as arbitrator. On objection by the city that it was not responsible, as it had not closed the streets, the arbitrator stated a case under R.S.O., 1927, cap. 97, sec. 26, as follows:\u2014\n\u201c1. Am I right in holding that the lands of the claimant have been injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers of The Corporation of the City of London under The Municipal Act, being R.S.O., 1927, chapter 233, or under the authority of any general or special act in consequence of which I am empowered by The Municipal Act, being R.S.O., 1927, chapter 233, sections 342 and 350, to determine as arbitrator the amount of the compensation to be made?\n\u201c2. If question Number One be answered in the affirmative, am I right in holding that the damage caused by any part of the work physically effected by the Canadian National Railway Company, may be attributed to The Corporation of the City of London and compensation assessed against that corporation accordingly?\u201d\nIn view of the objection of the Court to answer hypothetical questions [\u2018cases referred to], we might regularly decline to answer these questions, as it is not stated that the injury complained of was in fact the result of the operations stated; but, as it is admitted for the purposes of this application that such is the case, we may accede to the request, confident that this consent will not be withdrawn for other purposes.\nThe statute under which the Holeproof Company claims the right it asserts is R.S.O., 1927, cap. 233, sec. 342, which reads:\n\u201cWhere land * * * is injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers of a corporation under the authority of this Act or under the authority of any general or special Act, * * * the corporation shall make due compensation to the owner * * * \u201d\nWe are, of course, to take the actual language of the Legislature, and have no concern with alleged hardship, moral right, etc.; the modern method of interpreting and applying statutes is to consider that the legislators knew what they wished to enact, and had sufficient knowledge of the English language to enable them to employ the correct terminology to carry out their intention.\nWhatever may have been the case before the legislation of 1930, the aforesaid \u201cSpecial Act,\u201d cap. 86, gave power to the municipality to have the agreed work done; this power was exercised by the municipality; and I am unable to see that the work which injuriously affected the land spoken of, was not an exercise of the power so given, so as to come within the very words of the statute, as quoted.\nThe question 1, then, must be answered in the affirmative.\nThe answer to question 2 is obvious from the remarks above.\nThe City of London should pay the costs of this application. It may be added that it was not and could not successfully be contended that the railway company performed the work complained of under statutory obligation; it is clear that the validation of an agreement by the Legislature has the effect only of making it as effective as if it had been valid ab initio, and the parties to it may deal with it by insisting on it being carried into effect, by modifying it or by entirely abrogating it. \u201cThe agreement between the parties though ratified by an Act of the Legislature still remains a private contract;\u201d [cases referred to].\nThe appellant gave security for costs on the appeal to this Court, and the same was allowed as good and sufficient security, reserving, however, to the respondent the right to object to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal.\nThe appellant then moved the Court of Appeal for special leave to appeal to this Court, and the motion was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice to any motion that has been or may hereafter be made to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201d\nThe appellant moved before the Registrar for an order affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear its appeal, which motion was referred by the Registrar to the Court as above stated.\nR.S. Robertson, K.C., and K.G. Morden for the motion.\nG.F. Macdonell, K.C., contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal from a pronouncement of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dated 17th of February, 1933.\nThe pronouncement of the Court of Appeal was given in exercise of that court\u2019s jurisdiction under s. 26 of the Arbitration Act, ch. 97 (R.S.O., 1927), which is in these words:\nAn arbitrator or an umpire may at any stage of the proceedings and shall, if so directed by the court, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the court any question of law arising in the course of the reference and an arbitrator or umpire appointed under the authority of a statute or by a court or judge shall, when so directed by the court, state the reasons for his decision and his findings of fact and of law.\nThis section originally appeared in the Arbitration Act of 1897 (60 V., c. 16) as s. 41, reading as follows:\nAny County Judge, referee, arbitrator or umpire may at any stage of the proceedings under a reference, and shall, if so directed by the Court or a Judge, state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the Court any question of law arising in the course of the reference. By an amendment in 1927, the section was altered and brought into the form in which it appears in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1927, as quoted above. The amendment does not materially affect the point I am about to discuss. The section, in its original form, in s. 41 of c. 16 of the Statutes of 1897, was taken almost verbatim from s. 19 of the Arbitration Act of 1889 (Imp.), the only difference being that,\nAny referee, arbitrator, or umpire may at any stage of the proceedings * * *\nin s. 19, was altered to read,\nAny County Judge, referee, arbitrator, or umpire may at any stage of the proceedings * * *\nin s. 41.\nIn 1892, the Court of Appeal had to consider in In re Knight and Tabernacle Permanent Building Society[2] whether an opinion pronounced by a Divisional Court in exercise of the jurisdiction given by s. 19 of the Arbitration Act of 1889 was a judgment from which an appeal would lie to the Court of Appeal. The Court, Lord Esher, M.R., Bowen and Kay, LL.J., held that it was not. Lord Esher points out that the question of law is not under the statute stated \u201cfor the \u2018determination\u2019 or \u2018decision\u2019 of the Court,\u201d and he held that no determination or decision amounting to an appealable judgment was contemplated by the section.\nBowen, L.J., said (p. 619) that the submission of the case is\nan interlocutory proceeding in the reference, and I do not think that it can have been intended that, whenever a case is stated under this section for the opinion of the Court, such opinion when taken is to be treated as an absolute determination of the rights of the parties with the result that there may be an appeal from it which may be carried to the House of Lords.\nKay, L.J., said (p. 621),\nI think that it is impossible, looking to the language of the Arbitration Act, to say that the opinion given on the special case stated under s. 19 is a judgment or order. I do not think that the section contemplates that the Court should give any judgment or make any order, but simply that it should express an opinion.\nThese views, expressed by the judges of the Court of Appeal, constitute the ratio of the decision in that case.\nAs we have seen, s. 41 of the Ontario Arbitration Act of 1897 reproduces with no material modification the words of s. 19. The note in the margin shows the origin of s. 41. Indeed, the Arbitration Act of 1897 is in great part a reproduction of the English Arbitration Act of 1889.\nIt is now, perhaps, permissible to say that the observations of Sir Montague Smith in Trimble v. Hill in the Judicial Committee[3], as to the authority which in this Court should be ascribed to the decision of the Court of Appeal upon the construction and effect of an English statutory enactment which has been reproduced in a Canadian statute, are a little too absolute. Robins v. National Trust Co.[4] Nevertheless, it is difficult to suppose that the framers of the Arbitration Act of 1897 were unaware of the construction which had been attributed to s. 19 of the English Arbitration Act of 1889; and, be that as it may, the reasoning of the eminent judges who considered s. 19 in 1892 appears to me to be unanswerable.\nIt follows that the pronouncement of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in this matter is not a final judgment in the sense that it binds the parties to it and concludes them from taking exception to any ultimate award by the arbitrator founded on that opinion.\nIt may be observed further that this view is confirmed by the judgment of Lord Haldane in British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Underground Electric Railways Co. of London Ltd.[5]\nThe application must be dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.G.

On the 14th of September, work being sufficiently advanced, D. gave a first mortgage of $6,750 from the proceeds of which he paid H. $6,503.68. On the 20th of September, H., representing that he needed a further guarantee for the benefit of his creditors, prevailed upon D., although the work was not completed, to give a second mortgage for $4,150, which was executed on that day and registered on the 14th of October. The appellant D., on the 16th of November, caused a protest to be served upon H., which was registered on the 18th, notifying him inter alia that the sum due under the second mortgage was not to be paid unless H. paid the overdue accounts for work and material and requesting him not to negotiate the same in any manner. But H., who was indebted to the (respondents) mis-en-cause D. & F., had transferred and assigned to them on the 29th of October this second mortgage as collateral security for his indebtedness; however, it was not until the 9th of December that the respondents D. & F. served upon the appellant D. notification of this transfer. H. absconded some days after receiving the protest of the 18th of November and left the contract uncompleted. The appellant D. then discovered that the settlement of privileged claims registered against the property and the cost of the uncompleted work increased the cost of the buildings to a sum exceeding the contract price, and that therefore the debt guaranteed by the second mortgage of $4,150 was extinguished. D. took the present action against H. as defendant, and D. & F. as mis-en-cause, for a declaration that the mortgage if not null and void should be cancelled or paid by compensation, with an order to the registrar to enter such cancellation in his book.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 53 K.B. 81) that the appellant\u2019s action should be maintained.\u2014The principle laid down in Lamy v. Rouleau ([1927] S.C.R. 288), where it was held that \u201cthe transferee acquires possession available against (the debtor) only upon service of the transfer being made upon the debtor,\u201d applied. Accordingly D. & F. were in the same position towards D. as if the deed of transfer to them had been passed on the day of its service to D., i.e., on the 9th of December, 1929. Therefore any cause of extinction of the debt in whole or in part operating between H. & D. and anterior to such service has had the effect of liberating D.\u2014Article 1234 C.C. does not apply to the evidence adduced to prove such extinction as between D. and H., as such evidence does not \u201ccontradict or vary the terms of\u201d the second mortgage, but on the contrary has the effect of affirming that deed by proving its extinction.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, at Montreal, D\u00e9saulniers J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nO.

Champoux K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Appel d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi confirmant, avec la dissidence de MM. les juges Hall & L\u00e9tourneau, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure renvoyant, quant aux mis-en-cause, l\u2019action en radiation d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que du demandeur-appelant.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur Herbert, par \u00e9crits sous seing priv\u00e9, s\u2019engagea, en juillet 1929, \u00e0 construire pour l\u2019appelant une maison \u00e0 trois logements pour le prix de $10,900; et le mode de paiement fut r\u00e9gl\u00e9 comme suit:\n1. The owner will mortgage the property, and will pay to the contractor, the full amount of the said first mortgage.\n2. The balance of the money due to the contractor when the building is completed, will be converted into a second mortgage in favour of the contractor. The owner will there make equal payments of about $50.00 per month (Feb. 14) until the amount of the second mortgage and the interests computed at 7 per cent have been entirely paid for. The interest will be paid every six months.\nThe amount to be covered by the second mortgage, will depend on the amount of the first mortgage, and the final details will be settled when the deed of the second mortgage is prepared for signature by both parties.\nLe 20 septembre 1929, la seconde hypoth\u00e8que pr\u00e9vue fut consentie en faveur de l\u2019entrepreneur pour $4,150, que l\u2019appelant reconnut avoir re\u00e7u et promit de rembourser \u00e0 raison de $50.00 par mois, commen\u00e7ant le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1929, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 7% du 1er novembre 1929 payable semi-annuellement. Cet acte porte hypoth\u00e8que sur les lots 162-1824, 1825, 1826 et 1827 du cadastre de la paroisse de Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil, \u201cwith a three tenement building now in course of construction thereon erected.\u201d Le propri\u00e9taire-appelant souscrivit \u00e0 la condition suivante:\nThe borrower shall not permit any builder\u2019s privilege to be created upon the said property under pain of causing the present loan to become forthwith exigible.\nCette obligation hypoth\u00e9caire fut enregistr\u00e9e le 14 octobre 1929. La construction et les paiements par l\u2019entrepreneur n\u2019allant pas \u00e0 sa satisfaction, l\u2019appelant fit protester, le 16 novembre 1929, le d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019avoir \u00e0 payer toutes les r\u00e9clamations en souffrance pour mat\u00e9riaux ou main-d\u2019\u0153uvre relatifs \u00e0 la construction, le notifiant qu\u2019il le tenait responsable de toute somme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer, de m\u00eame que du co\u00fbt des travaux qui restaient \u00e0 faire, lui enjoignant aussi de ne pas n\u00e9gocier ou se dessaisir en aucune mani\u00e8re de la somme de $4,150 faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019obligation susmentionn\u00e9e. Ce prot\u00eat fut enregistr\u00e9 le 18 novembre 1929. Le d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e0 la suite du prot\u00eat, abandonna compl\u00e8tement les travaux, et semble avoir laiss\u00e9 la province. Ce n\u2019est que le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1929 que l\u2019appelant re\u00e7ut signification, de la part de Dupuy & Fr\u00e8res, les mis-encause intim\u00e9s, d\u2019un acte notari\u00e9 du 29 octobre 1929, leur transportant en garantie collat\u00e9rale cette cr\u00e9ance de $4,150. Ce transport fut enregistr\u00e9 le 30 octobre 1929, et comporte, en faveur des intim\u00e9s, une subrogation aux droits, privil\u00e8ges et hypoth\u00e8ques du c\u00e9dant Herbert en vertu du dit acte d\u2019obligation.\nLe demandeur-appelant s\u2019est pourvu en justice pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cet acte, all\u00e9guant mauvaise foi et dol de la part de l\u2019entrepreneur et faisant de plus valoir, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019obligation et de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, son accessoire, si valides, les paiements qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de faire aux ouvriers et aux fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux au lieu et \u00e0 l\u2019acquit du d\u00e9fendeur et pour terminer le contrat que ce dernier avait abandonn\u00e9.\nDevant le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, le demandeur a, en fait, essay\u00e9 de prouver que l\u2019obligation hypoth\u00e9caire sous forme de pr\u00eat n\u2019\u00e9tait, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la promesse \u00e9crite faite \u00e0 Herbert de lui consentir une seconde hypoth\u00e8que pour lui faciliter le paiement des frais de construction. L\u2019on a refus\u00e9 d\u2019admettre une preuve \u00e0 rencontre de la cause ou consid\u00e9ration mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit, mais le demandeur a pu prouver les r\u00e9clamations privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es et le paiement qu\u2019il avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans son action, et nous demande aujourd\u2019hui, non pas de lui accorder toutes les conclusions de son action, mais de d\u00e9clarer que la cr\u00e9ance de Herbert constat\u00e9e par l\u2019obligation \u00e9tait \u00e9teinte au temps de la prise de possession effective par les mis-en-cause, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence ces derniers doivent voir cette cour dire et d\u00e9clarer que, \u00e0 la date de la signification du transport, le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 ne devait rien au pr\u00e9tendu cr\u00e9ancier c\u00e9dant.\nDans l\u2019affaire Lamy v. Rouleau[2], cette cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nWhen a debt is transferred, the debtor is a \u201cthird person\u201d within the meaning of art. 1571 C.C., and the transferee acquires possession available against him only upon service of the transfer being made upon the debtor. Mere registration of the transfer is not sufficient.\nSo long as the transfer has not been served (or has not been accepted by the debtor) the transferor, with regard to third persons, remains the possessor and the owner of the debt.\nAs a result, the debtor is liable to the transferee only in so far as he is obligated to the transferor at the time when the transfer is served. As against the debtor, the transfer must be considered as having taken place only on the date of its signification to him.\nAny mode of extinction of the debt (as, for example, compensation) operating between the debtor and the transferor previous to the service of the transfer upon the debtor has the effect of discharging the debtor, even as against the transferee.\nEn vertu de cette d\u00e9cision, Dupuy & Fr\u00e8res sont donc dans la m\u00eame position, vis-\u00e0-vis de D\u00e9patie, que si le transport avait eu lieu le jour de la signification, \u00e0 savoir le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1929. Jusque l\u00e0, pour D\u00e9patie, le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e9tait Herbert. Le paiement \u00e0 ce dernier l\u2019e\u00fbt lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Toute extinction de la cr\u00e9ance due \u00e0 Herbert devait profiter \u00e0 D\u00e9patie, car le paiement n\u2019est que l\u2019une des mani\u00e8res par lesquelles l\u2019obligation s\u2019\u00e9teint. Tout autre mode d\u2019extinction de la cr\u00e9ance op\u00e9rant entre Herbert et D\u00e9patie ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la signification doit logiquement avoir le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat; et, comme le dit Pothier, vol: 3, no. 558:\nLe d\u00e9biteur peut opposer au cessionnaire la compensation de tout ce que lui devait le c\u00e9dant avant la signification du transport.\nC.C. 1192 (2). Le transport non accept\u00e9 par le d\u00e9biteur, mais qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9, n\u2019emp\u00eache que la compensation des dettes du c\u00e9dant post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 cette signification. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme dans celle de Lamy v. Rouleau[3], il s\u2019agit donc de savoir si, avant la signification du transport, quelque chose s\u2019est produit entre D\u00e9patie et Herbert qui a eu pour effet d\u2019\u00e9teindre la cr\u00e9ance. La preuve des paiements faits a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance; car il s\u2019agissait, non pas de contredire l\u2019\u00e9crit ou de nier l\u2019obligation constat\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9crit, mais de la confirmer en en prouvant l\u2019extinction, par ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 entre cr\u00e9ancier et d\u00e9biteur du 30 septembre au 9 d\u00e9cembre 1929. Nous pouvons donc \u00e9liminer, et nous \u00e9liminons pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause, l\u2019article 1234 C.C., car nous la d\u00e9cidons en adoptant un point de vue qui ne comporte aucune contradiction de l\u2019\u00e9crit suivant sa forme et teneur.\nMais, nous dit l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 chaque jour suffit sa peine. Vous pourrez faire valoir cette extinction, ce paiement par com\u00adpensation ou autrement le jour o\u00f9 les mis-en-causes voudront exiger paiement de l\u2019obligation. Vous n\u2019avez pas int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prendre l\u2019initiative pour demander que cette obligation soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00e9teinte et que l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que soit radi\u00e9e.\nLes mis-en-cause ayant fait enregistrer cette cr\u00e9ance sur les immeubles en question, le demandeur appelant a un int\u00e9r\u00eat actuel \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre cette charge qui diminue d\u2019autant la valeur de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui devenait due et exigible d\u00e8s qu\u2019un privil\u00e8ge \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl nous faut donc constater, par la preuve au dossier, si possible, de quel montant le demandeur-appelant et Herbert se trouvaient mutuellement d\u00e9biteur et cr\u00e9ancier l\u2019un de l\u2019autre le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1929, afin de d\u00e9terminer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point la compensation s\u2019est op\u00e9r\u00e9e de plein droit de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9teindre les deux dettes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de leurs montants respectifs. Cette compensation, d\u2019apr\u00e8s 1190 C.C., a lieu quelle que soit la cause ou consid\u00e9ration des dettes ou de l\u2019une ou de l\u2019autre, except\u00e9 dans trois cas qui ne s\u2019appliquent pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il ne faut pas oublier, en cette mati\u00e8re, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la signification, le cessionnaire reste vis-\u00e0-vis du d\u00e9biteur le simple repr\u00e9sentant du c\u00e9dant; le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 ne doit payer au cessionnaire que ce qu\u2019il doit au c\u00e9dant rest\u00e9 son cr\u00e9ancier, et garde vis-\u00e0-vis de celui-l\u00e0 toutes les exceptions qu\u2019il pouvait opposer \u00e0 celui-ci, d\u2019o\u00f9 la cons\u00e9quence que s\u2019il ne doit rien au c\u00e9dant, il n\u2019a rien \u00e0 payer au cessionnaire. La bonne foi du cessionnaire ne peut rien changer \u00e0 ces r\u00e8gles. Il a cru que le c\u00e9dant \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement cr\u00e9ancier? Cela ne suffit pas pour que la dette existe; et si le d\u00e9biteur, lors de la signification du transport, ne devait rien au c\u00e9dant, il ne peut se trouver oblig\u00e9 de l\u2019acquitter.\nCeci ressort de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour de cassation du 29 juin 1881, dans la cause de Goin et consorts c. Hons Olivier[4], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9:\nAttendu, en droit, qu\u2019il est de principe que nul ne peut c\u00e9der \u00e0 autrui plus de droits qu\u2019il n\u2019en a lui-m\u00eame; qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de cession de droits incorporels, le cessionnaire, nanti par la cession de tous les avantages aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ance c\u00e9d\u00e9e, est aussi passible des exceptions que le d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9 pouvait opposer au c\u00e9dant; qu\u2019il importe peu que la cession ait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e au d\u00e9biteur, si celui-ci ne s\u2019est pas, en acceptant la cession, rendu d\u00e9biteur personnel du cessionnaire, la signification prescrite par l\u2019article 1690 (C.N.) n\u2019ayant d\u2019autre effet que de saisir le cessionnaire vis-\u00e0-vis du d\u00e9biteur c\u00e9d\u00e9, comme de tous autres, des seuls droits qu\u2019avait le c\u00e9dant; que, si la bonne foi du cessionnaire doit lui assurer un recours contre celui-ci, elle ne saurait obliger le d\u00e9biteur envers lui, plus qu\u2019il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait envers le c\u00e9dant;\nQuelle \u00e9tait la situation respective de l\u2019appelant et de son . entrepreneur lorsque ce dernier, apr\u00e8s la signification du prot\u00eat, abandonna son contrat de disparut compl\u00e8tement? Il n\u2019y a pas de doute, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les conventions de juillet 1929, que les deux hypoth\u00e8ques sur le terrain o\u00f9 devaient se faire les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es pour procurer \u00e0 Herbert l\u2019argent et le cr\u00e9dit dont il avait besoin pour acheter les mat\u00e9rieux et payer ses ouvriers. Sur la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que, le demandeur paya directement \u00e0 Herbert $5,600, plus $600 sur un billet de $2,000 qu\u2019il lui avait consenti. Lors de la disparition du d\u00e9fendeur, le demandeur, comme propri\u00e9taire, fut assailli de r\u00e9clamations privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de la part de ceux dont le d\u00e9biteur semblait avoir quitt\u00e9 la province de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 leur faire perdre leur recours contre lui. En vertu de l\u2019article 2013(d) du Code civil, le propri\u00e9taire, qui \u00e9tait en m\u00eame temps son propre architecte, avait le droit de retenir, pendant toute la dur\u00e9e et \u00e0 la fin des travaux, sur le prix du contrat, un montant suffisant pour acquitter les cr\u00e9ances privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es; et le constructeur Herbert ne pouvait exiger aucun paiement sur le prix du contrat avant d\u2019avoir fourni au propri\u00e9taire un \u00e9tat, sous sa signature, de tous les montants dus par lui pour construction et mat\u00e9riaux. Et, sous l\u2019article 2013(e) du m\u00eame code, pour faire face aux cr\u00e9ances privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es des fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux, le demandeur avait le droit de retenir sur le prix du contrat de construction un montant suffisant pour le payer; et ce tant que le d\u00e9fendeur ne lui aurait pas remis soit une quittance, soit une renonciation \u00e0 leur privil\u00e8ge sign\u00e9e par eux.\nLe demandeur a prouv\u00e9 sans contradiction que ces r\u00e9clamations privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es \u00e0 lui d\u00e9nonc\u00e9es se montent \u00e0 $1,547.19, plus $3,513.93, formant un total de $5,061.12, que le demandeur propri\u00e9taire avait droit de retenir d\u00e8s avant le transport et qu\u2019il a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de payer au lieu et \u00e0 l\u2019acquit de son entrepreneur en fuite. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que le demandeur \u00e9tait tenu de payer ces dettes \u00e0 m\u00eame les argents du contrat dont partie \u00e9tait le montant de la deuxi\u00e8me hypoth\u00e8que qui nous occupe. Il \u00e9tait tenu en vertu de la loi de retenir ces montants pour les cr\u00e9anciers de son entrepreneur \u201cavec qui ou pour qui il \u00e9tait tenu de payer ces dettes, qu\u2019il avait int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019acquitter.\u201d La subrogation s\u2019est donc op\u00e9r\u00e9e en sa faveur par l\u2019effet de la loi et sans demande (Art. 1156 par. 3 C.C.) contre le c\u00e9dant d\u00e9fendeur et ses repr\u00e9sentants mis-en-cause.\nMalheureusement pour les mis-en-cause Dupuy & Fr\u00e8res, comme nous l\u2019avons expos\u00e9 plus haut, ils ne peuvent exercer plus de droits que ceux poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par le c\u00e9dant contre le demandeur le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1929. A cette date, l\u2019obligation du 20 septembre 1929, au montant de $4,150 \u00e9tait \u00e9teinte, vu la co-existence de deux dettes liquides et exigibles laissant en faveur du demandeur une diff\u00e9rence de $911.12. Je ne tiens pas compte de la somme de $755 que le demandeur pourrait r\u00e9clamer pour les d\u00e9bours\u00e9s \u00e0 faire pour compl\u00e9ter la construction que le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de lui livrer pour $10,900. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019au 9 d\u00e9cembre cette r\u00e9clamation en dommages pour inex\u00e9cution partielle du contrat f\u00fbt suffisamment liquide et exigible pour \u00eatre sujette \u00e0 une compensation de plein droit. Ce montant, d\u2019ailleurs, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9teindre, d\u00e8s avant le 9 d\u00e9cembre, toute r\u00e9clamation que le d\u00e9fendeur Herbert aurait pu essayer de faire valoir en vertu de la deuxi\u00e8me obligation hypoth\u00e9caire contre le c\u00e9dant.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour de cassation cit\u00e9 plus haut, m\u00eame la bonne foi du cessionnaire ne saurait le mettre dans une situation meilleure que celle du c\u00e9dant; et, \u00e0 moins d\u2019une acceptation formelle par le d\u00e9biteur qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une promesse de payer au nouveau cr\u00e9ancier, et \u00e0 une renonciation aux exceptions qu\u2019il pouvait faire valoir contre son premier cr\u00e9ancier, nous ne pouvons ignorer les responsabilit\u00e9s de Herbert vis-\u00e0-vis du demandeur d\u00e9coulant de sa conduite qui pourrait, sans exag\u00e9ration, \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de dolosive et malhonn\u00eate. D\u00e8s que le demandeur s\u2019est aper\u00e7u qu\u2019il \u00e9tait victime d\u2019un abus de confiance, il a pris les mesures voulues pour se prot\u00e9ger et prot\u00e9ger le public, en enregistrant le prot\u00eat du 16 novembre 1929 et en retenant l\u2019argent que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019avait pas le droit de recevoir au d\u00e9triment de ceux qui avaient r\u00e9ellement \u00e9rig\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9difice mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que. Peu importe que cet enregistrement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 connu de Dupuy & Fr\u00e8res. A cette date, et jusqu\u2019au 9 d\u00e9cembre, le demandeur appelant pouvait et devait les ignorer.\nNous sommes donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019action aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenue en partie et que le demandeur a droit \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne doit pas au d\u00e9fendeur, ni aux mis-en-cause la somme de $4,150, montant de l\u2019obligation du 20 septembre 1929; \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ordre soit donn\u00e9 au r\u00e9gistrateur du comt\u00e9 de Chambly d\u2019en radier l\u2019enregistrement sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, savoir les lots de terre connus et d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sous les num\u00e9ros dix-huit cent vingt-quatre, dix-huit cent vingt-cinq, dix-huit cent vingt-six et dix-huit cent vingt-sept de la subdivision officielle du lot originaire num\u00e9ro cent soixante-deux (nos. 162-1824, 1825, 1826 et 1827) des plan et livre de renvoi officiels de la paroisse de St-Antoine de Longueuil, comt\u00e9 de Chambly, de m\u00eame que l\u2019enregistrement des deux transports en faveur des mis-en-cause; et \u00e0 ce que l\u2019enregistrement du pr\u00e9sent jugement \u00e9quivaille \u00e0 la radiation de la dite obligation et des deux transports; le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre les mis-en-cause dans toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

C.R. 89, in favour of the plaintiff in an action brought for alleged infringement of its patent, which was for an invention relating to a machine and method for producing straight and curved fastener stringers, was reversed, on the ground that, having regard to the prior art, the only invention disclosed by plaintiff\u2019s patent was a particular method and a particular mechanism for achieving a known result, which method and mechanism were not infringed by defendant\u2019s machine.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of the plaintiff in an action for alleged infringement of patent. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nD. L. McCarthy, K.C., A. Geoffrion, K.C., and S. A. Hayden for the appellants.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., R. S. Smart, K.C., and H. G. Fox for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith, J.\u2014The respondent brought this action in the Exchequer Court for infringement by appellants of Letters Patent of Canada No. 210,202, dated 5th April, 1921, and obtained judgment1 for an injunction with a reference as to damages.\nFrom this judgment the appeal is taken. The invention covered by respondent\u2019s patent relates to a machine and method for producing straight and curved fastener stringers, such as shown in Letters Patent of the United States No. 1,219,881, and also the curved stringers shown in application for Letters Patent of Canada No. 219,986. These fasteners are commonly known as \u201cZipper\u201d fasteners, and physical exhibits \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d are specimens of respondent\u2019s fasteners and exhibits 21 and 22 are specimens of appellants\u2019 fasteners.\nThe fastener consists of two lengths of cloth tape disposed on opposite edges of the opening to be fastened, each tape edge next the opening bearing a series of spaced metal units, the units on one tape being staggered in position with respect to the units on the other tape, all the units being so shaped as to interlock the series on one length with the series on the opposed length of tape, when brought together with a slider which envelopes the two interlocking edges, and is manually movable thereon. Each unit has jaws at one end to straddle and be compressed on the corded edge of the tape. The projecting interlocking end of each unit is formed with a projection on one side and a socket on the other, so that the opposing series of units are interlocked through the action of the slider by meshing the projection of each unit of one series in the socket of the adjacent unit of the other series.\nThe completed fastener of both appellants and respondent is the subject matter of a British Patent No. 14,358 of 1912, Exhibit \u201cU,\u201d issued to Katharina Kuhn-Moos. The latter did not patent her invention in Canada or the United States, but the Sundback United States Patent, No. 1,219,881, seems to cover the same subject matter.\nWe are not, however, here concerned with the fasteners themselves, but with the machine for making them. In this machine we have a punch press for cutting out and forming the units from a flat strip of metal, which was the ordinary method of making the units long before the date of respondent\u2019s patent.\nThe problem that remained, after these small units had been made by a punch press, was that of getting the jaws astride the corded edge of the tape and compressing them there in succession with the correct space between each unit. A means of placing fastener units on the corded edge of a tape in succession with equal spaces between units is disclosed in the Aronson Canadian Patent No. 107,456, dated September 17, 1907 (Ex. B.) There the units, after being made, are placed by hand in what is called a magazine, which is combined with a machine in such a manner that the jaws of the units are successively placed astride the corded edge of the tape held taut in the machine and moved along, step by step, each unit, as placed astride the edge of the tape, being compressed there by two reciprocating plungers. A method of clamping the units to the tape in succession in regulated spaces after getting the jaws of the units astride the edge of the tape, was therefore not the problem that required to be solved by Sundback. The problem was a means of carrying the units, when formed, automatically to a position where the jaws of each unit would be placed successively astride the corded edge of the tape, to be there automatically compressed, the space between units being regulated by feeding the tape along step by step, as shown in the Aronson patent.\nMethods of cutting units with jaws from flat metal strips and automatically carrying such units on, so as to place these jaws astride a wire and compress them there with regulated spacing, were disclosed long before the date of respondent\u2019s patent, chiefly in connection with the manufacture of barbed wire.\nIt is at once argued that there is no similarity between the making of barbed wire and the making of these zipper stringers. It is, of course, plain enough that these stringers could not be made on a barbed wire machine without much change or modification of the machine. An examination, however, discloses that the principles involved in the working of the two machines have much in common. This was not overlooked by the inventor of respondent\u2019s machine, Sundback. His United States patent, No. 1,331,884, dated February 24, 1920, is, as the evidence discloses, for the same invention as the Canadian patent of respondent in question. In the specifications to the United States patent, he says:\nThe present invention is not limited in its broad aspects to the production of the particular fastener members referred to, nor to the setting of such members on tapes, but is of general application wherever it is desired to automatically and cheaply form large numbers of like parts, and to set them on a suitable carrier element.\nThe product of the machine, therefore, need not be fasteners at all, the units need not be fastener units, and the carrier need not be a tape, but may be any suitable carrier element.\nLooking, then, at Brainard\u2019s wire-working machine, Patent No. 292,467, dated January 29, 1884, we have a suitable strip automatically fed into a punch press, from which the barbs, each with two jaws, are formed and cut out successively. The carrier element, a strand of wire, is automatically fed into the machine from a spool, and passes under the barbs between the jaws, and a punch presses the barb down on the strand and into the concave sides of a channel, so that the jaws are made to clasp the strand tightly. The strand is automatically fed along step by step, so that a barb is fastened at each step with regulated spacing.\nThe Stover United States Patent No. 240,477, dated April 19, 1881, is practically the same as the Brainard patent, except that the carrier element is a flat metal tape, instead of a round wire. There is also a necessary variation of the mechanism for compressing the jaws on the metal tape.\nSpeaking generally, therefore, there was nothing, new in devising a machine to form automatically and cheaply large numbers of like metal units and to set them on a suitable carrier element with regulated spacing.\nThe problem remaining to be solved was the devising of a means by which, when the particular fastener units here in question were successively cut and formed from the metal strip, they would be automatically carried on and placed with the jaws astride the corded edge of the tape, to be there compressed on the tape, as disclosed in the Aronson patent, thus avoiding the tedious and expensive manual operation necessary in the Aronson process for placing the jaws of the units astride the edge of the tape.\nSundback solved this problem as shown in respondent\u2019s patent by constituting the metal strip the means for carrying the units to the desired position. This object is attained by first punching out in the punch press from the metal strip automatically fed into the machine the piece of metal from which the unit is to be formed, and replacing the piece so cut out automatically back into the space from which it was cut out, and carrying it on, as the metal strip is fed along, for the next operation, where it is firmly held in position by compressing the edges of the metal strip, while a punch and die form the unit. Then this unit, still held in position in the metal strip, is carried by that strip, as it is stepped on, to a position where the jaws of the unit are placed astride of the corded edge of the tape, and is there compressed on the tape by plungers, which compress the edges of the metal strip, and thus compress the jaws of the unit on the tape, as shown in the Aronson patent.\nThe specification of respondent\u2019s patent dwells on the novelty whereby the punching for the jaw member is completely severed from the blank metal strip and then immediately replaced therein, so that it can be further fed for the subsequent forming and cutting operations while at the same time being protected from tool marks. By this means, it is claimed, it is possible to apply pressure to the punching through the blank so as to hold the punching firmly during the shaping operation, and then, by a further side punching operation through the blank, to compress the jaws firmly on the carrier element or tape without leaving any tool marks upon the jaw members themselves. This avoidance of tool marks is claimed to be a great advantage, since it cheapens subsequent finishing operations.\nThe appellants\u2019 method of forming and severing the completed units from the flat strip of metal and then carrying these completed units in succession to a position where the jaws are placed astride the corded edge of the tape, is entirely different from the method employed as disclosed in respondent\u2019s patent just described. The appellants in their machine do not first punch from the metal strip a piece subsequently to be formed into a completed unit; but first, by punch and die, form the projection and socket of the unit in the metal strip, and then, by a subsequent punching operation, complete the making of the unit by cutting it out of, and thus severing it from, the metal strip. They do not constitute the metal strip a means of carrying the units successively to the position where the jaws are placed astride of the corded edge of the tape. They do not, by plunger, compress the edges of the metal strip and thus compress the jaws of the unit on the tape, and so prevent tool marks on the unit.\nThe method in the appellants\u2019 machine, in my view, is radically different. The unit is formed in the metal sheet and during the process of formation does not require to be held firmly by the pressure on the edges of the strip as specially provided for in respondent\u2019s patent. When completely formed by being cut from the metal strip by the second operation, the completed units are placed successively by the action of the cutting-out punch on a plane or table, where they are at once successively pushed by another operating part of the machine to a position where the jaws are placed astride of the corded edge of the tape. This method, and the form and operation of the machine by which the result is brought about, seem to me to be entirely different from the respondent\u2019s method, and from the form and operation of respondent\u2019s machine.\nThe method adopted in appellants\u2019 machine resembles less the methods adopted in respondent\u2019s machine than the methods disclosed in various other patents, such as the Brainard and Stover patents already referred to, and the Major United States Patent No. 525,914, dated September 11, 1894. The latter patent has reference to a machine for automatically making hooks and eyes and attaching them in spaced relation in groups, with gaps between groups, to a cardboard strip or tape by U shaped staples. The staples are formed and cut from a wire fed into the machine step by step, and are automatically brought to the proper position in relation to the hook or eye for fastening the latter to the cardboard strip or tape. The hook and eye are also made on the machine, and automatically brought to the proper position on the cardboard strip or tape, to be fastened there by the staples. The staple and hook or eye having thus been brought to the proper position, the staple is pushed through the loops of the eyes and cardboard, and clinched by contact of the staple ends at the other side of the cardboard in the ordinary method of stapling, so well known as not to require description, the patent states. The cardboard strip is fed along step by step until the desired number of hooks and eyes are attached, with regular spacing, and then is fed by a long step, so as to commence a new group.\nIt will thus be seen that the practice of forming and cutting units from a metal wire or strip fed step by step into the machine, and in the same machine automatically carrying the units successively as formed to a position where they are successively clamped or clinched to a tape or other carrying element in spaced relation in groups of pre- determined length, was not new at the date of the respondent\u2019s patent, and that the most that can be covered by respondent\u2019s patent is the particular method and the particular mechanism by which the result is achieved, and cannot cover all methods and all mechanisms by which that result is brought about. Tweedale v. Ashworth[2]; Miller v. Clyde Bridge Steel Co.[3].\nIt is argued for respondent that there is some novelty in respondent\u2019s method of clamping the units to the tape by feeding the tape step by step to attach a desired number of units with equal spacing and then, by a long step, to divide the units into groups, with a blank space on the tape between groups. Aronson attained this precise result, not by means of the tape being advanced by the long step, but by leaving blanks in his magazine\u2014that is, spaces without units.\nThe Shipley United States patent, No. 85,249, dated December 22, 1868, relates to a feed-motion for machines for cutting the teeth of metal combs, and discloses a means of feeding a metal strip into a machine, step by step, so that the desired number of teeth are cut with equal spacing. Then the metal strip is advanced by a long step, so as to form groups of teeth of the desired number, with gaps between the groups. This is secured by means of the cooperation of two ratchet wheels and one pawl.\nMajor secured the same result by co-operation of a single ratchet wheel and two pawls. In respondent\u2019s machine the Major device is used, and in appellants\u2019 machine the Shipley device of two ratchets and one pawl is adhered to. Both machines use the Shipley method of feeding the metal strip into the machine step by step, but in that part of the operation no long step is required.\nMany years before respondent\u2019s patent, Prentice made and used extensively a machine for fastening on tape the \u201cSecuro\u201d fastener, in regularly spaced groups with gaps between groups, using a single ratchet wheel.\nThere seems, therefore, to be nothing new in respondent\u2019s ratchet feed of the tape step by step with long gaps at required intervals to form separated groups. Neither is there anything novel in obtaining tension on the tape by wrapping same on a knurled roller, as this was a well known method of obtaining a grip on fabric without pinching the fabric so tightly between rollers as to cause injury. The use of roughened rollers to get a better grip on the tape is disclosed in the Olm patent, No. 1,114,177.\nThere is nothing new in respondent\u2019s use of plungers to compress the edges of the metal strip and, through them, the jaws. Aronson used plungers for this purpose, applied directly to the jaws. In any case, the appellants do not use plungers at all for this purpose, but adhere to a common practice disclosed in the patents already referred to, of pressing the jaws between or against inclined planes. These planes, in appellants\u2019 latest design, are pivoted at one end in such a way that, when the unit is pressed between them, they swing on the pivots and close at the point of contact with the unit, thus lessening friction. They constitute no infringement of respondent\u2019s plunger device, which in itself was not new.\nRespondent, at the trial, relied on Claims 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10 and 19.\nClaim 1 has reference to any machine for making fasteners, regardless of the method by which the machine produces them, which has means of feeding fastener members into position to be compressed on to the tape and means for compressing the fastener members thereon. This makes no claim to any particular mode of making the fasteners in the machine, but purports to cover any and all means in such a machine of feeding the tape step by step, feeding fastener members into position, and compressing these on the tape. Fastening Aronson\u2019s machine to any ordinary punch press arranged to form fastener units would infringe this claim. The claim, as already stated, is too wide, and must be limited to the particular means disclosed.\nClaim 2 would cover all the machines previously used for making fasteners, unless it is confined to the particular means used for cutting out the material to be used for the unit and replacing it in the place from which it was cut, and then forming it into the unit. This means is not used by appellants, and is not infringed.\nClaim 3 also must be confined to the particular means described, and is not infringed by appellants, who use an entirely different means.\nClaims 7 and 8, as already stated, cover nothing that was new. Claim 10 covers an ordinary old-time punch press operation, without novelty.\nClaim 19 is exactly covered by the Aronson patent.\nThere is no new invention in respondent\u2019s machine, except the particular mode of carrying the units, after being formed, automatically to the position where the jaws are set astride the corded edge \u00f3f the tape. Various mechanisms for doing this very thing with metal units are disclosed in the other patents of prior date referred to. The general idea of a machine for making and cutting metal units and automatically placing those in succession where they were attached to a suitable carrying member with regular spacing, in separated groups, was old at the date of the respondent\u2019s patent, and the only invention disclosed by respondent\u2019s patent is, as already stated, the particular method of carrying the units, after being formed, so as to place the jaws astride the tape; and this method, and the mechanism by which it is accomplished, are not infringed by appellants\u2019 machine.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs; and the action dismissed, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Harold G.

The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., R. S. Smart, K.C., and H. G. Fox for the appellant.\nD. L. McCarthy, K.C., A. Geoffrion, K.C., and S. A. Hayden for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nEinfret, J.\u2014The appellant brought this action for infringement of Canadian letters patent No. 246727 applied for in the month of May, 1924, and granted on the 10th February, 1925. The action was dismissed by the Exchequer Court of Canada on the ground that the device therein described did not call for sufficient skill or ingenuity to constitute a patentable invention.\nThe invention relates to a particular type of slider for the now well known separable slide fasteners.\nThe earliest slide fasteners were of what was called the \u201ctear\u201d type. In these, the slider had a pull only at one end. It was adapted solely to close the fastener, which was opened by pulling apart the stringers on which the fastening elements were mounted, that is: \u201cby tearing the two sides apart like you tear a piece of paper.\u201d Fasteners of that type were open to a great many objections, of which the chief was that they were not adapted for use on articles where the aperture is permanently closed at each end, such as a purse, a tobacco pouch or any kind of a bag. There was no practical way of operating them on the class of articles which call for such openings and which are probably more numerous than the class of articles where the opening is permanently fixed only at one end. There were \u201cother deficiencies, such as weakness in holding the wings against spreading.\u201d\nThese difficulties were met, in 1916, by the use of a slider with a stiffening yoke running from one end to the other of the slider and to which a travelling pull or tab was attached, so that when the slider was being opened the pull would operate from one end of the yoke, while to close it the same pull would operate from the other end. A patent disclosing that type of slider was applied for in the United States on June 20th, 1917, and issued on May 6th, 1919, while a corresponding Canadian patent issued March 18, 1919. This slider was on the market from the year 1916 to the year 1923. Mr. Sundback, the inventor, stated that, while it made a very considerable improvement, it did not permit of complete commercial success, because of the undue cost of its construction and its undue fragility. However, according to the evidence, that was the type of slider used in almost all fasteners until 1923, when it gradually went out of production. It was replaced by the slider covered by the patent in suit.\nThe specification describes the new slider as an improvement upon previous patents \u201cwherein are shown sliders having the actuating means attached on an end thereof.\u201d The specification goes on to say that\nAccording to this invention, a rigid pull is pivoted at about the centre of the slider, and preferably transversely pivoted to the specially farmed head of the rivet which holds the wings together.\nSuch a construction is adapted to provide a smooth travel for the slider along the stringers; the actuating force applied at about the centre and above the plane of the stringers has an upward component thereof effective to raise the slider instead of raising only one end thereof, as is the case when the pull is attached at the end. This enables the slider to move more easily and smoothly when the actuating force is applied at a central point between the divergent channels. Another advantage accruing from the location of the pull in the centre is the provision of surfaces on either side of the pull, lengthwise of the slider, against which the operator\u2019s fingers may be pressed to steady the movement of the slider and lessen chatter when the pull is held between the fingers, or more precisely the thumb and forefinger. This invention also comprises a rigid construction of few parts.\nThe specification then describes the several parts of the slider by reference to the drawings. It sets forth that the slider is formed from a metal blank having wing portions connected by a neck. The wing portions have inturned edges adapted to provide diverging channels through which the locking members pass. The rivet clamps the wing portions and prevents them from spreading. Before insertion of the rivet, the spacer portions are bent down and inserted between the wings to hold them a fixed distance apart when clamped by the rivet. The lower ends of each spacer are bent inwardly to form inner walls for the diverging channels. The rivet has a head on one side and a portion, on the opposite side, adapted to be bent down in clamping the wings. Within the rivet are guide grooves forming a wedge at the vertex of the diverging channel; and the grooves are rounded to provide the necessary clearance for the locking members and to serve as guides to the latter. The rivet head, as already mentioned, is preferably formed so that a rigid pull is pivoted to it at about the centre of the slider; but the head may be more elongated to permit of a travelling pull which applies the moving force at either end of the slider, according to the direction of the pull.\nAdmittedly the respondent\u2019s slider resembles very closely the slider covered by the patent in suit. The rivet and the spacer walls are substantially the same. The only difference is that the rivet in the appellant\u2019s slider has been bevelled off so as to make a sharp cutting edge for the dividing of the units and the walls or inturned edges are on one wing only in the respondent\u2019s article, while they are on both wings of the appellant\u2019s article. It was not seriously disputed that the respondent\u2019s slider must be held to be an infringement of the slider covered by the patent, and that the appellant\u2019s action must succeed unless the patent be adjudged invalid.\nFurther it may not be denied that the appellant\u2019s slider was not to be found in the prior art in precisely the form in which it is described in the patent. To a certain extent, it was a new combination and the evidence establishes that it was useful. The learned trial judge found that it was lighter, smaller and neater and possibly more rigid than the earlier sliders, to which may be added that it was capable of being manufactured and sold cheaply. But the learned judge did not \u201cthink that these changes are sufficient to constitute subject-matter for a patent, whatever were the reasons for such structural changes.\u201d The result of the appeal, therefore, turns upon the question whether the extent of the advance made over the previous patents showed an inventive step or disclosed an invention in the pertinent sense. In order to ascertain the advantages of the invention, it would seem to us that we will be completely fair to the appellant if we allow the specification to speak for itself:\nAmong the advantages of this invention may be enumerated its simplicity and rigidity of construction whereby the slider body and wings are stamped from a single sheet which also contains the spacer portions. The rivet clamps the wings against the spacers and also prevents spreading of the wings. The rivet is located between the spacers referred to and enables the pull device to be secured in substantially the central part of the slider. This invention provides a rigid slider of minimum overall thicknesses, wherein the pull will naturally lie flat below the top of the rivet. This permits the slider on washable articles to pass readily through a wringer without damage, and also does not provide objectionable projections on articles equipped with this slider. Securing the pull in about the centre of the slider permits a diagonal actuating force to have a component tending to lift the body of the slider instead of only an end thereof to produce smoother travel of the slider. Another feature contributing to smoother travel and resulting from the location of the pull device intermediate the end portions of the slider is the provision of the supporting surfaces on each side of the pull longitudinally of the slider whereby the thumb and finger of the operator may rest against these supporting surfaces to steady the travel of the slider and lessen the tendency to jerks and chatter in its movement. The elongated rivet head provides a very rigid construction for the slider and pull attachment and permits limited travel of the pull relatively to the centre of the slider, which will be desirable in large sliders for heavy work.\nIt will thus be seen that the slides of this invention comprises only three parts, the wings, neck, spacer and inturned edges being formed integral, the rivet holding these parts in fixed position and near the centre of the slider whereby any tendency of the diverging channels to spread is reduced to a minimum and the attachment of the pull device to the rivet head completes the slider.\nThis slider is especially adapted for fasteners attached to purses, bags, tobacco pouches, garments, and others, and is in short applicable to any fastener where it is convenient to hold the pull in such manner that the slider is supported by the fingers to retain its position parallel with the interlocking plane of the fastener. The transverse pivotal attachment of the pull facilitates travel of the slider around corner.\nThe advantages emphasized in the description just quoted are: the slider body (wings, neck and spacers) stamped from a single sheet, the rivet acting as a clamping piece and an anti-spreader, and the attachment of the pull device to the rivet head. Some insistence is made upon \u201csecuring the pull in about the centre of the slider\u201d; but this is not given as a characteristic of the invention, since the specification alternatively refers to an \u201celongated rivet head \u201cproviding for a travelling pull. In fact, claim number 6 selected by the appellant as succinctly stating the combination is in the following terms:\nA slider comprising wings having inturned edges forming diverging channels, a clamping rivet passing through said wings between the channels, and a pull device pivoted to said rivet.\nNow, all the features claimed herein were old. Sliders comprising wings having inturned edges forming diverging channels, pull devices on various parts of the front of the slider including the centre; and rivets connecting wings were all disclosed in the prior art. In fact, the patent in suit is practically a combination of Sundback\u2019s earlier United States patents Nos. 1219881 and 1302606 with a variation in the location of the rivet in the former and the addition of the rivet head as a hitching post for the pull piece.\nNo doubt in almost every patent for mechanical combination the elements are old. But merely putting two things together is not a combination patentable in law. The resulting article may be new in a sense and it may be useful, but the combination is not an invention simply because it possesses advantages not produced before (See dictum of Lord Halsbury in Morgan v. Windover & Co,[1]; and Harwood v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[2]; Riekmann v. Thierry[3]).\nWe do not say that there was no merit in the new combination, but we do not think it was a combination to support a patent, because there was no real step by way of invention within the meaning of the patent law (Wood v. Raphael[4]).\nHaving regard to the state of knowledge at the time of the application, we agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that the improvement did not require such exercise of the inventive faculty as would justify the granting of a monopoly. (Durable Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd.[5]; Atlantic Works v. Brady[6]). With the sliders already known to the art lying before them, Sundback and Prentice working independently, as the evidence shows, each produced the new article almost at the same time. In both cases, the result was brought about by the exercise of mechanical skill. It is not the object of the Patent Act to dignify by the name of invention every slight advance in the domain of mechanism.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court ought to be confirmed and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Harold G.

C.R. 127, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action for damages for alleged infringement of a patent relating to a locking device for separable slide fasteners, was affirmed, on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s patent was invalid, all its essential points having been already brought out in a disclosure patented in France more than two years prior to the application in Canada for the patent in question.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing its action, which was brought for a declaration that the defendants had infringed certain letters patent and that the said letters patent were good, valid and subsisting letters patent, an injunction, damages, etc. The material facts of the case, for the purposes of the present judgment, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs. O. M. Biggar, K.C., R. S. Smart, K.C., and H. G. Fox for the appellant.\nD. L. McCarthy, K.C. and S. A. Hayden for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014This action was brought by the appellant against the respondents for a declaration that a certain patent (No. 288925) granted to the appellant was good, valid and subsisting and that the respondents had infringed the patent. The Exchequer Court of Canada dismissed the action[2] and this is an appeal from the judgment of that court.\nThe patent relates to a locking device for separable slide fasteners, that is to say: fasteners consisting of two rows of co-operating elements (locking members) which are caused to engage with one another by the passage of a slider along the rows and are disengaged by the movement of the slider in the opposite direction.\nThe appellant\u2019s invention is described as follows in the specification of the patent:\nAccording to this invention, a slider pull is provided adjacent its pivot with one or more fingers or lugs shaped to extend through a recess in the slider wing for direct engagement between locking members on one stringer or the lug may indirectly co-operate with said members through the aid of some other part of the slider. Preferably these lugs are spaced longitudinally and laterally to be engaged between locking members on each stringer.\nIt is claimed that the finger or lug automatically moves by gravity into position, through the recess, between two of the co-operating fastener elements and thus provides locking means whereby the slider is retained against movement in either direction on the stringer. A feature is that by means of this device the movement of the slider may be prevented at any point along the stringer.\nThe patent was applied for on the 26th of January, 1928, and was granted on the 16th of April, 1929.\nThe infringing article is also a locking device for separable slide fasteners; and, in the judgment appealed from, it is described as follows:\n* * * the pull or tab has two small lugs on its upper edge, bent at right angles to the face of the pull, one of which is longer than the other, the longer one being intended to go between the units, the other being intended simply as a support. The pull is not pivoted on the front wing of the slider but travels on a longitudinal slide the full length of the slider, and falls below the slider where the longer lug enters between the units, thus preventing any sliding of the fasteners. There is no hok extending through any portion of the wing of the slider. There are two slight recesses, not holes, at the bottom of the slider, on either side of the longitudinal slide, against which the lugs or fingers rest when in a locking position; it is really at the end of the front wing of the slider that the lug enters between the units.\nWe agree with the appellant that, for the purposes of the case, no distinction ought to be made between a travelling and a fixed pull. The invention relates to a mode of locking a slider, not to a mode of attaching the pull; and whether the pull has a fixed or travelling pivot is irrelevant, since it operates in the same way and the substitution of the one for the other has no effect upon the operation of the lock.\nIt is also immaterial whether the finger or lug reaches the fastener elements through a hole or through a recess; both recess and hole fulfill exactly identical functions. At best, one would be the mechanical equivalent for the other. The appellant\u2019s patent shows various embodiments of the invention. The specification uses the word \u201crecess\u201d; but the claims may be construed to cover indifferently a hole or a recess.\nThe respondent Prentice commenced to manufacture his slider lock and put it on the market in the United States in the Fall of 1925. It was shown through Canada early in 1926; but the first definite order for the article in this country was in October, 1926.\nThe respondents pleaded, amongst other things, that the appellant\u2019s patent was invalid because the invention was patented or described in printed publications more than two years before the application for the patent; and, at the trial, reference was made to the fastener of M. Gabriel Fontaine, a patent for which was applied for in France, on the 14th of November, 1923, and granted on the 5th of March, 1924. A copy of the patent was produced, as also an enlarged model of the slider used in connection with that fastener. As described in the patent, in the Fontaine device, the pull of the slider is provided with two spaced lugs adjacent its pivot. When the stringers are drawn up through the channels of the slider, as soon as the pull is released; it comes down by force of gravity and the lugs are pressed against the fastener elements, immediately above the conical edges of the slider, where the fasteners are in engagement, thus offsetting the fasteners, retaining them against movement and preventing the slider from working in any direction.\nThe Fontaine fastener was primarily intended for use on footwear. But we can conceive of no reason why it could not equally be used on any number of other articles where fasteners are employed; and the point is that, in the Fontaine patent, the locking device disclosed is substantially similar, is designed for exactly the same purpose and the disclosure gives the same knowledge as the appellant\u2019s patent. Fontaine, in his patent, begins by describing the invention, first in a general way, and then by way of reference to each of the drawings. On the drawings, the slider is marked as number 7, comprising the coupling member 8 and the pull or tab 9. The fastener elements are indicated by No. 6 and the lugs on the pull by Nos. 10 and 11. Other numbers are used to indicate other parts of the device; but we think that if the above numbers are borne in mind, it will be easy to understand the following quotation from the patent:\nLe rapprochement des bandes en vue de leur embo\u00eetement est obtenu par une pi\u00e8ce 7 formant coulisse. Cette pi\u00e8ce particuli\u00e8re comporte deux parties 8, 9 dont l\u2019une peut pivoter autour de l\u2019autre. La partie 8 qui est creuse, aplatie et cylindro-conique coiffe les extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s oppos\u00e9es des lamelles 6 qui font l\u00e9g\u00e8rement saillie \u00e0 cet effet de sorte que lorsqu\u2019on tire la pi\u00e8ce 7 dans un sens d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque les lamelles passant successivement par la partie conique sont rapproch\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019elles arrivent dans la partie cylindrique et s\u2019embo\u00eetent. La partie 9 porte deux ergots 10, 11 et vient s\u00e9 rabattre, apr\u00e8s fermeture de la chaussure, sur la pi\u00e8ce 8, sa fen\u00eatre 12 recevant la saillie 13 de la pi\u00e8ce 8. Les ergots 10, 11 viennent alors obturer les sorties 14, 15 de la partie conique de la pi\u00e8ce 8 en coin\u00e7ant les lamelles 6 s\u2019y trouvant \u00e0 ce moment et emp\u00eachant ainsi le d\u00e9crochage des bandes, tant que la pi\u00e8ce 9 reste appliqu\u00e9e sur la pi\u00e8ce 8.\nPour d\u00e9faire la chaussure il suffit de relever la pi\u00e8ce 9, de tirer les extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s des bandes en les \u00e9cartant et le d\u00e9crochage a lieu, la pi\u00e8ce 8 coulissant le long des bandes dans le sens inverse de l\u2019accrochage.\nIl reste d\u2019ailleurs entendu que l\u2019invention n\u2019est pas strictement limit\u00e9e aux dispositions d\u00e9crites qui peuvent varier de forme, de dimensions, de mati\u00e8re constitutive, etc.\n\u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nFermeture pour chaussures rempla\u00e7ant le lacet et autres caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e en ce que les bords du soulier \u00e0 r\u00e9unir portent des bandes compos\u00e9es de lamelles m\u00e9talliques distinctes dont l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 libre forme saillie d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et un creux de l\u2019autre pour permettre leur embo\u00eetement lorsque les bords du soulier sont rapproch\u00e9s.\nCe rapprochement est obtenu par une pi\u00e8ce constitu\u00e9e en deux parties dont l\u2019une creuse, plate et cylindro-conique coiffe les saillies oppos\u00e9es des lamelles et dont l\u2019autre qui porte deux ergots vient se rabattre sur la premi\u00e8re pour coincer les lamelles et emp\u00eacher le mouvement des bandes.\nIt will thus be seen that all the essential points in the appellant\u2019s patent were already brought out in Fontaine\u2019s disclosure. This would be made still clearer by reference to the drawings accompanying the patent.\nThe lugs described by Fontaine have complete identity of function with those claimed by the appellant; and they perform that function substantially in the same way. Nor does it matter whether the appellant\u2019s article is a modification of the Fontaine device, which it is not necessary to discuss. (Panyard Machine & Mfg. Co. v. Bowman[3]; MacLaughlin v. Lake Erie & Detroit River Ry. Co.[4]). In Fontaine\u2019s, as well as in the appellant\u2019s and the respondent\u2019s devices, the idea is the same and there is substantial identity in the means of carrying it out. In our view, the difference is a mere variation of details. In Fontaine\u2019s, the lugs engage the fastener elements immediately above the conical sides of the slider. In the appellant\u2019s, the lugs reach the elements through a recess or a hole in the central part of the slider; in Prentice\u2019s, they reach the elements immediately below the slider. The appellant alleged and brought evidence to show that Prentice\u2019s was an infringement of its patent. We may assume that the contention is right. But what amounts to infringement, if posterior, should, as a general rule, amount to anticipation, if anterior. Fontaine\u2019s disclosure having been patented in France on the 5th of March, 1924, or more than two years prior to the application of the appellant in Canada, this affords sufficient ground for displacing the appellant\u2019s patent (Patent Act, sec. 7), which must therefore be declared invalid.\nWithout discussing the other matters involved herein, it follows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Harold G.

After the theft, the automobile was located by the appellant in Quebec in the hands of one Tremblay who had purchased the same, in good faith, from a dealer in similar articles, namely, the respondent, Baptist, for $2,400. The appellant revendicated the car from Tremblay upon payment to him of the sum of $2,400 under the provisions of the fourth paragraph of article 2268 of the Civil Code. Appellant then sought to exercise its recourse against the respondent Baptist, and his surety, The Toronto Casualty Marine and Fire Insurance Company, the other respondent, in virtue of section 21 of chapter 35 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1925. The appellant claimed from the respondents jointly and severally $2,400, and made a further demand against the respondent Baptist only, for $400 in reimbursement of expenses alleged to have been necessarily incurred by it in revendicating the said automobile. The respondents made a common defence on two principal grounds, firstly that the automobile which the appellant acquired from Tremblay was not that which was stolen from Seiss, and secondly that, even if it was, the appellant had no right of action against them, inasmuch as the car had been bought by the respondent Baptist in good faith; in the regular course of business from a regular dealer in automobiles, and, that, under the circumstances of the case as alleged by them, the Motor Vehicles Act did not apply.\nThe trial judge upheld the respondents' plea mainly on the second ground, although in his judgment the evidence did not establish sufficiently the identification of the stolen automobile.\nThe formal judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench, Tellier C.J. and Howard and St. Germain JJ., dismissed appellant's appeal on the ground that \u201cthere is no error in the judgment appealed from but Howard and St. Germain JJ. in their written opinions stated that they arrived at that conclusion exclusively on the ground that the evidence as to the identification of the car was not sufficient. The dissenting judges, Bond and Galipeault JJ., would have allowed the appeal and maintained the appellant's action on the ground that the stolen car had been sufficiently identified, holding further that there was error in the decision of the trial judge that the Motor Vehicles Act did not have the effect of modifying the general law contained in the Civil Code as to the sale of stolen goods, and adding that such a decision was directly conflicting with the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the case of Imperial Assurance Co. v. Lortie[1].\nOn the appeal to this Court, after hearing argument of counsel, the Court reserved judgment and on a subsequent day, delivered judgment allowing the appeal with costs and maintaining the appellant's action for $2,400, as, under the provisions of article 21 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the appellant was entitled only to be reimbursed the amount paid to Tremblay. This Court held that the appellant's evidence was the best available under the circumstances of the case and was sufficient to justify the maintenance of the action. On the question whether the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act had the effect of modifying the enactments of the Civil Code as to stolen goods, the Court, concurring with the judgment of the appellate court, held that there was error in the decision of the trial judge. On this point, Rinfret J., with whom the full Court concurred, in his written reasons said: Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que l'appelante \u00e9tait \u201coblig\u00e9e\u201d d'\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9fauts de la \u201cpossession ou du titre de possession du d\u00e9fendeur\u201d (Baptist). Or, a-t-il ajout\u00e9, \u201cen supposant que l'automobile \u00e9tait celle dont on r\u00e9clame le prix, le d\u00e9fendeur a prouv\u00e9 qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue aux ench\u00e8res, \u00e0 un encan public, au nomm\u00e9 Falcon, et de lui est pass\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur par l'entremise de Reid\u201d. Baptist \u201cest devenu propri\u00e9taire et possesseur dans le cours ordinaire de ses affaires\u201d. Baptist, \u201cqui est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de bonne foi, jure qu'il ignorait que cette automobile avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e; il est un homme de bonne renomm\u00e9e et doit \u00eatre cru; de plus, sa possession de la voiture \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire fait pr\u00e9sumer juste titre; (il) a donc \u00e9tabli l'exception pr\u00e9vue par l'article 1489 du code civil et c'\u00e9tait \u00e0 la demanderesse, \u00e0 son tour, de prouver les vices de la possession et du titre (de Baptist), ce qu'elle n'a pas fait; elle n'a pas \u00e9tabli que Falcon ou Reid s'\u00e9taient entendus avec la maison U.H. Dandurand Limit\u00e9e (les encanteurs) pour faire de cette vente par encan, une vente dolosive et fictive\u201d.\n* * *\n\u201cLa loi concernant les v\u00e9hiclules automobiles ne modifie et n'affecte pas le code civil quant aux articles (1487, 1488, 1489, 2202, 2268 et 412) qui s'appliquent dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\u201d\nBien que le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y a pas d'erreur dans le jugement port\u00e9 en appel, il est \u00e0 remarquer que ceux des juges de cette cour formant la majorit\u00e9 qui ont donn\u00e9 des notes s'appuient exclusivement sur le fait que la preuve d'identification de l'automobile est insuffisante ou incompl\u00e8te. Les deux juges de la minorit\u00e9 signalent que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est directement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Imperial Assurance Company v. Lortie (1).\nSur ce point, nous pouvons croire que la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9tait unanime; et nous pensons comme elle qu'il y a erreur dans le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nEn r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux articles du code civil concernant les \u201cchoses qui peuvent \u00eatre vendues\u201d (Arts. 1486 et suiv. C.C.). il est facile de comprendre le but du l\u00e9gislateur lorsqu'il a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 l'article 21 dans la loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles. Jusque l\u00e0, la vente de la chose qui n'appartenait pas au vendeur \u00e9tait nulle (Art. 1487 C.C.). Elle \u00e9tait valide s'il s'agissait d'une affaire commerciale ou si le vendeur devenait ensuite propri\u00e9taire de la chose (art. 1488 C.C.). Elle \u00e9tait encore valide si la chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la loi. Dans ce cas, elle ne pouvait \u00eatre revendiqu\u00e9e (art. 1490 C.C.). Enfin, elle \u00e9tait valide si la chose perdue ou vol\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e de bonne foi, dans une foire, un march\u00e9, ou \u00e0 une vente publique, ou d'un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res. Dans ce cas, le propri\u00e9taire pouvait la revendiquer; mais il \u00e9tait tenu, pour rentrer en possession, de rembourser \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il en avait pay\u00e9 (art. 1489 C.C.).\nCe que l'article 21 du statut sp\u00e9cial (S.R.Q. 1925, c 35) a ajout\u00e9 au code civil est ceci:\nUne vente d'un v\u00e9hicule automobile faite par une personne qui n'est pas licenci\u00e9e sous l'autorit\u00e9 de cet article \u201cn'est pas cens\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un commer\u00e7ant trafiquant en v\u00e9hicules automobiles\u201d; ou pour employer l'expression du code civil, par un \u201ccommer\u00e7ant trafiquant en semblables mati\u00e8res\u201d. Le but \u00e9vident est d'emp\u00eacher l'application de l'article 1489 du code, et, en pareil cas, d'\u00e9liminer l'obligation du propri\u00e9taire, en revendiquant la machine qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9e, de \u201crembourser \u00e0 l'acheteur le prix qu'il en a pay\u00e9\u201d Donc celui qui ach\u00e8te une automobile d'une personne qui n'est pas licenci\u00e9e perd la protection de l'article 1489 du code civil. D'autre part, si l'acheteur de l'automobile l'a acquise d'une personne licenci\u00e9e, \u201cdans ce cas\u201d, dit l'article 21, \u201cle propri\u00e9taire (du v\u00e9hicule automobile vol\u00e9) \u201ca le droit de r\u00e9clamer en son nom, du commer\u00e7ant et de sa caution, le prix qu'il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'acheteur\u201d.\nD\u00e8s lors la personne licenci\u00e9e ou le commer\u00e7ant et sa caution doivent effectuer \u201cle remboursement du prix que le propri\u00e9taire a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 tout acheteur de ce v\u00e9hicule automobile pour en recouvrer la possession sur revendication comme chose vol\u00e9e\u201d; et ce remboursement doit \u00eatre fait dans tous les cas o\u00f9 se rencontrent les conditions que mentionne l'article 21, sans tenir compte de la bonne foi du vendeur licenci\u00e9, ni des circonstances pr\u00e9vues aux articles 1487 et suivants du code civil. Dans les cas sp\u00e9ciaux que cette l\u00e9gislation pr\u00e9voit, on a voulu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9viter l'application des articles du code. C'est ce que fait tr\u00e8s bien voir la Cour du Banc du Roi re Imperial Assurance v. Lortie[2]. Les notes des juges y sont claires, compl\u00e8tes et convaincantes. Nous ne d\u00e9sirons rien y ajouter. Mais il s'ensuit que les intim\u00e9s ne pouvaient invoquer l'exception pr\u00e9vue par l'article 1489 du code civil, que l'appelante n'avait pas \u00e0 prouver les vices de la possession et du titre de Baptist, et que le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire ne pouvait \u00eatre maintenu, au moins sur ce point.\nNous pouvons maintenant en venir au premier moyen invoqu\u00e9 dans le plaidoyer des intim\u00e9s, c'est-\u00e0-dire le d\u00e9faut d'identification de l'automobile en litige. Ce moyen est rest\u00e9 dans l'ombre dans le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui y fait seulement une rapide allusion (\u201cLa preuve \u00e0 cette fin n'est pas cat\u00e9gorique, certaine, convaincante et suffisante; elle est contradictoire; de plus, la demanderesse \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e d'\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9fauts de la possession ou du titre de possession du d\u00e9fendeur,\u201d etc.) pour passer imm\u00e9diatement, comme on peut le voir, \u00e0 la discussion de la question de droit qui est devenue la v\u00e9ritable ratio decidendi du jugement. Pour cette raison sp\u00e9ciale, nous croyons pouvoir intervenir dans la d\u00e9cision de cette question d'identit\u00e9, de m\u00eame que l'a fait la Cour du Banc du Roi, d'autant plus que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne s'est pas prononc\u00e9 sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins, et qu'il a naturellement pes\u00e9 les faits du point de vue de l'opinion qu'il \u00e9mettait sur la question de droit.\nLa m\u00e9thode d'enregistrement adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 l'usine de fabrication des voitures Cadillac a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate:\nEach car has a separate combination part number. When the car is assembled there is a record made which is called the assembly record, and it appertains to a particular motor number, and the serial number of the car when it is sold.\nQ. And each car has a different assembly record ?\nA. Yes, each car has a different assembly record.\nQ. In your long experience you must have acquired some knowledge as to the manner in which numbers are stamped on different parts of cars?\nA. Yes.\nQ. When numbers are stamped by the factory, how are those numbers applied? What I mean is, are they applied regularly or irregularly?\nA. They are regularly applied, all the figures being the same height and the same width.\nQ. Are they on the same line?\nA. On the same line. La voiture vol\u00e9e \u00e0 Seiss et revendiqu\u00e9e de Tremblay \u00e9tait une automobile de la marque Cadillac. Elle avait donc son; \u201cassembly record\u201d (enregistrement). Ce \u201crecord\u201d a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par Seiss et par le t\u00e9moin Horan. Nous admettons que la preuve qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte n'\u00e9tait pas la meilleure dont le cas \u00e9tait susceptible (art. 1204 C.C.). On aurait pu faire venir comme t\u00e9moin celui qui est pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la garde des enregistrements \u00e0 la compagnie Cadillac et lui demander d'apporter le \u201crecord\u201d de l'automobile vendue \u00e0 Seiss; mais Horan avait vu le \u201crecord\u201d et il avait v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 personnellement les num\u00e9ros attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque pi\u00e8ce de l'automobile de Seiss. Il a fait cette preuve devant la cour sans objection. La l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette preuve ne pouvait plus \u00eatre contest\u00e9e devant les tribunaux d'appel (Schwerzenski v. Vineberg[3]; Gervais v. McCarthy[4]. D'ailleurs, \u00e0 l'audition, le procureur des intim\u00e9s n'a pas attaqu\u00e9 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette preuve, mais il s'est born\u00e9 \u00e0 en discuter la valeur probante.\n* * *\n(Here the judgment deals with the facts of the case, and then concludes as follows.)\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi semble avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de l'id\u00e9e qu'il fallait que l'identit\u00e9 de la voiture f\u00fbt \u00e9tablie jusqu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9monstration. Nous croyons respectueusement qu'on ne pouvait en exiger autant de la demande, que la preuve qu'elle a offerte \u00e9tait la plus satisfaisante dont le cas \u00e9tait susceptible et qu'elle \u00e9tait suffisante pour le maintien de l'action. En envisageant l'ensemble de la preuve, nous ne pouvons en venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion.\nNous sommes donc d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu; mais le montant dont l'appelante peut demander le remboursement en vertu de l'article 21 de la loi des v\u00e9hicules automobiles est seulement le prix qu'elle a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Tremblay. Elle devra donc avoir jugement pour la somme de $2,400 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et les d\u00e9pens dans toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nF. Philippe Brais K.C. for the appellant.\nC. A.

Farren (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: March 1; 1933: May 8.\nPresent: Duff, Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPEAL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK\nTitle to lands\u2014Wilderness land\u2014Documentary title\u2014Evidence\u2014Burden of proof\u2014Pedigree evidence\u2014Rule as to such evidence.\nThe matter in (controversy in the respondent\u2019s action involved the title to and ownership of 200 acres of wilderness or wood-land. The respondent claimed title to the property through a conveyance dated May 3, 1920, from John and James Fitzgerald, the sons and heirs of one David Fitzgerald, deceased, who, in turn, was alleged to have been the only child of one Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee from the Crown. The appellant company claimed a documentary title to the property through a series of five conveyances from the first deed in 1897 to the last in 1909, and also claimed a title by continuous, exclusive and adverse possession in itself and its predecessors in possession for a period of over twenty years. The trial judge, after having admitted as evidence, subject to objection by appellant\u2019s counsel, the declarations made to witnesses by the two brothers, John and James Fitzgerald, concerning their own pedigree, excluded them in his judgment and dismissed respondent\u2019s action, finding that the appellant company had established its title to the property. The Appeal Division reversed the judgment.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Appeal Division (5 M.P.R. 261), that the trial judge was justified in excluding the declarations of the deceased grantors in the deed to the respondent, John and James Fitzgerald, as evidence that they were grandsons of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee from the Crown and that he was also justified in reaching the conclusion that the respondent had failed to establish his title. Crocket J. dissenting.\nHeld, also, Crocket J. dissenting, that the statements made by James and John Fitzgerald to the respondent, when the sale was being negotiated and they were trying to establish their title, would appear to be inadmissible, as having been made in favour of interest and at a time when, in the circumstances of the case, the title itself and the question of relationship had already become matters in controversy within the principle of the rule stated below. At all events, the interest of James and John Fitzgerald was so obvious and of such a character as to entitle the Court to regard their declarations as destitute of evidentiary weight. Declarations as to pedigree made by deceased persons are receivable to establish the particular issue, provided they were made ante litem motam (i.e., \u201cbefore the commencement of any controversy, actual or legal, upon the same point\u201d), and provided the deceased are proved aliunde to be members of the family by extrinsic evidence. The declarant\u2019s relationship must be proved independently and cannot be established by his own statement. The rule must be understood in this sense, that the party on whom the onus lies to establish the affirmative of the issue and who, for the purposes of the issues, must show that A was in family relation with B (as, for example, in such cases as the present where the party seeks to establish a right to property through inheritance from B) must adduce some evidence that the declarant was \u201cde jure by blood or marriage\u201d a member of the family of B.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting).\u2014The trial judge has erred in excluding the declarations of John and James Fitzgerald as evidence that they were grandsons of the original grantee from the Crown; and, when the whole record of the trial, including these declarations, is considered, the decision of the Appeal Division in favour of the respondent should be affirmed. The rule as to pedigree evidence, applicable to this case, is that any declaration made by a deceased person touching his own pedigree is prima facie admissible as proceeding from one who is presumed to possess competent knowledge of the matter of which he speaks, and that no interest, which falls short of constituting a lis mota or actual or legal controversy upon the precise question which is the subject-matter of such a declaration, will render it inadmissible. If it appears, either from the declaration itself or from any other evidence which may be tendered, that there was, before or at the time the declaration was made, such a controversy upon the particular fact of which the declaration speaks and which it is sought to prove by it, the declaration will not be received.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Grimmer sitting in Chancery and maintaining the respondents\u2019 action for a declaration that he was the owner of 200 acres of wilderness or wood-land situated in King\u2019s County.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. N. Carter for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, reversing Grimmer J. sitting without a jury, who dismissed with costs an action for a declaration that the respondent is the owner of lot number 40 containing 200 acres in the parish of Upham, King\u2019s County, in the province of New Brunswick, for an injunction to restrain the appellants from entering on the lot and for damages for trespass and conversion of wood cut on the lot by the appellants.\nThe respondent claimed to be the owner of the land, which is wilderness land, by virtue of a deed given to himself and one Alexander Crawford, on the 3rd of May, 1920, by John and James Fitzgerald who pretended to have inherited the land from Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee;\u2014Crawford having later sold his rights to the respondent.\nThe contention was that Elizabeth Fitzgerald died intestate leaving a son, David Fitzgerald, who in turn died intestate leaving his sons and heirs, the above named John and James Fitzgerald.\nThe burthen was on the respondent to establish that contention. The respondent claimed a declaration and decree that he was the owner in fee. He produced a deed purporting to come from the alleged heirs of the original grantee. The relationship of the vendors having been challenged, the onus was on the respondent to prove it, not upon the appellants to show that it did not exist. Of course, the deed itself recited the supposed lineal descent, but that was nothing more than the vendor\u2019s own declaration made, at the time of the sale, in order to establish their interest in the land. Recitals of that character do not amount to evidence of title.\nJames and John Fitzgerald died before the trial and, in fact, some time before the action was brought. As evidence of their relationship with Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the respondent attempted to prove the statements they made pending the negotiations leading to the sale. He also called as a witness one John Meyers, to prove declarations alleged to have been made concerning their genealogy by deceased members of the Fitzgerald family.\nDeclarations as to pedigree made by deceased persons are receivable to establish the particular issue, provided they were made ante litem motam (i.e. \u201cbefore the commencement of any controversy, actual or legal, upon the same point\u201d), and provided the deceased are proved aliunde to be members of the family by extrinsic evidence. The declarant\u2019s relationship must be proved independently and cannot be established by his own statement.\nThe rule, we think, must be understood in this sense, that the party on whom the onus lies to establish the affirmative of the issue and who, for the purposes of the issues, must show that A was in family relation with B (as, for example, in such cases as the present where the party seeks to establish a right to property through inheritance from B) must adduce some evidence that the declarant was \u201cde jure by blood or marriage\u201d a member of the family of B.\nIt was said by Lord Brougham, apparently, in Monkton v. Attorney General[2] that it would be sufficient to show that the declarant was a member of the family of A; and this view of Lord Brougham has been acted upon in other cases and has been very vigorously supported by a well known and very able American writer on the law of evidence, Professor Wigmore.\nThe weight of authority, however, is decisively in favour of the rule as stated. In the Berkeley Peerage case[3], Lord Eldon expressed himself thus:\nAccordingly, in the Banbury case[4], as the depositions under the bill to perpetuate testimony contained many statements with regard to pedigree, a question was put to the Judges, whether if they could not be received as depositions, they could be received as declarations. The Judges thought that at all events the depositions could not be received as declarations, unless the individuals whose declarations were supposed to be incorporated in the depositions were aliunde proved to be relations, and that there was no such evidence.\nIn Plant v. Taylor[5], Baron Channel, speaking, in 1861, for the Court of Exchequer, which included at that time Baron Bramwell and Sir James P. Wilde, used this language, at p. 237,\nAs we have stated more than once, the sole question of fact in dispute at the trial was the legitimacy of the defendant Taylor and the female defendants. This depended on the validity of the marriage of the persons who were de facto their father and mother. The fact of the marriage of the father, Thomas Taylor, with Anne Wickstead before his marriage with the mother of the defendant Taylor, and that Anne Wickstead was at that time living, was proved.\nThe defendant, Taylor, was called as a witness to prove declarations by his father respecting his first marriage. Before a declaration can be admitted in evidence the relationship of the declarant de jure, by blood or marriage, must be established by some proof, independent of the declaration itself. See the cases cited in Taylor on Evidence, vol. 1, p. 526, note 4.\nSlight evidence, no doubt, would be sufficient. Here there was no proof of any relationship de jure between the declarant and the defendant. The proof was the contrary.\nThe cases collected in the note in Taylor on Evidence, to which Channell B. refers include, inter alia, the Banbury Peerage case and the Berkeley Peerage case[6].\nIn Hitchins v. Eardley[7] Lord Penzance who, as above mentioned, was a member of the court which pronounced judgment in Plant v. Taylor[8], said:\nThe rule of law on the subject is perfectly plain. It is that when a witness is called to give evidence of the declarations of a person whose connection with the family is in question, the judge is to decide whether this connection is established. It is obvious the application of this rule must lead to some practical difficulties, where the person whose declarations are tendered and objected to is also the person whose legitimacy is the question in the suit, and the Court must do its best to meet these difficulties in a practical way.\nIn Aalholm v. People[9], the Court of Appeals of New York, after a very careful review of the authorities, American as well as English, followed the judgment in Plant v. Taylor8.\nThe phrase ante litem motam in itself might be capable of misconstruction. It contemplates a time anterior to the commencement of any actual controversy upon the point at issue.\nThe statements made by James and John Fitzgerald to Farren and Crawford, when the sale was being negotiated and they were trying to establish their title, would appear to be inadmissible, as having been made in favour of interest and at a time when, in the circumstances of the case, the title itself and the question of relationship had already become, it may fairly be held, matters in controversy within the principle of the rule. At all events, the interest of James and John Fitzgerald was so obvious and of such a character as to entitle us to regard their declarations as destitute of evidentiary weight.\nIn Plant v. Taylor8, the Court of Exchequer thought the declaration of Thomas Taylor, the father, though made before any dispute as regards the property had actually arisen, might, perhaps, be inadmissible as a declaration by a person whose mind could not be free from bias; it was manifestly in many ways directly for his interest to make a declaration having a tendency to show that his first marriage was an illegal marriage and the second, consequently, valid.\nNo case has been cited (said Channell B.) in which the declaration of a deceased person obviously interested has ever been received.\nThis is reported in 1903 by Joyce J. in Brocklebank v. Thompson[10].\nIn the premises, the interest of James and John Fitzgerald was so obvious, at the time and in the circumstances the declarations were made, that their statement on the very point in question ought not to be held receivable.\nThe only other evidence was that of John Meyers who, the trial judge said, \u201cclaimed to be a nephew of the Fitzgeralds.\u201d In truth, there is in the record nothing to identify him as a member of the family, outside of his own self declarations to that effect. Myers, if his story proved to be correct, was interested in the result of the litigation and would have the same rights as John and James Fitzgerald. On his own admission, he came down to the trial, from Boston, because he had an interest in the outcome.\nMoreover, his evidence comes far short of establishing, in such a way as to satisfy a judicial mind, the all important fact of the connecting link between Elizabeth Fitzgerald and David, the father of the respondent\u2019s vendors. Throughout his testimony, he failed to commit himself to any relevant statement. On the vital issue, the concrete facts are all to be found in the questions put to him by counsel, and his answers are vague and indefinite. In addition, they contain inaccuracies and contradictions pointed to by the trial judge, who found him unreliable and was even disposed to disregard his evidence altogether on the ground of lack of credibility.\nWe think, for these reasons, the trial judge was justified in reaching the conclusion that the plaintiff respondent had failed to establish his title. The evidence is not of such a character that the courts may judicially act upon it and declare John and James Fitzgerald the lineal descendants of the original grantee and, as a consequence, adjudge to the respondent the ownership of the lot in suit.\nPerhaps one other point ought to be mentioned. Admittedly, the name of the original grantee\u2019s husband was Ezekiel Fitzgerald. A certified copy of the registration of death of David Fitzgerald was produced. Under the law of New Brunswick, these certificates or \u201cextracts\u201d are \u201cprima facie evidence in any court of the facts therein stated\u201d (The Health Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 59, s. 36-5). In the certificate, the name of David\u2019s father is given as William Fitzgerald. It does not, therefore, correspond with the name of the husband of the original grantee. We are unable to find in the record any ground upon which to repel the evidentiary value of the certificate, which stands with its full force and effect.\nThere are several other circumstances in the evidence pointing to the same result; but we do not deem it necessary to dwell upon them.\nIn our view, the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the declaration and decree as to ownership prayed for by the respondent could not be granted by the court. That is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge must be restored with costs here and in the Appeal Division.\nCrocket J. (dissenting)\u2014With all deference, I am of opinion that the learned trial judge was not justified in excluding the declarations of the deceased grantors in the Farren-Crawford deed, James and John Fitzgerald, as evidence that they were grandsons of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee from the Crown.\nTwo grounds of objection to the admissibility of these declarations were put forward on the argument, viz: first, that there was no evidence de-hors the declarations shewing any relationship by blood or marriage between the declarants and the original grantee; and, second, that the declarations were not made ante litem motam.\nAs to the first ground, the law is clear that if a declaration of a deceased person is tendered to prove a matter touching the pedigree of another, it must be proved aliunde that the declarant is related by blood or marriage to the person whose pedigree is in question, but among the numerous cases I have examined on the rule relied upon, I can find none which decide that where the declaration of a deceased person is made concerning his own lineage, such a declaration is not admissible until his lineage is independently proved by other testimony. When one considers the fundamental reason for the relaxation, in matters of pedigree as well as in matters of public and general interest, of the rule rejecting hearsay and reputation, one can well appreciate why it has been consistently held that some proof should be adduced of the relationship of a declarant, who is dead, to the person of whose pedigree his declaration speaks, but for my part I can discover no reason for applying such a rule to the declaration of a deceased person concerning his own pedigree. The very ground upon which such declarations are let in on matters of pedigree is the impossibility of proving by living witnesses the relationships of past generations, and the presumption that, when these declarations are made by relatives of the person whose pedigree is involved, they are made by those who have the greatest interest in seeking, and the best opportunity of knowing the truth on the subject.\nSimilarly hearsay and reputation in the form of declarations of deceased persons are admitted upon matters of public and general interest. Taylor\u2019s treatise on the Law of Evidence points out that on matters of public interest, which concern every member of the state, reputation from anyone is receivable, and that the want of proof of a declarant\u2019s connection with the subject in question affects the value only and not the admissibility of the evidence, all the King\u2019s subjects being presumed to have some knowledge of rights, which are essentially public, while in matters which are not strictly public, but of general interest\u2014being confined to a lesser, though still a considerable portion of the community\u2014some particular evidence of knowledge of the subject matter involved is generally required to render a declaration of a deceased person admissible. In treating of this distinction that well known work states in paragraph 612, 12th ed., 1931:\u2014\nIf the quality of the hearsay itself raises a natural inference that it was derived from persons acquainted with the subject, the Court will not require independent proof of that fact.\nIt seems to me that the rule requiring independent proof of relationship of the deceased declarant in cases of pedigree with the person, regarding whose pedigree his declaration is made, is based on the same consideration as the rule requiring independent proof in cases of general, as distinguished from public rights, viz:\u2014that the declaration proceed from a source which the law presumes possesses that competent knowledge which is an essential prerequisite of its admission.\nPhipson\u2019s Evidence, 7th ed., 1930, states the relationship rule as follows:\u2014\nThe declarations are only receivable from persons legitimately connected by blood with the person or family whose pedigree is in question, or from the husbands or wives of persons so connected.\nHere the declarations objected to are the declarations of two brothers, James and John Fitzgerald, concerning their own pedigree, viz.; that they were grandsons of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee. It was the pedigree of the declarants themselves which was in question, and as to this there could assuredly be no more competent knowledge than their own. In the words of Lord Chancellor Cranworth in the Shrewsbury Peerage Case[11],\nthe declarations are made by (one of the) persons supposed to be perfectly cognizant of\nthe subject matter of which they speak. To require as a prerequisite to the admission of such a declaration other and independent proof of the very fact which the declarations are tendered to establish, viz: that the declarants were grandsons of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, would, it seems to me, not only involve the same superfluous absurdity, which Lord Brougham points out, in Monkton v. Attorney-General[12], and Taylor\u2019s Law of Evidence, referring to the latter case, in paragraph 640, but \u201cwould\u201d at the same time\u2014to quote the words of that distinguished Lord Chancellor in the same case upon the submission that the declarations must be shewn to be contemporaneous with the events to which they relate\u2014\u201ddefeat the purpose for which hearsay in pedigree is let in.\u201d\nSurely the presumption of the law must be that a man knows the names of his own grandparents as well as others, who are more remote relatives and who must therefore go further afield to connect themselves with the deceased person whose pedigree is in question and who is long since dead. Is it reasonable to suppose that once relationship is established, no matter in what degree, with the person whose pedigree is in question, the courts will presume that any relative possesses sufficient knowledge of the pedigree of that person to render his declaration admissible, and yet will not presume that the person himself possesses the requisite knowledge for that purpose? As to whether the fact that the declarants themselves had an interest which might cast suspicion upon the genuineness of their declarations is another question, which I shall discuss when treating of the second ground of objection, remarking only in the meantime that, in my opinion, unless there be a lis mota existent before the declaration which is tendered, interest goes only to the weight and not to the admissibility of the evidence. Apart from the doctrine of lis mota presumed knowledge is the ground of admissibility, not lack of interest.\nIt therefore seems to me that it is only by assuming that when the rule in question speaks of the necessity of proving the relationship aliunde it refers to a relationship of the declarant with the person or family of the ancestor, through whom a property is claimed, and not of relationship with the person whose lineage is really involved, that that rule can have any applicability to the case at bar. For such an assumption, as I have already intimated, I have been unable to find any decisive authority and no warrant in the principles upon which hearsay evidence is admitted in pedigree cases. If the rule is to be thus interpreted it \u201cwould,\u201d as Taylor on Evidence puts it,\nto use a homely illustration, render inadmissible the statement of a deceased person as to the maiden name of his own grandmother.\nunless the person relying upon such statement were able first to prove by other testimony the very fact which the deceased declarant\u2019s statement is tendered to establish. There would indeed be few cases in which descent from persons of long past generations could be proved at all. No greater encouragement could be given to those disposed to squat on long vacant wooded lands than by the adoption of such an interpretation of the rule as is here contended for.\nI concede that it was an essential requisite of the plaintiff\u2019s case that he prove that James and John Fitzgerald, from whom he derived his title to the land, were heirs of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee, but this fact does not, of course, deprive him of the benefit of the rules of evidence, which, for the very purpose of making possible what otherwise would be impossible, have so relaxed the doctrine against hearsay, as to render admissible for what they are worth all declarations of deceased persons, in matters of pedigree, of which the law may fairly presume the deceased declarants were fully cognizant. The fact that the reputed grandmother was the original grantee of the land in dispute, does not make her the person with whom relationship must be established. The relationship meant is, in my opinion, relationship with the person whose lineage is in question. In the case at bar James and John Fitzgerald were the persons whose pedigree was in reality, as it seems to me, involved. Had they been living and themselves been the plaintiffs in this action I cannot conceive of any valid objection which could have been made on the trial to any question put to either of them as to the names of his grandparents, unless his cross-examination clearly disclosed that he did not in fact know, either by personal knowledge or by family repute or tradition, in which event the presumption the law makes of competent knowledge in such a matter would, of course, be effectually rebutted.\nPlant v. Taylor[13], which is chiefly relied on, and upon which the learned trial judge apparently based his decision as to proof of relationship, by no means makes it clear in my judgment that, in such a case as we are now dealing with, any proof aliunde is required to establish relationship with the ancestor from whom the title to the land in dispute is derived. In that case the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the land in question under a power of appointment was conditioned on default of lawful issue of the reputed father of the defendants. Proof of the absence of lawful issue of the defendants\u2019 father was therefore essential to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and, as stated in the reasons for judgment, the sole question of fact in dispute at the trial was the legitimacy of the defendants. The plaintiffs accordingly proved that at the time the defendants\u2019 father married the mother of the defendants, he was married to another woman. One of the defendants, a son by the second marriage, was called as a witness to prove declarations by his deceased father respecting his first marriage. This evidence was rejected by the trial judge, and the Court of Exchequer sustained that ruling. It is true that in the reasons for judgment the Court states that before a declaration can be admitted in evidence relationship of the declarant de jure, by blood or marriage, must be established by some proof, independent of the declaration itself. This passage itself throws no light upon the identity of the persons between whom such relationship must be shewn to exist, but the Court after stating that \u201cslight evidence, no doubt, would be sufficient\u201d of such relationship, proceeds: \u201cHere there was no proof of any relationship de jure between the declarant (the father) and the defendant (the reputed son). The proof was the contrary,\u201d and this, I take to be the real ground of the decision. While it was the legitimacy of the reputed son and his sisters which was in issue, and this depended on the validity of the marriage of the persons who were de facto their father and mother, the Court held, that the plaintiffs having already proved that the reputed marriage with the defendant\u2019s mother took place while the declarant\u2019s wife by the former marriage was still living, a declaration of the deceased father ought not to be received for the purpose of establishing that his own former marriage was invalid and the later one as a consequence valid, and that the defendants were therefore his lawful children, without some proof, independent of the declaration itself, that the defendants were de jure the children of the declarant. I can find no analogy between that case and the case at bar. The law manifestly would not presume that the declarant was cognizant of the invalidity of his own marriage. Moreover, while the declaration tendered in Plant v. Taylor[14] was the declaration of the ancestor himself, to whom, as it happened, the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the land in dispute had to be traced, the decision, as I apprehend it, cannot in any view be regarded as in any way indicating that a declaration of a deceased person respecting pedigree must be shewn, independently of the declaration itself, to be the declaration of one who is related de jure to the ancestor from whom the title to the land in dispute is inherited. If it decides anything with respect to the identity of the persons between whom the required relationship must be established it is that a relationship must be shewn to exist between the declarant and the person, whose legitimacy was in question, and in that aspect confirms, rather than controverts, the view I have ventured to express upon this point. Neither do I think that the excerpt from Lord Eldon\u2019s reasons, quoted by my brother Rinfret from the Berkeley Peerage case[15], decides that the relationship which the rule contemplates, is a relationship of the declarant with the ancestor from whom title to the land in dispute must be derived.\nAs to the second ground of objection upon the question of lis mota and interest, there is no doubt that if at the time the declarations relied on were made there was any actual or legal controversy with reference to the point as to which the declarations were made, viz: the fact of the declarants being grandsons of Elizabeth Fitzgerald, the original grantee, they would not be admissible, but that controversy must relate to the precise point to which the declarations are sought to be applied. See Freeman v. Phillips[16]; also the judgments of Sir C. Cresswell, Wightman, J. and Williams, J., in Shedden v. Attorney-General[17], and particularly the following dictum of Williams, J.:\u2014\nI apprehend the true view is this: that the controversy which is to make the evidence of declarations of the members of the family inadmissible must be a controversy which has arisen in respect of the very point in dispute to which the proposed evidence is relevant.\nIn my opinion there is no evidence that there was, at the time the declarations here excluded were made or at any time, anything in the nature of a lis mota upon that question. The fact of the declarants being the heirs of the original grantee of the land in question was never challenged by the appellant or its predecessors in title otherwise than by the registration of deeds comprising, with many other lots, the lot of land claimed by the plaintiff\u2014deeds which did not pretend to be derived from the original grantee or any of her heirs, devisees or grantees, but which themselves disclose were founded on a conveyance from one W. H. Rourke and five other grantors of the same family name, and their wives, dated 13th December, 1897, without indicating any connection with any prior conveyance of any description from any earlier grantor, leaving a hiatus of over 55 years between the date of the original grant to Elizabeth Fitzgerald, which was dated August 4, 1842. These conveyances were no doubt sufficient to pass any possessory title which the Rourkes had established to the lot. While they may be said in that sense to controvert the title of the heirs of the original grantee, they cannot in my opinion be properly held to raise a controversy upon the point which it was sought by the declarations to establish on the trial of this action, viz: that James and John Fitzgerald were heirs of the original grantee. It was at most the possession of the land against the heirs, whoever they were, that the registration of the Rourke deeds disputed\u2014not the identity of the heirs. It is true that the plaintiff in order to maintain his action had to prove that John and James Fitzgerald, through whom he claimed his title, were heirs of the original grantee, and that this fact thus became an issue on the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s action, but, as I understand the doctrine of lis mota, the admissibility of the declarations relied on for the required proof of heirship, is unchallengeable in the absence of evidence that the particular fact which these declarations sought to establish had become a subject of controversy before the declarations were made.\nI can find no authority for the proposition that the mere fact that the declaration of a deceased person as to his lineage may have or does have the effect of supporting his title to land to which a claim of adverse possession is being made affords of itself any valid ground for rendering that declaration inadmissible, while on the other hand there are cases which distinctly hold that, in questions of pedigree, declarations tending to support the title of the declarant to land are admissible in behalf of a plaintiff claiming under the declarant if made ante litem motam. See Tilman v. Tarver[18], where Abbott, Lord C.J., said:\u2014\nI think them (declarations tending to support the title of the declarant) admissible notwithstanding, having been made ante litem motam. I remember a case of title to a peerage before the House of Lords in which the widow was allowed to prove the declarations of her deceased husband in support of her son\u2019s title, though the husband, if living, would have had the right which the declarations went to establish; and this has been followed up since. If no controversy existed at the time, the principle acted on is, that such declarations are admissible, though subject to observation.\nIn Jenkins v. Davies[19], Lord Denman, C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, used the following words, which appear to me very specially to apply to the present case:\u2014\nThe last disputed piece of evidence was a deed to which Elizabeth Stevens, then Davies, was a party, under the description of daughter and heiress of John Davies; and one Evan John, an undoubted relation, was also a party. Evan John was the tenant for life of the property in question; and she joined with him in conveying it to those under whom the defendants claimed to hold. Here was the declaration, therefore, both of Elizabeth Davies and of Evan John. It was objected to on account of the interest they had in making out things to be as there represented; and at least this intention of disposing of the property was said to be equivalent to a lis mota. But we think that this objection also fails. No dispute existed: but the parties did what they had a right to do, if members of the family. Almost every declaration of relationship is accompanied with some feeling of interest, which will often cast suspicion on the declarations, but has never been held to render them inadmissible.\nIt is true that in Whitelock v. Baker[20], Lord Eldon laid it down that the admissibility of declarations of deceased persons on questions of pedigree was founded upon the presumption that the words given in evidence are the natural effusion of the party upon an occasion when his mind stands even without bias to exceed the truth or to fall short of it, and that this has been recognized generally as a qualification of the principle upon which such declarations are to be received, but this dictum does not, I think, mean that it is to be presumed from the mere fact that a declaration of a deceased person upon a question of pedigree would tend to support the declarant\u2019s title to land or other property that there is such a bias as to render the declaration inadmissible.\nIn Monkton v. Attorney-General[21], Lord Brougham, L.C., commenting upon Lord Eldon\u2019s statement, said:\nI entirely agree that the words must be the natural effusion of the party and that, generally speaking, he must have no bias upon his mind. But even here there must be a limit. It will be no valid objection to such evidence that the party may have stood, or thought he stood (for that would equally bias) in pari casu with the party tendering the declaration, and relying upon it for the purpose of his own contention; for it has been decided, that although the party deceased, whose declaration you are giving in evidence, was in pari casu, and, if he had been living might have stood in the shoes of the party who tenders his declaration in evidence, that is not sufficient to exclude it.\nAnd again at page 161:\u2014\nIt was then asked as an argument for the further restriction of the rule, if a man may sit down to frame a pedigree how can you receive that pedigree in evidence like an ordinary declaration, when non constat, he may not have been in the act of making evidence for himself by preparing a document which should afterwards profit him or those in whom he is interested? To that I answer \u201cShow me that the pedigree in question was prepared with that view. Bring it within the rule either of Whitelock v. Baker[22], or of the Berkeley Peerage case[23]; prove that it was made post litem motam, not meaning thereby a suit actually pending, but a controversy existing, and that the person making or concocting the declaration took part in the controversy; show me even that there was a contemplation of legal proceedings with a view to which the pedigree was manufactured, and I shall then hold that it comes within the rule which rejects evidence fabricated for a purpose by a man who has an interest of his own to serve.\u201d The question then always will be (and so far I agree with the argument of the Crown) was the evidence in the particular circumstances manufactured or was it spontaneous and natural? If I thought that this came within the description of manufactured evidence, manufactured for a purpose connected with the present controversy, I should of course at once have rejected it, but upon looking at it and examining it, I cannot upon the whole bring my mind to see that it was fabricated in such circumstances or with such a view as should bring it within the principle adverted to.\nThat the principles thus enunciated in Tilman v. Tarver[24]; Monkton v. Attorney-General[25]; Jenkins v. Davies[26], and Shedden v. Attorney-General[27] regarding the admissibility of declarations of deceased relatives upon questions of pedigree and the bearing of the doctrine of lis mota therein have never been authoritatively challenged and are still recognized as the settled law of England is clearly shewn by Taylor\u2019s treatise on the Law of Evidence already referred to, where all these cases and many others of the same effect are treated as laying down the law as it now stands upon these important subjects. For instance at page 402 of this work it is stated regarding the legal meaning of lis mota in English law as a controversy:\u2014\nThe commencement of the controversy was at one time further defined by Alderson, B., to be \u201cthe arising of that state of facts on which the claim is founded\u201d without anything more; but this dictum, though afterwards upheld by Lord Cottenham, has since been overruled (Shedden v. Attorney-General and it is now decided that there must be, not merely facts which may lead to a dispute, but a lis mota, or suit, or controversy preparatory to a suit, actually commenced, or dispute arisen, and upon the very same pedigree or subject matter which constitutes the question in litigation.\nAnd again at page 403:\u2014\nIt follows from the above explanation of lis mota that declarations * * * are admissible if no dispute has arisen, though made in direct support of the title of the declarant and * * * that the mere fact of the declarant having stood or haying believed that he stood in pari jure with the party relying on the declaration will not render his statement inadmissible (Monkton v. Attorney-General[28]).\nAnd, again on the same page, referring particularly to a peerage case (Zouoh Peer 1807) Parl. Min., 207, which seemed to throw some doubt upon the admissibility of a declaration made in direct support of the title of the declarant:\u2014\nBut even if the peerage case just referred to be not susceptible of this explanation, a single isolated decision can scarcely controvert a rule of law which has been sanctioned and acted upon by numerous Judges and is so founded on reason that a contrary doctrine would go far towards excluding all evidence of reputation.\nFor the reasons already appearing, I am of opinion that any declarations made by a deceased person touching his own pedigree is prima facie admissible as proceeding from one who is presumed to possess competent knowledge of the matter of which he speaks, and that no interest, which falls short of constituting a lis mota or actual or legal controversy upon the precise question which is the subject-matter of such a declaration, will render it inadmissible. If it appears, either from the declaration itself or from any other evidence which may be tendered, that there was, before or at the time of the declaration was made, such a controversy upon the particular fact of which the declaration speaks and which it is sought to prove by it, the declaration will not be received.\nPlant v. Taylor[29], already referred to, and a passage from the judgment of Joyce, J., on the trial of the action of Brocklebank v. Thompson[30], are particularly relied upon in support of the proposition that the declaration of a deceased person upon a matter of pedigree is inadmissible if the declarant is obviously interested or the declaration is one which is obviously made for his own interest. I have already pointed out in discussing the first objection the dissimilarity between the facts in Plant v. Taylor[31] and those in the case at bar, and what was the real ground of the decision in the former. At best the statements relied upon in that judgment were mere dicta, and obviously contingent ones, as appears from the words by which they are introduced:\nPerhaps the learned trial judge was right in excluding the evidence on the ground that any declaration * * * though not made post litem motam * * * would be a declaration by a person whose mind could not be free from bias.\nHad the decision been based upon the ground of obvious interest, which the court seems to have been careful to avoid, no criticism could well have been made of the statement that a declaration tending to shew that the declarant\u2019s first marriage was void and his second consequently valid, the negation of which would have stamped him as a bigamist, was a declaration which \u201cit was manifestly in many ways directly for his interest to make,\u201d but that would not have made it an authoritative decision to support the proposition that the mere fact that a declaration tended to support a title to a small lot of vacant woodland, was a declaration that was so obviously made in the declarant\u2019s own interest as to warrant its exclusion in view of the long line of authoritative decisions to the contrary.\nThe statement of Joyce J., in Brooklebank v. Thompson[32] is a repetition of the dictum relied on in Plant v. Taylor31 and in a case which likewise has no application whatever to the case now under discussion. The declaration there in question, which was a written memorandum made in the year 1762 by the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor in title, related to the existence of a churchway through the demesne of a manor and was tendered as a declaration of reputation concerning a question of alleged public or quasi public right for the purpose of proving that the way was limited to a certain class of tenants of the manor. The learned trial judge held that it was not such a declaration, \u201cbut, if anything, at the very utmost only a statement by the person most interested denying or disputing the existence of a right in any but the \u2018tenants above wall,\u2019 (whatever may be the meaning of that expression) to a church way through the demesne\u201d of the particular manor, and that it was a private statement, and then quoted the dictum from Plant v. Taylor[33]. No question of pedigree was in any way involved in Brocklebank v. Thompson[34] and presumably Joyce J. held that the declaration in question did not concern any public or quasi public right. In my judgment it in no manner touches the matter now in question. I can find no reference in Taylor\u2019s Law of Evidence to this case. Phipson on Evidence cites it at p. 232 among other cases as authority for the proposition that declarations by predecessors in title are not evidence for their successors \u201cunless receivable on other grounds,\u201d and at p. 286, coupled with Plant v. Taylor33, as authority for the further proposition that declarations made in direct support of a claim contemplated to be brought by the declarant or otherwise obviously to subserve his own interest, will be rejected, but immediately adds \u201cbut if no dispute has arisen or claim been contemplated the fact that the declarations tend to support his own title or that the declarant stood or believed he stood in pari jure with the party relying on them affects their weight only and not their admissibility,\u201d citing Jenkins v. Davies[35], from which I have already quoted Lord Denman\u2019s decisive observations.\nThe learned trial judge having erred in excluding the declarations referred to, as with the utmost respect I think, for the reasons above stated, he did, his judgment on the question of title or descent clearly cannot stand, notwithstanding His Lordship\u2019s very strong comments upon the unreliability of the testimony of the witness, David Myers, whose evidence in my opinion as to his being the grandson of David Fitzgerald and the nephew of James and John Fitzgerald, was corroborated by the testimony of three or four independent witnesses. When the whole record of the trial as it came before the Appeal Division, and as it is now before us is considered, including the declarations which the learned trial judge subsequently to the trial decided should be excluded, and which he did exclude from his consideration of the cause, I am bound to say that it has produced upon my mind the same conviction which it did upon the mind of the Appeal Division. It is only necessary to mention the fact that the certified copy of the grant to Elizabeth Fitzgerald and the memorandum attached thereto as an official government document shewed that the grant was made to her as the widow of Ezekiel Fitzgerald, to whom it had been allotted on account of military service, and that he, Ezekiel Fitzgerald was a sergeant in the 34th Regiment, a well known regiment then quartered in New Brunswick; that David Myers, the nephew of James and John Fitzgerald, who had lived with them and with their father and his grandfather, David Fitzgerald, as a boy had heard them all speak of his great-grandfather being a lieutenant or sergeant in the army; and the further declaration of James and John Fitzgerald, as testified by the plaintiff in reply to a question by the learned trial judge that when he (plaintiff) asked them where the original grant of this property was, they told him it was burned in a trunk when they were burned out in a fire at 98 Winter Street, Saint John, with the statement of the plaintiff that he had personal knowledge of the fire to which the declarants had referred. Farren also swore that when he asked them if they had ever been into the property, James told him he had been in with his father as a boy. Other witnesses swore that they had heard James and John Fitzgerald at different times speak of owning woodland in Saint Martins, where this land was situated. These declarations, it seems to me, were declarations which bore upon the question of their descent from the original grantee, and were admissible with evidence of all other facts bearing thereupon for the purpose of establishing a series of facts from which the affirmative of that issue might be inferred as a reasonable probability, within the meaning of the dicta of Lord Chancellor Loreburn in Evans v. Astley[36], and Lord MacMillan in Jones v. G. W.

The material facts of the case and the question in dispute are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal was dismissed with costs (Lamont J. dissenting).\nW. T. Henderson K.C. and A. M. Latchford for the appellant.\nC. F. Elliott K.C. and W. S. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Rinfret, Smith, Crocket and Hughes JJ.) was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014On April 27, 1929, the appellant made a return of his income for the year ending December 31, 1928, which return contained the following entry under Clause 6:\nIncome from Dividends\n* * *\nReceived from Waterous Limited, Brantford, Ontario, Dominion of Canada Victory Loan Bonds, maturing November 1st, 1983, as dividend declared payable in bonds; these bonds being tax free as to principal and interest. Face value, $30,500.\nThe appellant was a shareholder in the company mentioned. At a meeting of the directors of Waterous Limited, held on June 28, 1928, the following resolution was passed:\nIt was moved by C. A. Waterous and seconded by L. M. Waterous that a dividend of thirty per cent be declared, payable in Dominion of Canada War Loan Bonds now held by the Company at the par value thereof and that bonds be distributed to the shareholders in accordance herewith. Carried.\nIn pursuance of this resolution, the appellant received from the company the bonds in question, as shown in the receipt quoted above.\nThe appellant was assessed under the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 97, upon this sum as part of his income, and took an appeal to the Minister of National Revenue, which was dismissed. He then appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada, from the decision of the Minister, and this appeal was dismissed by Mr. Justice Audette on the 4th April, 1931[2]; and from that judgment the present appeal is taken.\nSection 4 of the Act reads as follows:\n4. The following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\n* * *\n(i) The income derived from any bonds or other securities of the Dominion of Canada issued exempt from any income tax imposed in pursuance of any legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada; The appellant contends that he was not liable to taxation for income on the amount of these bonds, and relies upon the following provision, set out in the bond itself, as follows:\nThe obligation represented by this bond and the annexed interest coupons and all payments in discharge thereof are and shall be exempt from taxes\u2014including any income tax\u2014imposed in pursuance of any legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada.\nIt is argued on behalf of the appellant that the taxation levied on the amount of this bond is taxation on \u201cthe obligation represented by the bond,\u201d which obligation is non-taxable under the provisions of the bond itself, issued in pursuance of statutory authority.\nThe respondent contends that the amount of the bond in question is income of the appellant, as defined by sec. 3 of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 97, and that the taxation is not upon the bond itself, or upon the obligation represented by the bond, but upon the appellant personally, on his income, part of which is merely represented by the amount of the bond.\nI am entirely in agreement with the reasons of Mr. Justice Audette in the court below, containing the following statement:\nThe dividend paid and distributed from the gains and profits of the company remains a gain and profit in the hands of the shareholder, whether that dividend is paid in kind, specie or in bond; because it is all through a dividend from, and of, profit and gain; it remains of such nature in the hands of both the company and the shareholder.\nI think it is clear that this is not a taxation on the obligation represented by the bond or upon payments in discharge thereof, but merely taxation upon the appellant\u2019s income, which is in part measured by the amount of the bond which he received as dividend, and which constitutes income.\nIn the case of In re McLeod v. The Minister of Customs and Excise[3], Mr. Justice Mignault has the following-remark:\nAll this is in accord with the general policy of the Act which imposes the income tax on the person and not on the property. In other words, it is the person who is assessed in respect of his income.\nWe are also referred to the case of Hitner v. Lederer[4]. This case, though not binding here, seems to be precisely in point, and the reasoning is in accord with what has been said above. The United States issued Liberty Bonds. One of the provisions of the Act authorizing these bonds was that the bonds were exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxes. An employee received one of these bonds in payment of salary, and the question there, as here, was whether or not the amount of the bond should be regarded as income, for the purposes of taxation; and it was held that it was income, subject to income tax.\nIt is pointed out in the reasons that it was not a tax because of the ownership of the bonds, which would have been a tax upon the principal; it was solely and exclusively income in payment of salary for compensation of services, and had nothing whatever in this sense to do with Liberty Bonds.\nAgain, it is said at p. 993:\nThe bonds are by the express provision of the Act of 1917 not a medium of exchange recognized by law. This means that what was taxed was not \u201cbonds,\u201d but \u201cincome.\u201d\nThe appeal should be dismissed, with costs.\nLamont J. dissented, but did not deliver written reasons.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson & Boddy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Brown, Provincial Assessor Respondent.\n1933 : April 25; 1933 : April 26.\nPresent : Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nAssessment and taxation\u2014Income\u2014Company assessed for income tax in respect of profit on sale of land\u2014Whether profit was a profit of the company\u2014Whether sale was made by or on behalf of the company\u2014Facts and circumstances in connection with transaction\u2014Agreement of sale by individuals to whom company had made voluntary and unregistered conveyance\u2014Resulting trust\u2014Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 127, s. 34.\nThe question in dispute was whether or not the profit on sale of certain land was a profit of the appellant company and therefore income of the company upon which it was liable for income tax under the Taxation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 254, ss. 2, 4. The land had been purchased by or on behalf of three individuals (who, with their solicitor, were the company's only shareholders) who paid the purchase price. The land was transferred to the company (which made no payment therefor), one lot by a conveyance (direct from the original vendor) in February, 1928, and the other lot by a conveyance in May, 1928. The land (upon which were rented buildings) was managed by one of the individuals, the same as if the company did not exist. In 1929 the said three individuals entered into an agreement to sell the land to a purchaser at a profit (the profit in question), which agreement was registered on February 5, 1929. On the face of the agreement, it was a sale by the three individuals; the money was payable to them, and the proceeds of the sale were paid to them. In June, 1928, the company had executed a conveyance of the land to the three individuals, for a nominal consideration, which conveyance was not registered until February 5, 1929, a flew minutes after the registration of said agreement of sale.\nHeld: Upon all the facts and circumstances in evidence, the sale on which said profit was made was not a sale by the company or on its behalf, the profit was not a profit of the company, and it was not liable for income tax thereon.\nIt was contended that the said conveyance from the company to the individuals was a voluntary deed, and that, consequently, it passed nothing but the legal estate, and that there arose a resulting trust in favour of the grantor, the company. Held: Although it may be a disputed question whether or not a voluntary deed, without more, gives rise to a resulting trust in favour of the grantor, yet the law is clear that all the circumstances are to be looked at, and if the conclusion is that, in view of all the circumstances, no resulting trust was intended, then no resulting trust arises. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, no resulting trust was intended. The intention was to vest the full beneficial, as well as the full legal, title in the grantees.\nThe individuals were in a position to enter into the agreement of sale, notwithstanding that the conveyance from the company to them had not been registered; and the mere fact that, at the times of the making and registering of the agreement of sale, the conveyance from the company to them had not been registered, did not militate at all against the conclusion that the sale was their sale and that the purchase price was theirs. (The effect of s. 34 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c.127, discussed).\nUpon the facts in evidence, the individuals, in managing the property and in receiving the conveyance of June, 1928, from the company, were not acting as agents or trustees for the company; the company was intended to be merely the depositary of the title, while all responsibilities in relation to the land were to be borne by, and all benefits to be enjoyed by, the individuals. Certain assessment returns made by the company, while entitled to their proper weight as evidence against the company, could not, under the circumstances in which they were made and in light of all the facts, affect the above conclusion. In re Hastings Street Properties Ltd. 43 B.C. Rep. 209, discussed and distinguished.\nAPPEAL by the company, M. D. Donald Ltd., from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing (Macdonald, C.J.B.C., and Galliher, J.A., dissenting) its appeal from the judgment of the Judge of the Court of Revision and Appeal, Vancouver Assessment District, dismissing its appeal against an assessment for income tax with respect to a certain profit made on a sale of land. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nEric Pepler for the respondent.\nAfter hearing argument of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on the following day delivered judgment orally.\nThe Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the Court, said:\nThis appeal arises out of a controversy concerning the assessment of the appellants to income tax in respect of a sum of $77,000 which, the Crown alleges, was a profit \"of\" the appellants from the sale of real estate in Vancouver in the year 1929. The material sections of the Act (the Taxation Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C, 1924, c. 254) are sections 2 and 4. Section 2 defines \"income\" as including\n*** all *** profits arising *** from real and personal property, or from money *** invested, ** or from any venture, business, *** of any kind whatsoever.\nSection 4, which is the section creating the liability, imposes taxes upon\nall *** income of every person resident in the Province, *** and income earned within the Province of persons not resident in the Province.\nThere is no question raised here whether this sum of $77,000, in respect of which the dispute arises, was in the nature of income, and upon that point it is quite unnecessary to express any opinion.\nThe question of substance is whether it was income \"of\" the appellant; and the answer to that depends upon the determination of the point whether or not the sale, in the execution of which this sum was paid, was a sale by the company or on behalf of the company. If it was such a sale, so that the proceeds belonged to the company beneficially, then the form of the transaction is of no importance whatever, and, admittedly, the appeal must fail, because the assessment was a right assessment.\nThe property consisted of two lots, which were throughout the argument referred to as lots 9 and 10, and that will be a sufficient description for our purposes. In 1929, Mrs. Meltzer, Mr. William Meltzer and Mrs. Schwartz entered into an agreement to sell this property to a purchaser for $210,000. That agreement was subsequently registered on the 5th of February, 1929. On the face of it, it is a sale by these three individuals; the money is payable to them, and, in point of fact, the proceeds of the sale were actually paid to them, and so far as appears enjoyed by them. The Meltzers, at the time of the execution of the agreement, were not the registered owners of the property. There had (on 12th June, 1928) been a conveyance to them of these lots, executed by the company, for the expressed consideration of one dollar and \"other good and valuable consideration\"; the resolution, however, by which the sale had been authorized by the Board of Directors having fixed the consideration at the nominal consideration of one dollar. This deed was not registered until the 5th February, 1929. On that same day, and a few minutes before the registration of the deed, the agreement of sale was registered.\nHere, there are two points with regard to which some observations ought to be made. First, it is said that this deed from the company to the Meltzers was a voluntary deed, and that, consequently, it passed nothing but the legal estate, and that there arose a resulting trust in favour of the grantor, the company. Now, the question whether or not, to-day, a voluntary deed gives rise to a resulting trust in favour of the grantor, is a question about which there is a good deal of dispute. I refer to paragraph 108 in the 28th volume of Lord Halsbury's collection, upon the subject of Trusts and Trustees, which is in these words,\nIt would seem that a voluntary conveyance of real property is deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to pass the beneficial interest in the property conveyed. That statement is based mainly upon the observations of Lord Hardwicke in Young v. Peachy[1], and of Lord Justice James in Fowkes v. Pascoe[2]. In the note, however, it is observed that a contrary view is expressed in Lewin on Trusts and concurred in by the eminent property lawyer, Mr. Joshua Williams, in his Law of Real Property, as well as by others.\nThe question as to the effect of a voluntary deed, without more, is, beyond doubt, a question upon which there is difference of opinion among real property lawyers. But there is no dispute about this: all the circumstances are to be looked at, and if the conclusion is that, in view of all the circumstances, no resulting trust was intended, then no resulting trust arises.\nI think the proper conclusion from the facts I shall presently mention is that, in the circumstances of this case, it is quite out of the question to conclude that these parties intended there should be a resulting trust; quite impossible to reach any other conclusion than that the intention was to vest the full benefical as well as the full legal title in the grantees under that deed.\nAnother point is raised which it is perhaps desirable to consider, and that is based upon section 34 of the Land Registry Act of British Columbia. It is said that, by force of that section, this document which was executed on the 12th June, 1928, but which was not registered until the following February, conveyed, before registration, no interest of any description whatever to the grantees, so that, at the time the agreement of sale was made and registered, the land was the property of the company. Now, it is to be observed that the section, while it declares that an unregistered deed conveys no interest in the land, limits its operation in this way: \"except as against the person making the same.\" As between the parties, the instrument has its full operation according to its terms. As between the parties, the interest in the property which is the subject of the instrument, the interest of the grantor, is deemed to pass to the grantee. Moreover, the section expressly declares that the grantee, in any case, acquires the right to apply to be registered. It is quite plain that where a registered owner, having a title to real estate as registered owner, and having the right to convey, executes a conveyance, the duty of the Registrar is, upon application, to register the transfer and to take all the steps necessary to lead to the issue of a certificate of title in favour of the grantee. The effect of the deed, therefore, is to vest in the grantee at least a right, enforceable by mandamus, to require the registrar to register him as the owner of the property. Moreover, the express terms of section 34 leave no doubt that this right is a right which passes by alienation inter vivos, by inheritance, by will; and the possessor of the right is in a position to make a sale of the property. From the economic point of view, there can probably be little difference between the position of an unregistered grantee from an honest grantor, who has not registered his grant, and the position of a person who has registered his grant and has received a registered title. Accordingly, assuming the deed to be operative to pass the beneficial as well as the legal interest, as it would be on the face of it, to the grantee upon registration, the grantees are in a position to enter into an agreement for sale of the property; and the mere fact that the document had not been registered would not militate in the slightest degree against the conclusion that the sale was their sale, that the benefits of the sale secured on the face of the instrument to the vendor were their benefits; in other words, that the purchase price was theirs.\nNow, as against this, there could, in the present case, be only one possible effective answer; and that is, that these three persons who received this grant from the appellant company, received it in the capacity of agents or trustees for the company. And that is a question which must be determined by a consideration of the facts as a whole, and it is, therefore, necessary to review the history of the company's title and of the company's conduct and the conduct of the Meltzers in relation to these properties.\nThe company was incorporated in December, 1926. The nominal capital was $10,000. Four people signed the memorandum of association,\u2014Mrs. Meltzer, Mr. Meltzer, Mrs. Schwartz (their daughter) (the persons who were the grantees under the deed from the company and the vendors under the deed to the Vested Estates Ltd., to which I have just referred), and Mr. Grossman, their solicitor. Four shares were allotted, one to each of these persons. These shares were paid in full and the sum of $400 received for these shares by the company was deposited to the credit of the company; and that appears to have been the only bank account the company ever had, and that sum of $400 appears to have been the only sum that was ever credited to the company in the bank account.\nThe company had, as assets, these two lots, and two mortgages,\u2014one for $75,000 and the other for $9,500, held by Mrs. Schwartz as mortgagee, and assigned to the company. They were transferred to the company shortly after its incorporation, for a nominal consideration, apparently. There is no suggestion that the consideration was anything but nominal.\nLot 9 was purchased in December, 1926, prior to the incorporation of the company, by Mrs. Schwartz, for the sum of $53,000, $15,000 of which was paid in cash. A final payment was made on the 6th of February, 1928, and was, as Mrs. Meltzer says, paid by the Meltzers. The other part of the consideration consisted of the assumption of a mortgage and of the obligations of a purchaser under an agreement of sale, and clearly before the execution of the conveyance to the company these encumbrances must have been discharged, because in the conveyance which was registered 20th February, 1928, there is no reference to any encumbrance of any description. There is no suggestion that the company entered into any obligation to repay any of these moneys; or that one cent of the money paid by the Meltzers was repaid. Mrs. Meltzer's evidence is directly to the contrary. But, for the moment, I dwell upon the fact that, apart from the evidence of Mrs. Meltzer, there is no suggestion that there was any obligation on the part of the company to reimburse, or that there was any reimbursement to Mrs. Schwartz, or to any of the Meltzers, in respect of these payments.\nLot 10 was purchased, apparently, in December, 1927, for $70,000. Thirty thousand dollars was paid in cash. The other part of the consideration was by way of the assumption of a mortgage for the balance of the purchase money. The property was transferred by a conveyance on the 5th May, 1928, to the company. Here again, there is no suggestion that there was any obligation entered into to repay this sum of $30,000 or that there was any repayment of a single cent of that money. I ought to have remarked, with respect to lot 9, that the conveyance is taken direct from the vendor to the company, that, in other words, the purchase was a purchase in the name of the company.\nThese are the facts of the situation as they appear from the documents, and altogether apart from the evidence of Mrs. Meltzer.\nIt is stated by Mrs. Meltzer, and not contradicted (if there were any dispute, there could have been contradiction), and I understand Mr. Pepler did not dispute, that these two properties, upon which there were buildings and which were rented, were managed by Mrs. Meltzer for the family. Indeed, the learned judge of the Court of Revision finds that she managed these properties precisely as she would have done if there had been no incorporation of the company, and did that because she was accustomed to doing business in that way.\nI mentioned the bank account of the company. Mrs. Meltzer had her own personal account in the Bank of Montreal, and it must be taken, I think, as established that all rentals received from this property were paid to her, that all the outgoings were paid by her. She paid the insurance, the taxes, and for the repairs. There were virtually no meetings of the company. The company, as a company, did not intervene in any respect in the management of these properties. I repeat, the properties were dealt with, were managed, precisely as they would have been, if there had been no company in existence. The company received no money, had no money, and paid no money.\nThere is, in addition to what has been said, the circumstance already mentioned that the conveyance of lot 9 was taken directly in the name of the company, the purchase money having been paid by the Meltzers. That being so, there was, of course, a resulting trust in favour of the Meltzers. The company, I think, clearly held that property in trust for the Meltzers.\nIt may be noted that the total of the rentals received was less than $15,000; the specific payments by the Meltzers mentioned in the evidence amount to $51,000. The payments by them must have been much more. Mrs. Melt- zer's testimony is, as already stated, that all payments were made by her. On the face of all these facts, the proper conclusion seems to be that the company was intended to be merely the depositary of the title, while all responsibilities in relation to the property were to be borne by, and all benefits to be enjoyed by, the Meltzers as individuals. That being so, the proposition upon which the position of the Crown is necessarily founded, viz., that in managing these properties, and in receiving the deed of June 12, 1928, the Meltzers were acting as agents or trustees of the company necessarily falls to the ground.\nThis conclusion does not necessarily rest upon the strict legal presumption. Looking at the whole situation,\u2014the way in which the parties acted in relation to the property, the disregard of the company in the actual transactions in connection with the property, the fact that in both cases the property was purchased by the Meltzers, that the purchase money was paid by the Meltzers,\u2014apart altogether from strict legal presumption, there is sufficient support for a highly probable conclusion that the parties had no thought of any such intention as a resulting trust in favour of the company when the transfer took place in June, 1928.\nAs against all this, the Crown puts forward, and very properly, certain assessment returns made in the name of the company. And let me say here that I see no ground for criticizing the action of the Assessment Department. On the face of the transaction, there was undoubtedly something to be investigated, and one can hardly be surprised that the assessor reached the conclusion he did. I do not understand Mr. Farris to cast any reflection on the Department or upon anyone connected with it. But here we are concerned, not with the appearance of things, but with the proper result when the real facts are, as they are now, known.\nAs to these assessment returns, Mrs. Meltzer, who had management of the estate, says she never saw them. They appear to be signed by Mrs. Schwartz who, apparently, did not know anything about the business. They were compiled by Mr. Clyne on instructions from Mrs. Meltzer, no doubt, with perfect bona fides. The datum from which he started, I think, plainly was this, that in his view the company was the owner of the properties; and that being so, he concluded that the rents would be a part of the income of the company. It is perfectly plain, I think, from the evidence, that he had no sufficient knowledge of the actual facts to direct his attention to the distinction between the company and the Meltzers individually, and from the point of view of the parties themselves it was not a matter of consequence whether, as regards rentals, the parties as individuals or the company should be assessed to income tax in respect of them.\nMrs. Meltzer says she didn't know whether in the municipal assessment roll the property was assessed to the company or to the individuals. In all probability, as the registered title was in the company, the company was assessed in respect of them. Now that the facts are known, I cannot regard these returns as in any way affecting the inferences to be drawn from the facts I have mentioned.\nNow, a word as to the judgments. The Judge of the Court of Revision has given his reasons, and from those I think we can see pretty clearly the considerations by which he was influenced in reaching the conclusion he did. He does find as a fact that the business which was carried on by Mrs. Meltzer was the company's business. He finds also as a fact that the company did carry on the business of dealing in real estate, within its powers, and that the company did make the profit alleged from such dealings.\nI think it is necessary to consider here his remark that the company in order to succeed has to get away from its own returns as made to the Assessor. I am not sure that the learned Judge of the Court of Revision has not misdirected himself just at that point.\nThe returns by the company were undoubtedly evidence against the company. They should receive their proper weight as evidence. But, in truth, the real question which the learned judge had to decide was whether or not the sale which was made in December, 1928, was a sale made by the Meltzers entitling them to the purchase money or whether it was a sale by the company entitling the company to the purchase money, and, as I have already said, there could be only one basis for a conclusion that it was a sale made by the company, and that would be that the Meltzers were acting either as agents or as trustees of the company. Now, I repeat, in considering that question, these returns were some evidence undoubtedly, in favour of the Assessor's view; but the returns were compiled by a man who really did so without taking into consideration, and without really knowing, the real facts, and the conclusion, if he had come to the conclusion, that the business was the business of the company would have been a conclusion involving, to some extent at all events, conclusions of law the validity of which he was entirely incompetent to determine. The learned judge has, I think, quite failed at that point to realize what the real question was that he had to decide. Then, he emphasizes the fact that it is not denied that Mr. Clyne's figures are correct. I do not think there is any dispute as to that and I do not think that the correctness of the figures really enters into the controversy at all. The learned primary Judge does, I think, indicate very clearly what is influencing his mind by his allusion to the Hastings Street Properties Ltd. case[3]. That is a case to which I think some reference ought to be made, because it really illustrates the point before us.\nThat was a case in which some people incorporated a company with an authorized capital of $50,000, five shares being issued of $1 each. The shareholders were minded to enter into a speculation and proposed to do so by using the company as an instrument and, in order to effectuate their design, loaned the company $40,000. The company bought property and sold it at a profit of $30,000. The terms on which the loan was made were that any profit on the transaction was to be distributed among them. I should have thought there could be only one question in that case,\u2014whether the company was entitled to deduct from the moneys received the sums which it paid under the obligation to the lenders for the purpose of determining the amount of its taxable income. If it was not so entitled, the case was an obvious one. The purchase was the company's, the sale was the company's, the profit (for the purposes of the Taxation Act) was the company's.\nThere is no kind of analogy to the present situation where the sale was not made by the company; where the proceeds of the sale never, even momentarily, belonged to the company. Again, the learned Judge referred to section 34, which I have already discussed, in a manner which I think shows his view to be that, as the title to the property remained, except as between the parties, vested in the company until after the sale was made, the benefit of the sale necessarily enured to the company, and that consequently the profit was the company's profit.\nFor these reasons, I think the learned Judge's so-called findings of fact cannot be regarded as conclusive.\nComing to the Court of Appeal, the judgments in favour of the Crown are very brief and they seem to proceed upon the view that, as there was some sort of design to \"evade\" the Taxation Act, the appellants are liable. Of course, the word \"evade\" is, in this connection, a rather ambiguous one. It may mean that the intention was to engage in a transaction not touched by the Taxation Act; if so, nobody has any ground of complaint. It may be, on the other hand, that you are imputing an intention to put a transaction, which is in substance within the taxing provisions, into a form which, on the face of it, takes it out of the taxing provisions; and such a scheme as that must fail. I think, on the whole, that the view expressed by the Chief Justice in his dissenting judgment, concurred in by Mr. Justice Galliher, is the correct one.\nFor these reasons, I think the appeal should be allowed; and the order will be that the assessment will be amended by striking out this sum of $77,000. The appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Grossman, Holland & Co\nSolicitors for the respondent: Harper & Sargent.\n[1] (1742) 2 Atk. 254, at 256.\n[2] (1875) 10 Ch.

Ilsley, K.C., for the Nova Scotia Shippers\u2019 Association and others.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff C.J., and Rinfret, Smith and Crocket JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal concerns the interpretation of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, which, as originally enacted, contained a recital to the effect (inter alia) that it was expedient to put into practical operation the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Maritime Claims respecting Transportation and Freight Rates, for the purpose of removing the burden imposed upon the trade and commerce of the Maritime Provinces since 1912, in so far as it might be reasonably possible to do so, without disturbing unduly the rate structure in Canada. The statute required the Canadian National Railways, and permitted other companies, to lower their tolls in the Maritime Provinces by approximately 20%, and the deficits in respect of the Maritime section of the C.N.R. were to be paid by the Government, and other companies adopting the lower standard were to be reimbursed the difference between normal tolls and the lower tolls.\nFor a complete understanding of the bearing and significance of the questions with which we have to deal, it is convenient to transcribe the statement of facts and the questions now put before us by the Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners in the case stated for the opinion of this Court under the authority of section 43 of the Railway Act.\n\u201c1. The Maritime Freight Rates Act, 17 Geo. V, chapter 44 (Appendix A hereto), assented to on 14th April, 1927, entitled \u2018An Act Respecting The Canadian National Railways and the Tariffs of Tolls to be charged on certain Eastern Lines,\u2019 directed that from and after 1st July, 1927, a reduction of approximately 20% be made in the tariffs of tolls to be charged in respect of movements called \u2018Preferred Movements\u2019 of freight traffic upon or over the \u2018Eastern Lines,\u2019 as defined, of the Canadian National Railways. Revenues and expenses of the Eastern Lines were to be kept separate from other accounts in connection with the Canadian National Railways and the deficits of the Eastern Lines were to be included in the estimates annually submitted to Parliament.\n\u201c2. The Act also provided by section 9 that with respect to freight movements similar to the \u2018Preferred Movements,\u2019 other companies operating in the \u2018Select Territory\u2019 as defined might file tariffs of tolls \u2018meeting the statutory rates\u2019. The Board of Railway Commissioners was by the Act to approve these tariffs and certify the normal tolls which but for the Act would have been effective and ascertain and certify to the Minister of Railways and Canals the amount of the difference between the tariff tolls and the \u2018normal tolls\u2019 on traffic moved by the company each year under the tariffs so approved. \u201c3. The Act is now chapter 79 of the Revised Statutes of 1927 (Appendix B). As originally passed it contained a preamble reciting that the Act was passed to carry out the recommendations contained in the Report of a Royal Commission on Maritime claims.\n\u201c4. The Board of Railway Commissioners by section 11 of the Act was authorized to hear and determine all questions arising under the Act, subject, however, to appeal as provided in the Railway Act. The Board, acting under this section and in response to application of other companies referred to in section 9, made rulings set out in its Circular No. 213, dated 18th June, 1927 (Appendix C), as to the interpretation to be given the following expressions found in section 9 of the Act: (a) \u2018Select Territory\u2019; (b) \u2018Freight movements similar to the preferred movements\u2019; and (c) \u2018meeting the statutory rates.\u2019 Subsequently certain companies, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Dominion Atlantic Railway and others, elected to meet the statutory rates, and then filed tariffs pursuant to section 9 of the Act.\n\u201c5. Prior to 1st July, 1927, it was the practice in the territory covered by the Act, as in other parts of Canada, for railway companies to make adjustments in rates from time to time to meet changing industrial or traffic conditions, including competition with other transportation agencies, and since the Act came into effect, the Canadian National Railways and also the companies referred to in section 9 of the Act have found it necessary to adjust and vary the tolls originally filed under the Act, from time to time, as new industrial and traffic conditions arose.\n\u201c6. In the autumn of 1927, the question was raised as to whether the companies referred to in section 9 were entitled to reduce the rates that had been published in compliance with the Act and still continue to be reimbursed for the difference between the normal rate and the rate originally published in compliance with the Act. There are attached (Appendix D) copies of letters dated 25th November, 1927, and 10th January, 1928, from E. P. Flintoft, Assistant General Solicitor, Canadian Pacific Railway, to the Secretary of the Board and letters dated 16th January, and 1st February, 1928, from the Secretary of the Board to Mr. Flintoft, containing the decision made by the Board with respect to the questions raised. \u201c7. In continuance of the practice referred to in section 5 hereof and under authority of the decision of the Board as set out in section 6 hereof the companies referred to in section 9 of the Act have from time to time filed with and had approved by the Board tariffs containing reductions in various tolls below those originally filed and approved under the said section 9.\n\u201c8. (a) All tariffs subsequently filed were approved by Orders in the form set out in Appendix E (1) in which the Board also certified what purported to be the normal rates which, but for the Act, would have been effective.\n\u201c(b) In some cases the normal rates specified in the Order were arrived at strictly in conformity with the decision referred to in section 6 hereof by adding to the new reduced rates specified in the tariff the same differentials as existed between the original normal rates and the reduced rates originally filed under the Act.\n\u201cExample: Board\u2019s Order No. 47304, dated 2nd September, 1931, as amended by Order No. 47339, dated 10th September, 1931, re rates on apples from Dominion Atlantic stations to Halifax for export. (Appendix E (2)).\n\u201c(c) In a large proportion of the cases, however, the Board adopted the practice of certifying in such order as normal such rates as it considered would have been adopted by the companies to meet the new industrial and traffic conditions, had the Act not been passed.\n\u201cExample: Board\u2019s Order No. 40130, dated 7th January, 1928, re rates on fruits and vegetables, canned, and apples, evaporated, from Port Williams and Sheffield Mills, N.S., via Dominion Atlantic and connecting lines to destinations in the Canadian Northwest. (Appendix E (3)).\n\u201c9. At a meeting of the Board on 23rd September, 1932, its ruling of 30th January, 1928, as contained in the Secretary\u2019s letter of 1st February, 1928, to Mr. Flintoft, was rescinded and the decision embodied in the letter from the Secretary of the Board, dated 12th October, 1932, was adopted. (Appendix F.)\n\u201c10. Rate adjustments of the character referred to in sections 5 and 7 hereof may be illustrated under the following four general headings under each of which are set out examples of particular conditions met and reference to the tariffs filed and the Board\u2019s Orders approving the same:\u2014 \u201c(1) Rates published on a basis lower than the rates originally approved under the Act to meet the needs of an industry established at a point where no similar industry previously existed, or to place it in proper relationship with similar industries at other points on the same railway which enjoyed the benefits of commodity rates as reduced under the Act:\u2014\n\u201c(a) Effective 12th December, 1927, rates on fruits and vegetables, canned, and apples, evaporated, from Port Williams and Sheffield Mills, N.S., via Dominion Atlantic and connecting lines to points in the Canadian Northwest, were reduced under the Act to the same basis as applied from other canning points on the Dominion Atlantic in Nova Scotia, such as Aylesford, Berwick, Bridgetown, Kingston, Lakeville and Waterville, to place the two canneries at Port Williams and Sheffield Mills on a competitive basis with those other canning plants. The rates previously in effect were the class rates as reduced under the Act. The tariff giving effect to the further reductions was Supplement No. 3 to C.P. Tariff No. E-4530, C.R.C. No. E-4318, Item No. 80-A, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 40130, dated 7th January, 1928.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix G (1).\n\u201c(6) Effective 19th April, 1929, rates on potatoes, carloads, for manufacturing into starch, from points on the Canadian Pacific Railway in New Brunswick to Hartland, N.B., were reduced below the basis originally approved under the Act, in order to enable the new industry at Hart-land to obtain the raw material it required for manufacture. The tariff giving effect to these further reductions was Supplement No. 14 to C.P. Tariff No. E-4524, C.R.C No. E-4312, Item No. 532, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 42665, dated 20th May, 1929.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix G (2).\n\u201c(2) Rates published on a basis lower than the rates originally approved under the Act to place an industry on the originating line on a competitive basis with similar industries located on the Canadian National Railways:\u2014 \u201c(a) Effective 3rd February, 1931, rates on pit props and pit timber, Glennie to Minto, N.B., via Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway, were reduced to the same basis as in effect between certain points on the Canadian National. The rates previously in effect were on the mileage scale as originally reduced under the Act. The Tariff providing for the further reductions was Supplement No. 26 to F. & G.L. Tariff No. 108, C.R.C. No. 157, Item No. 205, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 46267, dated 12th February, 1931.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix H (1).\n\u201c(b) Effective 15th December, 1931, rates on potato starch and potato flour, carloads, from Hartland, N.B., via Canadian Pacific to destinations in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, were reduced under the Act to the same level as the rates on the same commodities via the Canadian National from Charlottetown and Hunter River, P.E.I., to Ontario and Quebec destinations. The only rates in effect previously from Hartland were the class rates as reduced under the Act, and the further reductions were made to enable the mill at that point to compete with the mills established at the points on the Canadian National. The tariff giving effect to such further reductions was Supplement No. 43, to C.P. Tariff No. E-1360, C.R.C. No. E-4312, Item No. 534, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 47896, dated 22nd December, 1931.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix H (2).\n\u201c(3) Rates published on a basis lower than the rates originally approved under the Act to enable industries to reach additional markets or to compete at destination with products from other sources of supply:\u2014\n\u201c(a) Effective 9th November, 1927, rates on wood-pulp, carloads, from Saint John, West Saint John, Saint George, Fairville and Edmundston, N.B., to Gatineau, Quebec, via Canadian Pacific, were reduced under the Act to the same basis as in effect from the same shipping points to Ottawa, in order to enable shipments to be made to the new paper mill established at Gatineau. The rate previously applicable to this movement was the class rate as reduced under the Act. The tariff giving effect to such further reductions was Supplement No. 1, to C.P.R. Tariff No. E-4516, C.R.C. No. E-4304, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 40134, dated 7th January, 1928.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix I (1).\n\u201c(b) Effective 29th August, 1931, rate on peat moss, carloads, from Saint Stephen, N.B., via Canadian Pacific to Montreal, was reduced to enable the shippers at Saint Stephen to compete in the Montreal market with imported moss. The only rate previously in effect was the class rate as reduced under the Act. The tariff giving effect to the further reduction was Supplement No. 40 to C.P. Tariff No. E-1360, C.R.C No. E-4312, Item No. 482, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Orders No. 47491, dated 7th October, 1931, and No. 47638, dated 10th November, 1931.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Orders and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix I (2).\n\u201c(4) Reductions forced upon the railway company in order to hold the traffic against some other competitive transportation agency, either water or highway, such reductions being in some cases seasonal, that is, effective only during the season of navigation or during that part of the year when the highway competition is more acute:\u2014\n\u201c(a) Effective 3rd August, 1931, the rate on lumber from Falmouth, N.S., via Dominion Atlantic to Halifax, was reduced under the Act to meet motor truck competition. This was lower than the basis originally approved under the Act and expired 31st December, 1931. The tariff giving effect to the further reduction was Supplement No. 33, Item No. 60, to D.A.R. Tariff No. CT-388, C.R.C. No. 817, section 3, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order No. 47406, dated 24th September, 1931.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix J (1).\n\u201c(b) Effective 28th August, 1931, rates on apples, carloads, from Berwick, N.S., and other points, via Dominion Atlantic to Halifax for export, were reduced below the level originally approved under the Act, to meet competition by motor truck and water via Kingsport and Port Williams. The tariff giving effect to the further reduction was D.A.R. Tariff No. CT-418, C.R.C. No. 863, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Orders, No. 47304, dated 2nd September, 1931, and No. 47339, dated 10th September, 1931.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Orders and of the relevant portions of the said tariff are attached hereto as Appendix J (2).\n\u201c(c) Effective 15th April, 1932, rates on pulpwood from Annapolis Royal, N.S., via Dominion Atlantic, to Middle-town, N.S., for furtherance, were reduced below the basis originally approved under the Act to meet water competition. The tariff giving effect to such further reductions was Supplement No. 44 to D.A.R. Tariff No. CT-388, C.R.C. No. 817, Item No. 156, approved under the Act by the Board\u2019s Order, No. 48423, dated 13th April, 1932.\n\u201cCopies of the Board\u2019s Order and of the relevant portions of the said Supplement are attached hereto as Appendix J (3).\n\u201cThe foregoing examples are typical of many similar reductions of the several classes referred to that have been made since the coming into force of the Act.\n\u201cThe questions for decision are:\u2014\n\u201c1. Whether, having regard to the facts above set out and to the relevant provisions of the Maritime Freight Rates Act and of the Railway Act, it is within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction:\u2014\n\u201c(a) To approve, from time to time, under section 9 of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, tariffs filed by other companies referred to in the said section specifying tolls lower than those specified in the tariffs originally filed and approved under the said section, the tariffs last referred to having provided for reductions in rates of approximately 20%.\n\u201c(b) To certify, from time to time, as distinct from every third year as provided in subsection 4 of the said section, normal tolls in respect of particular freight movements differing from those originally certified at the time of approving the tariffs originally filed and approved under the said section; \u201c(c) To certify to the Minister of Railways and Canals as the amount of reimbursement to the company, the difference between the lower tolls, referred to in clause (a), and the modified normal tolls referred to in clause (b).\n\u201c2. Whether the Board\u2019s ruling dated 23rd September, 1932, set out in Appendix \u201cF\u201d is correct.\n\u201c3. Whether subsection (2) of section 3 of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, as contained in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, applies to \u201cother companies\u201d, referred to in section 9 of the said Act.\n\u201c4. Whether, having regard to the general scope and terms of the said Act, tariffs filed by other companies referred to in section 9 are lawful tariffs until disallowed, notwithstanding that subsection (3) of section 3 is not now expressly referred to in section 9.\u201d\nThe Maritime Act, by the general declaration of policy in its preamble, left little room for doubt as to the governing purpose of it. There is, besides, a specific declaration in section 8 that the purpose of the Act is to give certain statutory advantages in rates in the \u201cSelect Territory\u201d, and that these \u201cstatutory rates\u201d are not based upon a principle of fair return to the railways for the carriage service.\nThe general reduction of 20% primarily affects rates for what are called \u201cpreferred movements\u201d, which are, broadly speaking, movements upon the \u201cEastern Lines\u201d of the Canadian National Railways, that is to say, lines in the Maritime Provinces and in a limited area in Eastern Quebec. Since the declared policy of the statute is to give certain advantages to persons and industries in the region described as the \u201cSelect Territory\u201d, it was not within the purview of that policy to confine such advantages to shippers on the Canadian National Railways. Accordingly, by section 9, provision is made enabling other companies operating within the areas affected, to frame and file tariffs \u201cmeeting\u201d the \u201cstatutory\u201d tariffs. It is not disputed that both before and since the passing of the Act adjustments of freight rates have constantly been necessary in the Select Territory, as in other parts of Canada, to meet changing industrial and traffic conditions. With the establishment of a new industry at a point where no similar industry existed, it is often expedient, to encourage its development, to reduce the rates applicable to the movement inwards of its raw material and outwards of its finished product; again, in order to insure continuance of traffic on its line, a railway company finds it desirable to establish a basis of rates for industries thereon comparable to that enjoyed by competing industries on another line; furthermore, in order to enable shippers, particularly of low priced commodities, to reach more distant markets or to compete with shippers at other sources of supply, it often becomes necessary to accord special rates for such shippers. Another example of adjustments that must take place is furnished by those necessitated by the competition of other transportation agencies, particularly by highway and water.\nThe general rules governing the practice in fixing freight rates are laid down in the Railway Act (R.S.C., c. 170), under the heading \u201cTraffic, Tolls and Tariffs\u201d\u2014sections 312 to 359 (inclusive). By ss. 328 to 332 (inclusive), tariffs may be issued under three heads, viz., standard, special and competitive. Sections 336 to 341 (inclusive) provide for the issue of joint tariffs where traffic is to pass over two or more lines of railway.\nThese enactments are so designed as to enable railway companies to adjust and vary their tolls to meet the exigencies arising from alterations in industrial and traffic conditions, and to enable them to compete with other agencies of transport.\nIt must, of course, be assumed that the Maritime Freight Rates Act was passed in contemplation of the practice founded upon this state of the law which was well known. The C.P.R. Co. and the Dominion Atlantic Co. elected to act under section 9 of the Act, which is in these terms:\n9. (1) Other companies owning or operating lines of railway in or extending into the select territory may file with the Board tariffs of tolls respecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements, meeting the statutory rates referred to in section seven of this Act. The Board, subject to all the provisions of the Railway Act respecting tariff of tolls, not inconsistent with this Act, shall approve the tariffs of tolls filed under this section.\n(2) The provisions of subsection two of section three and of sections seven and eight of this Act shall apply to the tariffs of tolls filed under this section.\n(3) The Board on approving any tariff under this section shall certify the normal tolls which but for this Act would have been effective and shall, in the case of each company, at the end of each calendar year promptly ascertain and certify to the Minister of Railways and Canals the amount of the difference between the tariff tolls and the normal tolls above referred to on all traffic moved by the company during such year under the tariff so approved. The company shall be entitled to payment of the amount of the difference so certified, and the Minister of Railways and Canals shall submit such amount to Parliament if then in session, (or if not, then at the first session following the end of such calendar year) as an item of the estimates of the Department of Railways and Canals.\nSubsection 2 of section 3, designated in section 9 (2), is as follows:\n2. The Board of Railway Commissioners, hereinafter called the Board, is authorized and directed to\n(a) approve such cancellations, and, subject to the provisions of the Railway Act, respecting tariffs of tolls for the carriage of freight, where not inconsistent with this Act, to approve all tariffs of tolls so substituted;\n(b) maintain or cause to be maintained such substituted tariffs, subject to all provisions of the Railway Act respecting tariffs of tolls not inconsistent with this Act, on the general rate of level approximately twenty per cent. below the tolls or rates existing on the first day of July, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, while the cost of railway operation in Canada remains approximately the same as at the said date, but the Board may allow the increase or reduction of such tolls or tariffs from time to time to meet increases or reductions, as the case may be, in such cost of operations;\n(c) adjust or vary such substituted tolls or rates from time to time as new industrial or traffic conditions arise, but always in conformity with the intent of this Act as expressed in sections seven and eight and other relative sections hereof.\nThe form of order which the Board adopted and has employed in approving tolls under section 9 is this:\n1. The Board Orders that the tolls published in (particulars of tariff), filed by the Company under Section 9 of the Maritime Freight Rates Act be and they are hereby approved subject to the provisions of subsection 2 of section 3 of the said Act.\n2. And the Board Hereby Certifies that the normal tolls which but for the said Act would have been effective in lieu of tolls published in the said (same particulars of tariff) approved herein, are as follows:\u2014\n(Sgd.) Chief Commissioner, B.R.C.\nThere is not the least dispute that, in practice, during a period of years, it was considered that both the C.N.R. and the other railways must vary their tariffs from time to time and that the Maritime Act was applicable to the tariffs so varied; and upon this view the Board acted in ascertaining and certifying \u201cnormal rates\u201d.\nIn response to an application of the companies affected for a ruling as to the interpretation to be put upon certain expressions in s. 9, the Board made certain rulings or decisions, set out in its Circular No. 213 (Appendix C), interpreting section 9 of the Act. The general effect of these rulings was to authorize the application, in respect of rate reduction, of the same principles to the Canadian National Railways and to other companies within the \u201cSelect Territory\u201d.\nRelying on this ruling, it is stated that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Dominion Atlantic Railway Company, as well as other companies, and as to this there is, in point of fact, not the slightest controversy, elected to bring their rates into conformity, in principle, with the \u201cstatutory rates\u201d and framed their tariffs accordingly. Later, a question was raised whether the companies to which section 9 is applicable were entitled to reduce rates that had been published under that section, and still retain their right to reimbursement under the terms of its provisions. The Board decided this question in the affirmative.\nRelying, again, it is said, on the decision of the Board (and, again, there is no dispute about the fact), these companies, from time to time, filed with the Board, in supposed compliance with section 9, new tariffs effecting reductions in various tolls, as originally filed and approved, and these reduced tolls were approved by the Board.\nThe Board\u2019s power under section 9 (1) to approve the reduced tolls was not exhausted, it is contended, upon approval of the tariffs setting forth the reductions first made upon the Act becoming effective. The practical working of the scheme of the Act required, in view of considerations already explained, an interpretation of the Board\u2019s powers, under that section, as being continuing powers exercisable from time to time, whenever changed industrial or traffic conditions, in its judgment, might demand or render expedient further adjustments or variations of tolls. Otherwise, it is said, the Act, instead of endowing the shippers of the Maritime Provinces with the benefits it was designed to bestow, must prove an actual hindrance to the industrial and commercial development of the areas within the \u201cSelect Territory\u201d. This appears to have been the view accepted by the Board in approving the reductions already alluded to.\nIt should, perhaps, be observed that apart from the standard rates, which constitute the maxima of rates that may in any case be charged, the only rates available be- tween many points are the so-called class rates payable in respect of the various classes of commodities specified in the Canadian Freight Classification. Now, when a new industry is established at a point where no such industry previously existed, and there are flourishing similar industries at other places, with which the new establishment has to compete and which are in the enjoyment of lower rates than the class rates, the rates for the new establishment must, as a condition of its existence, be put upon a basis below the class rates, comparable to that of the rates enjoyed by the competing establishments. This is but one example of the numerous types of cases in which rate reductions become necessary and are constantly taking place.\nIn June, 1927, when the initial reduction of 20% went into operation, the only rates (other than standard rates) then in effect in a large proportion of cases were these so-called class rates, while in other cases \u201ccommodity rates\u201d were in effect, calculated, for various reasons, upon a lower basis. These rates were reduced approximately 20%. Almost immediately new conditions arose which called for further reductions, and the Board had to then deal with the question above indicated, which was decided, as already observed, in the manner contended for by the railways.\nA brief commentary upon the examples given in paragraph ten of the case will be useful:\nHeading 1 (a). This is the case of a new plant brought into competition with plants at other points. Successful operation would have been, it appears, commercially impossible if the \u201cclass\u201d rates, even as originally reduced under the Act, had been payable; a further reduction was sanctioned as necessary.\n(b) The starch manufacturer, it is explained, could not afford to pay on his raw material the ordinary rates paid on potatoes for domestic consumption, even as reduced under the Maritime Act, and a further reduction was required.\nHeading 2. These are cases of what, it appears, is sometimes called \u201cmarket competition.\u201d That is to say, the railway finds it necessary to reduce its rates in order to put shippers on its line in a position to compete with shippers on another line (in this case the Canadian National Railways) in common markets. This expansion of business would not have been possible if the further reductions had not been made.\nHeading 3 (a). In this case a prospective purchaser developed after the first reduction had been put into effect. The commodity was of a low grade, and the traffic could not, it is explained, bear the class rate, even as reduced under the Act, so a further reduction was necessary to enable the shippers to reach this additional market.\n(b) This is another case of market competition, though the rival shipper was overseas. It also illustrates the necessity of a further reduction to enable the shipper of this relatively low grade commodity to reach an additional market.\nHeading 4. These examples are said to illustrate one of the commonest conditions with which the railway companies are faced to-day, viz., the necessity of reducing their rates to preserve their traffic against other competitive agencies of transportation. In the examples given are the cases of highway competition, water competition and combined water and highway competition. These competitive conditions change almost from day to day and demand frequent readjustments of rates.\nFrom these illustrations it is argued that any construction of the Act which would prevent the railway companies affected by section 9 from moulding their tariffs to meet these constantly changing conditions, and while leaving the Canadian National Railways free to reduce its tariffs, would constitute discrimination between persons and industries served by the different systems; a result obviously not within the scheme of the Act as designed. The intent of the statute which aims at relief for shippers in the whole of the \u201cSelect Territory\u201d would be largely frustrated by permitting such discrimination.\nThe Board has until recent months given full operation to this interpretation of the section. Cases in which further reductions were made were approved by orders of the Board specially issued in the individual case, and in each of these orders the Board certified the normal rates that would be applicable to such case.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the practice followed by these companies with the approval of the Board, as indicated in the examples given, is in accord with the proper construction of section 9. In view of the conditions with which the Act deals, the better construction of the section would appear to be that the Board\u2019s power to certify normal tolls was not exhausted with the first certification. (Boon v. Howard[1]; Reg. v. Clarence[2]; The Duke of Buccleugh[3].)\nThe practice which has been followed is not, we think, inconsistent with the provisions of subsection 4 of section 9, which contemplates a general revision of rates, brought about by changes in wages or other costs of operation in the territory at large. The practice now under review deals with individual rates which, as already stated, must be subject from time to time to adjustment to enable individual shippers served by the railways concerned to hold their own as against shippers served by other lines or other transport agencies. We are satisfied that regional discrimination could not have been contemplated.\nIt will be convenient now to summarize the grounds we have indicated in this rather lengthy discussion, upon which we think the interpretation of the Maritime Act advanced by the appellants ought to be accepted.\nThe key to that interpretation seems to be given by sections 7 and 8. By force of section 7, the tariffs of tolls \u201cprovided for\u201d in the Act are \u201cto be deemed statutory rates\u201d and are \u201cto be deemed\u201d to be rates not \u201cbased on any principle of fair return to the railway for services rendered in the carriage of traffic Accordingly, these rates must not be taken into account in determining the \u201creasonableness\u201d of \u201cother rates\u201d By section 8, the \u201cpurpose of this Act\u201d is explicitly declared to be the purpose of \u201cgiving certain statutory advantages\u201d in respect of charges for railway transport to the \u201cpersons and industries\u201d in the select territory; and the Board is expressly prohibited from approving or allowing any tariffs which may \u201cdestroy or prejudicially affect\u201d such advantages \u201cin favour of persons or industries located elsewhere than in such select territory\u201d.\nShippers, in Nova Scotia, of apples, for example, destined for Montreal, are to enjoy the reduced rates which are to go into effect immediately on the passing of the statute (rates 20% below the existing rates) ; and to the extent of this reduction the Board is required to maintain a \u201cdiscrimination between\u201d (Railway Act, s. 314) the select territory and other localities where apples are produced and shipped\u2014the apple districts of Ontario, for example, and British Columbia.\nThere can, we conceive, be no question as to the scope of sections 7 and 8. They apply to all rates \u201cspecified in the tariffs of tolls in this Act provided for\u201d. They apply to the substituted tariffs which are to be \u201cprepared and submitted to the Board\u201d immediately upon the passing of the Act. They apply also, and this it is important to emphasize, to these tariffs, as varied and adjusted (under subs. 2 (c) of s. 3) \u201cas new industrial or traffic conditions arise\u201d. By the explicit terms of s. 9 (2) they apply to the tariff tolls to be approved under that section. In performing the duty of the effecting or sanctioning of such variations and adjustments, the Board is required to act \u201calways in conformity with the intent of the Act as expressed in sections 7 and 8\u201d. The \u201cintent of the Act as expressed\u201d in these sections, which is to govern the Board in effecting or sanctioning such variations and adjustments, is that persons and industries in the select territory, as to the \u201cpreferred movements\u201d are to enjoy a statutory preference of 20% in respect of railway rates over persons and industries \u201clocated\u201d elsewhere. As already observed, we think the phrase \u201cthe rates specified in the tariffs of tolls in this Act provided for\u201d must be read as including the variations and adjustments brought into force under section 3 (2c); and that the effect of the words of this last mentioned enactment \u201calways in conformity with the intent of this Act as expressed in sections 7 and 8 and other relative sections hereof\u201d (\u201cother relative sections hereof\u201d would appear to contemplate the principal enactment of section 3 requiring the reduction of existing rates by 20%) is to provide for the maintenance in the tariffs, as adjusted and varied, of the difference of 20% between the rate brought into force when \u201cnew industrial or traffic conditions arise\u201d and the rate which would have prevailed if the Act had not been passed.\nThis seems to be the necessary deduction from the declaration (in s. 7) that \u201cfair return to the railway for services rendered\u201d is not to be the principle determining the variations or adjustments under section 3 (2c) and the declaration in section 8 that the favoured persons and industries are always to enjoy the advantage of the discrimination established in their favour as against other localities.\nBroadly speaking, the principles have been observed in the execution by the Board of its general powers in relation to tolls, that \u201cthe object of the legislation is plainly declared\u201d, viz.,\nthe fixing of just and reasonable freight and passenger rates, having proper regard, not only to the question of the reasonableness and fairness of the rate itself, but also to the principle of equality as between different districts and shippers,\nthat this principle would be infringed by\ngiving special rights to any particular district of the country, or creating rates, which by change of circumstances and conditions could not be described as just or reasonable;\nand that\nan unremunerated rate applicable in one district involves a discrimination as against other districts where traffic and operating conditions are similar, and directly infringes on the provisions of the Act requiring uniformity of rates.\nThese passages from the judgment of the Chief Commissioner (Sir Henry Drayton) delivered in December, 1917, in the case known as the Increase in Rate Case[4], sufficiently explain the broad principles by which the Board has been governed in applying the enactments of the Railway Act.\nThe Board\u2019s duty in applying the enactments of section 3 (as well as of section 9) is to give form and substance to the intent of the Act, as expressed in sections 7 and 8, which, we repeat, exclude in explicit language the two principles expounded by the Chief Commissioner, that of the reasonableness of the rate in itself, and that of \u201cuniformity\u201d of rates as affecting different localities.\nSince the Board, in proceeding under section 3 (2c), is not to follow the fundamental principles of rate making governing tariffs compiled under the general Railway Act expounded by the Chief Commissioner, it follows that, unless we adopt the view above set forth that the rule of the Maritime Act, the maintenance of a difference of 20% between the rate in force and the rate that would have been in force if the Act had not been passed, is a condition governing the Board in effecting or sanctioning variations under section 3 (2c), we are driven to the conclusion that, in proceeding under this last named enactment, the Board is left without the guidance of any canon of any description. We cannot accept that conclusion.\nMoreover, it seems a reasonable view that the procedure indicated, and the rule laid down in subsection 3 of section 3 were intended to apply to proceedings under subsection 2c of that section. We have already said that in our view the phrase \u201crates specified in the tariffs of tolls in this Act provided for\u201d includes the variations and adjustments of such rates under section 3 (2c). We likewise think that \u201csubstituted tariffs\u201d in subsection 3 embraces \u201csubstituted tariffs\u201d as varied and adjusted under subsection 2c.\nWe do not doubt that the Act does not contemplate that the Board, in proceeding under subsection 2c, is to act exclusively ex mero motu suo. An application from some quarter is contemplated as the normal mode of initiating the proceeding. Where the Board proceeds without an application the variation or adjustment does or may take effect at once. But the Board may proceed upon an application by the Company or by a third party,\u2014a shipper, for example. If the variation or adjustment proposed is one required by \u201cnew industrial or traffic conditions,\u201d then, under s. 3 (2c) it is the duty of the Board to bring it into operation as soon as the change in circumstances arises, or as soon as it becomes aware of them. The Company or the other applicant having established the facts, in other words, having shewn that circumstances have arisen requiring action of the Board under s. 3 (2c), it would not be an unreasonable recognition of the spirit of the statute, as manifested by sections 7 and 8, to treat the new rate as in force from the moment the facts had been put before the Board, that is to say, from the moment of application.\nAgain, where the application is made by the Company it would seem to be a convenient procedure to treat the \u201csubmission\u201d of the altered tariff by the Company as the initiation of the application. As already indicated, this appears to be the procedure contemplated by s. 3 (3).\nThat this is the procedure which in fact has been followed by the Board is shewn by the various orders, copies of which are appended to the case, approving of variations proposed by the companies. It is said in the factum filed by the Board that no application has been made by the companies for variation or adjustment of rates under s. 3 (2c) or s. 9 (2). But the orders referred to are obviously not made under the Railway Act. They sanction in express terms rates 20% below the rates that, under the conditions prevailing at the time, upon the principles of rate making which prevail under the Railway Act, and under the practice of the Board, could not properly have been, and would not have been sanctioned by the Board, if the Act had not passed. The practice of the Board in respect of these orders is set forth in paragraph 8 of the Case in these words:\n8. (a) All tariffs subsequently filed were approved by Orders in the form set out in Appendix E (1) in which the Board also certified what purported to be the normal rates which, but for the Act, would have been effective.\n(b) In some cases the normal rates specified in the Order were arrived at strictly in conformity with the decision referred to in Section 6 hereof by adding to the new reduced rates specified in the tariff the same differentials as existed between the original normal rates and the reduced rates originally filed under the Act.\nExample: Board\u2019s Order No. 47304 dated 2nd September, 1931, as amended by Order No. 47339 dated 10th September, 1931, re rates on apples from Dominion Atlantic stations to Halifax for export. (Appendix E (2).)\n(c) In a large proportion of the cases, however, the Board adopted the practice of certifying in such order as normal such rates as it considered would have been adopted by the companies to meet the new industrial and traffic conditions, had the Act not been passed.\nExample: Board\u2019s Order No. 40130 dated 7th January, 1928, re rates on fruits and vegetables, canned, and apples, evaporated, from Port Williams and Sheffield Mills, N.S., via Dominion Atlantic and connecting lines to destinations in the Canadian Northwest. (Appendix E (3).)\nObviously, the Board, in all these cases, was professing to exercise its powers under the Maritime Act. Down to the time when the statute as it appears in the Revised Statutes came into force (1st February, 1928), the Board probably assumed that a grant of the same power as that expressly conferred by s. 3 (1e), (as s. 3 (2c) then was), in relation to the rates of the C.N.R., was necessarily implied, as respects the companies affected by s. 9, in the authority given to these last mentioned companies to file tariffs \u201cmeeting\u201d the \u201cstatutory rates referred to in s. 7\u201d which literally (and it would seem also by necessary intendment) would include the rates as varied or adjusted under s. 3 (1e). The Board may also have taken the view that a construction by which the authority to \u201cvary and adjust\u201d should embrace only the rates of the C.N.R. would reduce the statute to obvious absurdity, as imposing upon it the duty to discriminate, in the matter of tolls, against \u201cpersons and industries\u201d located on the lines affected by s. 9, in favour of those \u201clocated\u201d on the C.N.R.\nWe think the form in which the proposed changes were submitted to the Board is of no importance. We have no doubt that the Board had jurisdiction to approve the rates submitted, and to certify the normal tolls which would have prevailed if the Act had not passed, under s. 9 and s. 3 (1e) or under s. 9 (2) and s. 3 (2c).\nAt this point, it is convenient to comment upon Question 2, which is in this form:\nWhether the Board\u2019s ruling dated 23rd September, 1932, set out in Appendix F, is correct?\nThe ruling is in these words:\nWhereas the following ruling was made by the Board at a meeting held on the 30th January, 1928, in Connection with question submitted by Mr. Flintoft of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, is hereby rescinded:\u2014\n\u201cIs a carrier which is subject to Section 9 of the Act entitled to reduce a rate that has been published in compliance with the Act and still continue to be reimbursed for the difference between the normal rate and the rate originally published in compliance with the Act?\nAns.: The answer to this question is in the affirmative, but that such further reduction of the rate will be subject to all the limitations contained in the Railway Act.\u201d\nThat upon reconsideration of the above ruling, the decision of the Board is that where a railway company, under the authority of Section 9 of the said Act, has made an approximate 20% reduction in its rates, and subsequently publishes a tariff schedule making a further reduction in rates published under the authority of the Act, to meet water or truck competition, or for other reasons, such tariff schedule containing the further reduced rates should be published under the general provisions of the Railway Act and the railway company is not entitled to any reimbursement under Section 9 of the Maritime Freight Rates Act with respect to such rates and there should be no reference to the Act last named shown on such tariff schedules. In other words, where normal tolls, which would not have been reduced but for the provisions of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, were, under the authority of that Act, reduced approximately 20%, the railway company was entitled to reimbursement under the terms of Section 9, but where a railway company makes a further voluntary reduction in such rates it is not doing so under the provisions of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, but under the general provisions of the Railway Act, and the Maritime Freight Rates Act has no application with respect to such tariffs. The last sentence seems to give the ratio of the ruling; and, apparently, this ratio would apply to the Canadian National Railways as well as the railways affected by section 9. We cannot think that the powers or the duties of the Railway Commission are not the same under section 3 (2c) or section 9 (2) whether these powers are exercised by it ex mero motu suo or after having been invoked by a railway company or by a shipper. In all cases where the \u201cnew industrial or traffic conditions\u201d bringing those enactments into play have arisen, it is not only within the power, but it is the duty, of the Board to act. If a given variation or adjustment ought to be directed on the application of a shipper, then it ought to be approved on the application of the railway company. The fact that the railway company assents to the change or requests the change is immaterial. Such changes, if made, are made under the Maritime Freight Rates Act and not under the Railway Act.\nWe now turn to section 9. There is, we think, no admissible reason for disregarding subsection 2 of that section as it appears in the Revised Statutes of 1927. It must be assumed, we think, that the change was made deliberately, and in order more clearly to express the purpose of the statute; to give, perhaps, more explicit sanction to the rulings of the Board. The clue to the construction of section 9 is given by subsection 3 which requires the Board \u201con approving any tariff under this section\u201d to certify \u201cthe normal tolls which, but for this Act, would have been effective\u201d. The difference between the \u201cnormal tolls\u201d in this sense and the \u201ctariff tolls\u201d is to be the measure of the reimbursement. The \u201ctariff tolls\u201d are to be framed for the purpose of \u201cmeeting\u201d the \u201cstatutory tolls\u201d under section 7. \u201cTariff tolls\u201d are statutory tolls in the sense that they are tolls which for the reasons already outlined could not take effect, as indeed subsection 3 of section 9 impliedly declares, otherwise than by force of the Maritime Act.\nVariations and adjustments pursuant to subsection 2 are plainly \u201ctariff tolls\u201d within the meaning of subsection 3; for the obvious reason that they are \u201crates specified in tariffs of tolls in this Act provided for\u201d within the meaning of section 7, which is made applicable to them by the express terms of section 3 (2c). Moreover, we see no reason to think that what we have said as to section 3 (2c) and section 3 (3) does not equally apply to variations and adjustments under section 9 (2) which makes section 3 (2c) applicable to tariffs of tolls filed under section 9.\nThe answers to the questions submitted are, in principle, dictated by what has been said. The answers to the subquestions of Question 1 are in the affirmative; the answer to Question 2 in the negative; to Question 3 in the affirmative, and to Question 4 in the affirmative.\nCannon, J. (dissenting in part).\u2014In Canadian National Railway Company v. Province of Nova Scotia[5], the present Chief Justice of Canada, speaking for this Court concerning the Maritime Freight Rates Act now under consideration, said:\nIn explaining the provisions of the Act, the phrase \u201cEastern lines\u201d will frequently be used, and it is convenient at this place to quote textually section 2 of the Act which gives the meaning of that expression:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this Act the lines of railway now operated* as a part of the Canadian National Railways and situated within the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the lines of railway, similarly operated, in the province of Quebec extending from the southern provincial boundary near Matapedia and near Courchesne to Diamond Junction and Levis are collectively designated as the \u2018Eastern Lines.\u2019\u201d\nFor a similar reason, section 8 should also be mentioned, which defines the phrase \u201cselect territory,\u201d as including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in addition to the localities on \u201cthe lines in the province of Quebec mentioned in section 2.\u201d\nThe Act, by section 3, requires the cancellation of tolls in force at its date (which we shall speak of as normal tolls), in respect of the \u201cmovements of freight traffic\u201d described as \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d and the substitution therefor of tariffs of reduced tolls (which we shall refer to as the statutory tolls). The \u201cpreferred movements\u201d comprise three classes, first, of local traffic between points on the \u201cEastern lines,\u201d second, of export traffic destined overseas between points on the \u201cEastern Lines\u201d and ocean ports on the \u201cEastern Lines,\u201d and third, of westbound traffic originating on the \u201cEastern Lines,\u201d and extending westward beyond those lines.\nAs respects the first and second of these classes of \u201cpreferred movements,\u201d the statutory tolls are ascertained by making a deduction from the normal tolls of approximately twenty per cent. As respects the third class of such movements, the statutory rate is ascertained by making a deduction, also of twenty per cent, but, in this case, the deduction takes effect only upon that part of the \u201cthrough rate\u201d which the statute in section 4 describes as the \u201cEastern Lines proportion of\u201d that rate. The statute also provides for the non-compulsory reduction of rates by companies, other than those concerned with the \u201cEastern Lines,\u201d which own or operate railways \u201cin or extending into the select territory.\u201d Such companies, by section 9, are permitted, in order to \u201cmeet\u201d the compulsory statutory rates, to file tariffs of reduced rates \u201crespecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements.\u201d\nIt is part of the scheme of the Act that these non-compulsory reductions, sanctioned by section 9, shall not be ultimately borne by the companies whose tolls are affected by them; and by that section provision is made for the transfer of that burden to the Dominion Government, the Minister of Railways and Canals being required, at the end of each year, to pay to the companies availing themselves of the privileges of the section the difference, as certified by the Board of Railway Commissioners, between the amount which would have been payable in normal tolls, but for the tariffs filed under it, and the sums actually \u201creceived under those tariffs.\u201d\n* * *\nAs appears from recitals and declarations in the preamble and in the body of the Act, the statutory rates, whether compulsory under sections 3 and 4, or non-compulsory under section 9, are envisaged by the statute not as providing a fair return for railway services, but as arbitrary rates, established with the design of affording special \u201cstatutory advantages to persons and industries\u201d in the \u201cselect territory\u201d; it was therefore considered just to transfer from the railway companies to the Dominion Treasury the burden of reductions authorized by section 9, which in the legal sense are non-compulsory, but, which it was recognized, might be exacted from the companies concerned, by the force of competition. It should also be observed, that the only enactment of the Act which confers a right of compensation upon railway companies (other than those concerned in the operation of the \u201cEastern Lines\u201d) in respect of reductions sanctioned by the Act is the provision in section 9 already mentioned and that provision relates only to non-compulsory reductions authorized by the section.* Indemnity to companies in respect of loss of revenue arising from a compulsory reduction is not provided for and not contemplated by the Act.\n* * *\n* * * The function of this court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature, as disclosed by the language selected for the expression of that intention. Whatever views may have inspired the policy of a statute, it is no part of the function of a court of law to enlarge, by reference to such views, even if they could be known with certainty, the scope of the operative parts of the enactment in which the legislature has set forth the particular means by which its policy is to be carried into effect*. If the language employed is fairly open to a given construction, then the policy of the Act, as disclosed by the statute itself, read in the light of the known circumstances, in which it was passed, may legitimately be called in aid. * * *\nThe preamble professes to be for the most part a summary of the relevant portions of the report of a Royal Commission of September, 1926, through which, as it recites, Parliament has been advised that the Intercolonial Railway was designed, inter alia, to afford to Maritime merchants, traders and manufacturers the larger market of the whole Canadian people; but that in \u201cdetermining\u201d the construction of the railway, commercial considerations were subordinated to considerations of a national, Imperial, and strategic character, which dictated a longer route than would otherwise have been necessary, and that, to this extent,\n\u201cthe cost of the railway should be borne by the Dominion and not by the traffic which might pass over the line.\u201d\nThe preamble proceeds:\u2014\n\u201cAnd whereas the Commission has, in such report, made certain recommendations respecting transportation and freight rates, for the purpose of removing a burden imposed upon the trade and commerce of such provinces since 1912, which, the Commission finds, in view of the pronouncements and obligations undertaken at Confederation, it was never intended such commerce should bear; and whereas it is expedient that effect should be given to such recommendations, in so far as it is reasonably possible so to do without disturbing unduly the general rate structure in Canada.\u201d\nTo the recitals in the preamble there should be added the declaration contained in s. 8:\u2014\n\u201cThe purpose of this Act is to give certain statutory advantages in rates to persons and industries in the Maritime provinces.\u201d\nIt will be observed that the recitals in so far as they are pertinent, may be summed up in the proposition that, by reason of the circumstances attending the institution of the Intercolonial Railway system, \u201cthe cost of the Railway\u201d should be borne by the Dominion, and not by the traffic on the line, in so far as that cost is due to national, Imperial and strategic considerations, as contradistinguished from commercial considerations,* and that certain recommendations founded upon this view in the report of the Royal Commission ought to receive effect.\n* * *\n* * * The purpose of the Act is declared to be to give \u201ccertain statutory advantages in rates.\u201d\nNow, then, are the tariffs of rates under discussion in this case, \u201cstatutory rates given by the Special Act\u201d or are they special rates that might have been given by the companies, for purely commercial considerations, prior to 1927, under the provisions of the Railway Act?\nUnder sections 331 and 332 of the Railway Act, railway companies were authorized to issue special freight and competitive tariffs for the carriage of goods and were only required to file these tariffs with the Board of Railway Commissioners and specify the date of the issue thereof and the date on which it was intended to take effect. If the provisions of subsection 2 of section 3 of the Maritime Freight Rates Act, as they are found in chapter 79 of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1927, are to be read into section 9 thereof, \u201cother companies owning or operating lines of railway in or extending into the select territory may file with the Board tariffs of tolls respecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements, meeting the statutory rates referred to in section seven of this Act.\u201d These statutory rates are not based upon any principle of fair return to the railway for services rendered in the carriage of freight. This applies only to tolls filed under section 3 (1) (b) as statutory substitutes to the tariffs cancelled and showing a reduction of approximately 20% to meet the increased cost due to national, strategic or Imperial considerations.\nAgain, even assuming that subsection 2 (c) of section 3 applies to the other companies, the Board is only authorized and directed to adjust and vary such substituted tolls or rates from time to time as new industrial or traffic conditions arise, also in conformity with the intent of the Act which is to give compulsorily certain statutory advantages and rates to persons and industries in the \u201cselect territory.\u201d The Board has never been called upon by either the C.N.R. or the \u201cother companies\u201d to adjust or vary substituted tariffs. From time to time tariffs have been filed by both companies of their own motion, varying the substituted tariffs, and the Board has approved of these tariffs. This approval was not necessary, as no order or direction of the Board is required to enable a company to file a tariff lower than the substituted tariff for the purpose of meeting competition. The filing of such tariffs and the approving same in no way involve the exercise by the Board of its power to adjust or vary tariffs.\nDoes this clause add anything to the right which the companies already had of filing special and competitive freight rates to meet special and industrial or traffic conditions?\nI do not think so. They could and always had under the Railway Act the faculty of reducing their rates by simply filing the new rates with the Board. The latter\u2019s approval was not required and I see nothing in the Acts which calls upon the Board to approve these special tariffs. The adjustment and variation of tolls from time to time by the Board contemplated in the Special Act is not the approval of competitive rates such as those submitted and filed by the companies. The rights of other companies to file tariffs and obtain reimbursement from the government in respect of reduced rates must be found in section 9, which, according to me, shows clearly that reimbursement is provided for only in the case of original substituted tariffs.\nThe Board is given power to \u201capprove the tariffs of tolls filed under this section\u201d The only tariffs of tolls authorized to be filed under section 9 are \u201ctariffs of tolls respecting freight movements similar to the preferred movements, meeting the statutory rates referred to in section seven of this Act.\u201d\nSection 7 says that \u201cthe rates specified in the tariffs of tolls, in this Act provided for, in respect of preferred movements, shall be deemed to be statutory rates.\u201d\nThe tariffs of tolls referred to in section 7 are the tariffs filed by the C.N.R. under section 3 (1) (b), namely: tariffs \u201cshowing a reduction * * * of approximately twenty per cent.\u201d from those in force before July 1, 1927.\nHence it follows that the only tariffs of tolls which can be filed and approved by the Board under section 9 are tariffs meeting the tariffs filed by the C.N.R. under section 3 (1) (b).\nBy section 9 (3) the Board \u201con approving any tariff under this section shall certify the normal tolls which but for this Act would have been effective.\u201d\nThe Board must then certify and the company is entitled to receive \u201cthe difference between the tariff tolls and the normal tolls above referred to,\u201d not on all traffic, but \u201con all traffic moved by the company * * * under the tariff so approved.\u201d\nIt is also to be noted that the Board has no authority to change the \u201cnormal\u201d tolls except under the provisions of subsection 4.\nNowhere in the Act is authority given to \u201cother companies\u201d to file tariffs in substitution for those filed to meet \u201cthe statutory rates,\u201d and nowhere in the Act is authority given to the Board to approve any other tariffs.\nThe language of section 9 is only appropriate and can only be applied in the case of reimbursement under the original substituted tariffs.\nTo illustrate this: The rate before the Act came into force for a certain commodity was $1. A tariff is filed under section 9 reducing the toll to 80 cents. The Board certifies $1 as the normal toll, and the difference between the normal toll, $1, and the tariff toll, 80 cents, is the amount the carrier is entitled to receive from the Government. Later on, owing to competition, it becomes necessary for the company to reduce the toll to 60 cents. The company files a new tariff purporting to be under the Maritime Freight Rates Act and claims reimbursement. If entitled to reimbursement, how is the amount of such reimbursement to be ascertained?\nSection 9 (3) says: \u201cThe Board on approving any tariff under this section shall certify the normal tolls which but for this Act would have been effective.\u201d\nNow the normal toll in this case has not been changed. It still remains $1. The Board, if it assumes to approve the tariff, must certify $1 as the normal toll, and under the terms of the Act the carrier would be entitled to receive the difference between the tariff toll, 60 cents, and the normal toll, $1, namely, 40 cents.\nThis, of course, leads to an absurdity, and the railways themselves do not make this claim. What they say is that they are still entitled to the 20 cents, and this no matter how many tariffs are filed nor how great the reduction in the tariff toll may be.\nTo give an actual case: There was a rate of 28 cents on apples on June 30, 1927. A new tariff was filed under the provisions of section 9 in which the toll was reduced by 20% to 22\u00bd cents, making the reimbursement to the company 5\u00bd cents. To meet competition the rate was reduced to 10 cents. The company claims that it is entitled to receive the same reimbursement from the Government, namely, 5\u00bd cents.\nThe difficulty is that \u201cthe normal toll which but for this Act would have been effective\u201d is still 28 cents. If the company is entitled to reimbursement at all, it must be for the difference between 28 cents, the normal toll, and 10 cents, the tariff toll under which the apples move.\nHow can it be said that 15\u00bd cents, or any other figure lower than 28 cents is \u201cthe normal toll which but for this Act would have been effective\u201d? The railway was confronted with competition by other transportation agencies which compelled the establishment of a ten-cent rate, and, Act or no Act, this is the competitive rate it had to establish to secure the traffic. The actual words of section 9, together with the impossibility of making its language applicable for the purpose of reimbursement in the case of the filing of tariffs other than those authorized by section 9 (1), show clearly that it was only in respect of the original substituted tariffs \u201cmeeting the statutory rates\u201d that reimbursement was intended.\nWith hesitation, in view of my great respect for the opinion of the majority of my brethren, who seem to hold the contrary view, I believe that Parliament intended to reimburse the Canadian National Railways and the other companies for the losses which the 20% reduction in the rates existing in 1927 would occasion. The Dominion at large was to pay in order to give lower statutory rates to the \u201cselect territory\u201d, i.e., the three maritime provinces and part of Eastern Quebec, so as to bring them back to the position enjoyed along the I.C.R. prior to 1912. This has been done and presumably the 1927 cut in rates was sufficient to achieve that object of the Act; further action under this special legislation is expressly limited in scope. The reimbursement was provided to recoup the railways for the reduction of their legitimate earnings but nowhere does this legislation add to the already existing power of the railways to grant voluntarily special competitive rates. No indemnity was ever necessary to reach that result; railways are not supposed to do of their own free will what is not economically profitable to themselves. The very fact that no compulsion was required before or since the passing of the 1927 Maritime Freight Rate legislation would, to my mind, indicate that Parliament could not think it necessary to provide for compensation to the railways for such voluntary reductions. The fact that a different and illegal practice has crept in is not a good reason to continue it after the Board decide that such an unwarranted drain on the public purse must be stopped and refuse to lend themselves any further to a wrong application of the Act.\nMy answers to the questions would be as follows:\n1. (a) After the Board of Railway Commissioners have approved the cancellation of the existing freight rates and approved the substituted tariffs and tolls, they may adjust or vary such substituted tolls or rates from time to time as new industrial or traffic conditions arise; they may also allow the increase or reduction of such tolls and tariffs from time to time to meet increases or reductions, as the case may be, in the cost of operations of the railways; but they are not called upon to approve these special competitive rates, which could, before and since the passing of the special Act, be filed without leave and freely by the railway companies under the general provisions of the Railway Act.\n(b) Answering 1 (b). My answer is in the negative.\nAs a consequence, my answer to paragraph (c) of the first question is in the negative.\nMy answer to Question 2 is that, in my opinion, the Board\u2019s ruling of the 23rd September, 1932, is correct.\nMy answer to Question 3 is in the affirmative.\nIn answer to Question 4, I say:\nCompetitive tariffs filed by other companies are lawful tariffs until disallowed, under the express terms of sections 331 and 332 of the Railway Act; and to reach this conclusion, it is not necessary to have regard to the general scope and terms of the Maritime Freight Rates Act or to subsection (3) of section 3 thereof.\nThe sub-questions of Question 1 answered in the affirmative; Question 2 answered in the negative; Questions 3 and 4 answered in the affirmative.\n[1] (1874) L.R. 9 C.P. 277, at 308.\n[2] (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23, at 65.\n[3] (1889) 15 P.D. 86, at 96.\n[4] 22 Can.

Plaintiff claimed the amount of three months\u2019 rent ($5,250) under s. 126 of said Act and ss. 41 to 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.S., 1930, c. 199, and obtained leave, under s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, to commence an action in the King\u2019s Bench Court, Sask. Plaintiff recovered judgment at trial, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which dismissed its action. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Defendant moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the judgment appealed from was in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act and no special leave to appeal had been obtained under s. 174 thereof.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be dismissed; said s. 174 had no application, the action not falling within the description therein, \u201cproceedings under this Act.\u201d\nMOTION to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe appeal was by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1].\nThe plaintiff\u2019s tenant made an assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 11, and the defendant was appointed trustee. Leave was given by Macdonald J., in Chambers, under the provisions of s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, to commence action against the defendant. The plaintiff claimed the sum of $5,250, being the amount equivalent to three months\u2019 rent of the premises, and interest thereon, the claim being made under the provisions of s. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act and ss. 41 to 48, inclusive, of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.S., 1930, c. 199. There was also an alternative claim for the said sum against the defendant personally, because of its failure to give effect to the alleged preferential claim of the plaintiff upon the assets of the trust estate, and a claim (not in issue in the present appeal) for damages alleged to have been suffered by reason of wrongful acts of defendant in subletting the premises.\nThe trial judge, Taylor J.[2], awarded the plaintiff the sum of $5,250 for three months\u2019 rent, out of the tenant\u2019s assets, in the hands of the defendant, in priority to the claims of all other creditors. He dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s other claims in the action. The defendant, as trustee, appealed, and the Court of Appeal1 allowed its appeal, set aside the judgment below, and dismissed the plaintiff-tiff\u2019s action (dismissing also the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal in respect of its other claims). The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe plaintiff applied before Martin J.A., under s. 70 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, for the approval of a bond as security for the effectual prosecution of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and for the payment of such costs, etc., as might be allowed against it. On that application the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the approval of the bond, contending that the action was a \u201cproceeding\u201d in bankruptcy, and that, under the provisions of s. 174 of the Bankruptcy Act, no appeal lay from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, unless special leave to appeal had been obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court. Martin J.A.[3] held that such contention was not well founded; that the action was an ordinary action, commenced in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and the fact, that leave was obtained from the judge in bankruptcy to commence the action, under the provisions of s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, did not make the action, which was commenced pursuant to the leave, a \u201cproceeding\u201d in bankruptcy; that when leave is given to commence the action, it is brought in the appropriate court, and proceeds in that court, subject to the procedure therein and to any right of appeal which exists in that court or with respect to decisions rendered in that court; that the right of appeal in this action existed, not by reason of the Bankruptcy Act, but by virtue of the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, and the appeal was an exercise of the ordinary right of appeal which is given by the Supreme Court Act from a final judgment of the court of last resort in the province (Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 36). He approved of the bond as security.\nThe defendant (respondent in this Court) now moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground taken by defendant before Martin J.A. on the said application for approval of bond.\nG.

Two months later she gave birth to a female child who was born with club feet. The respondent, as tutor to his child, brought an action against the appellant company, claiming that the deformity of the child was the direct consequence of the negligence of the appellant company by which the mother was injured. The action was tried with a jury who found in favour of the respondent and judgment for $5,500 was rendered accordingly, which was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court.\nHeld, Smith J. dissenting, that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed. Held, also, Smith J. dissenting, that there was sufficient evidence adduced at the trial to produce in the jury\u2019s minds a conviction that it was reasonably probable that the deformity of the child resulted as a consequence of the mother\u2019s injury, and, consequently, their verdict should not be disturbed. The fact that the appellant\u2019s fault caused the deformity of the child cannot, from the nature of things, be established by direct evidence. It may, however, be established by a presumption or inference drawn from facts proved to the satisfaction of the jury. These facts must be consistent one with the other and must furnish data from which the presumption can be reasonably drawn. It is not sufficient that the evidence affords material for a conjecture that the child\u2019s deformity may have been due to the consequences of the mother\u2019s accident. It must go further and be sufficient to justify a reasonable man in concluding, not as a mere guess or conjecture, but as a deduction from the evidence, that there is a reasonable probability that the deformity was due to such accident.\nPer Smith J. (dissenting).\u2014The evidence of the medical experts called on behalf of the respondent establishes that medical science has not yet discovered the cause of club feet and such evidence has merely put forward more or less plausible theories on that subject. Therefore, having regard to the scientific problem involved, there was no evidence sufficiently positive and definite upon which the jury could reasonably find as a fact that the child\u2019s club feet resulted from the injury to the mother.\nHeld, further, Smith J. dissenting, that under the civil law, a child, who suffers injury while in its mother\u2019s womb as the result of a wrongful act or default of another has the right after birth to maintain an action for damages for the injury received by it in its pre-natal state.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont and Crocket JJ.\u2014The answer to the appellant\u2019s contention that an unborn child being merely a part of its mother had no separate existence and, therefore, could not maintain an action under article 1063 C.C., is that, although the child was not actually born at the time the appellant by its fault created the conditions which brought about the deformity to its feet, yet, under the civil law, it is deemed to be so if for its advantage. Therefore when it was subsequently born alive and viable it was clothed with all the rights of action which it would have had if actually in existence at the date of the accident. The wrongful act of the appellant produced its damage on the birth of the child and the right of action was then complete.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The action in damages, and consequently the possibility of exercising it, has its existence from the date the injured person has suffered prejudice. In this case, the right of the infant child to claim damages was not entire before its birth. The child, while in its mother\u2019s womb, was not suffering any prejudice nor inconvenience and no complete right of action then existed. Right to damages was born at the same time as the child when the deformity was revealed and therefore the respondent\u2019s action was well founded in law.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ.\u2014The great weight of judicial opinion in the common law courts denies the right of a child when born to maintain an action for pre-natal injuries; per Rinfret, Lamont and Crocket JJ., although it has been held that the doctrine, which regards an unborn child as born if for its benefit, had been adopted in England by the Ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts, and to some extent by the Court of Chancery.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., sitting with a jury, and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nArthur Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the appellant.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. and J. H\u00e9lai for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Rinfret, Lamont and Crocket JJ. were delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014On March 25, 1929, the respondent\u2019s wife, then seven months pregnant, was descending from a tram car belonging to the appellant (hereinafter called the Company) when, by reason of the negligence of the Company\u2019s motorman, she fell, or was thrown from the car to the street and was injured. Two months later she gave birth to a female child\u2014now called Jeannine\u2014who was born with club feet. The respondent had himself appointed tutor to the child and brought this action \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 against the Company, claiming that the deformity of the child was the direct consequence of the negligence of the Company by which its mother was injured. The action was tried with a jury who found for the respondent and awarded damages in the sum of $5,500, for which amount judgment was entered. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side), Dorion and Hall JJ. dissenting. From the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench the Company appeals to this court.\nThe appeal presents three questions for determination:\n1. Has a child, who suffers injury while in its mother\u2019s womb as the result of a wrongful act or default of another, the right after birth to maintain an action for damages for the injury received by it in its pre-natal state?\n2. Was there evidence on which the jury could reasonably find that the deformity of the child\u2019s feet was the result of the accident to its mother? 3. Was the charge of the trial judge to the jury sufficient in law?\nThese questions fall to be determined by the civil law of the province of Quebec. The action is brought under article 1053 of the civil code, which reads:\u2014\nEvery person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\nFor the Company it was contended that the first question should be answered in the negative, because\u2014\n1. A child en ventre sa m\u00e8re is not an existing person\u2014 in rerum natur\u00e2\u2014but only a part of its mother and, therefore, does not come within the meaning of the term \u201canother\u201d in article 1053 C.C., and\n2. The Company\u2019s liability was founded in contract, express or implied, and there had been no contract with the child.\nIn support of its contention the Company cited the case of Walker v. G.T.N. Rly. Co. of Ireland[1]. In that case the plaintiff\u2019s mother, while a passenger on the defendant\u2019s railway, was injured by the defendant\u2019s negligence, and the plaintiff, who was then en ventre, was subsequently born deformed. After the child was born it brought an action for damages for the deformity which it alleged was caused by the company\u2019s negligence. On demurrer, the court, which consisted of four judges, held that the child could not maintain the action. The decision was based largely on the ground that the company had only contracted to carry the mother to whom alone it owed a duty not to be negligent. The broader ground, namely, the legal right of an unborn child to personal security, was discussed at some length, but the views of the judges on that point were against the recognition of the right; the Chief Justice, however, expressly stated that he would leave the question open, and based his judgment on the single ground that there were no facts set out in the statement of claim which fixed the defendants with liability for breach of duty as carriers of passengers.\nDuring the argument in that case it was pointed out that under English law a conceived but unborn child, for the purposes of succession to property on an intestacy and for many purposes in connection with wills and their construction, was deemed to be born at a particular time if it was for the child\u2019s benefit that it be so held, and that in The George and Richard[2], it was held that a child en ventre sa m\u00e8re at the date of its father\u2019s death was capable, when born, of maintaining an action under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act. Reference was also made to the language of Mr. Justice Buller in Thellusson v. Woodford[3], who, when replying to an allegation that a child en ventre sa m\u00e8re was a non-entity, at page 322, said:\u2014\nLet us see what this non-entity can do. He may be vouched in a recovery, though it is for the purpose of making him answer over in value. He may be an executor. He may take under the Statute of Distributions. He may take by devise. He may be entitled under a charge for raising portions. He may have an injunction; and he may have a guardian.\nThe court, however, took the view that the doctrine which regards an unborn child as born, if for its benefit, was a fiction of the civil law which had been adopted in England by the Ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts, and to some extent by the Court of Chancery; but that the common law courts had never recognized the fiction as applying so as to permit a child to obtain damages for pre-natal injuries.\nThat pre-natal injury affords no foundation for an action for damages on the part of a child was held in the following American cases: Allaire v. St. Luke\u2019s Hospital[4]; Gorman v. Budlong[5]; Nugent v. Brooklyn Heights Rly. Co.[6]; Drobner v. Peters[7]; Stanford v. St. Louis-San Francisco Rly.[8]. The only case to the contrary cited to us was Kine v. Zukerman[9]. These were all cases under the common law and it must be admitted that the great weight of judicial opinion in the common law courts denies the right of a child when born to maintain an action for pre-natal injuries.\nThe rights of an unborn child under the civil law are based on two passages found in the Digest of Justinian, lib. 1, tit. 5, ss. 7 and 26, as follows:\u2014 7. Qui in utero est, perinde ac si in rebus humanis esset, custoditur, quoties de commodis ipsius partas quaeritur.\n(An unborn child is taken care of just as much as if it were in existence in any case in which the child\u2019s own advantage comes in question.)\n26. Qui in utero sunt in toto paene jure civili intelliguntur in rerum natur\u00e2 esse.\n(Unborn children are in almost every branch of the civil law regarded as already existing.)\nThe Civil Code of Quebec makes provision for the appointment of a curator to the person or to the property of children conceived but not yet born. Arts. 337 and 338 C.C.\nArt. 345 reads as follows:\u2014\nThe curator to a child conceived but not yet born, is bound to act for such child whenever its interests require it; he has until its birth the administration of the property which is to belong to it, and afterwards he is bound to render an account of such administration.\nThis article practically embodies the Roman Law rule first above quoted.\nArt. 608 C.C. reads as follows:\u2014\n608. In order to inherit it is necessary to be civilly in existence at the moment when the succession devolves; thus, the following are incapable of inheriting:\u2014\n1. Persons who are not yet conceived;\n2. Infants who are not viable when born;\nUnder this article the right to inherit is made to depend upon civil existence. A conceived but unborn child, therefore, is deemed to have civil existence if subsequently born viable.\nArticles 771 and 838 C.C. deal with gifts inter vivos and by will. The former article reads:\u2014\n771. The capacity to give or to receive inter vivos is to be considered relatively to the time of the gift. It must exist at each period, with the donor and with the donee, when the gift and the acceptance are effected by different acts.\nIt suffices that the donee be conceived at the time of the gift or when it takes effect in his favour, provided he be afterwards born viable.\nArticle 838 C.C. contains a similar provision in respect of a conceived but unborn child taking a benefit under a will.\nIt was contended by the Company that as the civil code by express provision had declared that the conceived but unborn child should possess the rights and capacities of a born child in respect of the matters mentioned in articles 608, 771 and 838 C.C., it limited by implication the cases in which a child en ventre would be deemed to be born to those expressly mentioned. On the other hand the respondent contended that the matters referred to in these articles, though specially dealt with in the civil code, are merely illustrative instances of the rule that an unborn child shall be deemed to be born whenever its interests require it, but that they in no way limit the meaning of article 345 C.C., which is general in its terms.\nThe Code Napol\u00e9on of France contains articles similar to articles 608 and 771 of the Quebec civil code. The French authorities may, therefore, be helpful in determining whether or not, under the civil law, the rule is of general application.\nIn Baudry-Lacantinerie et Houques-Fourcad\u00e9\u2019s Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, 3rd ed., tome 1, at page 270, the learned authors say:\u2014\n289. L\u2019homme constitue une personne d\u00e8s le moment m\u00eame de sa naissance. Jusque-l\u00e0 il n\u2019est pas une personne distincte, il n\u2019est encore que pars viscerum matris. Pourtant, en droit romain, on consid\u00e9rait, par une fiction de droit, l\u2019enfant simplement con\u00e7u comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 n\u00e9, lorsque son int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u2019exigeait. Ce principe, admis aussi dans notre ancien droit, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en ces termes: infans conceptus pro nato habetur, quoties de commodis ejus agitur. Le code civil en consacre lui-m\u00eame plusieurs applications, qui prouvent qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu dans toute sa g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9.\nIn Aubry et Rau, Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, 4th ed., tome 1, par. 53, page 262, the author says:\u2014\nDans le sein de sa m\u00e8re, l\u2019enfant n\u2019a point encore d\u2019existence qui lui soit propre, ni par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 vrai dire, de personnalit\u00e9. Mais, par une fiction des lois civiles, il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 n\u00e9, en tant du moins que son int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u2019exige. En vertu de cette fiction, l\u2019enfant simplement con\u00e7u jouit d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 juridique provisoire, subordonn\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 ses effets d\u00e9finitifs, \u00e0 sa naissance en vie et avec viabilit\u00e9.\nAnd in Mignault\u2019s Droit Civil Canadien, we find the following:\u2014\nUne vieille maxime dit que l\u2019enfant con\u00e7u est d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u00e9 toutes les fois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nThen, after referring to the nomination of the curator under article 345 C.C., the learned author continues:\u2014\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de citer les cas qui n\u00e9cessitent cette nomination. Elle se fait dans tous les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019enfant l\u2019exige.\nIn determining the generality of the application of the fiction reference may also be made to the opinions expressed by certain English judges familiar with that law.\nIn Burnet v. Mann[10], Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said:\u2014\nThe general rule is that they (unborn children) are considered in esse for their benefit not for their prejudice. and in Wallis v. Hudson[11], the same judge, at page 116, stated that a child en ventre sa m\u00e8re \u201cwas a person in rerum natur\u00e2.\u201d Then, after referring to the Statute of Distributions which he said was to be construed by the civil law, he proceeded as follows:\u2014\nAs to the civil law, nothing is more clear, than that this law considered a child in the mother\u2019s womb absolutely born, to all intents and purposes, for the child\u2019s benefit.\nThis statement as to the civil law was referred to with approval by Lord Atkinson in Villar v. Gilby[12]. See also Schofield v. Orrel Colber[13].\nIn Doe v. Clark[14], Butler J. used this language:\u2014\nIt seems indeed now settled that an infant en ventre sa m\u00e8re shall be considered, generally speaking, as born for all purposes for its own benefit.\nIn many of the English cases in which effect was given to the rule of the civil law it was applied simply as a rule of construction by which the term \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d was held to include a child en ventre sa m\u00e8re. But in Doe v. Lancashire[15], the question was not one of construction but of the revocation of a will by the birth of a child, and Gross J., at page 63, said:\u2014\nI know of no argument, founded on law and natural justice, in favour of the child who is born during his father\u2019s life, that does not equally extend to a posthumous child.\nThese learned judges undoubtedly considered the fiction to be of general application.\nTo the Company\u2019s contention that an unborn child being merely a part of its mother had no separate existence and, therefore, could not maintain an action under article 1053 C.C., the answer, in my opinion, is that, although the child was not actually born at the time the Company by its fault created the conditions which brought about the deformity of its feet, yet, under the civil law, it is deemed to be so if for its advantage. Therefore when it was subsequently born alive and viable it was clothed with all the rights of action which it would have had if actually in existence at the date of the accident. The wrongful act of the Company produced its damage on the birth of the child and the right of action was then complete. The separate existence of an unborn child is recognized even at common law, for it is well established that if a person wrongfully causes injury to a child before its birth which results in death after it has been born alive, such person will be guilty of a criminal offence although the wrongful act was directed solely against the mother. Rex v. Senior[16]; Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., vol. 1, page 622. It was, however, urged that there is no true analogy between crime and tort, as the punishment of crime is for the public benefit, while the remedy in tort is for private redress. While in some cases there may be no analigy yet there are, in my opinion, many cases in which crime and tort are merely different aspects of the same set of facts and in which there is so close an analogy that something more than the bare denial of it is necessary to carry conviction. The wrongful act which constitutes the crime may constitute also a tort, and, if the law recognizes the separate existence of the unborn child sufficiently to punish the crime, it is difficult to see why it should not also recognize its separate existence for the purpose of redressing the tort.\nIf a child after birth has no right of action for pre-natal injuries, we have a wrong inflicted for which there is no remedy, for, although the father may be entitled to compensation for the loss he has incurred and the mother for what she has suffered, yet there is a residuum of injury for which compensation cannot be had save at the suit of the child. If a right of action be denied to the child it will be compelled, without any fault on its part, to go through life carrying the seal of another\u2019s fault and bearing a very heavy burden of infirmity and inconvenience without any compensation therefor. To my mind it is but natural justice that a child, if born alive and viable, should be allowed to maintain an action in the courts for injuries wrongfully committed upon its person while in the womb of its mother.\nThe argument that the Company\u2019s liability is founded in contract cannot, in my opinion, be maintained. This is not the case of a person not a party to the contract suing for a breach of it. The respondent does not seek to recover from the Company on the ground that it failed to perform its contract with the mother, but on the ground that it committed an independent tort against the child. The fault which constitutes a wrong to the child may also constitute a breach by the Company of its contract with the mother, but, under article 1053 C.C. the existence or nonexistence of the mother\u2019s contract is entirely irrelevant in tort.\nThere were two other matters to which our attention was called; the first was that cases similar to the present one must have arisen many times in the past, but that no decided case (or at most only one) has been found in which the child\u2019s right of action for pre-natal injuries has been maintained. The paucity of decided cases is far from conclusive, and may be largely accounted for by the inevitable difficulty or impossibility of establishing the existence of a causal relation between the fault complained of and the injury to the child. With the advance in medical science, however, that which may have been an insuperable difficulty in the past may now be found susceptible of legal proof.\nThe other matter to which we were asked to give serious consideration was the practical inconvenience and possible injustice to which the Company might be exposed if it were held that this right of action could be maintained. It was urged that to so hold would open wide the door to extravagance of testimony and lead, in all probability, to perjury and fraud. I am not apprehensive on this point for, although in certain cases special care will be required on the part of the judge in instructing the jury, I feel quite confident that the rules of evidence are adequate to require satisfactory proof of responsibility and that the determination of the relation of cause and effect will not involve the court in any greater difficulty than now exists in many of our cases.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the fiction of the civil law must be held to be of general application. The child will, therefore, be deemed to have been born at the time of the accident to the mother. Being an existing person in the eyes of the law it comes within the meaning of \u201canother\u201d in article 1053 C.C. and is, therefore, entitled through its tutor to maintain the action.\nSupport for this view is, I think, furnished by the fact that none of the judges below cast any doubt upon the right of the respondent to sue. The point, it is true, does not appear to have been raised in either court but I cannot think a point so important and outstanding would have been passed without comment had not the judges below been satisfied as to the existence of the right.\nThe next question is, whether there was evidence on which the jury could reasonably find the existence of a causal relation between the accident to the mother and the deformity of the child\u2019s feet.\nThe general principle in accordance with which in cases like the present the sufficiency of the evidence is to be determined was stated by Lord Chancellor Loreburn in Richard Evans & Co., Limited v. Astley[17], as follows:\u2014\nIt is, of course, impossible to lay down in words any scale or standard by which you can measure the degree of proof which will suffice to support a particular conclusion of fact. The applicant must prove his case. This does not mean that he must demonstrate his case. If the more probable conclusion is that for which he contends, and there is anything pointing to it, then there is evidence for a court to act upon. Any conclusion short of certainty may be miscalled conjecture or surmise but courts, like individuals, habitually act upon a balance of probabilities.\nThere was undoubtedly evidence to go to the jury that the mother\u2019s accident was caused by the fault of the Company, and the jury\u2019s finding on that point cannot be disturbed. That such fault caused the deformity of the child cannot, from the nature of things, be established by direct evidence. It may, however, be established by a presumption or inference drawn from facts proved to the satisfaction of the jury. These facts must be consistent one with the other and must furnish data from which the presumption can be reasonably drawn. It is not sufficient that the evidence affords material for a conjecture that the child\u2019s deformity may have been due to the consequences of the mother\u2019s accident. It must go further and be sufficient to justify a reasonable man in concluding, not as a mere guess or conjecture, but as a deduction from the evidence, that there is a reasonable probability that the deformity was due to such accident.\nThe distinction, I think, is well brought out by a comparison between two cases of the province of Quebec: Boilard v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[18], and Montreal Tramways Company v. Mulhern[19]. In the Bollard case[20], the young child of the plaintiff had been compulsorily vaccinated in compliance with a city by-law. Shortly after the vaccination, the child\u2019s arm became paralysed and permanently useless. Contending that the condition of the arm had been brought about as a result of the vaccination, the plaintiff, as tutrix, sued the city in damages on behalf of the child. At the trial, three different theories were advanced by the medical experts. One was that it was a clear case of infantile paralysis in no possible way to be attributed to the vaccination. Another theory ascribed the cause either to infected vaccine or to infantile paralysis. The third theory was that the use of infected vaccine was the sole possible explanation of the condition of the arm. There was, however, no positive evidence of the fact that the vaccine was actually infected. The jury held the city responsible on the ground that the vaccine used was infected. The Court of King\u2019s Bench set aside the verdict. Sir Horace Archambault, then Chief Justice of the province of Quebec, delivering the judgment of the court, said:\u2014\nUne chose est claire, au milieu de cette obscurit\u00e9, c\u2019est qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une question d\u2019opinion, et non d\u2019une question de fait constant, positif. Aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019est venu jurer positivement que le vaccin \u00e9tait infect\u00e9. Tout ce que certains d\u2019entre eux ont pu dire, c\u2019est que le r\u00e9sultat produit tendrait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, ou ferait pr\u00e9sumer, que le vaccin \u00e9tait infect\u00e9. Les jur\u00e9s n\u2019ont donc pu que d\u00e9cider entre les diverses opinions \u00e9mises, et \u00e9mettre eux-m\u00eames une opinion. Ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un fait; et les jur\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas d\u2019autre juridiction que de d\u00e9cider les questions de fait.\n* * *\nSans doute, il faut s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de m\u00e9decins, d\u2019experts, pour conna\u00eetre les effets, les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019un accident. Ainsi, une maladie nerveuse se d\u00e9clare \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident; les m\u00e9decins seront admis \u00e0 prouver que cette maladie a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par l\u2019accident. De m\u00eame, on entendra des m\u00e9decins pour savoir si la maladie est permanante ou temporaire. Mais, dans ces cas, l\u2019accident lui-m\u00eame doit d\u2019abord \u00eatre prouv\u00e9, ainsi que la faute de la partie que l\u2019on veut tenir responsable des dommages qui ont r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de l\u2019accident. En d\u2019autre termes, le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de la responsabilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par t\u00e9moins, qui en attestent l\u2019existence. Les cons\u00e9quences de ce fait peuvent ensuite \u00eatre \u00e9tablies par des experts.\nIn the Mulhern case[21], the question was whether the respondent had established that the death of her husband was due to the bodily injuries sustained by him in a collision several months previous to his death and which, at first, did not appear to be serious. The autopsy had shewn that the death was due to \u201cthrombosis of the coronary artery.\u201d The question was whether the thrombosis had been caused by the accident. Three doctors testified that, in their opinion, the accident had either caused or aggravated the condition of the deceased. Other doctors, while admitting that possibility, said that it was not the cause in the particular circumstances. Yet another one declared that it was a scientific impossibility for the thrombosis to have been the result of the accident. The jury found in favour of the plaintiff. The case came before the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in Quebec, which included four of the five judges who had sat in the Bollard case (1). The court held that the finding of the jury should not be interfered with. It distinguished Boilard v. City of Montreal[22], as appears by the head-note:\u2014\nIn a jury trial where damages are claimed for (an accident), a verdict cannot be founded only on medical controverted opinions, but the case is different where the medical evidence is supported by a proof of non contested facts. The jurors may then render their verdict by appreciating the facts and opinion of medical men, which they have before them.\nAn affirmative verdict can be rendered upon facts and probabilities only if they establish presumptions; and if these presumptions are strong enough to bring about a reasonable conviction in the mind of a jury, the Court should not interfere.\nMr. Justice Carroll delivered the judgment of the court, and, referring to the Boilard case[23] (page 459)[24], he said:\nDans cette derni\u00e8re cause, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un enfant qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vaccin\u00e9 et qui, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019op\u00e9ration, avait perdu l\u2019usage du bras vaccin\u00e9. Le jury avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le vaccin \u00e9tait infect\u00e9, mais cette r\u00e9ponse ne r\u00e9sultait pas des faits prouv\u00e9s, elle r\u00e9sultait seulement d\u2019opinions th\u00e9oriques controvers\u00e9es entre les m\u00e9decins entendus comme t\u00e9moins.\nIci (meaning in the Mulhern case), nous avons bien des th\u00e9ories contradictoires, mais nous avons aussi des faits non contest\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9funt, avant cet accident, jouissait d\u2019une bonne sant\u00e9 et n\u2019avait manifest\u00e9 aucun sympt\u00f4me de la maladie dont il est mort. Il s\u2019est plaint imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident de douleurs dans la r\u00e9gion du coeur. Les t\u00e9moins que l\u2019ont connu nous disent qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus le m\u00eame homme d\u2019affaires averti, consciencieux et travailleur, l\u2019accident en a fait une ruine physique.\nLes jur\u00e9s pouvaient-ils, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 ces faits prouv\u00e9s devant eux, conclure que l\u2019accident avait ou d\u00e9termin\u00e9 ou acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 la mort? Sans doute que l\u2019autopsie a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des l\u00e9sions au coeur, plus anciennes que celles qu\u2019auraient caus\u00e9es l\u2019accident, mais si l\u2019accident a fait \u00e9voluer plus rapidement la maladie et abr\u00e9g\u00e9 la vie de Holman, la compagnie est responsable.\nLes faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis devant les jur\u00e9s produisent des probabilit\u00e9s, et cette, cause ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que sur des pr\u00e9somptions bas\u00e9es sur ces probabilit\u00e9s. Si les pr\u00e9somptions ainsi cr\u00e9\u00e9es sont assez fortes pour produire une conviction raisonnable chez douze jur\u00e9s, est-ce qu\u2019une cour doit intervenir? Je ne le crois pas. The judgment was affirmed by this court[25].\nIn Jones v. G.W. Rly. Co.[26], the House of Lords had to consider whether there was evidence on which a jury could properly find negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s servants which caused or contributed to the death of the husband of the first plaintiff. In stating the principles which should govern in such a case, Lord MacMillan, at page 45, said:\nThe dividing line between conjecture and inference is often a very difficult one to draw. A conjecture may be plausible but it is of no legal value, for its essence is that it is a mere guess. An inference in the legal sense, on the other hand, is a deduction from the evidence, and if it is a reasonable deduction it may have the validity of legal proof. The attribution of an occurrence to a cause is, I take it, always a matter of inference. The cogeny of a legal inference of causation may vary in degree between practical certainty and reasonable probability. Where the coincidence of cause and effect is not a matter of actual observation there is necessarily a hiatus in the direct evidence, but this may be legitimately bridged by an inference from the facts actually observed and proved.\nAn instance of a case where this court \u201cbridged the hiatus\u201d is that of Shawinigan Engineering Co. v. Naud[27]. It is sufficient to refer to the judgment of the court (Duff, Mignault, Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.), more particularly to the passage from the foot of page 344 to the end of page 345, to realize how strikingly similar the problem of the relation of cause and effect happened to be both in that case and in the present case.\nBy article 1242 C.C. presumptions not established by law are left to the discretion and judgment of the court. The corresponding article in the Code Napol\u00e9on (art. 1353) is to the same effect but with the limitation that the court will admit only such presumptions as are \u201cgraves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes,\u201d by which is meant presumptions in which the connection between the facts established in evidence and the fact to be proved is such that the existence of the known facts establishes by inference or deduction the fact in dispute.\nArticle 1242 of the Quebec Civil Code does not contain the limitation of the Code Napol\u00e9on but as a presumption to be admitted as legal proof is necessarily a deduction from proven facts, there is, perhaps, but little if any difference between the meaning to be ascribed to the two articles. See the Montreal Rolling Mills v. Corcoran[28].\nIn the present case there was evidence from which the jury could find that the mother fell on her stomach and that the fall produced ecchymosis on the right side thereof; that, after the accident, she suffered abnormal pains in her abdomen which continued until after her confinement, and for the first time she had a leakage of fluid from the uterus which, though slight and intermittent, continued until the birth of the child. These leakages Dr. Benoit, the family physician, explained as coming from the amniotic fluid. The doctor\u2019s view was that the three membranes of the sac had been slightly fissured, sufficiently to permit the fluid to slowly filter through, but not sufficiently to bring about a premature confinement.\nThe jury had also before them the further testimony of Dr. Benoit, who was present at the confinement, and who stated that in delivering the mother he had to break the sac\u2014that the water therein had partly escaped and \u201cl\u2019accouchement a \u00e9t\u00e9 presque \u00e0 sec.\u201d He examined the child immediately after its birth and found that each foot was bent inwards. Witnesses also testified that the child was born with a black mark on its heel. There was also evidence that no members on either side of the family had ever had club feet; that Madame L\u00e9veill\u00e9\u2019s first child had been perfect in health and form; that her carriage of Jeanine had been normal and that up to the 25th of March, 1929, she had not suffered any accident or fright. This evidence was uncontradicted. It was, therefore, for the jury to determine, in the light of that evidence and the medical testimony, whether a causal relation existed between Madame L\u00e9veill\u00e9\u2019s fall and the child\u2019s club feet.\nNine medical witnesses were examined at the trial, three testifying for the respondent and six for the appellant.\nFor the respondent Dr. Langevin, a gynaecologist and obstetrician professor at the University of Montreal, testified that in its mother\u2019s womb the child\u2019s members were in a flexed position and their malformation would be promoted by the absence of liquid in the uterine cavity which would cause the walls thereof to contract and the flexing to increase. He further said that in the last months of pregnancy, particularly from the seventh to the ninth month, the calcification of a child\u2019s bones greatly increases; that during this period it requires twenty-two times more lime than during the first months, and that with the extra pressure caused by the contraction of the uterine cavity the chances of the bones calcifying in their flexed position become greater. He also said that when the pressure is found in the uterine cavity the probability is that a deformity will result. Dr. Langevin\u2019s conclusion was that while club feet may result from various causes, the only satisfactory explanation, in the circumstances of this case, was that the deformity resulted as a consequence of the mother\u2019s fall. In fact he said that scientifically there was no other explanation.\nDr. Letondal, professor of children\u2019s clinic of the faculty of medicine, and specialist in children\u2019s diseases, testified to the same effect as Dr. Langevin. He admitted that his conclusion was simply a theory incapable of scientific demonstration but he expressed the opinion that it was the most probable theory and there was no other that he could suggest.\nDr. Benoit also testified as follows:\u2014\nQ. Docteur, \u00e0 quoi attribuez-vous cette condition de pieds bots dont l\u2019enfant souffre aujourd-hui?\u2014R. Enfin, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les auteurs,......\nQ. Docteur, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, qui nous occupe?\u2014R. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent ici, je l\u2019attribue par la pression ut\u00e9rine sur la position des membres, pression qui a dur\u00e9 deux mois, au cours desquels il y a calcification des membres et cette malformation a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la position des membres qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exag\u00e9r\u00e9e et je crois que le pied bot qui est ni plus, ni moins qu\u2019une exag\u00e9ration d\u2019une position normale au moment o\u00f9 il y avait calcification. Et je pourrais dire que le pied a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcifi\u00e9 dans cet \u00e9tat-l\u00e0.\n* * *\nQ. Maintenant, voulez-vous me dire s\u2019il y a relation entre l\u2019\u00e9tat que vous avez constat\u00e9 et l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 que vous avez vu chez cet enfant?\u2014R. Pour moi, c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat de contractibilit\u00e9 des membranes de l\u2019ut\u00e9rus, et c\u2019est d\u00fb au traumatisme qu\u2019elle a eu lors de sa chute.\nOn the other hand the medical witnesses called on behalf of the appellant stated that the cause of club feet in children is not known to the medical profession. They did not agree with the conclusion reached by the respondent\u2019s witnesses, some because they thought that if there had been a rupture of the uterine cavity sufficient to permit leakage from the amiotic sac it would have produced a premature confinement. Others thought the fall of the mother would not cause club feet in the child she was carrying at the time, and one added: that at seven months the feet of a child have become so ossified that a fall which would injure them would be likely to break the bones. The testimony given by these witnesses was largely of a negative character and they could not suggest any reasonable hypothesis to account for the deformity.\nDoes the evidence in this case take us beyond the region of pure conjecture and into the domain of reasonable inference? It was contended on behalf of the Company that, even if the accident to the mother was the result of the Company\u2019s fault, there was no evidence whatever to connect the deformity of the child\u2019s feet with the mother\u2019s accident; that it was just as reasonable to attribute the club feet to an unknown cause as to attribute it to the consequences of the mother\u2019s fall. I do not think this is so. Ascribing the club feet to an unknown cause does not eliminate uterine contraction as a probable cause. The Company\u2019s medical witnesses by saying that they do not know the cause of club feet do not negative the testimony of those who find uterine contraction a very probable cause. In this case the cause which produced club feet cannot be demonstrated to a certainty and the law does not require that it should be. It is simply a question of drawing an inference. Three medical witnesses for the respondent gave it as their opinion that the contraction caused by the escape of amiotic fluid was not only sufficient to account for the deformity in this case but that they could see no other probable cause. The jury were entitled to accept the conclusion of these witnesses and to infer from the whole evidence the existence of a causal relation.\nThe argument advanced on behalf of the Company in this case was advanced in the case of Craig v. Glasgow Corporation[29]. In that case a farmer was found lying beside the track of a tramway company with his head so badly injured that he had no recollection of what had taken place. He remembered that he had been driving two cows along the track, but had no recollection of having seen the tram car. The questions were whether he had been struck by the car and, if so, could it reasonably be inferred that the accident was due to the negligence of the company\u2019s driver? The driver testified that he would have been proceeding more slowly if he had seen the man and the cows. He did not see the man at all, nor did he see the cows until he was within three feet of them. The Lord Ordinary found that the man had been knocked down by the car as a consequence of the driver\u2019s failure to keep a proper lookout. This judgment was reversed on appeal but was restored by the House of Lords. In his judgment in the House of Lords Lord Findley, at page 9, said:\u2014\nIt is of course within the bounds of possibility that the pursuer had a fit and fell and injured his head upon the rail. It is within the bounds of possibility, as was suggested as a hypothesis\u2014not, I think, that it was put as a very likely hypothesis\u2014that he was knocked down by one of these cows. But what is the reasonable inference? That is what we have to deal with.\nThe data furnished by the evidence which the jury accepted and from which they deduced a presumption of causal relation, were, in my opinion, more convincing in the case before us than those found in the following cases in which the inferences drawn by the jury were upheld. McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[30]; Jones v. G.W. Rly. Co.[31]; Grand Trunk Rly. Co. v. Griffith[32].\nI am, therefore, of opinion that the evidence here does take us beyond the realm of conjecture and into the domain of reasonable inference, in which case it was for the jury to say if the evidence produced in their minds a conviction that it was reasonably probable that the deformity of the child resulted as a consequence of its mother\u2019s injury. They, having said it was, their verdict should not be disturbed.\nThe only other question is as to the sufficiency of the charge of the trial judge. Several objections were taken to the charge but the only one requiring consideration is that the judge misdirected the jury in respect of the law applicable to presumptions. The chief objection was that he failed to instruct the jury that a presumption was admissible as legal proof only when it was \u201cgrave, pr\u00e9cise et concordante\u201d or \u201cweighty and serious\u201d; that instead he instructed them that they were entitled to accept presumptions that rendered only simply probable or likely the existence of a causal relation between the deformity of the child and the accident to the mother. As required in the case of mixed juries the judge charged them in both the French and English languages. The following passages were referred to as embodying errors in law:\nQuand on examine les faits dans cette cause, ceux qui rendent m\u00eame simplement probable le r\u00e9sultat, c\u2019est que l\u2019accident rend probable que les pieds bots soit la cons\u00e9quence de la chute.\nIt is left to your discretion to find out and decide whether from all the circumstances there is sufficient for you to presume to create in your minds a likely presumption that the injury was caused as a direct result of the accident.\nIn this case you could not have direct proof. You must go by inference or presumption. More often the contested point is not demonstrated, but is simply rendered possible, vraisemblable to a more or less degree.\nIn this latter passage I take it the learned judge having used the word \u201cpossible,\u201d immediately substituted therefor, the word \u201cvraisemblable,\u201d for he has not elsewhere instructed the jury that the mere possibility of a causal relation was sufficient.\nIn support of his instructions the trial judge quoted to the jury the following passages dealing with presumptions of fact from well known French authors.\nPlaniol\u20149th ed., no. 36:\nla preuve proprement dite, directe et absolue n\u2019existe presque jamais; le plus souvent il n\u2019y a que des pr\u00e9somptions qui pourront non pas d\u00e9montrer mais simplement rendre la chose probable \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 plus ou moins fort.\nMarcad\u00e9\u2014vol. 5, art. 1353 C. N.:\nCette disposition de la loi est de la plus haute importance; elle est l\u2019une de celles qu\u2019il faut se graver profond\u00e9ment dans l\u2019exprit, pour ne les jamais perdre de vue.\nSa port\u00e9e est, en effet, immense puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9rige en preuves l\u00e9gales pour tous les cas o\u00f9 le t\u00e9moignage est admissible, les simples conjectures du magistrat, les simples probabilit\u00e9s que les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins ou les diverses circonstances de la cause peuvent faire na\u00eetre dans son esprit.\nDoes the law as stated by these authorities differ from that laid down in the above mentioned cases? In my opinion there is practically no difference for, under either the French or English jurisprudence, the presumptions or inferences to be receivable as proof must be a deduction from established facts which produces a reasonable conviction in the mind that the allegation of which proof is required is probably true. That conviction may vary in degree between \u201cpractical certainty\u201d and \u201creasonable probability\u201d or, as Planiol puts it, may render \u201cla chose probable \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 plus ou moins fort.\u201d In the Jones case[33] Lord MacMillan points out that a conjecture is of no legal value \u201cfor its essence is that of a guess,\u201d while Marcad\u00e9 would accept as proof \u201cles simples conjectures du magistrat.\u201d In my opinion these are not inconsistent views for as I read Marcad\u00e9 he was not using the word \u201cconjecture\u201d in the sense of \u201cguess.\u201d\nIn Littr\u00e9\u2014Dictionnaire de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise, the first meaning given for \u201cconjecture\u201d is \u201copinion \u00e9tablie sur des probabilit\u00e9s\u201d; and in Larousse pour tous, the meaning given is: \u201cpr\u00e9somption, supposition, opinion fond\u00e9e sur des probabilit\u00e9s.\u201d This appears to me to be the sense in which Marcad\u00e9 used the word \u201cconjecture.\u201d It, therefore, is simply a conviction founded on probabilities. For all practical purposes I see no reason why the principle stated by Lord MacMillan in the Jones case33 is not just as applicable to Quebec law as to English law. The objection, therefore, that the trial judge misdirected the jury in the observations referred to cannot be maintained.\nThe question, however, is whether he instructed the jury sufficiently? In a case such as this it is, in my opinion, essential that the judge should instruct the jury that the presumption which they are entitled to admit as proof must not be a mere guess on their part, but must be a reasonable deduction from such facts as they shall find to be established by the evidence. The learned trial judge did not in so many words give the jury this instruction but I think, in effect, he conveyed it to their minds. He called their attention to the uncontradicted evidence of the respondent\u2019s witnesses\u2014to the reasoning and conclusions drawn from that evidence by Dr. Langevin, and then he said:\u2014\nSi vous croyez, si vous en venez \u00e0 la conclusion que les faits dont les t\u00e9moins ont parl\u00e9 constituent dans votre esprit une pr\u00e9somption raisonnable, et si vous adoptez le t\u00e9moignage de M. Langevin qui est le seul qui nous donne une opinion un peu formul\u00e9e, si vous adoptez son opinion, vous r\u00e9pondrez \u00e0 cette question: oui.\nDr. Langevin had stated the inferences which he drew and the reasons why he drew them. In leaving it to the jury to say if they drew the same inferences the trial judge was practically instructing them that the presumption to be admitted as proof must be a deduction and not a guess. After considering the charge as a whole I agree with the majority of the court below that there was nothing in the charge to mislead the jury.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014Le demandeur, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 sa fille Jeannine, n\u00e9e le 25 mai 1929, r\u00e9clame les dommages soufferts par cette enfant, venue au monde avec des pieds bots, et poursuit la d\u00e9fenderesse parce que la n\u00e9gligence d\u2019un de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, en causant la chute, le 25 mars 1929, de la m\u00e8re de l\u2019enfant, alors enceinte de sept mois, serait la cause de cette infirmit\u00e9 dont l\u2019enfant souffre pr\u00e9judice depuis sa naissance. La faute de la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9e par le jury et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute devant nous.\nTrois points seulement sont soulev\u00e9s, dont le premier n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 devant les autres juridictions:\n1. L\u2019on nie que cette enfant puisse recouvrer des dommages qu\u2019elle aurait soufferts comme cons\u00e9quence d\u2019un accident caus\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re avant sa naissance et dont elle aurait, par ricochet, elle-m\u00eame souffert;\n2. Les pr\u00e9somptions sur lesquelles le jury s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la relation de causalit\u00e9 entre cet accident \u00e0 la m\u00e8re et l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant ne sont pas suffisantes en droit pour justifier le verdict du jury;\n3. La charge du juge n\u2019a pas suffisamment \u00e9clair\u00e9 le jury sur cette question de droit.\nI.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant la Cour du Banc du Roi l\u2019on n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 le point qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence du droit d\u2019action dans les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail dans les notes de mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019honorable juge Lamont.\nApr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin les raisons que Ton a fait valoir de part et d\u2019autre, il me semble qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de discuter les droits de l\u2019enfant dans le sein de sa m\u00e8re, entre sa conception et sa naissance. L\u2019action en responsabilit\u00e9, et partant la possibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019exercer devant la juridiction comp\u00e9tente, na\u00eet, en principe, du jour o\u00f9 la victime a subi le dommage; et une faute ne suffit pas pour agir. Le pr\u00e9judice est l\u2019un des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de la responsabilit\u00e9. Sans lui, pas d\u2019action en responsabilit\u00e9 possible. Quelle r\u00e9paration pourrait r\u00e9clamer un demandeur s\u2019il n\u2019avait subi encore aucun dommage? Si, en principe, le demandeur ne peut agir d\u00e8s l\u2019instant o\u00f9 la faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise mais seulement \u00e0 l\u2019instant o\u00f9 cette faute lui a caus\u00e9 un dommage, il me semble que le droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration de Jeannine L\u00e9veill\u00e9 n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exister qu\u2019apr\u00e8s sa naissance, lorsque l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 corporelle dont elle souffre s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e. Avant cette date, aussi longtemps qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait dans le sein de sa m\u00e8re, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle ne souffrait aucun dommage, aucun inconv\u00e9nient et aucun pr\u00e9judice. Aucune action en responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait ouverte. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque le pr\u00e9judice certain a \u00e9t\u00e9 souffert que ses droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9s, qu\u2019elle est devenue une victime ayant des droits \u00e0 r\u00e9paration. C\u2019est de ce moment, apr\u00e8s sa naissance, que son droit a commenc\u00e9. On peut dire que son droit est n\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019elle. Elle pouvait donc, assist\u00e9e de son tuteur, intenter la pr\u00e9sente action pour essayer de d\u00e9montrer que le pr\u00e9judice dont elle souffre a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 sa naissance par la faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse et de son employ\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter la maxime: \u201cInfans conceptus pro nato habetur quoties de commodis ejus agitur,\u201d ni l\u2019application des articles 345, 608, 771, 838 et 945 du Code civil. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un droit que l\u2019enfant avait d\u00e8s sa conception, mais d\u2019un droit \u00e0 r\u00e9paration qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 sa naissance.\nII\nLe demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 avait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir en fait que la chute de la m\u00e8re, deux mois avant la naissance de l\u2019enfant, a caus\u00e9 l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la faute et le pr\u00e9judice. Si le pr\u00e9judice est la cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019acte illicite, l\u2019auteur du quasi-d\u00e9lit doit r\u00e9parer, m\u00eame si cette cons\u00e9quence \u00e9tait impr\u00e9visible au moment de la faute.\nLa Cour de cassation, en France, pose en principe que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du rapport de causalit\u00e9 est une question de fait; mais nous pourrions intervenir et mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du fait par le jury si nous en arrivions \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019elle est d\u00e9raisonnable. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la faute n\u2019aurait atteint la victime qui se plaint devant nous que par ricochet. Sans doute, peut-on dire que l\u2019analyse du lien de causalit\u00e9 ne n\u00e9cessite pas une distinction entre les causes prochaines et les causes lointaines; toutes sont \u00e9quivalentes au point de vue de la responsabilit\u00e9. Mais devonsnous dire que les principes de la causalit\u00e9 conduisent \u00e0 ordonner la r\u00e9paration de dommages indirects? Je ne le crois pas; car dans la s\u00e9rie des pr\u00e9judices, il y a un moment o\u00f9 nul ne peut plus affirmer avec certitude que sans la faute le dommage ne se serait pas produit. A partir de ce moment, l\u2019existence du lien de causalit\u00e9 n\u2019est plus \u00e9tablie; la faute initiale ne peut donc plus \u00eatre tenue comme cause du pr\u00e9judice.\nComme le disent MM. Henri et L\u00e9on Mazeaud, dans leur Trait\u00e9 de Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, 1931, no. 1673,\n* * * l\u2019auteur de la faute initiale ne r\u00e9pond dans la cha\u00eene des pr\u00e9judices que de ceux qui sont la cons\u00e9quence certaine, n\u00e9cessaire de son acte.

Elle ne laisse pas en effet supposer que seul le premier pr\u00e9judice doit \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9: le deuxi\u00e8me, le troisi\u00e8me, le quatri\u00e8me, etc., sont susceptibles d\u2019engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur de la faute initiale: il en est ainsi chaque fois qu\u2019ils ont un lien certain de causalit\u00e9 avec cette faute; mais, plus ils s\u2019\u00e9loignent dans la cha\u00eene des cons\u00e9quences, plus la certitude diminue.\nCes m\u00eames auteurs soulignent le fait que la jurisprudence en France, avec raison, ne voit dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice direct que l\u2019application du principe d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel la relation de cause \u00e0 effet doit exister avec certitude entre la faute et le dommage.\nD\u00e8s que cette relation existe, le pr\u00e9judice doit \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9, si lointain soit-il; et cela montre assez que les expressions \u201cdommage indirect\u201d et \u201csuite imm\u00e9diate\u201d exprimaient fort mal l\u2019id\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019elles recouvrent. Il n\u2019est pas question de proximit\u00e9 dans le temps ou dans d\u2019espace, mais seulement de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9.\nDans la cause actuelle, avons-nous r\u00e9unis les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la responsabilit\u00e9: pr\u00e9judice, faute, rapport de causalit\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on a \u00e9tablir un lien de droit entre la victime du pr\u00e9judice et l\u2019auteur de la faute?\nIci, l\u2019on a d\u00fb n\u00e9cessairement, pour \u00e9tablir ce rapport de causalit\u00e9, avoir recours aux pr\u00e9somptions d\u00e9coulant des circonstances prouv\u00e9es: chute de la m\u00e8re, sympt\u00f4mes anormaux avant et pendant la naissance, qui ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas produits chez elle auparavant; marques de l\u2019enfant; constations du m\u00e9decin traitant et t\u00e9moignages m\u00e9dicaux. Les pr\u00e9somptions que le jury a tir\u00e9es des faits l\u00e9galement \u00e9tablis devant lui sont, en principe, suffisantes dans le proc\u00e8s en responsabilit\u00e9. Le juge du fait est souverain quant \u00e0 leur appr\u00e9ciation (arts 474-475 C.P.C.); mais il a le devoir de conscience de n\u2019admettre que des pr\u00e9somptions graves, pr\u00e9cises et concordantes. Il faut donc, dans chaque esp\u00e8ce, scruter les faits invoqu\u00e9s par le demandeur en responsabilit\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la faute, le dommage et le lien de cause \u00e0 effet; et une fois que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, assist\u00e9 d\u2019un jury, a constat\u00e9 les faits, a \u00e9tabli cette relation comme certaine et non probl\u00e9matique, un tribunal d\u2019appel ne peut, en vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, intervenir que si le verdict est contraire au poids de la preuve; et l\u2019article 501 C.C. nous dit que le\nverdict n\u2019est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 la preuve, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit de telle nature que le jury, en examinant toute la preuve, n\u2019aurait pu raisonnablement le rendre.\nou, suivant l\u2019article 508 C.C., un jugement diff\u00e9rent peut \u00eatre rendu\nlorsque les faits, tels que constat\u00e9s par le jury, exigent que le jugement soit en faveur de l\u2019appelant.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a refus\u00e9 d\u2019en venir \u00e0 cette conclusion; et je ne vois aucune raison valable pour mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision. Les conclusions des docteurs Langevin et Letondal \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les circonstances de cette cause indiquaient comme seule explication satisfaisante, que la chute de la m\u00e8re et ses cons\u00e9quences avaient amen\u00e9 la difformit\u00e9 de son enfant, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es par le jury. Est-ce un verdict d\u00e9raisonnable? Il n\u2019aurait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 celui d\u2019un jury de m\u00e9decins ou de sp\u00e9cialistes; mais il a re\u00e7u l\u2019approbation du tribunal choisi et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le loi pour d\u00e9cider souverainement du fait suivant sa conscience; et rien au dossier ne d\u00e9montre que ce tribunal a err\u00e9. Le verdict du jury ne r\u00e8glera pas la controverse m\u00e9dicale engag\u00e9e devant lui. Mais la loi ne peut attendre que les m\u00e9decins soient unanimes pour d\u00e9cider la question de fait soulev\u00e9e en cette cause. L\u2019on n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 de l\u2019enfant provenait d\u2019une autre cause que l\u2019accident caus\u00e9 \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re pendant la p\u00e9riode de gestation par la faute maintenant admise du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un verdict du jury, approuv\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et par le tribunal d\u2019appel, nous puissions, sur une question de fait, mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ces jugements concordants, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019on puisse nous indiquer une erreur manifeste qu\u2019il serait de notre devoir de corriger. On ne l\u2019a pas fait.\nComme dans Shawinigan Engineering Co. v. Naud[34], le fait que les m\u00e9decins de la compagnie, tout en soutenant que l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas le r\u00e9sultat de la chute de la m\u00e8re, se d\u00e9clarent incapables d\u2019en d\u00e9couvrir une autre cause, affaiblit la valeur probante de leur opinion, et l\u2019affirmation contraire me para\u00eet mieux s\u2019accorder avec l\u2019encha\u00eenement logique des circonstances et la succession des sympt\u00f4mes qui se sont manifest\u00e9s. Ces circonstances et ces sympt\u00f4mes sont suffisamment graves, pr\u00e9cis et concordants pour nous permettre de d\u00e9cider que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait la preuve qui lui incombait, de la relation entre l\u2019infirmit\u00e9 dont elle souffre et l\u2019accident que sa m\u00e8re a subi par suite de la n\u00e9gligence de l\u2019appelante.\nIII\nQuant au troisi\u00e8me point, je crois, comme mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019honorable juge Lamont, et pour les m\u00eames raisons, que le juge avait suffisamment indiqu\u00e9 au jury les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 suivre pour tirer des d\u00e9ductions des faits \u00e9tablis devant lui.\nJe crois donc que l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nSmith J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent sues on behalf of his infant child for injuries alleged to have been sustained by the child by reason of the mother having fallen in alighting from the appellant\u2019s car at a time when she was seven months pregnant of the child. The child was born two months later, with club feet. The allegation is that the club feet were the result of the fall, which the jury has found was caused by the appellant\u2019s negligence.\nThe first question to be determined upon the appeal is whether or not any action lies on behalf of the child.\nMy brother Lamont has reviewed authorities on this point at length, and concludes that the great weight of judicial opinion in the common law courts denies the right of a child, when born, to maintain an action for prenatal injuries, but that such right of action exists under the Civil Code of Quebec. In my view, the provisions of the Civil Code in reference to appointment of curators to unborn children or as to the right of such children to inherit or take, by gift or will, do not help to distinguish the law under this code from the common law, as all these rights exist also under the common law, and are entirely different in character from the right of action in tort set up in this case.\nIt seems to me that in the various citations made by my brother Lamont as to the civil law, the reference is to rights concerning property, and not to rights such as here claimed. Neither under the common law nor under the Civil Code of Quebec does the law on this point seem to have been definitely settled by authority; but, while admitting that the point is a doubtful one, my view is that the action does not lie.\nI am further of opinion that, having regard to the scientific problem involved, there was not evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find as a fact that the child\u2019s club feet resulted from the injury to the mother.\nThe medical evidence offered by the respondent to shew that the deformity of the child\u2019s feet resulted from the accident is that of Doctors Langevin, Letondal and Benoit.\nThe two latter do not pretend to have formed any independent opinion of their own. Dr. Letondal says:\n* * * \u00e9videmment que ce t\u00e9moignage du docteur Langevin m\u2019a excessivement impressionn\u00e9. Mais il s\u2019agit simplement d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8se et pas d\u2019une chose qu\u2019on peut d\u00e9montrer scientifiquement.\nMais dans le cas particulier c\u2019est vraiment l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se la plus probable, et il n\u2019y en a pas d\u2019autre que je puisse assigner, dans ce cas particulier, je n\u2019en vois pas d\u2019autres.\nDr. Benoit attended the mother from the time of the accident until after the birth of the child, two months later, and says:\non n\u2019aurait pas pu en faire la preuve mais j\u2019ai entendu le t\u00e9moignage cet apr\u00e8s-midi, du docteur Langevin, des causes qui am\u00e8nent le pied bot, et je crois que c\u2019est l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se la plus plausible. Il y a de certains cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on ne peut pas affirmer. Cependant, je n\u2019ai jamais fait d\u2019\u00e9tudes sp\u00e9ciales parce que je ne suis pas un sp\u00e9cialiste.\nIt may be noted here that he learned of no causes from Dr. Langevin except the one, as that witness mentioned no others. These two doctors therefore add nothing to the testimony of Dr. Langevin, but merely accept what he says, but both, on the strength of what Dr. Langevin has said, proceed to confirm his opinion. Dr. Langevin is a \u201cgyn\u00e9cologiste,\u201d and \u201cm\u00e9decin en chef de la Maternit\u00e9,\u201d professor at the University of Montreal, and has charge of the obstetrical course. He is asked if there is a relation between the accident and the club feet of the child, and answers:\u2014\nC\u2019est une possibilit\u00e9. D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019analyse du processus psychologique, ce qu\u2019il faut se rappeler, c\u2019est que naturellement l\u2019enfant a les membres fl\u00e9chis dans la cavit\u00e9 ut\u00e9rine. Deux causes peuvent favoriser surtout la difformation des membres normalement, l\u2019absence de liquide dans la cavit\u00e9 de l\u2019ut\u00e9rus venant contracter l\u2019enfant, le fl\u00e9chissement s\u2019accentue.\nThen the following question is asked:\u2014\nQ. Docteur, au cas o\u00f9 vous auriez un enfant, et la preuve d\u00e9montre ceci que la femme \u00e9tait parfaitement bien jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elle est tomb\u00e9e sur le ventre alors qu\u2019elle portait depuis sept mois, qu\u2019elle est arriv\u00e9e chez elle imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s \u00eatre tomb\u00e9e presque sans connaissance, et qu\u2019elle s\u2019est sentie imm\u00e9diatement des douleurs dans l\u2019abdomen, qu\u2019en arrivant chez elle sa m\u00e8re a constat\u00e9 que ses habits \u00e9taient souill\u00e9s, qu\u2019il y avait des marques rouges; que depuis elle a continu\u00e9 de perdre un peu et de tacher son linge jusqu\u2019au moment de l\u2019accouchement et que ces pertes qui arrivaient chez elle c\u2019\u00e9tait des eaux et que \u00e0 part de cela elle \u00e9tait parfaitement bien; et maintenant j\u2019ajouterai, par la preuve que nous allons faire, que l\u2019accouchement s\u2019est fait comme l\u2019on dit, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 sec; et que l\u2019enfant, \u00e0 sa naissance, portait des marques noires, comme des contusions \u00e0 l\u2019endroit ou ce traumatisme ce serait produit \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur; ces faits \u00e9tant donn\u00e9s, dites-moi donc, docteur, si vous trouvez qu\u2019il y a relation entre l\u2019accident et puis l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019enfant \u00e0 sa naissance.\u2014R. Je le crois.\nAsked if there might be any other cause, he answers:\u2014\nIl peut y avoir un nombre de causes, mais du moment qu\u2019il y aurait eu pression dans la cavit\u00e9 ut\u00e9rine il est probable qu\u2019il y a eu difformation. Il peut y avoir d\u2019autres causes que cet accident, mais cet accident, dans le moment, qui s\u2019est produit, par suite du traumatisme, peut expliquer le cas.\nThe doctor is not a specialist on club feet, and does not pretend to have made any special study on their cause. He says there may be many causes, but tells us nothing of what these other causes are, or of what medical science has discovered about the causes that lead to club feet.\nDr. Letondal, one of the respondent\u2019s witnesses, says that it is not exactly known in medicine what leads to club feet and, so far as he is concerned, it is not determined what is the cause of club feet.\nAccording to the last answer of Dr. Langevin, quoted, if the mother was well before the accident, and not well after it, it is a satisfactory conclusion to say that any defect in the child when born is the result of the accident. One of the basic facts submitted in the question is that the child, at its birth, carried black marks like contusions at the place where this \u201ctraumatisme\u201d would be produced at the exterior. The only evidence of any marks on the exterior of the woman\u2019s body after the accident is that given by her mother, Justine Therrien. She is asked:\u2014\nQ. Et puis, apr\u00e8s cela, avez-vous constat\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait des marques rouges.\u2014R. Un petit peu sur le ventre.\nThe injured woman gave evidence, and makes no mention of any marks; and Dr. Benoit, who was called in to see her the next day, and presumably examined her, although he does not say so, makes no mention of any such marks.\nWhen the child was born, Madame Beaulieu, a sister of the injured woman and an attendant at childbirth, discovered that the child had club feet, and called the doctor\u2019s attention to it; and then the mother and the doctor examined the child; and all three gave evidence as to what they saw. Madame Beaulieu says:\u2014\n* * * j\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que l\u2019enfant \u00e9tait infirme, et alors qu\u2019il avait des taches sur les pieds.\n* * * Quel genre de taches?\nDes bleus, des ecchymoses * * *.\nThe mother of the child says:\u2014\n* * * j\u2019ai regard\u00e9 les marques.\nQ. Des marques?\u2014R. Bien. Je sais qu\u2019il avait des taches noires en arri\u00e8re, des marques que j\u2019ai vues.\nDr. Benoit examined the child, and found that it had club feet but says not a word about marks, either black or blue, on the back or on the feet. I have quoted every word of evidence that there is in reference to marks on the mother and on the child, and, as will be seen, there is nothing connecting these blue marks on the feet, or these black marks en arri\u00e8re (perhaps meaning on the back of the feet\u2014that is, on the heels\u2014with the petit peu red marks on the body of the mother referred to in the evidence of Justine Therrien quoted, either as to position or otherwise. The marks mentioned in the question are black marks, and the only black marks mentioned in the evidence are those en arri\u00e8re.\nOne of these facts, therefore, upon which Dr. Langevin\u2019s theory is built, is not established by evidence.\nAnother of the basic facts, submitted in the question, is that on arriving home, the mother of the injured woman discovered that her clothes were soiled, that from that time she continued to lose a little, and to stain her linen, up to the moment of the birth; and that this loss, which\u2019 happened with her, was of water; that is, fluid. In addition to what is stated in the question, Dr. Langevin states, that he has heard the evidence giving the description of the symptoms which were present in consequence of the accident. The description, as given in the evidence, is entirely different from what is stated in the question.\nAs to the loss of fluid, the mother of the child says she had no loss up to the time of the accident, and, being asked if she had any such loss immediately after, answers that she cannot tell, as she was too nervous, and that they might ask Dr. Benoit. Two months passed from the date of the accident until the birth, during which time these alleged losses continued, saturating the woman\u2019s clothes; but she says not a word about it.\nThere is the evidence of Justine Therrien, mother of the child\u2019s mother, who undressed her on her arrival home after the accident, and who says she discovered that the patient was wetted, that she was very nervous, and had a headache. Asked if these losses of fluid lasted a long time, she answers: \u201cNon, monsieur, pas trop longtemps.\u201d Then asked if she remarked, following this, losses of fluid, she answers, \u201cPlusieurs jours.\u201d To the question, \u201cElle \u00e9gouttait?\u201d she responded, \u201cOui, monsieur.\u201d\nNext we have the evidence of Madame Beaulieu, already mentioned. She saw her sister the second day after the accident. She saw fluid on her sister\u2019s clothes and her linen soiled, and this condition continued; and at the birth there was no fluid at all. She is asked if, before the birth, her sister \u201c\u00e9tait avec un gros ventre?\u201d to which she replied, \u201cPas du tout.\u201d She is asked if this was due to the loss of fluid, and answers that, before the accident her sister was very big, but after, this diminished. She was so big before the accident as not to be able to button her coat, and after the accident \u201cca tout diminu\u00e9.\u201d At the birth, she says, there was no fluid at all, that it was \u201cun accouchement \u00e0 sec, dans le sang.\u201d\nDr. Benoit, who was called in to see the patient the day after the accident, and who attended her regularly, as he says, for the following two months, is asked if he dis- covered that she lost fluid, and answers, \u201cI did not discover it myself.\u201d Asked if the patient spoke to him on the subject, he says, \u201cFrankly, I do not remember that.\u201d He says not a word about the bigness of the patient having diminished; and this sister of the child\u2019s mother, who went to see her every day, and who must have come in contact with the doctor very frequently, never mentioned either the loss of fluid that she was observing nor the diminution of bigness to the doctor; and the doctor himself never heard of these conditions until some time after the birth, never was told of them by anybody; but he does say that he observed at the time of the birth that there was very little fluid.\nHe builds up, however, in his own mind a theory and says the fluid flowed away gradually by an opening very slight, and even, he believes, that it was some membranes of the sac which were torn. There are three of them, and he believes that one of the membranes had an opening lengthwise in one tissue and probably there was also an opening a little further away; and the fluid would run like that between the membranes, but the sac was not much open. Then he says that this is an anomaly, on which he would not rely if there had been no accident.\nIt will be noticed that all this is not founded on anything that he observed. He never knew, until the birth, that there was any loss of fluid; he then discovered, he says, that there was very little fluid, which did not even draw from him a remark about its loss at the time, nor a little later, when he discovered the club feet. If he had thought at the time that the small quantity of fluid had anything to do with the club feet, surely he would not have left all this theory about small openings in different plies of the walls of the sac to conjecture afterwards; but would have examined the sac there and then, when it was before him, to ascertain if there was any rupture at all. This was the sure method of determining the fact, but, instead of adopting this very obvious method, he waits until he gets into the witness box, and then propounds a conjecture about it, which has no basis whatever in fact, and which is entirely improbable. If a blow from the outside tore these membranes, why should it tear only one ply at one place, and another ply at some distance off? The doctor was not accepting the evidence of this sister of the patient, because, on his theory, there could have been no diminution of the bigness from the time of the accident. If such a thing occurred, it could only occur gradually, in accordance with the gradual loss that the doctor speaks of, and would be most significant at the time of the birth; and at that time the doctor noticed nothing of the kind.\nWhat, then, under all these circumstances, was the state of fact upon which Dr. Langevin\u2019s answer is based? He heard the evidence of the three women; then he heard what was stated in the question. We have it in evidence by Drs. Gray and Dub\u00e9, called for the defence, that if there had been a loss of fluid as described, causing the pressure assumed, there would have been a miscarriage, and matters could not have gone on for two months, to the completion of the birth in the natural way in the natural time. The conditions spoken of did not hasten the birth by a day, the child was born without any complications, and in perfect health. Did Dr. Langevin, in his answer, assume that there was such a great loss of fluid that the largeness disappeared almost immediately after the accident, and brought about the pressure that he speaks of from that time? If he did, he is not basing his answer upon what is stated in the question, as he was bound to do. If he did not accept that as the condition, but accepted the statement in the question as indicating a gradual loss of fluid, then when does he think the pressure that he relies on commenced? It must have been, on that view of the case, a very considerable time, probably at least a month, before pressure, to any practical extent, would commence. The doctor\u2019s theory, of course, is utterly denied by a number of doctors as prominent as himself, called by the defence; but if the doctor\u2019s opinion, under the circumstances mentioned, is sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict, it is useless to place the contrary opinion of other doctors against his, because it is the province of the jury to decide as to the weight to be attached to a number of conflicting opinions; and, in order to discard Dr. Langevin\u2019s evidence, and the verdict founded on it, one must go further.\nAs already stated, Dr. Langevin is not a specialist in the matter of club feet. His specialty in obstetrics has no more to do with club feet than it has to do with insanity. If this child had been born an idiot, Dr. Langevin could just as well have said that he believed it was caused by pressure on the skull, and, knowing no other reason, he would consider that one sufficient. He does not pretend to have formed his opinion on anything of the kind that he had observed in his own experience, does not pretend that he had made any special study as to the causes of club feet, or that he formed his opinion on anything that he learned from medical science. He does not say that he ever heard of such a case.\nDr. Benoit and Dr. Letondal, witnesses for the respondent, say that the cause of club feet is not known to medical science, and the same statement is made by Dr. Gray, Dr. Ferron, Dr. Nutter and Dr. De Martigny, and this is not denied by Dr. Langevin. All he says is that there are a number of causes, without naming a single one of them except the one that he propounds in this case.\nWhat force or probability, then, is there in Dr. Langevin\u2019s opinion? As already stated, it is not based on anything that he has observed, on any study of the matter that he has made, or on anything that has been discovered by medical science. Such an opinion, to be worth anything, must be based on a definite state of facts of which there is evidence, and here it is impossible to tell what particular state of facts he had in mind as the basis of his opinion. Did he, from the statement in the question, conclude that the black marks mentioned indicated that the feet, perfectly formed, were subjected to violence at the time of the fall, that twisted or distorted them, and that they were subsequently held in that position by pressure?\nPerhaps he discarded all statements about marks, and relied only on the pressure. The greatest pressure would be suggested by the evidence of the sister, who discovered the mother\u2019s bigness practically gone when she saw her, a little after the accident, and which was never recovered. Did Dr. Langevin take his theory of pressure from this testimony, which he says he heard? If so, his answer is not based on the statements in the question, and he must have rejected Dr. Benoit\u2019s theory of gradual leakage between the plies of tissue of the walls of the sac.\nAgain, did the doctor disregard the evidence of Dame Beaulieu about great loss of fluid, causing at once the loss of bigness, which he had heard, and which Dr. Benoit also heard and evidently disbelieved? If so, with the gradual leakage that otherwise took place, such as described by Dr. Benoit, when did pressure begin sufficient to twist the bones of the feet already formed at seven months? The pressure necessarily would come gradually, following the gradual loss of fluid that extended over the whole two months. On this supposition there would be for some time the rapid calcification of the bones of the feet that the doctor dwells upon as going on so rapidly during the last two months, before the pressure could become sufficiently great to have effect. I wonder at what time the doctor settled in his mind as the basis of his theory that pressure sufficient to twist the bones of the feet commenced? He was at liberty to choose in his mind any one of many different conditions as the basis of his theory, and no one can tell what the basic conditions on which he built were.\nThen there is the evidence of the two doctors called for the respondent, and the other doctors already referred to and not controverted by Dr. Langevin\u2019s evidence, that medical science has not discovered the cause of club feet, and has merely put forward more or less plausible theories, of which Dr. Langevin\u2019s does not seem to be one.\nFor the reasons indicated, I think that there was no evidence sufficiently positive and definite to warrant the jury in finding that the club feet resulted from the accident. Dr. Langevin\u2019s theory is a mere guess.\nIn coming to this conclusion, it is a satisfaction to me to feel that I am doing no injustice to this unfortunate child, because on the evidence, including that of Dr. Langevin, I am fully convinced that there is not the slightest probability that his theory is correct.\nThe appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Vall\u00e9e, Vien, Beaudry, Fortier & Mathieu.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Joseph H\u00e9lai.\n[1] (1891) 28 L.R.

Restaldi (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: May 17, 18; 1933: June 8.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Automobile\u2014Placed by owner at disposal of a friend\u2014Accident\u2014Patron momentan\u00e9\u2014Evidence\u2014Declarations by the owner admitting his liability\u2014Proof by the injured person.\nThe respondent, who was vice-consul for Italy, and also a physician and surgeon, carrying on the practice of his profession in the city of Montreal, had amongst his patients the appellant. On the 17th December, 1928, the appellant required by telephone the services of the respondent during the course of the afternoon, but the respondent had some professional calls to make before he was free to call upon the appellant. The latter accordingly\u2014as he had done on former occasions\u2014placed at the disposal of the respondent his automobile, together with his chauffeur, in order that the respondent might make his other professional visits and then call at the appellant\u2019s residence. Between the hours of six and seven o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the chauffeur of the appellant, in approaching from the south the subway under the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks over St. Denis street, drove the automobile against one of the steel uprights dividing the lane for vehicles of this nature from the lanes provided for the tramway lines, and as a result of the impact the respondent sustained serious injuries, for which he claimed damages from his friend and patient, the appellant. Before the trial, the appellant\u2019s counsel proceeded to the examination of the respondent on discovery (art. 286 C.C.P.); and the latter swore that the appellant admitted to him, in the presence of other witnesses, that the accident \u201cwas the chauffeur\u2019s fault\u201d and that \u201che (the appellant) was liable * * * for the accident and its consequences.\u201d At the trial, the respondent merely proved the amount of damages and produced no further evidence as to the chauffeur\u2019s fault. The appellant\u2019s grounds of appeal were, first, that the record did not show any evidence that the accident was due to the fault of his chauffeur and, secondly, that the respondent, at the time of the accident, was the patron momentan\u00e9 of the chauffeur, and as such had no claim against the appellant.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, (Q.R. 54 K.B. 197), that the respondent\u2019s examination on discovery established sufficiently the existence of facts which explained the acknowledgment by the appellant of his liability, as sworn to by the respondent and which also fully justified the judgment appealed from in favour of the respondent. Such examination taken under the provisions of art. 286 C.C.P. forms part of the record under art. 288 C.C.P., it contains evidence of \u201caveux extra-judiciaires\u201d by the appellant in which he admits his liability and his chauffeur\u2019s fault. These \u201caveux\u201d were expressly alleged by the respondent in his statement of claim, and, as this is a case where parol evidence is admissible, they could be proved by the respondent under his oath.\nHeld, also, that the respondent was not, at the time of the accident the patron momentan\u00e9 of the appellant\u2019s chauffeur. The appellant had retained for himself the power and the right to give instructions to his chauffeur; and the respondent, being merely the appellant\u2019s guest in his car, had no control over the acts of the chauffeur. Under the circumstances of the case, there has been no transfer to the respondent of the appellant\u2019s control over the chauffeur\u2019s acts and of his power to give orders to the driver of the car.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Joseph Demers J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for $5,073.07.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. A. Merrill K.C. and G. D. McKay for the appellant.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. and J. D. Kearney K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019intim\u00e9 est m\u00e9decin et exerce sa profession \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. L\u2019appelant, se sentant malade, le pria par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de venir le voir. A ce moment-l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait des courses \u00e0 faire et devait, entre autres choses, aller avec sa femme \u00e0 une r\u00e9ception offerte par le consul g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Serbie, puis faire des visites \u00e0 quelques-uns de ses patients. L\u2019appelant lui dit qu\u2019il lui enverrait son automobile pour lui permettre de vaquer d\u2019abord \u00e0 ses occupations et l\u2019amener ensuite \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant, o\u00f9 il pourrait lui donner ses soins. Cela fut convenu. Le bureau de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tant situ\u00e9 dans l\u2019est de la ville, il fut entendu que le chauffeur de l\u2019appelant, conduisant la voiture de ce dernier, passerait d\u2019abord \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour chercher Madame Restaldi et la conduirait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel Mont Royal, o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 viendrait l\u2019attendre; qu\u2019il irait de l\u00e0 \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception du consul de Serbie; puis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ferait ses visites \u00e0 ses patients et qu\u2019il se rendrait ensuite chez l\u2019appelant. Ce programme fut suivi. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception, l\u2019intim\u00e9 alla reconduire sa femme chez lui. Il ramena avec elle une des amies de cette derni\u00e8re, que, en route, ils d\u00e9pos\u00e8rent chez elle; puis, il fit ses visites m\u00e9dicales; et, au moment o\u00f9 il se rendait chez l\u2019un de ses patients, comme la voiture passait par le tunnel sous la voie du chemin de fer, au nord de la rue Saint-Denis, elle donna sur l\u2019un des montants en acier qui soutiennent le tablier de la voie ferr\u00e9e et qui s\u00e9parent le passage destin\u00e9 aux voitures de celui qui est destin\u00e9 aux tramways. L\u2019intim\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait assis \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de l\u2019automobile, fut violemment projet\u00e9 sur le si\u00e8ge d\u2019en avant et fut gravement bless\u00e9. Il poursuivit l\u2019appelant et r\u00e9clama des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc Roi en appel ont maintenu son action. L\u2019appelant se pourvoit devant cette cour et demande que ces jugements soient infirm\u00e9s pour deux motifs: Il pr\u00e9tend que le dossier ne d\u00e9voile aucune preuve de faute de la part de son chauffeur; et que, d\u2019ailleurs, ce chauffeur, au moment de l\u2019accident, \u00e9tait devenu le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nIl vaut mieux examiner d\u2019abord ce second moyen. Il soul\u00e8ve sans doute une question mixte de droit et de fait, mais sa solution d\u00e9pend essentiellement de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances particuli\u00e8res du cas qui nous est soumis.\nL\u2019appelant a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour requ\u00e9rir les services de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Il aurait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 le voir imm\u00e9diatement; mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait ses engagements \u00e0 remplir (\u201cimportant cases\u201d). C\u2019est alors que l\u2019appelant lui offrit de lui envoyer sa voiture et son chauffeur, ce qui lui permettrait d\u2019accomplir plus facilement ses diverses obligations (\u201cIt was easier for me to go and see these people before\u201d) et d\u2019arr\u00eater chez l\u2019appelant en retournant chez lui.\nC\u2019est l\u2019appelant qui sugg\u00e9ra de mettre sa voiture et son chauffeur \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour toutes ces fins. Au cours du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e9chang\u00e9 entre les parties, il ne fut naturellement question d\u2019aucun arrangement par lequel le chauffeur deviendrait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Aucune convention n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 ce sujet, il faut d\u00e9duire des faits que nous connaissons la nature des relations qui se sont trouv\u00e9es cr\u00e9\u00e9es entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et le chauffeur. Bien entendu, l\u2019appelant est rest\u00e9 le patron habituel du chauffeur; mais il pr\u00e9tend que, lors de l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 en \u00e9tait devenu le patron momentan\u00e9, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 engager sa responsabilit\u00e9. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec les jugements rendus pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que telles ne sont pas les cons\u00e9quences des faits qui se sont pass\u00e9s. En pareil cas, la r\u00e8gle nous para\u00eet bien pos\u00e9e dans le \u201cRecueil P\u00e9riodique des Assurances\u201d, publi\u00e9 par M. Sainctelette (ann\u00e9e 1930), page 519:\n* * * la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 mis par le commettant \u00e0 la disposition d\u2019un tiers se d\u00e9place pour incomber \u00e0 ce dernier, ou continue au contraire \u00e0 peser sur le commettant, suivant qu\u2019en fait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 est ou n\u2019est pas pass\u00e9 sous la direction et l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du tiers.\nLe crit\u00e9rium, d\u2019ailleurs, nous est fourni par les jugements de la Cour Supr\u00eame et du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Bain v. Central Vermont Ry.[2]. Il faut se demander qui avait le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019employ\u00e9 au moment du fait qui a caus\u00e9 l\u2019accident; et, \u00e0 son tour, ce contr\u00f4le d\u00e9pend du droit de donner des instructions et des ordres, du \u201cdroit de surveillance et de direction\u201d (Dalloz, 1909-1-135).\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il ne nous para\u00eet pas douteux que l\u2019appelant avait conserv\u00e9 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 et le droit de donner des instructions. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas acquis ce droit et l\u2019on ne saurait dire qu\u2019il exist\u00e2t un rapport de subordination entre le chauffeur et lui. Il n\u2019avait s\u00fbrement pas agr\u00e9\u00e9 le chauffeur comme son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 occasionnel ou comme un homme attach\u00e9 \u00e0 son service (Bloch v. Ordoquy)[3]. L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait tout simplement l\u2019invit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant dans sa voiture. Il ne contr\u00f4lait pas les agissements du chauffeur. La situation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente de celle o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant aurait envoy\u00e9 chercher l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans sa voiture pour le conduire directement \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019appelant. En effet, les courses faites avant de se rendre chez l\u2019appelant avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 convenues avec ce dernier, et le chauffeur conduisait l\u2019intim\u00e9 chez ses divers clients en vertu des instructions que lui avaient donn\u00e9es l\u2019appelant. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait donn\u00e9 les adresses au chauffeur, et le chauffeur y dirigea successivement la voiture conform\u00e9ment aux ordres qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7us de son ma\u00eetre habituel. Il est donc rest\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Grimaldi pour la fa\u00e7on de conduire et d\u2019\u00e9viter les accidents. (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vol. 10, vbo. Responsabilit\u00e9, n\u00b0 769). Le chauffeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 par son ma\u00eetre de conduire le m\u00e9decin \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception et chez ses patients. En cons\u00e9quence, il fallait que Restaldi fourn\u00eet au chauffeur les indications n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019il p\u00fbt le mener aux endroits pr\u00e9vus; mais Restaldi n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de donner des ordres au chauffeur. Il n\u2019a pas pris charge de la voiture ou du chauffeur. Le parcours de l\u2019auto \u00e0 travers la ville devait s\u2019accomplir dans les limites qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant lui-m\u00eame. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est laiss\u00e9 conduire suivant l\u2019invitation de l\u2019appelant et, sous tous rapports, il s\u2019en est rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 la prudence, \u00e0 l\u2019habilet\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de ce dernier. Dans les circonstances, il n\u2019y a pas eu substitution de pouvoir de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance; et l\u2019appelant est demeur\u00e9 responsable des actions de son chauffeur, qui, d\u2019ailleurs, faisait son affaire au moment de l\u2019acte dommageable (Tessier, Responsabilit\u00e9 de la puissance publique, p. 196). Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u00e9placement de responsabilit\u00e9 (Legros v. Mercadier)[4].\nNous pouvons maintenant passer au premier moyen de l\u2019appelant. La question se pr\u00e9sente de la fa\u00e7on suivante: Avant le proc\u00e8s, l\u2019appelant a fait interroger l\u2019intim\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable en vertu de l\u2019article 286 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant sans doute d\u2019avis que les faits d\u00e9voil\u00e9s dans cet examen pr\u00e9alable \u00e9tablissaient suffisamment la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant, se contenta de prouver les dommages qu\u2019il avait soufferts et n\u2019offrit aucune preuve des faits tendant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la faute du chauffeur. De consentement, cependant, deux photographies furent produites comme exhibits; et l\u2019une d\u2019elles fait voir le tunnel o\u00f9 l\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9. Sur cette photographie, on marqua d\u2019une croix le montant en acier avec lequel la voiture vint en contact. Cette indication fut faite par accord entre les deux parties. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019accident dont le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime r\u00e9sulte \u201cdu fait, de la faute, de l\u2019imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilet\u00e9 du chauffeur du d\u00e9fendeur\u201d. Il a ajout\u00e9 que, de plus, l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait \u201cpas repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption \u00e9tablie contre lui par la loi dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce\u201d.\nLes juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi furent unanimes \u00e0 \u00e9carter le moyen r\u00e9sultant de la pr\u00e9tendue pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale. Nous sommes d\u2019accord avec eux sur ce point, conform\u00e9ment, d\u2019ailleurs, \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette cour dans la cause de P\u00e9russe v. Stafford[5]. Mais la Cour du Banc du Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019avis du premier juge quant au r\u00e9sultat du proc\u00e8s. Il est vrai qu\u2019elle semble avoir appuy\u00e9 son jugement sur la th\u00e9orie de \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d. Sur ce principe, et surtout sur son application aux circonstances du pr\u00e9sent litige, nous entendons r\u00e9server notre opinion.\nMais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, suivant nous, d\u2019entrer sur ce terrain pour la solution de cette cause, car l\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable est suffisant pour conduire \u00e0 la conclusion concordante des jugements qui nous sont soumis.\nLa d\u00e9position prise en vertu de l\u2019article 286 C.P.C. doit \u201cformer partie du dossier\u201d dans la cause (Art. 288 C.P.C.). Or, cette d\u00e9position contient la preuve d\u2019aveux extrajudiciaires de l\u2019appelant dans lesquels il a admis sa responsabilit\u00e9 et la faute du chauffeur. Ces aveux \u00e9taient express\u00e9ment all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9claration; et comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019une cause o\u00f9 la preuve par t\u00e9moins est admissible, ils pouvaient donc \u00eatre prouv\u00e9s par le serment de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (Art. 1244 C.C.). Ce dernier jure que l\u2019appelant lui a admis, en pr\u00e9sence de t\u00e9moins, que l\u2019accident \u201cwas the chauffeur\u2019s fault\u201d, et que \u201che was liable * * * for the accident and its consequences \u201c.\nNous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait li\u00e9 par ces aveux au point de ne pouvoir les r\u00e9voquer lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, car le fait demeure qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas rendu t\u00e9moignage et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas contredit la version de l\u2019intim\u00e9. La preuve des aveux est rest\u00e9e au dossier avec sa pleine force et son plein effet.\nD\u2019ailleurs, nous croyons que la seule d\u00e9position pr\u00e9alable a d\u00e9voil\u00e9 suffisamment de faits pour expliquer les aveux de l\u2019appelant et pour justifier pleinement les jugements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, quoiqu\u2019ils n\u2019aient pas indiqu\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de faute particulier.\nL\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre. Il \u00e9tait environ six heures et demie du soir. Il faisait noir. Le tunnel et ses approches \u00e9taient dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 (\u201cIn the subway, I noticed that it was dark\u201d). Or, le chauffeur n\u2019avait pas allum\u00e9 les gros phares de la voiture (\u201cHe had no big lights on * * * He had his small ones\u201d). C\u2019est une pr\u00e9somption raisonnable, dans les circonstances, que, sans les projecteurs, le chauffeur ne pouvait voir les obstacles au-devant desquels il allait au moment o\u00f9 il s\u2019est engag\u00e9 dans le tunnel obscur, apr\u00e8s six heures du soir, en d\u00e9cembre. Il ne nous para\u00eet pas discutable que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0, de la part du chauffeur, une omission qui d\u00e9pendait exclusivement de lui et qui constituait une imprudence ayant un rapport direct avec l\u2019accident qui est arriv\u00e9. Il est juste de signaler que, dans sa d\u00e9claration, l\u2019intim\u00e9 en avait fait une all\u00e9gation sp\u00e9ciale de n\u00e9gligence.\nPour ces raisons, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Merrill, Stalker & McKay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mitchell, Ralston, Kearney & Duquet.\n[1] (1933) Q.R. 54 K.B. 197.\n[2] (1919) 58 Can.

C.C.\nThe general provisions of the Civil Code (Arts. 1013 et seq.) enacting certain rules of interpretation as to contracts are applicable, by analogy, to arrive at the true meaning of the clauses of a will, taking into account however the difference existing between a contract and a will. Therefore, in a will as in a contract, the real intention of the testator must first be looked for and such intention will be found by giving a fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will; and it is only when the intention is really doubtful that it is permissible to go outside the literal meaning of the words.\nThis must be the rule even if the result is that the clause in the will might thereby become inoperative. Art. 1014 C.C. applies only when the meaning of a clause is doubtful.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, D\u2019Auteuil J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action. The appellant brought an action against the respondent in order to obtain from the courts an interpretation of a certain clause of a will and there is no dispute between the parties as to the facts of the case. Marie-Louise M\u00e9tivier, widow of Narcisse Rioux, made her will in authentic form before Joseph Sirois, N.P., the 24th September, 1921. After having remembered a large number of her relatives by particular legacies in an amount exceeding $180,000, she bequeathed in equal shares the residue of her property to her niece, Marie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, wife of P. A. Parent, one of the respondents, and her two nephews, Philippe M\u00e9tivier, the appellant, and Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e the other respondent. The testatrix died December 1, 1921, and the three legatees survived her and accepted the bequest. Mrs. Parent subsequently died on December 1, 1930. Before her death she had already received from the executors a total sum of $36,430. In the antenuptial marriage contract entered into between Mrs. Parent and her husband, according to the laws of Quebec, it was provided that the surviving consort would be the universal heir of the other. The respondent Parent therefore took possession of his wife\u2019s estate including the sum of $36,430 or whatever might be left of it. The sole question at issue between the parties was whether or not Mrs. Parent took under her aunt\u2019s will as institute or grev\u00e9 de substitution. Appellant contended that she did and the respondents claimed there was no substitution created by the will and that none could be implied.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. and Chs. Fr\u00e9mont K.C. for the appellant.\nLs. St.-Laurent K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Dans cette cause, les parties ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient\npas de preuve \u00e0 faire, ni d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 ni de l\u2019autre, et (qu\u2019elles) s\u2019en remettaient \u00e0 la cour sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019acte, les faits \u00e9tant admis.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation dont il s\u2019agit a trait \u00e0 la clause XXIII du testament de Marie-Louise M\u00e9tivier, de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, veuve de M. Narcisse Rioux. Ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u devant Joseph Sirois et Ernest Labr\u00e8que, notaires, le 24 septembre 1921. Voici le texte de cette clause:\nXXIII. Je l\u00e8gue le r\u00e9sidu de tous mes biens sans exception \u00e0 ma ni\u00e8ce, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, \u00e9pouse de P.-A. Parent, de St-Ulric, \u00e0 mon neveu, Philippe M\u00e9tivier, d\u2019Algoma Mills, et \u00e0 mon neveu, Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e, de Beauport, que j\u2019institue mes l\u00e9gataires universels r\u00e9siduaires, par parts \u00e9gales entre eux. Si l\u2019un de mes l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires universels venait \u00e0 mourir avant moi, laissant des descendants l\u00e9gitimes, ceux-ci recevront sa part en son lieu et place, suivant les r\u00e8gles de la repr\u00e9sentation, mais la part de celui qui serait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans laisser de descendants appartiendra avec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s aux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires, \u00e0 titre d\u2019accroissement. Nonobstant la disposition ci-dessus, je veux qu\u2019au cas o\u00f9 Madame Parent d\u00e9c\u00e8derait sans descendants l\u00e9gitimes son mari prenne et re\u00e7oive en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 de la part de Madame Parent dans le legs universel pr\u00e9sentement fait, l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 seulement accroissant aux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires. Au cas o\u00f9 il d\u00e9c\u00e8derait sans enfant, et nonobstant encore la disposition ci-dessus, j\u2019autorise mon neveu, Philippe M\u00e9tivier, \u00e0 disposer par testament de sa part en faveur de son \u00e9pouse, lorsqu\u2019il se mariera, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de dix mille piastres, et de la balance en faveur de ses fr\u00e8res et soeurs et neveux et ni\u00e8ces. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au cas o\u00f9 mon dit neveu n\u2019aurait pas ainsi dispos\u00e9 par testament de sa part du legs universel qu\u2019il y aura accroissement en faveur de mes autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\nJe veux de plus, que mon autre neveu, Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e, puisse disposer par testament en faveur de sa femme d\u2019une somme de dix mille piastres pour les cas o\u00f9 il d\u00e9c\u00e8derait sans enfant, seul le surplus accroissant \u00e0 mes autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\nJe recommande \u00e0 ma ni\u00e8ce, Madame P.-A. Parent, de continuer les bonnes oeuvres que je fais actuellement, et qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet.\nEn vertu de cette clause, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, Philippe M\u00e9tivier et Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e sont institu\u00e9s l\u00e9gataires universels r\u00e9siduaires par parts \u00e9gales entre eux. Tous trois \u00e9taient vivants lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la testatrice. Mais, subs\u00e9quemment, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e sans laisser de descendants, et la question qui se pose est de savoir \u00e0 qui, dans les circonstances, sa part du legs universel r\u00e9siduaire doit \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9tendu que, dans ce cas, cette part appartenait pour moiti\u00e9 au mari de Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e et que l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 appartenait par parts \u00e9gales aux deux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires. Au contraire, le mari a pr\u00e9tendu que, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e ayant surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la testatrice, elle est devenue, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re, propri\u00e9taire absolue de sa part du legs universel r\u00e9siduaire et, par suite, libre d\u2019en disposer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9. Les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires intim\u00e9s ont adopt\u00e9 ce point de vue. L\u2019appelant est l\u2019un des deux col\u00e9gataires de Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, et il a institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action dans le but de faire d\u00e9cider la question ci-dessus. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi ont jug\u00e9 dans le sens des pr\u00e9tentions du mari et des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires. L\u2019appelant nous soumet que ces jugements sont erron\u00e9s et nous demande de les infirmer.\nLe code civil \u00e9dict\u00e9 certaines r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des contrats (art. 1013 et suiv.). Les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pos\u00e9es dans ces articles s\u2019appliquent, par analogie, \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des testaments, sauf \u00e0 tenir compte de la diff\u00e9rence qui s\u00e9pare le contrat du testament (R\u00e9f\u00e9rer sur ce point \u00e0 la jurisprudence et \u00e0 la doctrine cit\u00e9es dans Fuzier Herman, R\u00e9pertoire du Droit Fran\u00e7ais, vbo \u201cTestament,\u201d no 1616).\nDans tout testament, comme dans tout contrat, on doit d\u2019abord rechercher l\u2019intention des parties. Cette intention doit se d\u00e9duire du sens des \u201ctermes\u201d du contrat ou du testament (art. 1013 C.C. Carter v. Montreal Trust Co. & Goldstein[1]). Ce n\u2019est que si l\u2019intention est douteuse que l\u2019on doit s\u2019\u00e9carter du sens litt\u00e9ral des mots. Pothier, dans son Trait\u00e9 des Donations Testamentaires, au chapitre VII, \u201cDe l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des legs\u201d, pose la r\u00e8gle suivante\n357. R\u00e8gle II. Il ne faut pas n\u00e9anmoins s\u2019\u00e9carter de la signification propre des termes du testament, s\u2019il n\u2019y a de justes raisons de croire que le testateur les a entendus dans un autre sens que leur sens naturel; non aliter \u00e0 significatione verborum recedi opportet, qu\u00e0m c\u00f9m manifestum est aliud sersisse testatorem.\nC\u2019est, en somme, ce que le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 re Auger v. Beaudry[2]:\nThe only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will.\nAppliquant ces principes \u00e0 la clause XXIII, voici la signification qui en r\u00e9sulte:\nLe r\u00e9sidu de tous les biens, sans exception, est l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la testatrice, par parts \u00e9gales entre eux, \u00e0 Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, Philippe M\u00e9tivier et Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e.\nSi tous trois sont vivants lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la testatrice, chacun d\u2019eux recueille sa part et en devient propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9finitif. C\u2019est l\u00e0 la disposition principale. Tout ce qui suit est subsidiaire et ne prend effet que si l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des l\u00e9gataires universels ne recueille pas sa part par suite de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de la testatrice.\nSi l\u2019un de ces l\u00e9gataires vient \u00e0 mourir avant la testatrice, laissant des descendants l\u00e9gitimes, ceux-ci re\u00e7oivent la part du l\u00e9gataire d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en son lieu et place et suivant les r\u00e8gles de la repr\u00e9sentation.\nSi l\u2019un de ces l\u00e9gataires vient \u00e0 mourir avant la testatrice sans laisser de descendants, \u201cla part de celui qui serait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9\u201d appartiendra aux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires \u201c\u00e0 titre d\u2019accroissement,\u201d mais \u201cavec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d:\nSi c\u2019est Madame Parent (Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e) qui est ainsi d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e sans descendants, son mari re\u00e7oit en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 de la part de Madame Parent dans le legs universel; \u201cl\u2019autre moiti\u00e9 seulement accroissant aux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\u201d\nSi c\u2019est Philippe M\u00e9tivier qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, une partie de sa part \u201cjusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de dix mille piastres\u201d ira \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, et la balance \u00e0 ses fr\u00e8res et soeurs, et neveux et ni\u00e8ces, pourvu qu\u2019il en ait dispos\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on par testament. S\u2019il n\u2019en a pas ainsi dispos\u00e9 par testament, \u201cil y aura accroissement en faveur (des) autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\u201d\nSi c\u2019est Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans enfant, une partie de sa part ira \u00e0 sa femme (jusqu\u2019\u00e0 dix mille piastres), pourvu qu\u2019il en ait ainsi dispos\u00e9 par testament en faveur de cette derni\u00e8re; \u201cseul le surplus accroissant (aux,) autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires.\u201d\nC\u2019est l\u00e0, suivant nous, le seul sens que la clause XXIII peut avoir, si l\u2019on donne un emploi \u00e0 tous les mots qui s\u2019y trouvent et si l\u2019on donne \u00e0 ces mots leur sens usuel et litt\u00e9ral. Dans ces conditions, les pr\u00e9tentions des intim\u00e9s sont exactes et les jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi doivent \u00eatre maintenus.\nLa clause est form\u00e9e d\u2019une disposition principale: le legs universel \u00e0 trois l\u00e9gataires nomm\u00e9s; et d\u2019une disposition subsidiaire avec \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d ou restrictions sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es qui pourvoit aux conditions dans lesquelles s\u2019op\u00e9rera le droit d\u2019accroissement.\nPour donner raison \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, il faudrait que l\u2019on interpr\u00e9t\u00e2t les trois \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d ou restrictions comme \u00e9tant des dispositions distinctes et ind\u00e9pendantes de la disposition subsidiaire. Or, ces restrictions ne sont pas ind\u00e9pendantes et distinctes de la disposition subsidiaire. Elles sont reli\u00e9es \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re et elles y sont incorpor\u00e9es par les mots \u201cavec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d qui s\u2019y trouvent, par le mot \u201cnonobstant\u201d qui est r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 dans chacune des \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d relatives \u00e0 Madame Parent et \u00e0 Philippe M\u00e9tivier, et par les mots \u201cde plus\u201d dans la \u201cr\u00e9serve\u201d relative \u00e0 Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e. Traiter ces restrictions comme distinctes de la disposition d\u2019accroissement, ainsi que le veut l\u2019appelant, aurait pour effet d\u2019\u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement tous ces mots et de lire la clause enti\u00e8re comme s\u2019ils ne s\u2019y trouvaient pas. Ce serait aller formellement \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des r\u00e8gles que nous venons de voir concernant l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des contrats et des legs.\nCe serait, en plus, imposer \u00e0 la clause XXIII une intention que, \u00e9videmment, elle n\u2019a pas. En effet, il serait inexact de dire que les deux col\u00e9gataires de Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e recevront sa part dans tous les cas o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9c\u00e8derait sans descendants l\u00e9gitimes. La seule partie de la clause qui attribue cette part aux deux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires est celle o\u00f9 il est dit:\nMais la part de celui qui serait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 sans laisser de descendants appartiendra avec les r\u00e9serves, ci-apr\u00e8s, aux autres l\u00e9gataires r\u00e9siduaires \u00e0 titre d\u2019accroissement.\nEt cette disposition ne prend effet que moyennant trois conditions expresses:\n(1) Que Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e meure avant la testatrice (\u201cavant moi\u201d);\n(2) Que ce soit \u201c\u00e0 titre d\u2019accroissement\u201d;\n(3) Que cet \u201caccroissement\u201d se produise seulement \u201cavec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d.\nIl n\u2019y a donc pas droit d\u2019accroissement absolu. C\u2019est un droit d\u2019accroissement \u201cavec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d.\nLes \u201cr\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d sont des conditions impos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019existence m\u00eame du droit d\u2019accroissement. Ce sont des restrictions au droit d\u2019accroissement; ce ne sont pas des restrictions au legs initial. Ces mots: \u201cavec les r\u00e9serves ci-apr\u00e8s\u201d ont pour effet d\u2019ins\u00e9rer dans la disposition subsidiaire, \u00e0 titre d\u2019exception, chacune des restrictions subs\u00e9- . quentes, lesquelles, par le fait m\u00eame, sont incorpor\u00e9es dans cette disposition subsidiaire. Ces exceptions sont donc n\u00e9cessairement subordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 la condition essentielle qui est que l\u2019un des col\u00e9gataires universels r\u00e9siduaires (ou, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e) \u201cd\u00e9c\u00e9derait\u201d avant la testatrice et sans laisser de descendants. Ce n\u2019est que dans ce cas que l\u2019accroissement prend effet en faveur des autres col\u00e9gataires et ce n\u2019est donc \u00e9galement que dans ce cas qu\u2019il peut y avoir lieu de tenir compte des exceptions. D\u00e8s que chaque l\u00e9gataire universel, ou, pour le cas actuel, d\u00e8s que Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e a surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la testatrice, elle a ipso facto eu la saisine de son legs universel; il n\u2019y avait plus lieu \u00e0 accroissement; et les cas particuliers de r\u00e9serves ou d\u2019exceptions ne pouvaient plus se pr\u00e9senter. En d\u2019autres termes: L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nement suppos\u00e9 dans la disposition subsidiaire, \u00e0 savoir: le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l\u2019un des l\u00e9gataires universels avant la testatrice, n\u2019ayant pas eu lieu, cette disposition est devenue inop\u00e9rante; et, comme cons\u00e9quence, les \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d ou restrictions sont tomb\u00e9es avec elle.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9tendu qui si l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te ainsi la clause XXIII, il en r\u00e9sultera que l\u2019autorisation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Philippe M\u00e9tivier et \u00e0 Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e de disposer par testament d\u2019une partie de leur part serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 1061 du code civil qui d\u00e9fend de faire une\nstipulation sur * * * une succession non ouverte * * * except\u00e9 par contrat de mariage.\nPour le moment, nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer sur la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de ces \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d ou restrictions. Il ne serait pas juste d\u2019exprimer une opinion sur ce point, au sujet duquel le litige ne s\u2019est pas engag\u00e9 et o\u00f9 les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues. Nous nous contentons de dire ceci\u2014car c\u2019est tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9cider la cause actuelle: Il faut interpr\u00e9ter la volont\u00e9 de la testatrice conform\u00e9ment aux termes qu\u2019elle a employ\u00e9s dans son testament, d\u00fbt cette interpr\u00e9tation entra\u00eener l\u2019annulation des stipulations ou \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d sp\u00e9ciales qui concernent Philippe M\u00e9tivier et Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e (Cass. D. 67-1-30). Il en r\u00e9sulterait simplement que ces conditions particuli\u00e8res du testament seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme non \u00e9crites (art. 760 C.C.).\nL\u2019appelant nous a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1014 du code civil et a fait observer qu\u2019on doit plut\u00f4t entendre une disposition dans le sens\navec lequel elle peut avoir quelque effet que dans le sens avec lequel elle ne pourrait en avoir aucun.\nNous r\u00e9p\u00e9tons que nous ne nous pronon\u00e7ons pas sur la question de savoir si l\u2019autorisation de tester accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Philippe M\u00e9tivier et \u00e0 Alphonse Larriv\u00e9e peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme valide. Il suffit de dire que la r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 1014 C.C., et que l\u2019appelant invoque, s\u2019applique seulement \u201clorsqu\u2019une clause est susceptible de deux sens\u201d. Elle ne s\u2019applique donc pas ici. La volont\u00e9 de la testatrice a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on qui n\u2019est pas douteuse. S\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019une partie des stipulations qu\u2019elle a volontairement ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans son testament ne peut recevoir son ex\u00e9cution, parce que la loi le d\u00e9fend, cela n\u2019est pas une raison, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, pour modifier l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intention qu\u2019elle a exprim\u00e9e. En ce qui concerne le cas de Madame Parent, qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige, la disposition n\u2019est pas susceptible de deux sens; et, en plus, elle peut avoir tout son effet sans se heurter \u00e0 aucun article du code. (Voir les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour de R\u00e9vision dans les causes de: Montreal Canada Fire Insurance Company v. Richmond & al.[3], et Lemarier & al v. Corporation de Ste-Ang\u00e8le[4]:\nQuand un texte est pr\u00e9cis, ne pr\u00eate \u00e0 aucune \u00e9quivoque, il ne faut pas en \u00e9luder la lettre sous pr\u00e9texte d\u2019en p\u00e9n\u00e9trer l\u2019esprit.\nLe raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de acquiert encore plus de force par suite de l\u2019emploi, dans la disposition subsidiaire et dans chacune des \u201cr\u00e9serves\u201d, du mot \u201caccroissement\u201d. C\u2019est un mot dont le sens est pr\u00e9cis dans le code et dont la port\u00e9e est bien connue dans le droit civil. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est employ\u00e9 dans un document authentique re\u00e7u devant des notaires qui en connaissaient exactement la signification et qui, nous en sommes certains, appr\u00e9ciaient toutes les cons\u00e9quences du terme qu\u2019ils ont choisi. Le droit d\u2019accroissement est celui en vertu duquel des coh\u00e9ritiers ou des col\u00e9gataires recueillent comme venant se r\u00e9unir aux leurs les parts de ceux de leurs col\u00e9gataires qui ne peuvent les recueillir ou qui y renoncent. En ce qui concerne Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Larriv\u00e9e, l\u2019accroissement ne pouvait exister que dans le cas o\u00f9 elle n\u2019aurait pas recueilli sa part par suite du fait qu\u2019elle serait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e avant la testatrice. Elle a surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 la testatrice; et, en vertu des termes du testament et de la loi, elle a eu la saisine de sa part. A partir de ce moment, le mot \u201caccroissement\u201d, tel qu\u2019il est employ\u00e9 au code et dans le sens bien connu qu\u2019il a dans le droit civil, n\u2019\u00e9tait plus un terme appropri\u00e9 pour indiquer une disposition telle que la sugg\u00e8re l\u2019appelant. Au contraire, il est un terme \u00e9minemment propre \u00e0 exprimer la disposition telle que nous l\u2019interpr\u00e9tons, \u00e0 laquelle il s\u2019adapte parfaitement.\nPour ces raisons, l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guay & Fr\u00e9mont.\nSolicitors for the respondents: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\n[1] 63 Can.

Mathieu v. Martin, supra, foll.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Fortier J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s contestation.\nThe appellant, Ferdinand D\u2019Amours, having obtained judgment against L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours personally, seized in execution all the goods belonging to the company mise-en-cause, to which L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours had previously sold and transferred his manufacturing plant as a going concern, on condition that it would pay his debts. But, previous to that seizure, the company had borrowed moneys by issuing debentures and had hypothecated in a trust deed all its goods as warranty. The respondent Darveau, as trustee of the debenture holders, filed an opposition to annul the appellant\u2019s seizure and claimed possession of the goods seized. The appellant contested the opposition on the ground that the sale of the stock in trade by L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours to the company, being a bulk sale, was null for the reason that the formalities required by arts. 1569 (a) and seq. C.C. had not been complied with.\nAlex. Michaud K.C. for the appellant.\nR. Taschereau K.C. and P. Rousseau for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket J. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The ground upon which in my opinion this appeal should be dismissed can be stated very shortly.\nThe cardinal question appears to be whether chapter 9 (a) (arts. 1569 (a) to (d) C.C.) applies to a transaction such as that impeached in this litigation. By that transaction L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours sold to L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et Fils, Lt\u00e9e.,\n(1) Certain lands described;\n(2) Tout le roulant du fonds de commerce et toutes les marchandises en mains, contrats en cours, comptes et billets recevables;\n(3) His goodwill; and\n(4) Certain specified patent rights.\nIt is provided by the deed that the purchaser shall pay the liabilities of L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours. The consideration consists in this undertaking and the issue to L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours of virtually the whole of the capital stock of the purchasing company.\nThis is not, it seems to me, a transaction of the character contemplated by chapter 9 (a). The language of arts. 1569 (a) and (b) point to the conclusion that the transactions in view are only those of a very simple character,\u2014those, probably, in which there is a \u201cpurchase price\u201d in the strict sense, that is, a price in money. The provisions of the succeeding articles tend strongly to confirm this view of the scope of the chapter. It would be extremely difficult indeed to apply art. 1569 (d) in any other case than a case of sale for money. This would be particularly difficult in a transaction such as that before us where the whole of the consideration consists in the issue of shares to the seller and an undertaking to pay the liabilities of the seller. Such a case is, I think, outside the scope of the chapter.\nIn truth, where the contract of transfer imposes upon the purchaser the obligation to pay the debts of the seller, it, in itself, virtually arms the creditors of the seller with the chief practical redress given by the statute. In other words, such a transaction does not appear to fall within the mischief the chapter aims to correct.\nThis is the view expressed by Mr. Justice Rinfret in his judgment in Mathieu v. Martin[2], with which I entirely agree.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Smith and Cannon JJ. and Rivard J. ad hoc was delivered by\nRivard J. ad hoc.\u2014(Saisie mobili\u00e8re et immobili\u00e8re de la part de Ferdinand D\u2019Amours, en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement prononc\u00e9 contre L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours.\u2014Opposition afin d\u2019annuler par Henri Darveau en qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire pour les porteurs des obligations \u00e9mises par la compagnie L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et fils limit\u00e9e.\u2014Contestation par le demandeur saisissant, maintenue par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, rejet\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\u2014Appel \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, interjet\u00e9 par le demandeur-contestant.)\nLe 28 novembre 1928, par acte notari\u00e9, L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours, un n\u00e9gociant, avait vendu \u00e0 la compagnie L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et fils limit\u00e9e, pr\u00e9sente mise-en-cause, divers immeubles lui appartenant, y compris les constructions, usines, machines, machineries et accessoires qui s\u2019y trouvaient, de m\u00eame que ses droits dans certains brevets \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, et \u201ctout le roulant de son fonds de commerce et toutes les marchandises en mains, contrats en cours, comptes et billets recevables\u201d, avec \u201cl\u2019achalandage dudit fonds de commerce\u201d; cette vente avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour le prix de $99,000, pay\u00e9 par la livraison de 990 actions acquitt\u00e9es de la compagnie, dont quittance, et \u201c\u00e0 la charge par l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de payer et acquitter, pour et \u00e0 l\u2019acquit du vendeur, tous les comptes et billets payables dus par ledit sieur L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours * * *\u201d La compagnie L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et fils limit\u00e9e, constitu\u00e9e en corporation par lettres-patentes du 1er ao\u00fbt 1928, avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie pour acqu\u00e9rir les biens de L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et continuer son commerce. En effet, la vente du 28 novembre 1928 comprenait tout l\u2019actif de L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours, fonds de commerce, immeubles, droits et cr\u00e9ances; et, d\u2019autre part, la compagnie se chargeait de tout le passif du vendeur, y compris la cr\u00e9ance, dont le recouvrement est poursuivi par le pr\u00e9sent appelant, Ferdinand D\u2019Amours, et qui est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la vente du 28 novembre 1928.\nCependant, la compagnie L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours et fils limit\u00e9e avait \u00e9mis des obligations, garanties en la mani\u00e8re ordinaire par un acte de fiducie sur ses biens, y compris ceux qu\u2019elle avait acquis de L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours; et la compagnie ayant fait d\u00e9faut de rencontrer ses paiements, s\u2019\u00e9tant m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9e insolvable, l\u2019intim\u00e9 Darveau avait, en sa qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire, pris possession, le 20 juillet 1930, de tout l\u2019actif mobilier et immobilier de la compagnie. Et, quand le demandeur-appelant, Ferdinand D\u2019Amours, eut fait saisir les biens en ex\u00e9cution de son jugement contre L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours, l\u2019intim\u00e9 Darveau, invoquant l\u2019acte de fiducie et ses droits de fiduciaire, fit \u00e0 la saisie une opposition afin d\u2019annuler, dont la contestation par l\u2019appelant, maintenue en premi\u00e8re instance et rejet\u00e9e en appel, est maintenant soumise au jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure avait maintenue la contestation, pour la raison que la vente par L\u00e9on D\u2019Amours \u00e0 la compagnie constituait une vente en bloc aux termes des articles 1569A et suivants du code civil et que, n\u2019\u00e9tant pas accompagn\u00e9e de l\u2019affidavit requis, cette vente \u00e9tait nulle.\nLa m\u00eame contestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, en appel, par le motif que les articles 1569A et suivants du code civil ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00e0 la vente en bloc d\u2019un fonds de commerce dont l\u2019acheteur se charge de payer les dettes, et que les dispositions de ces articles ne s\u2019adaptent pas au cas d\u2019une vente de l\u2019actif \u00e0 charge du passif.\nDeux des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e9taient d\u2019opinion que la vente du 28 novembre 1928 devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme une vente en bloc au sens des articles 1569A et suivants du code civil quant \u00e0 ce qui constituait, dans les biens vendus, le fonds de commerce et les marchandises; ils n\u2019auraient apparemment d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019opposition fond\u00e9e que pour le reste; il semble donc que le jugement, qui rejette la contestation en son entier, ne soit pas une d\u00e9cision unanime de tous les juges d\u2019appel. Cependant, aucune dissidence n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e, et le motif ci-dessus rapport\u00e9 est le seul qui se trouve au jugement formel. C\u2019est aussi le seul auquel s\u2019attaque l\u2019appelant.\nLes articles 1569A et suivants s\u2019appliquent-ils \u00e0 la vente en bloc, quand l\u2019acheteur s\u2019est charg\u00e9 du passif? C\u2019est l\u00e0 le seul point \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans cette cause, dit-il. Il n\u2019y en a pas d\u2019autre.\nIl y en a d\u2019autres, mais celui-l\u00e0 suffit, en effet.\nLe chapitre de la vente en bloc, ajout\u00e9 au code civil par la loi I Geo. V, c. 39, et qui se compose des articles 1569A \u00e0 1569E, a pour objet d\u2019ouvrir en faveur des cr\u00e9anciers un recours de la nature de l\u2019action paulienne, mais qui n\u2019est pas assujetti aux conditions des articles 1033 et suivants C.C.\nL\u2019art. 1569A C.C. dit d\u2019abord ce qu\u2019il entendre par vente en bloc, en vue des dispositions qui suivent: c\u2019est toute vente ou tout transport de fonds de commerce ou de marchandises, en dehors du cours ordinaire des op\u00e9rations commerciales du vendeur.\nSuivent les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 cette sorte de vente:\n1569B: L\u2019acheteur doit, avant de payer le prix, en partie ou en totalit\u00e9, obtenir du vendeur une d\u00e9claration asserment\u00e9e des cr\u00e9anciers du vendeur et de la somme due \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux, ainsi que de la nature des cr\u00e9ances.\n1569C: Si une partie quelconque du prix d\u2019achat est pay\u00e9, sans que cet affidavit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu, la vente est\nr\u00e9put\u00e9e frauduleuse et, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des cr\u00e9anciers du vendeur, nulle et de nul effet, \u00e0 moins que tous les cr\u00e9anciers du vendeur ne soient pay\u00e9s en entier \u00e0 m\u00eame le produit de cette vente.\n1569D: Si l\u2019affidavit a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu, deux alternatives sont pr\u00e9vues: a) ou bien l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur se conforme aux indications que comporte cette d\u00e9claration: alors, il doit payer \u00e0 chacun des cr\u00e9anciers indiqu\u00e9s la somme qui lui est due, si le prix de vente est assez \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser tous, et sinon, une proportion d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le rapport de chaque cr\u00e9ance \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 du prix d\u2019achat; b) ou bien l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur ne se conforme pas \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle: il est alors personnellement responsable, envers les cr\u00e9anciers indiqu\u00e9s, des sommes port\u00e9es en regard de leurs noms respectifs. Il est ind\u00e9niable que la vente en bloc, non accompagn\u00e9e de l\u2019affidavit requis par l\u2019art. 1569B C.C., n\u2019est pas nulle de plein droit, est annulable seulement, et que son annulation doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e par l\u2019autorit\u00e9 judiciaire (cf. Mathieu vs Martin[3]; Ramsay vs Turcotte[4]; Montreal Abattoirs vs Picotte[5]; Benoit vs Dieulefet[6].). Pareille vente doit-elle \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e frauduleuse, quand elle ne comporte aucune fraude dont le cr\u00e9ancier puisse souffrir, lorsqu\u2019elle a pour cons\u00e9quence exactement le r\u00e9sultat que la loi a voulu lui faire produire, et qu\u2019elle \u00e9vite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu pr\u00e9venir?

En ce cas, la loi veut que leur droit d\u2019\u00eatre pay\u00e9s \u00e0 m\u00eame cet actif soit sauvegard\u00e9, soit qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019affidavit la vente puisse \u00eatre annul\u00e9e et que l\u2019actif retombe dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur, soit que l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur les paye sur le prix de son achat ou qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut il devienne personnellement tenu d\u2019acquitter les dettes du vendeur.\nCette derni\u00e8re alternative est, pour les cr\u00e9anciers, la plus favorable de toutes: ils gardent leur recours contre le d\u00e9biteur originaire, ils en acqui\u00e8rent un nouveau; ils peuvent exercer leurs droits sur les biens vendus et de plus sur les autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur.

Sankey v. The King ([1927] S.C.R. 436) foll. and Rex v. Seabrooke (58 C.C.C. 323) ref.\nDetermination of any question raised as to the voluntary character of a statement by an accused elicited by interrogatories administered by police officers is not a mere matter of discretion for the trial judge. Where such a statement is elicited in the presence of several officers, the statement ought, as a rule, not to be admitted unless (in the absence of some adequate explanation of their absence) those who were present are produced by the Crown as witnesses, at least for cross-examination on behalf of the accused; and, where the statement professes to give the substance of a report of oral answers given by the accused to interrogatories, without reproducing the questions, then the written report ought not to be admitted in evidence unless the person who is responsible for its compilation is (here again in the absence of some adequate explanation of his absence) called as a witness.\nUpon the evidence, although the document was read over to the appellant before he signed it, it was not, in one most important particular, a correct statement of what the accused appellant said and intended to say. Moreover the statement made by the accused in this case contained a declaration that he had been once arrested \u201cfor a fight * * * and I had paid the costs.\u201d The fact that the accused had been arrested for a criminal offence and had paid \u201cthe costs\u201d could not be competent evidence\u2014not only on the ground that the fact itself would be in law wholly irrelevant, but on account of the unfair prejudice to the accused which would be the likely effect of the reception of evidence of it; and a document professing to embody admissions obtained as the admissions of the accused were in this case, which included a record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible against him, and which was calculated to prejudice him, could not properly be received in evidence. It might in a proper case be used by a witness to refresh his memory; but the use of the document itself as evidence could not be justified.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upon leave to appeal granted by this Court[1], sustaining the conviction of the appellant, on his trial before Lalibert\u00e9 J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The grounds of appeal, and the material facts of the case bearing on the points dealt with by this Court, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed; the conviction was quashed, and a new trial ordered.\nLucien Gendron K.C. and Leopold Pinsonnault for the appellant.\nV. Bienvenue K.C. and P. Bigu\u00eb K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014This appeal raises a question as to the admissibility in evidence, upon the appellant\u2019s trial for murder, of a statement in writing alleged to have been made by him to certain officers of the provincial police of Quebec.\nThe indictment charged\nQue le ou vers le 4 mars 1932., en la paroisse de Ste.-Th\u00e8cle, district des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Donat Thiffault, de la dite paroisse de Ste-Th\u00e8cle, dit district, s\u2019est rendu coupable de l\u2019acte criminel qualifi\u00e9 meurtre, en mettant et faisant mettre volontairement le feu \u00e0 sa maison d\u2019habitation, dans la dite paroisse de Ste-Th\u00e8cle, laquelle maison fut incendi\u00e9e, avec l\u2019intention de causer la mort de Bertha Gervais, son \u00e9pouse, et en causant par l\u00e0 effectivement la mort de la dite Bertha Gervais, sa dite \u00e9pouse, qui. mourut dans le dit incendie. Le tout sans justification ni excuse et contrairement au code criminel canadien et ses amendements.\nAs we have come to the conclusion that there must be a new trial, our references to the facts will be limited to such as appear to be necessary to make clear the considerations affecting the points in dispute.\nThe appellant, at the time of the burning of his house on the night of the 3rd and 4th of March, 1932, was living alone in the house with his wife and one of his sons. His wife was sleeping upstairs. It was an important part of the case for the Crown that the fire which caused her death did not originate in the wood stove in the first story or in the furnace in the cellar. Witnesses were called who stated that the cellar was cold and that it was evident that the furnace had not been heated that night. There was a fire of no importance in the wood box beside the stove in the first storey, but that was easily and quickly extinguished. The fire in which Mrs. Thiffault lost her life in the second storey was, the Crown contended, and witnesses deposed, an independent fire which had originated in that storey where there was no stove or other heating apparatus.\nThe evidence adduced by the Crown consisted very largely of accounts of various instances of suspicious conduct and of incriminating statements of the accused himself. These, the Crown contended, pointed to a determination to burn the house in order to collect the insurance money and to get rid of his wife. A good deal was made of an incident in which his wife was said to have charged him with attempting to get her to drink ether. Much was also made of a conversation which was alleged to be, in effect, a proposal of marriage by the accused a few days before the fire accompanied by a prediction that he would soon be a widower.\nIn view of the nature of the case made by the Crown, the written statement received in evidence was plainly calculated to incriminate the appellant as shewing that he had given a false account of the origin of the fire, and as admitting that he entertained projects of marriage soon after his wife\u2019s death and that he was about to leave the province when he was detained by the police. The admission that the house which he had insured for $1,500 was bought for $800 and that he had received $3,500 as the result of a fire two years before was also gravely compromising, in view of the evidence adduced by the Crown of conversations in which he had spoken of insurance as a very useful thing and had said that his brother had profited by insurance to the extent of $16,000.\nThe text of the document objected to is as follows:\nMa femme \u00e9tait couch\u00e9e en haut, dans la nuit du 3 au 4 mars 1932, ainsi que mon fils Florent Thiffault. Je me suis aper\u00e7u du feu vers 1.00 hr. du matin. La boucane m\u2019a r\u00e9veill\u00e9, j\u2019ai travers\u00e9 de ma chambre \u00e0 la cuisine et j\u2019ai ouvert la porte pour crier: \u201cAu feu\u201d. En partant pour monter en haut, mon gar\u00e7on est tomb\u00e9 en bas dans l\u2019escalier, je l\u2019ai ramass\u00e9 dans l\u2019escalier et jet\u00e9 dehors. Il avait une \u00e9paule d\u00e9manch\u00e9e et la t\u00eate fendue. Le Dr. Aubin en a pris soin. C\u2019est le seul qui \u00e9tait couch\u00e9 en haut. Un nomm\u00e9 Magnan est arriv\u00e9 avec un extincteur. Quand on a vu qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas sauver en haut, nous avons sauv\u00e9 le m\u00e9nage en bas. J\u2019ai achet\u00e9 un gallon d\u2019\u00e9ther \u00e0 Shawinigan mais je ne connais pas qui me l\u2019a vendu. Mon \u00e9pouse a fait analyser l\u2019\u00e9ther par le Dr. Aubin de Ste-Th\u00e8cle. Le soir du feu, je suis all\u00e9 chez Magnan (Charles). (Je veux parler de la soir\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le feu), je suis entr\u00e9 chez Anselme Baril et Philom\u00e8ne B\u00e9land, vers 6.30 ou 7 hrs. je suis parti vers 9 hrs. moins quart. Ensuite je suis all\u00e9 chez Davidson, le barbier, j\u2019ai veill\u00e9 l\u00e0 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10.30 avec Alexandre Moisan. L\u00e0, je suis parti \u00e0 la maison.\nLa cause du feu est un feu de fournaise, la fournaise chauffait au bois. Le feu \u00e9tait pris le long du tuyau en montant. La dimension de la maison en dehors 26 pieds carr\u00e9s, en bas de la maison il y avait 4 appartements. En haut, 4 appartements et un passage.\nJ\u2019ai retir\u00e9 $1,500.00 d\u2019assurances sur la maison et $1,700.00 sur le m\u00e9nage. J\u2019\u00e9tais assur\u00e9 pour le feu par M. A. I. Gravel, de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. L\u2019assurance a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par M. Arthur Guillemette, de Ste-Th\u00e8cle. J\u2019\u00e9tais assur\u00e9 depuis quatre ans. \u00c7a fait un an que j\u2019ai cette maison et j\u2019ai continu\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les assurances pour le feu. J\u2019ai pay\u00e9 la maison $800.00 et elle \u00e9tait assur\u00e9e pour $1,500.00 J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 au feu \u00e0 Ste-Th\u00e8cle il y a 2 ans; j\u2019ai re\u00e7u $3,500.00 d\u2019assurances. J\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 assur\u00e9 par M. M. Guillemette et Gravel. Je n\u2019ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour vol ni pour vente de boisson; j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 une fois pour bataille \u00e0 Harvey Jonction et j\u2019ai pay\u00e9 les frais. Je n\u2019ai jamais propos\u00e9 \u00e0 une femme que nous pourrions nous marier prochainement alors que ma femme vivait. Personne n\u2019a bris\u00e9 de vitres ou enfonc\u00e9 la porte pour entrer dans la maison lors du feu alors que j\u2019\u00e9tais dans la cuisine. Je devais rencontrer Mme Emile Comeau, le 21 juillet, pour question de mariage mais quand j\u2019ai vu le d\u00e9tective \u00e0 Ste-Th\u00e8cle, j\u2019ai vu qu\u2019il se brassait quelque chose et je ne me suis pas rendu chez Mme Comeau et j\u2019avais d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de partir pour Hertz, Ontario, le 25 juillet; je n\u2019ai pas mis mon projet \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution parce que la police est venu me chercher. C\u2019est moi qui ai fait du feu dans la fournaise le dernier et il \u00e9tait environ 10.30 p.m. j\u2019ai fait un feu de bois et la fournaise \u00e9tait dans la cave. Un \u201cdrum\u201d \u00e0 gazoline servait de fournaise, et je ne suis pas descendu dans la cave entre minuit et une heure; je n\u2019ai pas entendu crier ni plaindre ni ma femme ni mon fils, et j\u2019ai sign\u00e9. The circumstances in which the document was procured are these: The coroner on the adjournment of the inquest on the 23rd of July directed Mitchell, a provincial constable, to arrest and detain the accused as a material witness. The accused was, accordingly, taken into custody at Ste. Th\u00e9cle and was conducted by Tremblay, the deputy chief of detectives, accompanied by Mitchell, to Quebec. He was there detained at the quarters of the provincial police until the following morning, when, in the presence of Tremblay and Mitchell and one Chouinard, a clerk, he was interrogated by the chief of detectives Lemire. It is quite evident, from the record made, that Lemire\u2019s questions were directed, not only to ascertaining the connection of the accused with the fire in which his wife lost her life, but also to obtaining admissions of damaging facts in his past history. It was obviously on the face of it an interrogation for the purpose of procuring admissions which could be used in evidence against the accused. A record of what the accused said was drawn up by Chouinard as the examination proceeded, and this was afterwards read over to the accused, who signed it.\nAlthough the summary compiled by Chouinard and signed by Thiffault is expressed in the first person, it is not a verbatim report of what occurred. The questions are not given and the summary could only be, at best, on the face of it, a statement of Chouinard\u2019s interpretation of the substance of the answers to the interrogatories administered.\nThere are two decisive objections to the admission of the document.\nFirst, the evidence points to the conclusion that, although the document was read over to him before he signed it, it is not a correct statement of what the accused said and intended to say. Admittedly, there is one most serious error. It was part of the Crown\u2019s case against him that he had procured ether for the purpose of putting into effect some noxious design against his wife. Being interrogated as regards his possession of ether, his answer was that he had bought, as he thought, whisky, and had discovered afterwards that they had given him ether. The signed statement not only disregards the explanation, but converts the explanation into an admission that he had purchased ether \u2014an admission most material to support the case for the Crown. In view of this admitted mis-statement of what the accused had said, it seems to us to be quite plain that the document containing it ought not to have been admitted, at all events in the absence of explanation by Chouinard, who had compiled it.\nThere is a cognate objection which, apart from everything else, seems to establish the inadmissibility of the document. It contains a declaration that the accused had been once arrested \u201cpour bataille * * * et j\u2019ai pay\u00e9 les frais.\u201d The fact that the accused had been arrested for a criminal offence and had paid \u201cles frais\u201d could, of course, not be competent evidence\u2014not only on the ground that the fact itself would be in law wholly irrelevant, but on account of the unfair prejudice to the accused which would be the likely effect of the reception of evidence of it; and we think that a document professing to embody admissions obtained as the admissions of the accused were, which includes a record of an admission of a fact that would be inadmissible against him, and which was calculated to prejudice him, could not properly be received in evidence. It, no doubt, might in a proper case be used by a witness to refresh his memory; but the use of the document itself as evidence could not be justified.\nThe second objection is on the ground that the voluntary character of the statement signed by the accused has not been established. The law governing the decision on the point raised by this objection was stated in a judgment of this Court in Sankey v. The King[2], in the course of which it was said,\nWe feel, however, that we should not part from this case without expressing our view that the proof of the voluntary character of the accused\u2019s statement to the police, which was put in evidence against him, is most unsatisfactory. That statement, put in writing by the police officer, was obtained only upon a fourth questioning to which the accused was subjected on the day following his arrest. Three previous attempts to lead him to \u201ctalk\u201d had apparently proved abortive\u2014why, we are left to surmise. The accused, a young Indian, could neither read nor write. No particulars are vouchsafed as to what transpired at any of the three previous \u201cinterviews\u201d; and but meagre details are given of the process by which the written statement ultimately signed by the appellant was obtained. We think that the police officer who obtained that statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the occasions when he \u201cinterviewed\u201d the prisoner; and, if another policeman was present, as the defendant swore at the trial, his evidence should have been adduced before the statement was received in evidence. With all the facts before him, the learned judge should form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made \u201c voluntarily and freely.\u201d\nIt should always be borne in mind that while, on the one hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible, on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from the accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Crown. (The King v. Bellos[3]; Presko v. The King[4]. That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely and voluntarily.\nThis judgment was applied, and rightly applied we think, by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Seabrooke[5]. It results from this statement of the law that the determination of any question raised as to the voluntary character of a statement by the accused elicited by interrogatories administered by the police is not a mere matter of discretion for the trial judge, as the court below appears to have thought. Where such a statement is elicited in the presence of several officers, the statement ought, as a rule, not to be admitted unless (in the absence of some adequate explanation of their absence) those who were present are produced by the Crown as witnesses, at least for cross-examination on behalf of the accused; and, where the statement professes to give the substance of a report of oral answers given by the accused to interrogatories, without reproducing the questions, then the written report ought not to be admitted in evidence unless the person who is responsible for its compilation is (here again in the absence of some adequate explanation of his absence) called as a witness.\nIn the present case there are exceptionally powerful reasons for applying these rules strictly. The Deputy Chief of Detectives Tremblay who accompanied the accused from Ste. Th\u00e8cle with Mitchell and was present throughout the interrogatories was not produced. Mitchell was called but only after the document had been admitted. No explanation is proffered of the absence of Tremblay. As to the clerk Chouinard, it was especially important that his evidence should be before the court, because, first, as already observed, the statement written by him was in reality a summary of what he judged to be the substance of the answers given by the accused; and second, because of the proved inaccuracy of the statement in one most important particular.\nWe can entertain no doubt that, upon the principle elucidated in the judgment of this Court in Sankey v. The King (1), the admission of this document cannot be supported.\nWe were asked to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that, even if not strictly admissible, the document added nothing to the weight of the evidence supplied from other sources. We are not satisfied that no substantial wrong, within the meaning of sec. 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code, has occurred in virtue of the improper reception of this document. We are unable to reach the conclusion that, to use the language of the Judicial Committee in Makin v. A.G. for N.S.W. (2), that\nit is impossible to suppose that the evidence improperly admitted * * * can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury.\nThe conviction must be quashed and, in the circumstances, we think there should be a new trial.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\n[1] [1933] S.C.R. 242.\n[2] [1927] S.C.R. 436, at 440-1.\n[3] [1927] S.C.R. 258.\n[4] (1922) 63 S.C.R. 226.\n[5] (1932) 58 C.C.C. 323.\n"}

G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014L\u2019action qui nous est soumise dans cet appel a pour but de faire d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019un certain immeuble, vendu par le sh\u00e9rif \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, est sujet au rachat pr\u00e9vu par les articles 564 et suivants de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (1925, S.R.Q., c. 102), sous pr\u00e9texte que la r\u00e9clamation qui avait fait l\u2019objet du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure consistait en une demande de taxes municipales.\nIl est exact que l\u2019action originaire intent\u00e9e par la ville d\u2019Iberville contre la compagnie \u201cPyramid Realty Limited\u201d avait pour but de r\u00e9clamer des taxes municipales. Ces taxes s\u2019\u00e9levaient \u00e0 la somme de $352.10. La ville institua cette action comme une action pour dette ordinaire devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure; et il est indiscutable qu\u2019elle avait le droit de poursuivre sa r\u00e9clamation sous cette forme et que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait juridiction pour entendre la cause et prononcer le jugement.\nSur ce point, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019avis contraire exprim\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, la Cour du Banc du Roi[1] a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime dans le sens que nous venons d\u2019indiquer; et c\u2019est la conclusion in\u00e9vitable qui r\u00e9sulte \u00e0 la fois du texte du code de proc\u00e9dure civile (art. 48 et suiv.) ainsi que du jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Montreal Light, Heat & Power Consolidated v. City of Outremont[2]. Il est juste d\u2019ajouter que, devant cette Cour, les deux parties \u00e9taient d\u2019accord sur cette question.\nLa ville d\u2019Iberville, ayant, conform\u00e9ment au code de proc\u00e9dure, obtenu son jugement d\u2019une cour comp\u00e9tente sur une action ordinaire pour dette, proc\u00e9da, toujours en vertu du m\u00eame code, \u00e0 mettre ce jugement \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution au moyen d\u2019un bref de saisie au nom du Souverain (Art. 600 C.P.C.). Les proc\u00e9dures de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e furent strictement suivies. Dans le cours ordinaire des choses, un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans la ville d\u2019Iberville fut vendu par le sh\u00e9rif d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles du code de proc\u00e9dure et fut adjug\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLe bref de fieri facias, de m\u00eame que les annonces de vente et les autres proc\u00e9dures accessoires, se contentaient de mentionner que la saisie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e et que la vente judiciaire serait effectu\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement, sans indiquer la nature de la r\u00e9clamation pour laquelle le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu. Cela est d\u2019ailleurs conforme \u00e0 la pratique et \u00e0 la loi. En sorte que le public, et en particulier l\u2019adjudicataire, ne connaissaient rien de la dette qui avait fait l\u2019objet de la demande originaire. Tout ce qu\u2019ils savaient, et tout ce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient tenus de savoir, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont on a toujours proc\u00e9d\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, c\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019il y avait eu un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure suivi d\u2019une saisie dont la vente judiciaire \u00e9tait la conclusion.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le proc\u00e8s-verbal de vente dress\u00e9 par le sh\u00e9rif, l\u2019adjudication a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 tous les droits inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble vendu et que le saisi pouvait exercer, ainsi que les servitudes actives qui y \u00e9taient attach\u00e9es (c\u2019est le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 780 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile). L\u2019intim\u00e9e, s\u2019\u00e9tant port\u00e9e adjudicataire, paya le montant de son ench\u00e8re (art. 758 C.P.C.) et re\u00e7ut du sh\u00e9rif un contrat de vente (art. 760 C.P.C.) dont les termes \u00e9taient:\n* * * autant que je puis le faire l\u00e9galement, je c\u00e8de, abandonne, vends et transporte au dit adjudicataire, ses hoirs et ayant cause, tout le dit-immeuble (suit la description) et tous et chacun les droit, titre, int\u00e9r\u00eat, propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et demandes quelconques, de ma part en vertu du dit bref relativement au dit immeuble.\nPour avoir et tenir le dit immeuble sus-mentionn\u00e9 et d\u00e9crit avec ses accessoires, par le dit adjudicataire, ses hoirs et ayant cause, pour leur propre usage et b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 toujours.\nCette cession est aussi compl\u00e8te qu\u2019elle peut l\u2019\u00eatre. Elle est d\u2019ailleurs en la forme habituelle du contrat de vente judiciaire. S\u2019il est une chose bien \u00e9tablie dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, c\u2019est que la vente du sh\u00e9rif, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faite, comporte une cession absolue et constitue le titre le plus s\u00fbr et le plus solide que Ton puisse poss\u00e9der.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tant devenue propri\u00e9taire en la forme et mani\u00e8re que nous venons d\u2019exposer, vendit plus tard la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un tiers. Mais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aller plus avant dans l\u2019histoire de ce litige, vu que les proc\u00e9dures suppl\u00e9mentaires auxquelles cette affaire a donn\u00e9 lieu ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par la Cour du Banc du Roi et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019appel de cette partie du jugement.\nL\u2019appelant, cr\u00e9ancier de \u201cPyramid Realty Limited,\u201d invoquant alors les articles 564, 565, 566 et 567 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, s\u2019est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour racheter ou retraire l\u2019immeuble au nom et pour le profit de la compagnie qui en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire au temps de l\u2019adjudication. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9; et l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e contre elle pour la contraindre \u00e0 effectuer la r\u00e9trocession de l\u2019immeuble. La sanction sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e persistait dans son refus, \u00e9tait que le jugement d\u00e9finitif tienne lieu d\u2019acte de r\u00e9trocession et, au moyen de l\u2019enregistrement, op\u00e8re la radiation de tous les actes qui sont intervenus \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adjudication. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action, mais la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi[3] a infirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision.\nPour mieux comprendre la pr\u00e9tention soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant, il vaut mieux reproduire d\u2019abord l\u2019article de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes sur lequel il s\u2019appuie:\n564. L\u2019immeuble vendu pour taxes peut \u00eatre rachet\u00e9 par le propri\u00e9taire ou ses repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, en tout temps durant Tann\u00e9e qui suit la date de l\u2019adjudication, sur paiement \u00e0 l\u2019adjudicataire du prix de vente, y compris le co\u00fbt du certificat d\u2019adjudication, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 raison de dix pour cent par an, une fraction de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e9tant compt\u00e9e pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis que la Cour du Banc du Roi a eu raison de d\u00e9cider que cette disposition de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 une vente judiciaire effectu\u00e9e par le sh\u00e9rif en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nLa premi\u00e8re consid\u00e9ration qui nous am\u00e8ne \u00e0 cette conclusion est que l\u2019article 564 se trouve dans une loi sp\u00e9ciale et que, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019intention contraire n\u2019y soit formellement exprim\u00e9e ou ne d\u00e9coule n\u00e9cessairement des termes employ\u00e9s, il ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme devant s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des cas autres que ceux auxquels pourvoit la loi sp\u00e9ciale. Ce principe a d\u2019autant plus de force, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que la loi sp\u00e9ciale ici vient en conflit avec le code de proc\u00e9dure civile, qui est, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, la loi fondamentale d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Or, l\u2019adjudication \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en vertu de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes\u2014loi sp\u00e9ciale o\u00f9 se trouve l\u2019article 564\u2014, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale o\u00f9 aucune disposition de ce genre ne se rencontre. Sans doute, le texte de l\u2019article 564 est plut\u00f4t large. Mais cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le fait qu\u2019il est contenu dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre entendu comme \u00e9tant, dans l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, destin\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019appliquer uniquement aux cas pr\u00e9vus par la loi dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9. En l\u2019absence d\u2019indications pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 cet effet, l\u2019on ne saurait traiter l\u2019article\u2019 564 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que s\u2019il faisait partie du code de proc\u00e9dure civile et, pour ainsi dire, comme s\u2019il \u00e9tait incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 ce code.\nNotre point de vue est bien exprim\u00e9 dans Maxwell, On the interpretation of statutes, 7th ed., p. 71:\nGeneral words and phrases, however wide and comprehensive they may be in their literal sense, must usually be construed as being limited to the actual objects of the Act and as not altering the law beyond them.\nL\u2019auteur, au moment o\u00f9 il formule ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, vient de faire observer que l\u2019on ne saurait pr\u00e9sumer que le parlement aurait eu l\u2019intention, sans le dire express\u00e9ment, de modifier la loi commune\nbeyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters outside those limits, the law remains undisturbed.\nL\u2019on ne doit pas perdre de vue que, dans une loi sp\u00e9ciale, l\u2019esprit du l\u00e9gislateur est dirig\u00e9 uniquement sur l\u2019objet de cette loi. M\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il emploie les termes les plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, il n\u2019a quand m\u00eame en vue que le sujet particulier dont la loi s\u2019occupe; et il n\u2019entre pas dans ses intentions de l\u00e9gifi\u00e9rer sur d\u2019autres mati\u00e8res. Il faut \u00e9viter, si le l\u00e9gislateur ne l\u2019a dit lui-m\u00eame, d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter une disposition contenue dans une loi sp\u00e9ciale de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui donner une port\u00e9e qui la ferait sortir du cadre de cette loi.\nEn plus de la premi\u00e8re consid\u00e9ration que nous venons d\u2019exposer, il nous para\u00eet y avoir plusieurs autres raisons, pour arriver \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. On conna\u00eet bien le but de l\u2019article 564. La m\u00e9thode sp\u00e9ciale pourvue par les lois municipales de Qu\u00e9bec pour permettre de percevoir les taxes comprend, d\u2019abord, la saisie et la vente des biens meubles appartenant \u00e0 ceux qui doivent des taxes et se trouvant dans la municipalit\u00e9 (Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 542 et suiv.; Code municipal, art. 718 et suiv.). A l\u2019encontre de la proc\u00e9dure dans les cas ordinaires, telles saisie et vente sont faites en vertu de mandats sign\u00e9s par le maire ou par le pr\u00e9fet, suivant le cas, adress\u00e9s \u00e0 un huissier et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par cet officier. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 de tous les meubles saisissables appartenant au contribuable d\u00e9biteur et qui se trouvent dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nIl y a, en plus, la vente et l\u2019adjudication des immeubles, soit en vertu des articles 726 et suivants du code municipal, soit en vertu des articles 548 et suivants de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes; mais l\u00e0 il ne s\u2019agit plus de la vente de tous les immeubles du contribuable. Cette proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux \u201cimmeubles sur lesquels les taxes impos\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es\u201d; et c\u2019est l\u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre la vente pour taxes effectu\u00e9e en vertu des lois municipales et la vente judiciaire en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement. La premi\u00e8re ne peut \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e que sur l\u2019immeuble qui doit la taxe, tandis que, lorsqu\u2019une municipalit\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre jugement pour ses taxes comme sur une action de dette ordinaire, son jugement\u2019 est ex\u00e9cutoire contre tous les biens meubles et immeubles du contribuable, sans tenir compte de la question de savoir si les immeubles saisis sont les m\u00eames que ceux sur lesquels les taxes \u00e9taient impos\u00e9es et \u00e0 raison desquels le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu. La vente municipale est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble impos\u00e9, tandis que la vente judiciaire s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les biens du contribuable.\nOr, le code municipal et la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, clans des chapitres sp\u00e9ciaux, r\u00e8glent minutieusement la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre suivie lorsque la corporation municipale d\u00e9cide de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la vente des immeubles sur lesquels des taxes sont impos\u00e9es. Ce ne sont pas les officiers de justice qui agissent dans ces proc\u00e9dures. Suivant le cas, c\u2019est le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier du comt\u00e9 ou le greffier de la ville. C\u2019est lui non seulement qui ex\u00e9cute toutes les proc\u00e9dures, mais c\u2019est lui \u00e9galement qui dresse et signe le certificat d\u2019adjudication d\u2019abord, puis l\u2019acte de vente apr\u00e8s que la p\u00e9riode de retrait est expir\u00e9e. C\u2019est une proc\u00e9dure tr\u00e8s sommaire. Il n\u2019y a pas de saisie. Il n\u2019y a que la publication d\u2019avis aux endroits sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s par la loi municipale. Dans le code municipal, l\u2019adjudication est faite \u00e0 celui qui offre de payer le montant des deniers \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever, y compris les frais, pour la moindre partie de l\u2019immeuble sur lequel il est d\u00fb des taxes (art. 732 code municipal). En vertu de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, le greffier vend les immeubles au plus haut ench\u00e9risseur; mais il est sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit que des \u201cimmeubles sur lesquels il est encore d\u00fb des taxes\u201d (art. 552). Dans chacun des cas, l\u2019adjudicataire doit payer imm\u00e9diatement le prix de son adjudication; et, sur paiement, il re\u00e7oit seulement un certificat constatant les particularit\u00e9s de la vente, en vertu duquel il est d\u00e8s lors saisi de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019immeuble adjug\u00e9; et il peut en prendre possession, mais \u201csujet au retrait qui peut en \u00eatre fait\u201d dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e, pour les villes, et dans les deux ann\u00e9es suivantes pour les corporations r\u00e9gies par le code municipal (C.M. art. 734-735 et 736; Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 553-554 et 555). Ce n\u2019est que si l\u2019immeuble adjug\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rachet\u00e9 ou retrait dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019adjudicataire devient propri\u00e9taire absolu ou irr\u00e9vocable (Code municipal, art. 740; Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, art. 558). Au contraire, dans la vente judiciaire en vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, d\u00e8s que l\u2019adjudicataire a pay\u00e9 son prix d\u2019achat, le sh\u00e9rif, comme officier de la cour, lui consent un acte absolu et d\u00e9finitif.\nOn voit donc la diff\u00e9rence essentielle entre les deux m\u00e9thodes de proc\u00e9dure; et cela permet de comprendre le sens exact des mots employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 564 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. Il nous para\u00eet clair que, lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur, dans cet article, s\u2019est servi de l\u2019expression \u201cl\u2019immeuble vendu pour taxes\u201d, il a voulu exprimer par l\u00e0 exclusivement l\u2019immeuble vendu conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions des articles 548 et suivants de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, parce que c\u2019est uniquement \u00e0 ce genre de vente que l\u2019expression s\u2019applique. Les mots \u201cvente pour taxes\u201d ont un sens bien sp\u00e9cial dans le langage municipal de la province, et ils sont compris couramment comme voulant dire: la vente effectu\u00e9e suivant la m\u00e9thode particuli\u00e8re qui est pourvue au code municipal ou dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. C\u2019est le seul cas, en effet, o\u00f9 l\u2019on puisse dire v\u00e9ritablement qu\u2019un immeuble est \u201cvendu pour taxes\u201d. Dans les autres cas, sans doute la dette pour laquelle l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e a pu \u00eatre une taxe, mais cette taxe est transmu\u00e9e dans le jugement qui intervient. Elle devient une dette judiciaire semblable \u00e0 toutes les autres dettes judiciaires; et lorsque la saisie et la vente s\u2019ensuivent, ce n\u2019est plus une vente pour taxes, mais c\u2019est une vente en ex\u00e9cution du jugement obtenu sur l\u2019action. La distinction que nous faisons n\u2019est pas arbitraire, puisque pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment elle est marqu\u00e9e par les mots employ\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur luim\u00eame dans les expressions diff\u00e9rentes qu\u2019il a employ\u00e9es aux articles 564 et 546 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. A l\u2019article 564, comme nous l\u2019avons signal\u00e9, il parle de \u201cl\u2019immeuble vendu pour taxes\u201d, tandis qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019article 546, lorsqu\u2019il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la vente du sh\u00e9rif ou d\u2019un autre officier, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une action intent\u00e9e devant les tribunaux, il la d\u00e9finit comme \u201cla vente * * * en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement obtenu\u201d.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, en analysant le texte m\u00eame de l\u2019article 564 et en donnant aux mots de ce texte leur sens usuel et courant, on arrive encore \u00e0 la conclusion adopt\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi que \u201cl\u2019immeuble vendu pour taxes\u201d se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la vente particuli\u00e8re r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par les lois municipales, et non pas \u00e0 la vente judiciaire effectu\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement. Cela est confirm\u00e9 encore par l\u2019emploi dans l\u2019article des mots \u201ccertificat d\u2019adjudication\u201d, qui, \u00e9videmment, s\u2019adressent au certificat donn\u00e9 par le greffier dans une vente municipale. Ce dernier point cependant est moins significatif, parce que l\u2019on pourrait tout de m\u00eame pr\u00e9tendre que, si l\u2019on applique l\u2019article \u00e0 une vente judiciaire par le sh\u00e9rif, il faudrait alors l\u2019entendre mutatis mutandis, et, dans ce cas, remplacer les mots \u201ccertificat d\u2019adjudication\u201d par les mots \u201ccontrat de vente\u201d. Ce serait sans doute, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9fectueuse, puisque le contrat de vente du sh\u00e9rif est d\u00e9finitif, tandis que le certificat d\u2019adjudication du greffier est un titre uniquement temporaire. Mais comme il est n\u00e9cessaire de faire cette substitution de mots pour permettre l\u2019op\u00e9ration du droit de retrait dans les ventes faites \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un jugement de la cour de magistrat, ou des cours de circuit, ou de la cour du recorder, en vertu de l\u2019article 546, l\u2019argument tir\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi des mots \u201ccertificat d\u2019adjudication\u201d dans l\u2019article 564, pour \u00e9carter son application \u00e0 une vente faite \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, perd n\u00e9cessairement de la force que cet argument pourrait autrement avoir.\nIl est cependant deux autres motifs d\u2019approuver le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, que nous tirons de l\u2019article 546.\nCet article d\u00e9roge au code de proc\u00e9dure civile. Il permet de r\u00e9clamer, par une action intent\u00e9e devant la cour de magistrat, ou la cour de circuit du comt\u00e9 ou du district, ou la cour du recorder, le paiement des taxes municipales, quel que soit le montant de Faction.\nPr\u00e9cisons que la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cet article dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes est uniquement ce fait: que l\u2019action peut \u00eatre intent\u00e9e, dans ce cas, quel que soit le montant des taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es. N\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 cette raison, le premier paragraphe de l\u2019article e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 inutile, car le code de proc\u00e9dure civile attribuait d\u00e9j\u00e0 aux cours qui y sont mentionn\u00e9es le droit de conna\u00eetre de ces actions dans la limite de leur juridiction ordinaire. En vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, la corporation municipale avait droit d\u2019instituer son action en r\u00e9clamation de taxes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence des montants pr\u00e9vus, soit devant chacune de ces cours, soit devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Le but principal de l\u2019article 546 a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 de faire exception \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour permettre aux corporations municipales de poursuivre le recouvrement des taxes devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs sans aucune limite quant au montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9.\nUne disposition de ce genre existait depuis longtemps dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (Voir les statuts refondus de 1909, art. 5755, et les statuts ant\u00e9rieurs). Mais, jusque-l\u00e0, il demeurait bien clair que tout immeuble soumis \u00e0 une vente en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement\u2014m\u00eame si le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur une action en r\u00e9clamation de taxes municipales\u2014n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis au retrait qui, au contraire, \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 par la loi dans tous les cas de vente par le greffier de la municipalit\u00e9. C\u2019est en 1922, lors d\u2019une refonte de la loi concernant les cit\u00e9s et villes, que l\u2019on introduisit pour la premi\u00e8re fois (S.R.Q. 13 Geo. V, c. 65, art. 535) la prescription que la vente d\u2019un immeuble par le sh\u00e9rif, ou autre officier, en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement obtenu devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs, serait sujette au droit de retrait, de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai que les ventes faites par le greffier de la municipalit\u00e9. Le texte de l\u2019article 535 de la loi de 1922 est le m\u00eame que le texte de l\u2019article 546 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes actuelle; et l\u2019on peut en tirer imm\u00e9diatement deux d\u00e9ductions:\n1\u00b0 Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cet amendement, les immeubles vendus en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement, qu\u2019il f\u00fbt des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs ou de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas susceptibles de retrait. La loi de 1922 a modifi\u00e9 la situation en disant express\u00e9ment que le retrait s\u2019appliquerait d\u00e9sormais aux jugements obtenus sur une action devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. Elle a donc laiss\u00e9 subsister la loi ant\u00e9rieure quant aux jugements obtenus devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9e dans la nouvelle l\u00e9gislation.\n2\u00b0 En plus, l\u2019amendement de 1922 reproduit dans l\u2019article 546 de la loi actuelle est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la vente en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs\nest sujet au droit de retrait de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai que les ventes faites par le greffier de la municipalit\u00e9.\nOr, le seul article qui permet ce droit de retrait est l\u2019article 564; et c\u2019est donc cet article que le l\u00e9gislateur a entendu d\u00e9signer lorsqu\u2019il parle du\ndroit de retrait de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai que les ventes faites par le greffier de la municipalit\u00e9.\nCela souligne bien que, dans son intention, le retrait dont il est question dans l\u2019article 564 est celui qui op\u00e8re dans \u201cles ventes faites par le greffier de la municipalit\u00e9\u201d. Cet article, par lui-m\u00eame, ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019\u00e0 ces ventes; et le retrait dont il parle s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux ventes en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs uniquement en vertu de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence qui se trouve dans l\u2019article 546 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes. Comme l\u2019on ne saurait trouver de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence analogue en ce qui concerne les ventes faites en vertu d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, il s\u2019ensuit que le droit de retrait ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 ces ventes.\nNous dirions d\u2019ailleurs, ind\u00e9pendamment du raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, que le fait m\u00eame de sp\u00e9cifier le droit de retrait dans le cas de vente \u00e0 la suite de jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs implique n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019exclusion de ce droit lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de jugements de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nAjoutons, en plus, ceci:\nL\u2019article 10 du chapitre 7 de la loi de Qu\u00e9bec 31 Vict. prescrit que nul acte ou nulle disposition de la l\u00e9gislature en aucune mani\u00e8re aura force \u00e0 l\u2019encontre (d\u2019un article du code de proc\u00e9dure civile), \u00e0 moins que tel article n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans tel acte.\nUn arr\u00eat de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, Giroux v. Quebec, Montreal & Southern Railway[4], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cet article \u00e9tait encore en vigueur. Cette opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par quelques-uns des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui ont rendu jugement dans cette cause-ci; et elle a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant dans son factum et lors de l\u2019audition devant cette cour, bien qu\u2019il s\u2019en soit servi pour appuyer un autre point de la cause. Si cela est exact, il semblerait qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sulte que les dispositions du code de proc\u00e9dure civile quant \u00e0 une vente judiciaire en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et tous les articles qui s\u2019y rapportent, n\u2019\u00e9tant nulle part \u201csp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9sign\u00e9s\u201d dans la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, continuent d\u2019avoir leur plein effet conform\u00e9ment au code de proc\u00e9dure civile, et ne sont nullement affect\u00e9s par les prescriptions relatives au retrait contenues dans cette loi sp\u00e9ciale.\nIl ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer deux objections soulev\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant.\nJusqu\u2019\u00e0 la loi de 1922, les articles des lois successives qui prescrivaient le rachat des immeubles vendus pour taxes contenaient l\u2019expression: \u201cVendu par le greffier du conseil en vertu des dispositions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes\u201d, ou quelque expression \u00e9quivalente; tandis qu\u2019en 1922 on a retranch\u00e9 ces expressions.\nLeur disparition peut certainement s\u2019expliquer par le fait que c\u2019est au m\u00eame moment que la l\u00e9gislation nouvelle a \u00e9tendu le droit de retrait aux ventes faites en ex\u00e9cution des jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. Mais m\u00eame si cette modification du texte ne s\u2019expliquait pas de cette fa\u00e7on, nous n\u2019y verrions pas, quand m\u00eame, l\u2019indication d\u2019un changement dans l\u2019intention du Parlement. La pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019un changement d\u2019intention r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une modification du texte n\u2019est jamais d\u00e9cisive; et l\u2019on doit adopter sur ce point le principe pos\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans son arr\u00eat re Brown v. McLachlan[5] que:\nin dealing with a statute which professes merely to repeal a former statute of limited operation and to re-enact its provisions in an amended form, (we) are not necessarily to presume an intention to extend the operation of those provisions to classes of (matters) not previously subject to them, unless the contrary intention is shewn; but (we) are to determine on a fair construction of the whole statute, considered with the surrounding circumstances, whether such an intention existed.\nL\u2019appelant a attir\u00e9 notre attention sur le fait que les articles 568 \u00e0 571 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes sembleraient impliquer que l\u2019article 564 doit recevoir une application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNous ne le croyons pas. Ces articles traitent de l\u2019achat par la municipalit\u00e9 des immeubles vendus pour taxes. Ils permettent \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 d\u2019ench\u00e9rir et d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir ces immeubles lorsqu\u2019ils sont mis en vente; la municipalit\u00e9 peut ainsi ench\u00e9rir et acqu\u00e9rir ces immeubles \u00e0 toute vente du sh\u00e9rif et \u00e0 toute autre vente ayant l\u2019effet d\u2019une vente du sh\u00e9rif; puis ces articles pr\u00e9voient la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der \u201csi le droit de retrait est exerc\u00e9\u201d et stipulent que, s\u2019il n\u2019est pas exerc\u00e9, \u201cle greffier, le sh\u00e9rif, le protonotaire ou le syndic, suivant le cas, dresse et signe un acte de vente en faveur de la municipalit\u00e9 et le fait enregistrer\u201d. La mention de \u201ctoute autre vente ayant l\u2019effet d\u2019une vente du sh\u00e9rif\u201d et celle du protonotaire ou syndic dans les articles 568 et 570, supposeraient, suivant l\u2019appelant, que le l\u00e9gislateur aurait pr\u00e9vu que le droit de retrait pourrait s\u2019exercer dans d\u2019autres cas que ceux d\u2019une vente par le greffier ou d\u2019une vente en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. Nous ne croyons pas que cette cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9sulte du texte de ces articles.\nEn vertu du code de proc\u00e9dure civile (art. 1146 et suiv.), m\u00eame \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un jugement de la cour de circuit, le bref pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un immeuble est rapportable \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district o\u00f9 le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu; et toutes les proc\u00e9dures incidentes \u00e0 la saisie ou \u00e0 la vente des immeubles saisis sont du ressort de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, o\u00f9 le bref est rapportable, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que si le jugement y e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement rendu. Il s\u2019ensuit que, dans les cas pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019article 546 de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes, et comme cons\u00e9quence du jugement rendu par la cour de circuit, le sh\u00e9rif et le protonotaire sont les officiers qui doivent agir. En plus, lorsque le sh\u00e9rif est int\u00e9ress\u00e9, c\u2019est le protonotaire ou son d\u00e9put\u00e9 qui agit en ses lieu et place (art. 35 et 36 C.P.C.). L\u2019emploi des mots \u201csh\u00e9rif\u201d et \u201cprotonotaire\u201d n\u2019implique donc pas n\u00e9cessairement une vente qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il y a l\u2019emploi du mot \u201csyndic\u201d qui, nous l\u2019avouons, n\u2019est pas facile \u00e0 expliquer. Les avocats de l\u2019un ou de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de nous signaler un cas o\u00f9 un syndic serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 agir lorsqu\u2019un immeuble situ\u00e9 dans une cit\u00e9 ou une ville est mis en vente pour taxes municipales. Le savant procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019article 568 pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement tous les cas d\u2019immeubles mis en vente et sur lesquels seraient dues des taxes municipales. Il se peut que ce soit l\u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur; mais cette intention ne r\u00e9sulte pas clairement de la phras\u00e9ologie qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9e. Dans un cas o\u00f9 la question se pr\u00e9senterait carr\u00e9ment, les tribunaux seraient peut-\u00eatre contraints de lui attribuer ce sens, s\u2019il fallait r\u00e9ellement en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que, en d\u00e9pit du texte, il ne peut avoir d\u2019autre sens, et que l\u2019on soit incapable de trouver un cas o\u00f9 un immeuble serait mis en vente pour taxes municipales par un syndic.\nPour le moment, il suffit de dire que le seul emploi de ce mot dans l\u2019article 570 n\u2019a s\u00fbrement pas pour effet d\u2019introduire la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans les clauses de la Loi des cit\u00e9s et villes qui concernent le droit de retrait. Un syndic n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec une vente en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nEt d\u2019ailleurs, la loi n\u2019indique pas de quel syndic il s\u2019agit. Il n\u2019est pas probable que ce soit le syndic de faillite. Cet officier existe en vertu d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale; et il semblerait que si c\u2019est \u00e0 lui qu\u2019on a voulu faire allusion dans une loi provinciale, on l\u2019aurait indiqu\u00e9 par une d\u00e9signation plus claire. On lui aurait donn\u00e9 tout son nom de \u201csyndic de faillite\u201d. Il est plus vraisemblable qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des syndics scolaires, ou des syndics nomm\u00e9s en vertu des lois paroissiales. En effet, c\u2019est \u00e0 ces syndics que r\u00e9f\u00e8re un article de la m\u00eame loi dans la sous-division pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, \u00e0 l\u2019article 563.\nDe plus, l\u2019on remarquera que l\u2019article 568, qui parle de l\u2019achat par la municipalit\u00e9 des immeubles vendus pour taxes, mentionne indistinctement les taxes municipales et les taxes scolaires. L\u2019article 570, qui le suit, par l\u2019emploi du mot \u201csyndic\u201d, aurait donc eu pour but d\u2019indiquer les syndics scolaires, en assumant qu\u2019il pourrait se pr\u00e9senter des cas o\u00f9 ces syndics seraient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 agir et \u00e0 dresser et signer un acte de vente en faveur de la municipalit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 570. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit de la port\u00e9e exacte de cette prescription, nous sommes d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle ne cr\u00e9e certainement pas une pr\u00e9somption suffisante pour pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 rencontre de toutes les raisons d\u00e9montrant que le droit de retrait ne s\u2019applique pas dans les cas d\u2019immeubles vendus en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nNous croyons donc que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chauvin, Walker, Stewart & Martineau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lajoie, Lajoie, G\u00e9linas & McNaughton.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 54 K.B. 161.\n[2] [1932] A.C. 423.\n[3] (1932) Q.R. 54 K.B. 161.\n[4] 19 R.P.Q. 357.\n[5] 4 A.C. 550.\n"}

Plaintiffs claimed, and defendant counterclaimed, for damages. At the trial each party contended that the vehicle of the other had crossed the middle line of the road and caused the collision, and the evidence was largely directed to this issue. In answers to questions put to them, the jury found negligence in defendant\u2019s driver, causing the injuries to plaintiffs, in that \u201cdriver had been warned (this referring to a passenger\u2019s remark on seeing the motor car\u2019s approach) and might have applied brake sooner\u201d; and also found negligence in plaintiff driver, causing the injuries to plaintiffs and damage to defendant, in that, \u201cowing to the wet surface of road and worn condition of his front tires, he should have taken more precaution in making this curve\u201d; and found the degrees of negligence: plaintiff driver 70%, defendant 30%; in accordance with which judgment was given at trial (The Negligence Act, 1930, Ont., c. 27). This judgment was varied by the Court of Appeal, Ont., which dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action and sustained defendant\u2019s judgment against plaintiff driver. Plaintiffs appealed.\nHeld (Cannon and Crocket JJ. dissenting): Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.: The jury\u2019s finding of negligence against plaintiff driver was a finding that he did not exercise the care which a reasonable and prudent man would have exercised in the circumstances, and further, by implication, that the accident occurred on defendant\u2019s side of the road. By their answer as to defendant\u2019s negligence, the jury found in effect that, notwithstanding that through plaintiff\u2019s negligence his car crossed the middle line and went in front of the bus, the bus driver by applying his brakes more promptly could and should have avoided the accident. This was a finding of ultimate negligence, and, if supported by the evidence, left defendant responsible for the whole resulting damage. But the evidence did not reasonably warrant such a finding. (As to lack of time to act, Swadling v. Cooper, [1931] A.C. 1, at 10, referred to). The verdict against defendant could not be sustained and should be set aside (reference to Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Fr\u00e9chette, [1915] A.C. 871, at 881).\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): The jury\u2019s findings were in effect that the negligent driving of both plaintiff and defendant\u2019s driver contributed (in the degrees mentioned) to cause the accident; and, upon the evidence, their verdict should not be set aside as unreasonable. (As to cases of contribution, Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute, [1922] 1 A.C. 129, at 144, cited). The judgment at trial should be restored.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): The jury\u2019s finding against the defendant was a finding of ultimate negligence, and was reasonably warranted upon the evidence. But also the finding against the plaintiff driver was, on its face, a finding of ultimate negligence, and, but for the finding of ultimate negligence against defendant, a finding of either ultimate or contributory negligence against the plaintiff driver would have been reasonably supportable upon the evidence. The two findings (of the negligence in each which \u201ccaused\u201d the injuries), upon the wording of the questions and answers, were contradictory, and both could not stand, either as findings of ultimate or of contributory negligence. (The law as to contributory negligence and ultimate negligence discussed). For above reason, and having regard to the direction, exclusive in certain respects, of the contest at the trial and of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, there should be a new trial.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Kelly J. on the findings of a jury.\nThe action, which was for damages, arose out of a collision between a motor car, driven by one of the plaintiffs and in which the other plaintiff was riding, and a motor bus of the defendant. The jury found negligence (causing the injuries or damage) both in the driver of the defendant\u2019s bus and in the driver of the motor car, assessed the damages of the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel (driver of the car) at $629.50, of the plaintiff Nettie Koeppel at $6,500, and of the defendant (which had counterclaimed for damage to its bus) at $2,300, and found that the degrees of fault were: in the plaintiff driver 70%, and in the defendant 30%.\nThe judgment at trial was that the plaintiff driver recover against defendant $188.85 and costs; that the other plaintiff recover against defendant $6,500 and costs; that the defendant recover against the plaintiff driver $1,610 and costs; and that the defendant (which had claimed indemnity in accordance with the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act of Ontario\u2014The Negligence Act, 1930, c. 27) recover from the plaintiff driver 70% of the amount awarded to the plaintiff Nettie Koeppel for damages and costs, which the defendant might be compelled to pay pursuant to the judgment.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal directed that the action be dismissed with costs, and that the defendant recover on its counterclaim from the plaintiff driver the sum of $1,610 with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the jury\u2019s findings are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Cannon J. (who would restore the judgment at trial) and Crocket J. (who would order a new trial) dissenting.\nW.F. Schroeder for the appellant.\nT.N. Phelan, K.C., and A.W. Beament for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside the judgment of Kelly J. in favour of the appellants entered in accordance with the verdict of the jury. The action was for damages for personal injuries received as the result of a collision between a light Falcon Knight coup\u00e9, owned and driven by Benjamin Koeppel, and an omnibus belonging to the respondent. On June 17, 1930, the appellants were proceeding easterly along the Provincial Highway No. 2, and, when about half a mile west of the town of Prescott, their car collided with the respondent\u2019s bus going west, whereby both vehicles were badly damaged and Nettie Koeppel was severely injured. The road at the point of impact had a good concrete surface, twenty\u2011four feet wide, and had a black line marking its centre. It, however, curved sharply and, at the time of the collision, was wet. The appellants\u2019 car was six feet wide, while the bus was eight feet wide, thirty-three feet long, and weighed 14,000 pounds.\nThe pleadings shew a remarkable similarity in the allegations made. In their statement of claim the appellants allege that\nthe accident occurred solely in consequence of the negligence, imprudence and want of care of the defendant\u2019s driver in driving the defendant\u2019s bus at an excessive rate of speed, contrary to the rule of the road, in failing to keep a proper look-out and in failing to have the said bus under control having regard to all the circumstances.\nThe statement of defence, on the other hand, alleges that\nthe said collision was caused solely by the negligence, imprudence and want of care of the plaintiff Koeppel in driving his motor car at an excessive rate of speed contrary to the rule of the road and not having it under control under all the circumstances.\nAt the trial each party contended that the vehicle of the other had crossed over the centre line of the road, invaded his territory, and was responsible for the collision, and the evidence was largely directed to this issue.\nThe questions material to this appeal put to the jury, and the answers thereto given by them, were as follows:\u2014\n1. Q. Was there any negligence of the driver of defendant\u2019s bus (or coach) which caused the injuries to the plaintiffs?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. Q. If there was such negligence of defendant\u2019s said driver, state fully and clearly what was or were the act or acts, or omission or omissions, which constituted such negligence?\u2014A. Driver had been warned and might have applied brake sooner.\n3. Q. Was there any negligence of the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel which caused the injuries to plaintiffs, and the damage to defendant?\u2014A. Yes.\n4. Q. If there was such negligence of the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel, state fully and clearly what was or were his act or acts or omission or omissions which constituted his negligence?\u2014A. Owing to the wet surface of road and worn condition of his front tires. He should have taken more precaution in making this curve.\n* * *\n8. Q. If you find that the driver of defendant\u2019s bus was negligent, and also that plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel was negligent, then state the degree in which each of them was at fault or negligent?\u2014A. Koeppel\u201470%, Colonial Coach Lines\u201430%.\nIn giving these answers the jury had before them the evidence of the Koeppels, that at the time of the collision their car was running twenty-two or twenty-three miles per hour; that previously it had been running from twenty-eight to thirty miles but had slowed down for the curve; that at all times their car had been on the south side of the centre line; that the respondent\u2019s bus was coming fast, and that instead of keeping to its own side of the road it cut the curve and crashed into their car. They said the left wheels of the bus were two or three feet over the centre line at the time.\nThe jury had also before them the evidence of W.G. McElroy, the driver of the bus; Edmund Smith, formerly a driver for the respondent but who, at the time of the accident, was a passenger in the bus; E.H. Billings, agent at Prescott for the Canadian Oil Company, who was driving a truck a short distance behind the respondent\u2019s bus, and Mrs. Sarney, a passenger in the bus. These witnesses testified that at all material times before the impact the bus was on its own side of the road; that the appellants\u2019 car was coming very fast\u2014one witness putting it at thirty-five miles per hour\u2014and that it was raining at the time. The first three of these witnesses stated that when Koeppel turned his front wheels to the right to take his course around the curve the momentum of the car was such that it did not take the curve but went straight ahead although the front wheels were properly set for the curve. They gave as a reason that the front tires would not grip the wet pavement. Smith refers to this straight ahead movement as \u201cskidding\u201d and says that when he saw the speed at which Koeppel\u2019s car was coming he remarked to McElroy that \u201csomething was likely to happen\u201d, as he knew Koeppel could not make the curve at that speed. On being asked how far the car was from the bus when he made that remark to McElroy, he gave this testimony:\u2014\nQ. At the time you made this remark to McElroy how far was the coupe away from you?\u2014A. I do not know exactly how far it would be away.\nQ. Approximately how far away would it be? I do not expect you to get out and measure it?\u2014A. I could not give you any estimate.\nQ. Would it be 20 feet away?\u2014A. It was more than that.\nQ. Was it 30 feet away?\u2014A. Yes, and it would be more than that, but I do not know exactly how far. Q. Was it 50 feet away?\u2014A. I could not say if it was 50 feet or not, or more.\nQ. Give us your best estimate. I do not care whether you are right or wrong?\u2014A. I do not know how far it was away.\nQ. You do not remember how far it was away?\u2014A. I do not know.\nQ. What made you think there was going to be an accident?\u2014A. When I saw the car coming around the curve I could see he was travelling quite fast and I know the nature of the roads there and I knew that at the speed he was travelling he could not make that curve.\n* * *\nQ. At the time you made that remark to McElroy the coupe was still well over to its south side of the centre line of the road?\u2014A. He was still on his own side of the road, yes.\nQ. And if you gave him the whole half of the road to pass there is no reason why he should not get across?\u2014A. Yes, there was.\nQ. What reason?\u2014A. The reason I saw was that he was travelling too fast and the road was wet.\nSmith also said that after the accident he examined the front tire left on the car and found it had no tread on it, that the tread had been worn off and the tire was in a very smooth condition.\nMcElroy testified that at no time did the speed of his bus exceed twenty miles an hour. He claimed that the accident was caused because the front tires of the Koeppel car failed to grip the wet pavement and follow the curve; that the car crossed the centre line and hit his bus which was well over to the right hand side; that when Koeppel turned his wheel to follow round the sharp part of the curve he was not more than twenty feet from him, and that Koeppel was then on the south side of the centre of the road. As to his ability to stop the bus, McElroy testified that, going at fifteen miles an hour, he could stop it, even on the wet pavement, in nine feet, and, going at twenty miles an hour he could stop in fifteen feet, but he added: \u201cI do not know much about feet.\u201d He further said that he did not hear Smith say \u201cSomething is likely to happen,\u201d all he heard him say was \u201cLook at this bird coming.\u201d\nIn view of this evidence what meaning is to be given to the answers of the jury? Dealing first with question 4\u2014the negligence ascribed to the appellants\u2014the finding is: \u201cOwing to the wet surface of the road and the worn condition of his front tires he should have taken more precaution in making this curve\u201d. This is a finding that Koeppel did not exercise the care which a reasonable and prudent man would have exercised in the circumstances. In my opinion it is more: it is a finding by implication that the accident occurred north of the centre line of the road; there would be no point otherwise in referring to the condition of Koeppel\u2019s tires. If Koeppel were on his own side of the road when the collision occurred the condition of his tires could not be a factor contributing to the accident.\nThen referring to the answer given to question 2: \u201cThe driver had been warned and might have applied his brakes sooner.\u201d\u2014By this answer, the jury, in my opinion, intended to find that if the brakes had been applied sooner the accident would have been avoided. It is a finding of ultimate negligence. The jury by these two answers were saying that, notwithstanding the fact that Koeppel crossed the centre line and drove in front of the bus, the driver of the bus, by the more prompt application of his brakes could and should have avoided the accident. If that finding is supported by the evidence, the driver of the bus, by not avoiding the consequences of Koeppel\u2019s negligence, when he had the present ability to do so, leaves the respondent responsible for the whole resulting damage.\nDoes the evidence support the finding?\nAssuming that the remark made by Smith to McElroy amounts to a warning sufficient to fix the respondent with liability if unheeded (which to my mind is very doubtful), and assuming that when it was made the relative positions of the car and the bus were just what he says they were (and his is the only evidence on the point on which the appellants can rely), what does the evidence shew? It shews that when Smith gave his warning to McElroy the car and the bus were more than thirty feet apart, but it cannot be definitely fixed at fifty feet. But, giving the respondent the benefit of the doubtful distance of fifty feet between the car and the bus when Smith uttered his warning, it is, in my opinion, impossible to say that the accident could have been avoided. The combined speed of the vehicles was forty-two or forty-three miles per hour. The two cars at that speed would cover fifty feet in four-fifths of a second and, even if we allow more for the decreased speed of the bus after applying the brakes, there would be no more than one second of time which the driver of the bus would have to apply his brakes. One must add to that, as pointed to in the evidence, that brakes \u201cdo not take right instantly,\u201d that is, their effect is not felt imme- diately upon the wheels. It seems clear that we have here the class of case illustrated by the recent decision of the House of Lords in Swadling v. Cooper[1]. Koeppel himself states that \u201che first realized there was danger\u201d only when he was \u201cabout 20 feet away from the bus\u201d. The driver of the bus could not anticipate that the tires of the car \u201cwould not grip the pavement\u201d and would let it \u201cslide directly across into the path of the bus\u201d. Upon the only evidence in the record, between the moment when the bus driver \u201ccould have become aware\u201d that Koeppel\u2019s car was cutting across to the north side and the moment of the impact, \u201cthere can have been no time for the (driver) to do anything to avoid the impact\u201d.\nEven assuming the bus had stopped in fifteen feet, that would not have avoided the accident. Koeppel admits that he did not apply his brakes. His car would have kept on approaching the bus in any event and the only difference would have been that Koeppel\u2019s car would have struck the bus possibly a little more to the right than where it actually struck it.\nIt follows that the finding against the respondent is not reasonably warranted by the evidence and that, under the circumstances, that finding cannot stand.\nThough reluctant to disturb the verdict of a jury, after careful examination of the evidence in this case, we have come to the conclusion that the verdict against the respondent cannot be sustained and there is no course open to us but to set it aside. (Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Fr\u00e9chette[2]. We, therefore, agree with the Court of Appeal that the appellants\u2019 action fails.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCANNON J. (dissenting).\u2014I have read with great profit the opinions prepared by my brothers Lamont and Crocket. Is the evidence in this case of such a character that judgment cannot be possibly given in favour of plaintiffs? Or is the verdict of the jury so contradictory that a new trial must be ordered? With due respect, I think that the Court of Appeal went too far in dismissing the action completely and refusing to accept the finding of contributory negligence reported by the jury. Borrowing the words of Lord Birkenhead in his speech to the House of Lords in Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Volute[3]\u2014\nI think that the question of contributory negligence must be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common-sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it. And while no doubt, where a clear line can be drawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look to, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together, and the second act of negligence is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligent, while not held free from blame * * *, might, on the other hand, invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.\nIn this case, we have the benefit of the jury\u2019s verdict, and there is evidence given on behalf of the defendant showing that McElroy was aware of the danger. The jury did not go so far as to say that he could have avoided the collision by appropriate measure but thought that he to a certain extent, 30%, contributed to the accident in the ordinary common sense, because there was not, in their opinion, a sufficient separation of time, place and circumstances between the negligent driving of the plaintiff and that of McElroy to make it right to treat the negligence of the plaintiff as the sole cause of the collision. If McElroy had put on his brake sooner, he may or may not have avoided the collision; there is no finding on this point and it was difficult to determine the distance between the vehicles when the danger of collision became apparent to Smith and other onlookers. I do not feel competent to decide from the record that it was not possible to stop the bus in good time within a distance which is not clearly established. I do not see my way clear to set aside the verdict of the jury as unreasonable; they have to the best of their ability applied their common sense to the evidence and, like the trial judge, I would give effect to their findings.\nI, therefore, would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge. The appellants will recover their costs here and in the Appellate Division from the respondent company.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting).\u2014This action was brought to recover compensation for personal injuries and loss severally sustained by the two plaintiffs before their marriage as a result of a collision between the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel\u2019s automobile and one of the defendant\u2019s omnibuses.\nThe collision occurred on a sharp curve between a quarter and a half a mile west of the town of Prescott shortly before ten o\u2019clock a.m., on June 17th, 1930, while the plaintiff was driving his automobile\u2014a light Falcon-Knight coupe\u2014with the female plaintiff (then Miss Nettie Bernstein) seated beside him\u2014easterly along the Ontario provincial highway No. 2 on a holiday trip from Brooklyn, N.Y., to visit relatives at Hull, Quebec. The defendant\u2019s omnibus was proceeding west on its regular scheduled trip from Ottawa to Kingston. Koeppel was instantly thrown through the windshield of his car and sustained several bruises and other injuries, including the fracture of two teeth for which he claimed the payment of a New York dentist\u2019s bill for $150. Miss Bernstein sustained much more serious injuries, including a fracture of her right ankle and lacerations of the scalp, of the right leg below the knee and of her left ring finger, all of which have left deep permanent scars. The coupe itself was practically destroyed.\nIn their statement of claim for these injuries the plaintiffs alleged that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the driver of the omnibus. This negligence is specifically stated in paragraph 3 to have consisted in approaching the curve at an excessive rate of speed and having the left wheels of the bus several feet south of the centre line of the highway. \u201cThe plaintiff Koeppel,\u201d the statement continues,\nturned his car to the south side of the highway as much as possible in order to avoid a collision with the defendant\u2019s bus, but when both vehicles were quite close to each other, the defendant\u2019s bus not only failed to turn to the right to enable the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile to pass in safety, but it was negligently turned sharply to the south, colliding violently with the plaintiffs\u2019 motor car * * *.\nParagraph 3-A alleges that the said accident occurred solely in consequence of the negligence, etc., of the defendant\u2019s driver in driving the bus\nat an excessive rate of speed, contrary to the rule of the road, in failing to keep a proper lookout and in failing to have the said bus under control having regard to all the circumstances.\nThe defendant by its defence denied all negligence on its part and alleged that the collision was caused solely by the negligence of the plaintiff, Koeppel, in driving his motor car at an excessive rate of speed contrary to the rule of the road and not having it under control under all the circumstances,\nand, alternatively, that Koeppel was guilty of contributory negligence. The defendant counter\u2011claimed on these grounds for damages to the amount of $3,000, covering cost of repairing its bus, depreciation and loss of its use for thirty days at $50 a day. The defendant also claimed, in the event of the female plaintiff being found entitled to recover any amount against it, indemnification from the plaintiff, Koeppel, for his proportionate share thereof, under the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act.\nOn the trial of the action at the Ottawa Assizes before Kelly, J., and a jury, the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs was directed principally towards proving that, immediately before and at the moment of the collision, the omnibus was cutting the curve with its left wheels on the south side of the painted line marking the centre of the paved roadway, and that it struck the coupe while the latter was well over on its own side of the road and while Koeppel, seeing the omnibus heading southwesterly towards him, was trying to avoid it by steering his car southeasterly towards the south shoulder of the road. The evidence on the part of the defendant was directed to disproving this claim and proving that the collision was caused by the coupe, in consequence of the excessive speed at which it was approaching the acute part of the curve, swerving from the south side of the road and running against the omnibus when the latter was wholly on and well over to its own, the north, side of the pavement. It was common ground that the pavement was wet with the rain and was more or less slippery.\nThe learned trial judge left eight questions to the jury. These questions and the jury\u2019s answers thereto were as follows:\n1. Was there any negligence of the driver of defendant\u2019s bus (or coach) which caused the injuries to the plaintiffs?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. If there was such negligence of defendant\u2019s said driver, state fully and clearly what was or were the act or acts, or omission or omissions, which constituted such negligence?\u2014A. Driver had been warned and might have applied brake sooner.\n3. Was there any negligence of the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel which caused the injuries to plaintiffs, and the damage to defendant?\u2014A. Yes.\n4. If there was such negligence of the plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel, state fully and clearly what was or were his act or acts or omission or omissions which constituted his negligence?\u2014A. Owing to the wet surface of road and worn condition of his front tires. He should have taken more precaution in making this curve.\n5. At what amount do you assess the damages of plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel?\u2014A. $629.50.\n6. At what amount do you assess the damages of plaintiff Nettie Koeppel?\u2014A. $6,500.\n7. At what amount do you assess the damages of the defendant?\u2014A. $2,300.\n8. If you find that the driver of defendant\u2019s bus was negligent, and also that plaintiff Benjamin Koeppel was negligent, then state the degree in which each of them was at fault or negligent?\u2014A. Koeppel, 70%; Colonial Coach Lines, 30%.\nUpon these findings His Lordship directed a judgment for the plaintiff, Nettie Koeppel (an amendment having been allowed changing her maiden to her married name), against the defendant for $6,500 and costs; and, applying the provisions of the Contributory Negligence Act, a judgment for the plaintiff, Benjamin Koeppel, for $188.85\u201430% of the damages found by the jury to have been sustained by him\u2014and costs; and a judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff, Benjamin Koeppel, for $1,610\u201470% of the damages found by the jury to have been sustained by it\u2014with costs of its counter-claim. He also adjudged that the defendant should be indemnified under the provisions of sec. 3 of the Contributory Negligence Act (The Negligence Act, 1930, Ontario) to the extent of 70% of the amount it should be compelled to pay the plaintiff, Nettie Koeppel, upon her judgment against the defendant.\nThe defendant appealed to the Appellate Division against the judgments in favour of the two plaintiffs. That Court (Mulock, C.J.O., and Riddell and Grant, JJ.A.) allowed the appeal with costs, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action with costs, allowing the defendant\u2019s judgment against the plaintiff, Benjamin Koeppel, for $1,610 and costs to stand.\nThe plaintiffs now appeal to this Court against this decision, which, it is contended, involved the unwarranted setting aside of a valid finding of the jury that the collision was caused by the negligence of the omnibus driver in failing to apply his brakes sooner.\nThe learned Chief Justice and the late Mr. Justice Grant held that to succeed in the action it was necessary for the plaintiffs to establish that the omnibus crossed over to the southerly half of the highway and there caused the collision, and that the jury\u2019s answer to question 2 was not a finding to that effect. They held further, however, that that answer was not a finding that the application of the brakes sooner would have prevented the accident nor a finding that the accident was caused by any negligence of the defendant.\nIt is only on the assumption that the plaintiffs must be strictly confined to the particulars alleged in their statement of claim and to the case as appearing by the evidence of their own witnesses on the trial that the jury\u2019s answer to question 2 can be disregarded. With all deference I am of opinion that such an assumption is not warranted in the circumstances of this case. The whole conduct of the defendant\u2019s driver in the operation of the bus while approaching the curve and in meeting the situation created by the approach of the Koeppel car from the opposite direction was exposed to the jury by the evidence of the bus driver and other of the defendant\u2019s own witnesses, who were travelling in the bus with him at the time. The first question which the learned trial judge left to the jury was: \u201cWas there any negligence of the driver of defendant\u2019s bus, which caused the injuries to the plaintiffs?\u201d with a direction in the event of the jury finding that there was, to state fully and clearly what was or were the act or acts or omission or omissions which constituted such negligence. There was no reservation or restriction to acts or omissions specifically alleged in the statement of claim.\nHad the plaintiffs sought to introduce evidence to prove any negligence which was not within the allegations of their statement of claim, the defendant might well have objected to its admission on that ground. Such an objection would, doubtless, have resulted in an application to amend, which it would have been the duty of the trial judge to grant, unless the defendant made the affidavit of prejudice required by the Judicature Act. Here the failure of the driver of the bus to apply the brakes sooner than he did, which was the negligence the jury plainly meant to find, was disclosed by the defendant\u2019s own witnesses. No question of surprise, therefore, could arise on the production of the testimony. The evidence was all on the record and without objection. As a matter of fact, when the defendant\u2019s counsel, after the jury returned its findings, objected to the answer to question 2 on the ground that it was not within the negligence set up in the statement of claim, the trial judge, on application thereupon made by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, did allow an amendment to cover that answer.\nIn my opinion, it was not only the duty of the jury, under the direction which the learned trial judge gave them, to state any negligence of which they were satisfied on the whole evidence the driver of the bus was guilty, whether it was specifically alleged in the statement of claim or not, but it was also the duty of the trial judge to accept the jury\u2019s finding as to what that particular negligence was, provided it was intelligible and could reasonably be made on any evidence adduced before them and not withdrawn from their consideration, and to allow any amendment necessary to cover it, as His Lordship did.\nI find myself also unable to adopt the view that the answer to question 2 was not a finding that the failure to apply the brakes sooner caused the collision, nor a finding that the collision was caused by any negligence of the defendant. It is true that it was not in terms an express, specific finding that \u201cthe application of the brakes sooner would have prevented the accident,\u201d but, reading it, as it must be read, with question 1 and the jury\u2019s answer thereto, it sufficiently indicates that the negligence of the bus driver, which they had already distinctly found caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, consisted in his failure to apply the brakes sooner than he did. This in law plainly means that his failure to apply the brakes sooner was the real effective cause of the collision, i.e., its proximate, ultimate cause, which of course implies that the application of the brakes sooner would have prevented the collision. It may be, as Mr. Justice Riddell in his reasons for judgment holds, that the words of the answer: \u201cDriver had been warned and might have applied brake sooner\u201d negatives any negligence with regard to the application of the brakes by the bus driver before he was warned, but whether the language which the jury used was intended to so limit the negligence or not, it is none the less a finding of negligence on the part of the bus driver, and, coupled with question 1 and the jury\u2019s answer thereto, a finding of negligence \u201cwhich caused the injuries to the plaintiffs.\u201d\nThe real difficulty in the case is that, while the jury have made this finding on questions 1 and 2, they have at the same time in answer to questions 3 and 4 found that Koeppel was also guilty of negligence \u201cwhich caused\u201d the collision and the resulting injuries and damage, and that these two findings are manifestly contradictory unless one reads into questions 1 and 3 the words \u201cor materially contributed to cause\u201d and treats the negligence separately found against each driver, not as in itself causing the collision, but as operating with the negligence of the other to jointly cause it.\nAlthough the answer to question 4 is less specific and definite than the answer to question 2, and in reality adds nothing to the jury\u2019s answer to question 3, viz: that Koeppel was guilty of negligence in approaching the curve in the circumstances, it is quite apparent from the reference to the wet surface of the road and the worn condition of his tires that what the jury meant was that he was approaching the curve at too great a speed. Whether the answer sufficiently indicates this or not, the answer to question 3 is a distinct finding that Koeppel was guilty of negligence, \u201cwhich caused the injuries to plaintiffs and the damage to defendant.\u201d On its face this finding is a finding of ultimate negligence on the part of Koeppel, as the answers to questions 1 and 2 are also a finding of ultimate negligence on the part of McElroy. When the two findings and the answer to question 8 apportioning the fault are considered together there can, I think, be little question that the jury intended the two findings as findings of contributory negligence against both drivers, no doubt in the sense that the collision would not have occurred had it not been for the negligence of both. This, however, is not sufficient to make the negligence of either contributory in the legal sense of the word. A cause which is merely a sine qua non is not sufficient to constitute contributory negligence in the legal sense. This court decided in the case of McLaughlin v. Long[4], that the Contributory Negligence Act of the province of New Brunswick, which is similar in its relevant provisions to that of Ontario and the other provinces of Canada, effected no change in the law of contributory negligence so far as the meaning of that term is concerned and that damage or loss could properly be said to be \u201ccaused\u201d by the fault of two or more persons within the meaning of sec. 2 of that Act \u201conly when the fault of each of such persons is a proximate or efficient cause of such damage or loss, i.e., only when at common law each would properly have been held guilty of negligence which contributed to causing the injurious occurrence.\u201d Contributory negligence therefore implies, as it always did, negligent acts or omissions of two or more persons operating together to produce such an emergency or peril as to render it impossible for either or any of them, by the exercise of reasonable care, to avoid the consequences of the negligence of the other or others. There can be no such thing in the case of a collision between two vehicles as contributory negligence on the part of the one driver unless there is negligence on the part of the other which has also materially contributed to bring the collision about, that is to say, has efficiently operated with the negligence of the other to cause it. In that case, the combined negligence of the two drivers is in law the proximate cause of the collision. If, however, notwithstanding that both drivers may have been guilty of negligence, the situation resulting therefrom was such that either, by the exercise of reasonable care, could have avoided the collision, the failure to exercise such care and thus prevent the collision becomes the immediate and sole proximate cause thereof. The negligence of the other in that event cannot be said to have had any effective part in it. It is not a causa efficiens.\nHere, the sole negligence found against McElroy was his failure to apply his brakes sooner. This finding obviously is based upon the fact that he was fully aware of the danger of Koeppel\u2019s not making the curve at the speed at which he was approaching it on a wet and slippery pavement and that he had the time and opportunity to avoid the threatened consequences by applying his brakes and stopping the bus before proceeding to the danger point at the peak of the curve. If he had the time and opportunity thus to avoid the threatened consequences of Koeppel\u2019s negligence, and negligently failed to do so, he was ultimately and wholly responsible for the collision. If he had not, and the earlier application of his brakes would have made no difference, he was not responsible at all, failing a finding of some other negligence on his part operating with that of Koeppel to create a peril which neither could avoid, such as excessive speed, driving on the wrong side of the road or not keeping a proper lookout.\nThe finding against McElroy can therefore only be treated as a finding of ultimate negligence. Whether it is reasonably warranted as such by the evidence is another question which Mr. Justice Riddell, alone of the Appeal Judges, considered. With the utmost respect I find it impossible, upon my examination of the evidence of McElroy himself and of the witnesses, Smith and Billings, to agree with His Lordship that the finding is not reasonably warranted, whether it be construed as negativing all negligence on McElroy\u2019s part before he was warned or not.\nThe jurors had before them evidence of the dangerous character of the curve, especially in wet weather, and of McElroy\u2019s undoubted knowledge thereof. Also the statement of Smith, a licensed chauffeur, then in the employ of the defendant, who was seated in a passenger seat directly behind McElroy, that he saw the coup\u00e9 coming around the curve and knew when he saw it that at the speed it was travelling it \u201ccould not make that curve\u201d and called McElroy\u2019s attention to the danger. They had heard Smith, when asked how far the coup\u00e9 was away at that time, answer that he did not know exactly, but later admit that possibly he could see 150 to 200 yards down the road (from where the bus was) at that time, and state also that at the time the coup\u00e9 started to skid across the road it was possibly 100 or 125 feet away, and that he disagreed with McElroy\u2019s statement that the bus was but 20 feet away when the coup\u00e9 started to skid. They also had Smith\u2019s evidence that when he called McElroy\u2019s attention to the coup\u00e9 coming down the road the latter started slowing the coach down and \u201ceither shortly before or at the time of impact he immediately jammed his brakes on to stop the coach\u201d. Also the evidence of Billings, another licensed chauffeur, who was driving an oil truck behind the bus, that they were both entering this very treacherous curve, especially after a rainstorm, and that he could see a glimpse of the coup\u00e9 coming around and that he realized if the smaller car took the curve at that speed it would be fatal. Also the statement of McElroy himself that when he first saw the coup\u00e9 he was pretty close to the guard rail (on the north side of the highway) about the same distance back from the corner, and that the coup\u00e9 had just come around another turn west on the road (at least 400 feet west of the first turn, according to the road plan in evidence), and that as he (McElroy) approached this curve the coup\u00e9 \u201ckept coming all the time towards us\u201d, and his further statement that when he got pretty near to the guard rail he saw the car coming, jumping in front, and he knew it was coming-fast and got over as far as he could, \u201c* * * and got just about to the sharp part of the turn when this car came around and the wheels (of the coup\u00e9) started to turn towards the river, towards the south\u201d. They had, moreover, his statement that the bus was travelling at 15 miles per hour and that he should have been able to stop it in about nine feet. They had before them also a blueprint of a plan of the highway, drawn to scale, shewing a total length of over 1,300 feet, upon which McElroy pointed out to them the point the bus had reached east of the guard rail when he first saw the coup\u00e9, which point would, according to the plan scale, be a short distance east of the east end of the guard rail and at least 300 feet east of the culvert within a few feet of which the collision occurred.\nThis testimony appears to me to be a conclusive answer to the following statement of the learned Appeal Judge in the closing part of his judgment: \u201cNo one gives any evidence so much as indicating that there was any delay in putting on the brakes as soon as an accident seemed imminent, or suggesting anything the driver could have done.\u201d Whether \u201cit all happened in a split second,\u201d as His Lordship adds, apparently grounding the statement upon his acceptance of an answer which Billings made to one of the questions put to him by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, or whether McElroy had a reasonable opportunity of avoiding the collision after he became aware or should have become aware of the danger, was essentially a question of fact which it was the jury\u2019s exclusive function to determine, if there was sufficient evidence to enable them to reasonably do so, as I think there was. They had a right to accept or reject as much of the evidence of Smith and McElroy as they chose. Both were chauffeurs in the employ of the defendant at the time of the accident and were thoroughly familiar with the road. The jury evidently concluded that the bus was at least 125 feet away from the coup\u00e9 when the latter began to skid, as they were warranted in doing upon Smith\u2019s evidence, and that when McElroy was warned or became or should have become aware of the danger, he was some considerable distance farther east. Smith had sworn that when he warned McElroy, the latter started slowing down the bus\u2014this obviously before the coup\u00e9 had started to skid\u2014and McElroy himself had pointed out to the jury on the road plan the point he had reached east of the east end of the guard rail when he first saw the coup\u00e9. If there were no other considerations than these, I would not feel prepared to say that the jury could not in any reasonable view of the evidence find that McElroy could have avoided the collision by applying his brakes sooner and stopping the bus before reaching the point where the coup\u00e9 skidded across the road. We cannot justifiably substitute what may be our own views of the evidence upon such a question for those of the jury to whom the statute specially commits it for determination.\nThe finding therefore is, in my opinion, in itself a valid finding of ultimate negligence sufficiently supported by evidence. The question remains as to whether effect ought to be given to it as such, in the face of the finding against Koeppel. Obviously this can only be done by rejecting the latter finding as insupportable in any reasonable view of the evidence, whether regarded as a finding of contributory or of ultimate negligence. Convinced, as I am, that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the answers to questions 1 and 2 as a finding of ultimate negligence against McElroy, I am not prepared to hold, upon the whole evidence, that, but for this finding, a finding of either ultimate or contributory negligence on the part of Koeppel could not as well have been made in any reasonable view of the evidence. It is clear that both findings cannot stand either as findings of ultimate or of contributory negligence. In such a case and especially where, as here, the contest between the parties on the trial was so exclusively directed to the particular grounds of negligence set forth in the pleadings, and the learned trial judge, apparently for this reason, made no mention in his charge to the jury of McElroy\u2019s failure to apply his brakes sooner, which was the sole negligence found against him, or of the significance of the testimony with respect thereto as bearing upon the question of ultimate, as distinguished from contributory, negligence, I think that justice will best be served by ordering a new trial.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to this court should be allowed and the judgment of the Appellate Division, dismissing their action with costs and allowing the judgment of the trial court on the defendant\u2019s counter-claim for $1,610 and costs, set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiffs of the appeal here, but, in the circumstances, no order should be made for costs of the trial or on the appeal in the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacCraken, Fleming & Schroeder.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beament & Beament.\n[1] [1931] A.C. 1, at 10.\n[2] [1915] A.C. 871 at 881.\n[3] [1922] 1 A.C. 129, at 144.\n[4] [1927] Can.

(Defendant) respondent.\n1933: May 16; 1933: June 16.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u2014Accident\u2014Inexcusable fault\u2014Amount of damages\u2014Statutory discretion of the Court\u2014Section 6 of the Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 274.\nOne Joseph Geoffroy was employed as helper to one L\u00e9vesque, a millwright, in repairing some part of the interior machinery of one of three electrically operated revolving separators which were usually kept in operation together on the floor of the respondent\u2019s mill next above the blow pit floor. These separators, which were round wooden vats, were placed over what are called in the case basins, the walls of the basins being 3 to 4 feet wide, and stood about 3 feet above the level of the basin floors. There was an opening of about 18 inches diameter in the bottom of each separator. L\u00e9vesque and another millwright, Tr\u00e9panier, were instructed by one of the respondent\u2019s foremen, to make the repairs in question. The electric switch, by which it was set in motion and which was placed on a wall some 10 feet or more from the separator beside the switches by which the two other separators were started and stopped, was shut to enable the repairs to be made. While the repair work was in progress the power suddenly went off, putting out the regular lights as well as stopping all the machinery in that portion of the mill. The two millwrights resorted to an electric extension hand lamp to avoid delay in the repair work. Joseph Geoffroy was standing on the floor of the cement basin with the upper part of his body inside the separator endeavouring to continue the work with the improvised light, while his boss, L\u00e9vesque, was standing outside the separator within the basin wall, when, the electric current having been restored, the switch controlling the shaft by which the separator in question was operated was opened by one of the respondent\u2019s employees, the separator began to turn and Joseph Geoffroy was so injured that, although he was able to get himself through the opening in the bottom of the separator, he died soon afterwards. The respondent, recognizing its responsibility under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, c. 274, R.S.Q., (1925), without awaiting the appointment of a tutor to represent her infant children, paid the widow $3,000\u2014the maximum sum payable under the Act except in those cases which fall within the provisions of sec. 6\u2014and $50 additional for funeral expenses. Ladislas Geoffroy, one of the appellants, was subsequently appointed tutor to the infant children, and in his quality as such brought, with the widow of the deceased as co-plaintiff, this action to recover further compensation to an amount of $20,000 under section 6 of the Act, alleging that \u201cthe accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the\u201d respondent.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the respondent company within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The accident was one which would not have occurred if any precautions of any kind had been taken to protect the deceased in the dangerous position in which he was placed, and one for which there was no valid excuse\u2014Dujresne Construction Co. v. Morin ([1931] S.C.R. 86) applied.\nAs to the amount by which the compensation should be increased, section 6 of the Act, in authorizing the Court to increase the compensation awarded where the accident \u201cwas due to the inexcusable fault of the employer,\u201d does not contemplate compensation estimated according to the standard of full reparation as in cases under arts. 1063 and 1054 C.C.\u2014It is reasonable, in this case at all events, to limit the indemnity for the benefit of the children by reference to the principle of the enactment of section 4, ss. 2, by which compensation is payable \u201cto the legitimate children * * * to assist them to provide for themselves until they reach the full age of sixteen years or more if they are invalids.\u201d This Court, in exercising its statutory discretion, is of the opinion that a fair award would be the sum of $10,000 from which must be deducted the sum of $3,000 already paid, this amount to be apportioned one half to the tutor for the benefit of the infant children in equal shares and the other half to the deceased\u2019s widow.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Gibsone J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action to recover $20,000, as compensation for the death of one Joseph Geoffroy, who was killed while in the employ of the respondent company owing to the alleged inexcusable fault of the latter\u2019s employees.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are fully stated in the above headnote and in the judgment now reported.\nErnest Lapainte K.C. and Louis A. Pouliot K.C. for the appellants.\nAlfred Savard K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Smith and Crocket JJ. were delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec, confirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Gibsone of the Superior Court dismissing the appellants\u2019 action to recover compensation for the fatal injury of Joseph Geoffroy, father of the infants, represented by the above named tutor, and husband of the co-plaintiff, while engaged in the course of his employment in the defendant\u2019s paper mill in the city of Quebec.\nThe accident occurred on the night of December 13, 1927. There is no dispute as to the material facts. The deceased was employed as helper to one L\u00e9vesque, a millwright, in repairing some part of the interior machinery of one of three electrically operated revolving separators which were usually kept in operation together on the floor of the mill next above the low pit floor. These separators, which were round wooden vats, were placed over what are called in the case basins, the walls of the basins being 3 to 4 feet wide, and stood about 3 feet above the level of the basin floors. There was an opening of about 18 inches diameter in the bottom of each separator. L\u00e9vesque and another millwright, Tr\u00e9panier, were instructed by one of the defendant\u2019s foremen, to make the repairs in question. The electric switch, by which it was set in motion and which was placed on a wall some 10 feet or more from the separator beside the switches by which the two other separators were started and stopped, was shut to enable the repairs to be made. While the repair work was in progress the power suddenly went off, putting out the regular lights as well as stopping all the machinery in that portion of the mill. The two millwrights resorted to an electric extension hand lamp to avoid delay in the repair work. Geoffroy was standing on the floor of the cement basin with the upper part of his body inside the separator endeavouring to continue the work with the improvised light, while his boss, L\u00e9vesque, was standing outside the separator within the basin wall, when, the electric current having been restored, the switch controlling the shaft by which the separator in question was operated, was opened, the separator began to turn, and Geoffroy was so injured that, although he was able to get himself through the opening in the bottom of the separator, he died soon afterwards.\nWhen the power went off the mill superintendent sent an employee named Stapleton up to the separator room from the floor below to see to the return of the power and the light. The separator switches had nothing to do with the light. Stapleton after the return of the current proceeded to turn on the separator switches, first one and then the other, the last one being the switch connecting with the separator in which Geoffroy was working. He did so of course without knowledge that Geoffroy was working inside this separator, neither L\u00e9vesque or Tr\u00e9panier, who was standing outside the basin wall, having warned him, though both saw Stapleton open the first switch. When the latter turned on the third switch Tr\u00e9panier shouted that there was a man inside the separator, but it was too late.\nThe defendant, recognizing its responsibility under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, c. 274, R.S.Q., (1925), without awaiting the appointment of a tutor to-represent her infant children, paid the widow $3,000\u2014the maximum sum payable under the Act except in those cases which fall within the provisions of section 6, and $50 additional for funeral expenses. Ladislas Geoffroy was subsequently appointed tutor to the infant children, and in his quality as such brought this action to recover further compensation under sec. 6, which reads as follows:\u2014\n6. No compensation shall be granted if the accident was brought about intentionally by the person injured.\nThe court may reduce the compensation if the accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the workmen, or increase it if it was due to the inexcusable fault of the employer.\nThis Court in a judgment delivered by Duff J., in Dufresne Construction Co. v. Morin[1], without undertaking to lay down a definition of the word \u201cinexcusable,\u201d as used in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, unanimously declared the view that it is to be applied in its ordinary sense in the light of the context in which it occurs and of the subject-matter of the statute, quoting the dictum of Lord Cave in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Montreal Tramways v. Savignac[2], that \u201ceach case must be judged from its own facts.\u201d\nWe are of opinion that the accident was due to the inexcusable fault of the defendant company, within the meaning of the Act. It is not pretended that the deceased was himself in any way to blame. The opening of the switch by which the separator was put in motion while the deceased was within it engaged in the work he had been directed to do is inexplicable on any other ground than negligence on the part of some one or other of the defendant\u2019s employees. Whether the fault was the fault of the superintendent or Stapleton or Tr\u00e9panier or L\u00e9vesque or the foreman who directed the repairs to be made is a matter of no consequence, so far as the responsibility of the defendant is concerned. All were servants of the company acting in the course of their employment. Their acts and omissions were all alike imputable to the company as their employer under art. 1054 of the Civil Code. The accident was one which would not have occurred if any precautions of any kind had been taken to protect the deceased in the dangerous position in which he was placed, and one for which there was no valid excuse. That is all that is necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to have the maximum compensation prescribed by sec. 4 increased.\nAs to the amount by which the compensation should be increased, we accept in principle the view upon which Mr. Justice Dorion proceeded in his dissenting judgment that, in authorizing the Court to increase the compensation awarded where the accident \u201c was due to the inexcusable fault of the employer,\u201d the enactment does not contemplate compensation estimated according to the standard of full reparation, or according to some principle entirely unaffected by any considerations derived from the nature of the scheme of the Act. For example, the Court would not, we think, be justified in guiding itself by a rule that should admit, where death has not ensued, reparation for the suffering of the victim as such, apart altogether from its effect upon the victim\u2019s earning power, or the cost of providing for its alleviation. We think, moreover, that in this case at all events, it is reasonable to limit the indemnity for the benefit of the children by reference to the principle of the enactment of sec. 4, ss. 2, by which compensation is payable\nto the legitimate children * * * to assist them to provide for themselves until they reach the full age of sixteen years or more if they are invalids.\nIn the present case the children are very young and whether or not any one or more of them may fall, while still of tender years, within the class of \u201cinvalids\u201d within the meaning of the enactment, only the future can determine. This last is a point which, we think, cannot be entirely neglected by the Court in exercising its discretion under section 6.\nThe majority of the court below have not afforded us any guide. We think that, keeping in view the limitations suggested by the provisions of the Act, a fair award would be the sum of $10,000 from which must be deducted, however, the sum of $3,000 already paid, this amount to be apportioned one-half to the tutor for the benefit of the infant children in equal shares and the other half to the co-plaintiff, deceased\u2019s widow.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed and judgment entered accordingly against the defendant for $7,000, to be apportioned as stated, with costs throughout.\nCannon, j.\u2014Je crois, comme mon coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019honorable juge Crocket, que les circonstances de cette cause r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que l\u2019accident est arriv\u00e9 par une faute inexcusable du patron et de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Si ces derniers avaient, en connaissance de cause et intentionnellement agi comme ils l\u2019ont fait, ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 coupables d\u2019une acte criminel; il n\u2019en faut pas autant pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une faute inexcusable. Je crois cependant, vu qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019appliquer les articles 1053 et 1054 du code civil, que nous devons augmenter l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 en restant dans le cadre de la loi des accidents du travail, essentiellement contractuelle et forfaitaire, bas\u00e9e enti\u00e8rement sur le salaire que gagnait la victime; par cons\u00e9quent, on ne peut r\u00e9clamer quoi que ce soit qui ne repr\u00e9sente pas une partie ou, tout au plus, le total du salaire perdu par la victime. L\u2019article 2 de la loi donne droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses dispositions.\nIl faut dire cependant que, en cas de mort; la loi pourvoit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 aider \u00e0 pourvoir aux besoins des enfants jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de seize ans r\u00e9volus, ou plus s\u2019ils sont invalides. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 4 du chapitre 274 S.R.Q. 1925, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 comprend une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 quatre fois le salaire moyen annuel du d\u00e9funt au moment de l\u2019accident, ne devant dans aucun cas, sauf le cas de faute inexcusable du patron, \u00eatre moindre que $1500 ni exc\u00e9der $3000, plus $50 pour les frais de m\u00e9decins et de fun\u00e9railles.\nLa victime de la faute inexcusable de l\u2019intim\u00e9e gagnait $4.25 par jour, soit, pour 300 jours d\u2019ouvrage, $1,275 par ann\u00e9e. Mais, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 7, si la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration annuelle de l\u2019ouvrier d\u00e9passe $1,000, elle n\u2019est prise en consid\u00e9ration que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de ce montant. Pour le surplus, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 $1,500, elle ne donne droit qu\u2019au quart des indemnit\u00e9s. Au-del\u00e0 d\u2019un salaire annuel de $1,500, la loi ne s\u2019applique pas. Pour rester dans le cadre de la loi, le capital accord\u00e9, en cas de faute inexcusable du patron, ne devrait, dans aucun cas, d\u00e9passer le montant requis pour payer une rente viag\u00e8re de $1,500 \u00e0 un individu de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la victime. L\u2019honorable juge Dorion aurait accord\u00e9, en se basant, non sur le salaire de l\u2019ouvrier, mais sur les besoins de la m\u00e8re et des enfants, $6,300.\nTout en exer\u00e7ant notre discr\u00e9tion pour augmenter l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 statutaire, car il ne s\u2019agit pas dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de fixer le montant des dommages subis, je crois que nous devons surtout tenir compte du salaire que l\u2019ouvrier gagnait au moment de l\u2019accident, soit $1,275 par ann\u00e9e. Le dossier ne nous donne pas le chiffre qu\u2019une compagnie d\u2019assurance exigerait pour fournir une rente de ce montant. De plus, il ne faut pas oublier que le capital que nous accordons, tout en \u00e9tant susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre plac\u00e9 \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat, en tout ou en partie, demeurera la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la veuve et des enfants. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 seize ans, les enfants vivront des revenus et entameront probablement le capital. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, \u00e0 seize ans, \u00e0 moins d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, ils sont cens\u00e9s pourvoir eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 leurs besoins et m\u00eame \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019aider leur m\u00e8re. Cette derni\u00e8re devra tout probablement encore compter sur sa part du capital pour vivre, m\u00eame quand les enfants ne seront plus l\u00e9galement \u00e0 sa charge.

On the first point, Cannon J. stated further that these goods were extra commercium and therefore unseizable. He expressed no opinion on the second point which he deems unnecessary to decide the appeal.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, reversing, Tellier C.J. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court, P. Cousineau J.[1] and dismissing the demand made by His Majesty the King, by way of an opposition to withdraw, to enforce against the respondent, as lessor, the forfeiture of certain moveable property, which had been declared forfeited for violation of the Excise Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and Ivan Sabourin for the appellant.\nG. Barclay K.C. and Geo. Fortin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Smith and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The controversy in this appeal concerns the question whether goods seized as forfeited under the Excise Act, to which s. 125 of that statute applies, and in the possession of the Crown as such, in leased premises in the province of Quebec, are subject to seizure at the instance of the landlord in proceedings by way of saisie-gagerie and to sale to satisfy the landlord\u2019s claim for rent.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench has held that this question should be answered in the affirmative. We have come to the conclusion that a negative answer is dictated by the enactments of the Excise Act.\nA very brief account of the facts will, perhaps, be useful. On the 4th of July, 1930, officers of the excise seized in the name of His Majesty certain goods, a number of gallons of ethyl acetate and the machinery and equipment consisting of boilers, tanks, pumps, still and accessories in the premises of the National Chemical Co. at Iberville as forfeited to His Majesty for violation of the Excise Act. The company had a licence for operating a chemical still but none for manufacturing beer or spirits. A sample of the spirits found was sent to the department which was informed that the \u201caccused\u201d had offered no explanation of the presence of the spirits on the premises. In the \u201copposition afin de distraire\u201d filed subsequently in the Superior Court on behalf of His Majesty, it is alleged that the company had made use of\nces objets ill\u00e9galement, ces articles ayant comme question de fait servi \u00e0 manufacturer ill\u00e9galement l\u2019alcool, contrairement aux dispositions de la loi de l\u2019accise et ces dits objets pouvant pour ces raisons \u00eatre saisis en vertu de l\u2019article 125 de la loi de l\u2019accise, et l\u2019opposant ayant aussi le droit de saisir ainsi ces objets et de les confisquer; et les objets sont ainsi sous saisie et confisqu\u00e9s depuis le 4 juillet 1930, en vertu de la loi de l\u2019accise et des r\u00e8glements du department qui en fait partie, \u00e9tant depuis cette date sous la garde constante des officiers du department;\nThe National Chemical Co. having abandoned the premises, the articles seized on the 4th July remained in the custody of the officers of excise and in the possession of the Crown and were in such custody and possession on the 15th November, 1930. On that date, the respondent, the landlord of the premises, initiated proceedings by way of saisie-gagerie against the National Chemical Co., the tenant, and on the same day caused the property mentioned, in the possession of the Crown, to be attached.\nThe declaration having been filed on the 20th November claimed $600 for arrears of rent, $750 for rent for the residue of the term, possession of the demised premises and sale of the goods seized and payment of the landlord\u2019s claim by way of preference, and the Crown, on the 29th December, filed an \u201copposition afin de distraire\u201d alleging that the Crown was the sole proprietor of the goods seized on the 4th July praying a declaration to that effect and a direction to the bailiff to release the goods from the seizure under the saisie-gagerie.\nSome question was raised on the argument as to the effect of the seizure of the 4th July and as to its character as well. The point was not raised in the courts below and\n(1932) Q.R. 70 S.C. 446. the evidence on the point is quite sufficient. It is not open to question on that evidence, that the goods were seized, and \u201cseized as forfeited\u201d for violation of the Excise Act. Nor is there any room for doubt as to the effect of such a seizure. It proceeds upon the assumption that the goods, having been forfeited ipso jure, in consequence of the violation of the Act, are at the time of seizure, and not as a consequence of it, the property of the Crown. There are several provisions of the statute under which forfeiture supervenes upon the commission of the offence, as a legal consequence of the offence, independently of any act on the part of the officers of excise or any conviction or other judgment of a court. Section 97, for example, under which in this case the officers seem to have been proceeding provides,\n97. Every steam-engine, boiler, mill, still, worm rectifying apparatus, fermenting-tun, mash-tub, cistern, couchframe, machine, vessel, tub, cask, pipe or cock, with the contents thereof, and all stores or stocks of grain, spirits, malt, beer, tobacco, cigars, drugs or other materials or commodities which are in any premises or place subject to excise, shall be forfeited to the Crown, and be dealt with accordingly, if any fraud against the revenue is committed in any such place or premises, or if the owner of any such place, premises, apparatus, goods or commodities, his agent or any person employed by him, or any person having lawful possession or control of such place, premises, apparatus, goods, or commodities, is discovered in the act of committing, or is convicted of committing any act in or about such place or premises which is declared by this Act to be an indictable offence.\nThe enactments of the statute make effective provision for the protection of the Crown\u2019s possession of goods after forfeiture. Section 79, for instance, is in these words,\n79. If any stock, steam-engine, boiler, still, fermenting-tun, machinery, apparatus, vessel or utensil, boat, vessel, vehicle or other article or commodity is forfeited under the provisions of this Act, for any violation thereof, it may be seized by the collector or other officer, or by any other person acting by the authority of such officer, at any time after the commission of the offence for which it is forfeited, and may be marked, detained, removed, sold or otherwise secured until condemned or released by competent authority, and shall not, while under seizure, be used by the offender; and if condemned, it shall be removed, sold or otherwise dealt with as the Minister directs.\nMoreover, by force of the Act, certain definitely stated consequences flow from the seizure itself where the goods are \u201cseized as forfeited\u201d. S. 116 provides as follows:\n116. Every person who, whether pretending to be the owner or not, either secretly or openly, and whether with or without force or violence, takes or carries away any goods, vessel, carriage or other thing which has been seized or detained on suspicion, as forfeited under this Act, before the same has been declared by competent authority to have been seized without due cause, and without the permission of the officer or person who seized the same, or of some competent authority, shall be deemed to have stolen such goods, vessel, carriage or other thing, being the property of His Majesty, and is guilty of theft and liable to three years\u2019 imprisonment.\nIt is convenient here to call attention also to s. 133 of the statute which is in these words,\n133. All forfeitures and penalties under this Act, after deducting the expenses in connection therewith, shall, unless it is otherwise expressly provided, belong to His Majesty for the public uses of Canada: * * *\nA good deal turns upon the effect of these sections and it is better that that should be now explained. But, first of all, attention ought to be called to the decision of this court in The King v. Krakowec[2], which deals with the words of s. 181. It was there held that the scope of the forfeiture contemplated by the Act could not be limited to the particular interest of the person or persons involved in the offence giving rise to it, but that it operates to vest in the Crown the absolute property of the thing forfeited.\nI shall assume for the moment that the contention of the Crown is correct as to the effect of s. 125, viz., that in the events that happened the goods in question were, in point of law, condemned as forfeited to the Crown. At the time, therefore, of the attachment of the goods under the landlord\u2019s proceedings the goods were the property of the Crown. They were by force of s. 79 held by the Crown under the statutory enactment that they \u201cshall be removed, sold or otherwise dealt with as the Minister directs\u201d. By s. 133 they belonged \u201cto His Majesty for the public use of Canada\u201d. By the general law, being the property of the Crown, they were in the Crown\u2019s possession, but s. 116, which has just been quoted, deals with the possession of goods seized as forfeited in a very specific way before such goods have\nbeen declared by some competent authority to be seized without due cause and without the permission of the officer or person who seized the same or some other competent authority.\nIf they are taken or carried away, with or without force or violence, by any person, they are deemed to have been stolen and the person having taken or carried them away is taken to be guilty of theft and liable to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The act, therefore, of interfering with the possession of the excise officer in such circumstances is an illegal act, and any authority which might otherwise have been derived from Art. 1622 C.C. or any of the articles of the Code of Civil Procedure is overridden by the paramount force of the Dominion statute.\nThe argument for the respondent very largely centered upon the effect of s. 125 which is, accordingly, reproduced in its entirety:\n125. All vehicles, vessels, goods and other things seized as forfeited under this Act or any other Act relating to excise, or to trade or navigation, shall be deemed and taken to be condemned, and may be dealt with accordingly, unless the person from whom they were seized, or the owner thereof, within one month from the day of seizure, gives notice in writing to the seizing officer, the collector in the excise division in which such goods were seized, or superior officer, that he claims or intends to claim the same.\n2. The collector at the place where the seized articles are secured, or any superior officer, may order the delivery thereof to the owner, on receiving security by bond with two sufficient sureties, to be first approved by such collector or superior officer, for double the value in case of condemnation.\n3. If such seized articles are condemned, the value thereof shall be forthwith paid to the collector and the bond cancelled; otherwise the penalty of such bond shall be enforced and recovered.\n4. Such bond shall be taken to His Majesty\u2019s use in the name of the collector or superior officer, and shall be delivered to and kept by such collector or superior officer.\nThere does not appear to be any ground of substance for imputing ambiguity or obscurity to this language or even doubt as to what is signifies. In light of the provisions of the statute the phrase \u201cseized as forfeited\u201d can have only one meaning, as already indicated. It can only mean a seizure in consequence of the goods having been forfeited, the title to which has, by virtue of the forfeiture, become vested to the Crown. The context shews also that it does not contemplate a forfeiture which has occurred in consequence of a condemnation, and beyond question it includes a forfeiture following, without any act or proceeding of the Crown\u2019s officers, the commission of the offence, in cases in which the statute under which the forfeiture takes effect so provides.\nWhat then follows? \u201cAll * * * goods * * * seized as forfeited\u201d, the section declares, \u201cshall be deemed and taken to be condemned and may be dealt with accordingly,\u201d unless the owner or the person from whom they are taken gives notice within one month that he intends to claim them. The consequence that the goods shall \u201cbe deemed and taken to be condemned\u201d is declared, in unqualified words, to be the consequence of the seizure unless the notice provided for is given within the specified time. If the notice is given, the seizing officer may deliver up the goods to the owner on receiving security by bond with sureties for double the value of the goods, to be available in the event of condemnation. In the absence of notice within one month, condemnation follows by force of the statute. If notice is given, the statute contemplates the usual proceedings for establishing the grounds of forfeiture and condemnation accordingly.\nMr. Barclay argued forcefully that the requirements of s. 124 must be observed before the condemnation declared by s. 125 could take effect.\nIt is plain from a mere inspection of these two sections that they are dealing with different things. S. 125 provides for a condemnation by force of the statute itself in the absence of notice. If notice is given, proceedings for condemnation will in the ordinary course follow, in which case the enactments of s. 124 may come into play, but in the absence of notice it is too clear for argument that no such proceedings are contemplated.\nIt was vigorously urged upon us that under this construction, s. 125 flagrantly violates the principle audi alteram partem. But, in truth, it is doubtful whether the provision for notice by posting in s. 124 affords any protection for the parties concerned more efficacious than that of s. 77, which directs the officer concerned in cases of seizure of property \u201cas forfeited\u201d to furnish one copy of the schedule to the person from whom the seizure is made, or to forward it to his last known post office address by registered letter.\nIt will be observed indeed that s. 125 embraces seizures not only under the Excise Act, but also under \u201cany other act relating to excise or to trade or navigation,\u201d while the scope of s. 124 is restricted to proceedings in respect of things seized under the Excise Act and is not necessarily limited to cases where the things are \u201cseized as forfeited\u201d.\nIn the course of his able argument, Mr. Barclay very properly called our attention to sections 163 and 164 of the Customs Act which deal with the effect of seizure of goods \u201cas forfeited\u201d by the officers of the Customs. There the words are, All such vessels, goods or other things seized as forfeited shall be deemed and taken to be condemned without suit, information or proceedings of any kind and may be sold. * * *\nThe difference in language, he contends, manifests a difference in intention and he asks us to infer from the absence from s. 125 of the words corresponding to the closing words of the sentence just quoted, that s. 125 contemplates only a condemnation after a proceeding in the ordinary course. If the language of s. 125 were ambiguous it might be permissible to resort to s. 164 for assistance. But, we repeat, the language of the former section is not ambiguous. Indeed, the phrase \u201cshall be deemed and be taken to be condemned\u201d manifests in the plainest way that an actual condemnation by judgment after suit is not what the section has in view, and the words in the Customs Act \u201cwithout suit, information or proceedings of any kind,\u201d if inserted in s. 125 would be redundant. The legislature had in view a condemnation by construction of law taking effect the moment the prescribed conditions come into being. In modern statutes parsimony of words is not the rule. Redundancy, as every lawyer knows, is very common; in consequence, no doubt, of the necessity of meeting the difficulties suggested sometimes by inexpert persons during the passage of measures through Parliament. It would be a perilous proceeding to modify the effect of the unequivocal words of one statute by reference to the more copious style employed in a cognate provision of some enactment in pari materia.\nThis is sufficient for the disposition of the appeal in favour of the appellant, but we ought not, we think, to take leave of the case without dealing with the decision of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench upon a question of fundamental importance and significance. That question is nothing less than this\u2014whether under a writ in the King\u2019s name, issued out of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, goods which are the property of His Majesty and in the possession of His Majesty\u2019s officers can be seized and sold to satisfy a pecuniary claim of a subject. With great respect, in our opinion, the decision upon this point cannot be supported.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we shall assume that the landlord has a privilege upon the goods of His Majesty situated on the demised premises in the sense that in a proper proceeding by petition of right, in the proper court, he could have the goods sold and out of the proceeds have payment, by preference, of his claim for rent. It will, we think, be convenient first of all to state the doctrine of the English law as to the recourse given to a subject in respect of claims against His Majesty.\nIn respect of torts, the law permits no redress against the Crown. In respect of, perhaps, every other claim based upon legal right: for example for specific recovery of goods, recovery of land, for the enforcement of contract and, no doubt, for the enforcement of such a right as a landlord possesses in the goods of his tenant or of other persons who leave their property on the demised premises, the law permits such recourse by petition of right (The Abbott of Feversham\u2019s case, 4 Edw. III[3]; although, of course, no order can be made against the Crown in such proceedings in the sense in which an order can be made against a subject (Dominion Building Corp. v. The King (P.C.) 9 May, 1933[4].\nApart, however, from such remedies as the subject has by way of petition of right and in some special cases by statute, the rule is a rigorous one that His Majesty cannot be impleaded in any of His courts and this rule is just as rigorous in the case of an action in rem in which the proceeding is against some property belonging to His Majesty (The Scotia)[5]. It is true that under modern procedure in certain cases a proceeding may be taken for a declaration of right by a subject against the Attorney General and in other cases where the interests of the Crown appear to be involved in litigation the Attorney General may be made a party (Dyson v. Attorney General[6]; E. & N. Ely. Co. v. Wilson[7]; but the rule is absolute that no proceeding having for its purpose the issue of any process against His Majesty himself or against any of His Majesty\u2019s property is competent in any of His Majesty\u2019s courts.\nFor our present purpose the reason for this rule may, perhaps, best be stated in the words of Blackstone who wrote in November, 1765, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1876, 1 Kerr 214-5), And, first, the law ascribes to the king, \u201cor queen regnant,\u201d the attribute of sovereignty or pre-eminence. \u201cRex est vicarious,\u201d says Bracton, \u201cet minister Dei in terra: omnis quidem sub eo est, et ipse sub nullo, nisi tantum sub Deo\u201d He is said to have imperial dignity; and in charters before the conquest is frequently styled basileus and imperator, the titles respectively assumed by the emperors of the East and West. His realm is declared to be an empire, and his crown imperial, by many acts of parliament, particularly the statutes of 24 Hen. VIII, c. 12, and 25 Hen., VIII, c. 28; which at the same time declare the King to be the supreme head of the realm in matters both civil and ecclesiastical, and of consequence inferior to no man upon earth, dependent on no man, accountable to no man. Formerly there prevailed a ridiculous notion, propagated by the German and Italian civilians, that an emperor could do many things which a king could not, as the creation of notaries and the like; and that all kings were in some degree subordinate and subject to the Emperor of Germany or Rome. The meaning, therefore, of the legislature, when it uses these terms of empire and imperial, and applies them to the realm and Crown of England, is only to assert that our king is equally sovereign and independent within these his dominions, as any emperor is in his empire; and owes no kind of subjection to any other potentate upon earth. Hence it is, that no suit or action can be brought against the sovereign, even in civil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction over him. For all jurisdiction implies superiority of power; authority to try would be vain and idle, without an authority to redress; and the sentence of a court would be contemptible unless that court had power to command the execution of it; but who, says Finch, shall command the king? Hence it is, likewise, that by the law the person of the sovereign is sacred, even though the measures pursued in his reign be completely tyrannical and arbitrary: for no jurisdiction upon earth has power to try him in a criminal way; much less to condemn him to punishment. If any foreign jurisdiction had this power, . . . . the independence of the kingdom would be no more; and if such a power were vested in any domestic tribunal, there would soon be an end of the constitution, by destroying the free agency of one of the constituent parts of the legislative power.\nThis passage is adopted by the Court of Appeal in The Parlement Belge[8] with this comment:\nIn this passage, which has often been cited and relied on, the reason of the exemption is the character of the sovereign authority, its high dignity, whereby it is not subject to any superior authority of any kind.\nIt follows from this that no process of execution can issue against His Majesty or His Majesty\u2019s property from any of His Majesty\u2019s courts.\nIt has sometimes been said that this immunity of the sovereign from processual coercion, \u201cthe grandest of his immunities\u201d, to use the words of Maitland (Pollock & Maitland\u2019s History of English Law, Vol. I, 1st Ed., p. 502) rests upon the principle that the King by his writ cannot command himself, and this was laid down in the Sadler\u2019s case[9]; the immunity has also been ascribed to the fact that the courts are the King\u2019s own courts and to the same principle as that of the immunity of the feudal seigneur from process in his seigneurial court.\nBut Blackstone, probably, expressed with accuracy the view which generally prevailed among constitutional lawyers in the year in which the Quebec Act was passed. By s. 8 of that statute it is provided,\nAnd be it further enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all His Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects within the Province of Quebec, the religious Orders and Communities excepted, may also hold and enjoy their Property and Possessions, together with all Customs and Wages relative thereto, and all other their Civil Rights, in as large, ample, and beneficial Manner, as if the said Proclamations, Commissions, Ordinances, and other Acts and Instruments, had not been made, and as may consist with their Allegiance to His Majesty, and Subjection to the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain; and that in all Matters of Controversy, relative to Property and Civil Rights, resort shall be had to the laws of Canada, as the Rule for the Decision of the same; and all Causes that shall hereafter be instituted in any of the Courts of Justice, to be appointed within and for the said Province by his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, shall, with respect to such Property and Rights, be determined agreeably to the said Laws and Customs of Canada, until they shall be varied or altered by any Ordinance that shall, from Time to Time, be passed in the said Province by the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or Commander in Chief, for the Time being, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council of the same, to be appointed in Manner hereinafter mentioned.\nIt is to be observed that the part of the enactment which is of immediate practical importance is that\nin all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort shall be had to the laws of Canada for the decision of the same; and all causes that shall hereafter be instituted in any of the courts of justice, to be appointed within and for the said province by His Majesty, his heirs and successors, shall, with respect to such property and rights, be determined agreeably to the said laws and customs of Canada until they shall be varied or altered by any ordinances which shall from time to time be passed in the said province. \u2026\nAll this is subject, of course, as appears plainly from the language of the enactment to the proviso that such rules must be such as consist with the allegiance of the inhabitants to His Majesty, and their \u201csubjection to the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain.\u201d\nAs foreshadowed in this enactment, a superior court of general jurisdiction was set up for the province in 1777 under the ordinance of that year. The court is described as a court of civil jurisdiction to be called the Court of Common Pleas and it is provided that appeal may be taken to the Governor in Council with a final appeal to His Majesty in Council. In the same year a further ordinance was enacted \u201cTo regulate the proceedings in the courts of civil judicature in the province of Quebec\u201d. Article 1 is in these words,\nIn all causes or matters or property exceeding the sum or value of ten pounds sterling upon a declaration presented to any one of the judges of the court of common pleas, by any person setting forth the grounds of his complaint against a defendant, and praying an order to compel him to appear and answer thereto; such judge shall be, and hereby is empowered and required, in his separate district, to grant a writ of summons, in the language of the defendant, issuing forth in his majesty\u2019s name, tested and signed by one of the judges, and directed to the sheriff of the district, to summon the defendant to appear and answer the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, on some certain future day, regard being had to the distance of the defendant\u2019s abode from the place where the court sits; but if the judges, or any two of them, are satisfied by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or otherwise, that the defendant is indebted to him, and on the point of leaving the province, whereby the plaintiff might be deprived of his remedy against him, it shall be lawful for the said judges, or any two of them, to grant an attachment against the body of such defendant and hold him to bail, and in default of bail, to commit him to prison until the determination of the action against him. The declaration shall in all cases accompany the writ, and the plaintiff shall not be permitted to amend it, until the defendant shall have answered the matter therein contained, nor afterwards, without paying such reasonable costs as the court may ascertain.\nBy Article 4 (14) the execution sued out of any of the courts of civil jurisdiction shall be a writ issuing in the King\u2019s name.\nIt does not seem to be a proposition seriously open to debate that the courts contemplated by s. 8 of the Act of 1774, or that the courts set up by the ordinances just mentioned, were to be the King\u2019s courts in the ordinary sense of that phrase as known to English lawyers. The proposition, at all events, seems to be demonstrable that the court established by the first of the ordinances mentioned, the proceedings of which were regulated by the second, was one of the King\u2019s courts in that sense. The writ of summons which initiates the proceedings is a writ in the King\u2019s name; the writ of execution is a writ in the King\u2019s name. It would appear to follow that this legislation does not in any way contemplate the invasion of the immunity of the Crown already mentioned, that is to say, from being impleaded and from having his property subjected to any execution issued out of the court. These observations apply to the Code of Civil Procedure as originally brought into force by which it is provided,\n43. Toute action devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure commence par un bref d\u2019assignation au nom du souverain; sauf les exceptions contenues dans ce code, et les autres cas auxquels il est pourvu par les lois particuli\u00e8res.\nand by Art. 545,\nLe jugement du tribunal ne peut \u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution qu\u2019au moyen d\u2019un bref \u00e9manant au nom du Souverain et adress\u00e9 au sh\u00e9rif du district (o\u00f9 il doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.)\nCe bref est attest\u00e9 et sign\u00e9 comme les brefs introductifs de l\u2019action, et scell\u00e9 du sceau du tribunal, et il doit contenir la date du jugement \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter, et fixer le jour o\u00f9 il doit \u00eatre rapport\u00e9 au tribunal.\nThese articles point with no uncertainty to the conclusion that the superior courts are the King\u2019s courts; and that the immunities of His Majesty in respect to the process of his own courts are not intended to be trenched upon.\nOn the argument, a good deal was said as to the distinction between major and minor prerogatives and public and private law as bearing upon this subject of the Crown\u2019s immunities in respect of legal proceedings. Such distinctions may be exceedingly useful for the purposes of exposition but we doubt if a line can be drawn between major and minor prerogatives or between public and private law with sufficient precision to provide a guide for the determination of individual cases. We think it is very clear that there is nothing in the Act of 1774 or in the legislation establishing the courts of Quebec or in the Civil Code or in the Code of Civil Procedure justifying an inference that there was any intention of in any way impairing this immunity.\nThere was some difference of judicial opinion in Quebec whether or not prior to the statute presently to be mentioned the courts in Quebec had jurisdiction to entertain a petition of right (Laporte v. Les Principaux officiers d\u2019Artillerie[10]). In 1883, however, a statute (46 Vic, c. 27) was enacted to make provision for the institution of suits against the Crown by petition of right which is now reproduced in effect in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Arts. 1011 et seq.) The first section of that statute (now Art. 1011, C.C.P.) purports to define the circumstances in which a petition of right will lie and is expressed in comprehensive terms which, no doubt, embrace all the cases in which a petition would be proper at common law. In 1876 a statute (39 Vic, c. 27) regulating the procedure in respect of petitions of right was passed by the Dominion Parliament. It is in substance embodied in R.S.C., 1927, c. 158. That statute assumes, no doubt rightly, that the cases in which a petition would lie to the sovereign in right of the Dominion would be determined by the common law and by any other statute dealing with the subject; the respondent\u2019s claim, if well founded in point of substantive law, could, no doubt, have been put forward under the procedure instituted by that enactment.\nThe question does not at present arise whether an action claiming a declaration without consequential relief as against the Attorney General affecting the rights of the Crown could, in any and, if so, in what circumstances, be competent in the Superior Court of Quebec.\nThe respondents rely upon the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Exchange Bank v. The Queen[11]. In that case Lord Hobhouse, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said,\nTheir Lordships think it clear not only that the Crown is bound by the codes, but that the subject of priorities is exhaustively dealt with by them, so that the Crown can claim no priority except what is allowed by them.\nIt would be extending the language of their Lordships beyond its legitimate scope so to apply it as to give to the subject in all cases the same remedy against the Crown as against the private individuals. Arts. 1053 and 1054 C.C., for example, give, as against individuals, a right of action for quasi d\u00e9lit and the Code of Civil Procedure requires that all proceedings shall be initiated by a writ of summons issued in the King\u2019s name. It would be a strange thing, indeed, if the effect of these provisions was to give to the subject a right of action in tort against the Crown by a proceeding commenced in the King\u2019s own name. In truth, in the Exchange Bank v. The Queen11, their Lordships were discussing a subject dealt with, and as they held, dealt with exhaustively, by the Code of Civil Procedure. It is well to remember that, in applying the decisions of the Privy Council, one must have regard to the rule stated by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern[12], to the effect that every judgment must be read secundum subjectam materiam. The appeal should be allowed and the intervention granted with costs throughout.\nCannon J.\u2014La saisie-gagerie faite et pratiqu\u00e9e dans une cause est une mesure provisionnelle pour conserver le privil\u00e8ge du locateur sur le produit de la vente en justice des effets saisis.\nL\u2019article 1591 C.C. nous dit que les ventes forc\u00e9es en ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un jugement sont sujettes aux r\u00e8gles applicables aux contrats de vente.\nL\u2019article 1486 C.C. dit:\nPeut \u00eatre vendue toute chose qui n\u2019est pas hors du commerce, soit par sa nature ou sa destination, soit par une disposition sp\u00e9ciale de la loi,\nconfirmant le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pos\u00e9 par l\u2019article 1059 C.C. qu\u2019\nil n\u2019y a que les choses qui sont dans le commerce qui puissent \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019une obligation.\nL\u2019article 399 C.C. nous dit que les biens qui appartiennent \u00e0 l\u2019Etat sont r\u00e9gis par le droit public ou par les lois administratives.\nOr, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire de The King v.

Williams Machinery & Supply Company, Limited (Intervenant) Appellant;\nand\nDame Marie Stella Morin (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: May 12; 1933: June 28.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nContract\u2014Agreement called lease and promise of sale\u2014Whether valid as such as to third party\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Conditional sale\u2014Claim for rent\u2014Saisie-gagerie\u2014Right of vendor of goods to recover same\u2014Art. 1622 C.C.\u2014Bankruptcy\u2014Writ issued without leave of court\u2014Nullity\u2014Section 126 of the Bankruptcy Act\u2014Art. 871 C.C.P.\nOn the 2nd day of April, 1928, the respondent, widow of one Geo. Vezina, entered into an agreement, entitled \u201cLease and promise of sale,\u201d to transfer an immoveable property to an incorporated company, \u201cGeo. Vezina Ltd.,\u201d for a sum of $26,000, of which $10,000 was paid cash and $16,000 payable in deferred payments twice a year, with interest half-yearly on the unpaid balance. The agreement was passed before a notary under the form of a lease at a rental equivalent to the deferred (payments plus the interest on the unpaid balance, with an additional right of the lessee to have the property transferred to it for the sum of one dollar upon the expiration of the term and full payment of the \u201crents\u201d or deferred instalments and interest. On December 1, 1930, the Vezina Company did not pay the \u201crent\u201d then due, and on the 3rd of the same month made an assignment. The \u201cbilan\" signed by the bankrupt, which was sent and received by the respondent, described her as an hypothecary creditor for $14,000, and not as a privileged creditor for rent as a lessor. Moreover the respondent filed with the trustees a sworn claim for $14,391.50 for balance due and interest on a lease and promise of sale. In May, 1930, the Vezina Company had bought certain machines from the appellant company on the usual terms and conditions of conditional sales contract and payments were made regularly until the Vezina Company went into liquidation. The machines remained in the premises of the Vezina Company with the consent of all parties so as to enable the trustees to effect a more favorable sale of the assets; but in July, 1931, the appellant company, with the trustees\u2019 consent, decided to repossess the machines and secure their return to Montreal. Before the appellant could do so, the respondent secured, without leave of the court, the issuance of a writ of saisie-gagerie and seized the machines in satisfaction of \u201crents\u201d then due. The appellant company filed an intervention demanding the dismissal of the seizure.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the appellant company\u2019s intervention should have been granted.\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ.\u2014Although the transaction above described may be valid in all its terms as between the parties, the privilege given by art. 1622 C.C. and the use of the procedure therein provided cannot be invoked by the respondent under the circumstances of the case.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The respondent by filing her claim with the trustees in bankruptcy for the balance of the purchase price and not for \u201crents,\u201d elected to act as unpaid vendor and could not, six months afterwards, substitute to this remedy, or add to it, a claim for rent in order to exercise a privilege on appellant\u2019s property under article 1622 C.C.\nHeld, also, that the proceeding (writ of saisie-gagerie) initiated by the respondent was incompetent, as having been taken without leave of the court. (Bankruptcy Act, s. 126\u2014Art. 871 C.C.P.)\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Bouffard J., and dismissing the appellant company\u2019s intervention.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and L. H. Ballantyne for the appellant.\nF. J. Gosselin for the respondent.\nThe judgments of Duff C.J. and Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ. were delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014The instrument of the 2nd of April, 1928, is not difficult to construe. The language is plain. The effect of it is that the parties have entered into an agreement to sell the property with which the instrument is concerned for a nominal price to be paid partly in cash and, as to the residue, in deferred payments, with interest half-yearly from time to time on the unpaid balance. The transaction is clothed in the form of a lease at a rental equivalent to the deferred payments plus the interest on the unpaid balance, with an additional right of the lessee to have the property transferred to him for the sum of one dollar upon the expiration of the term and full payment of the deferred instalments and interest.\nAs between the parties I am unable to see why such a transaction may not be valid. But, as regards the goods of others on the premises with their consent, an entirely different question arises. I do not think art. 1622 C.C. contemplates the invocation of the principle there given, and the use of the procedure therein provided for, in a case like this. On that ground alone I think the appeal should succeed.\nThere is another ground on which, in my opinion, the proceedings initiated by the vendor must fail. I see no reason to differ with the view taken by the Court of King\u2019s Bench in Workman v. Lamarre[1] in respect of the effect of s. 126 of the Bankruptcy Act and of Art. 871 C.C.P. The effect of that decision is that a proceeding such as that in question here, in the absence of leave by the Superior Court, is incompetent.\nThe court below seems to have thought that the trustee alone is entitled to raise this exception. With great respect, I am unable to agree with this view. The proceeding being incompetent, it cannot be used for the purpose of seizing and selling in invitum the goods of anybody and any person against whom the proceeding is directed for that purpose, is entitled to resist on the ground that the whole thing is illegal.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed and the appellant\u2019s intervention should be granted with costs throughout.\nCannon, J.\u2014Le 2 avril 1928, par un acte intitul\u00e9 \u201cBail et Promesse de Vente\u201d, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Dame Marie-Stella Morin, veuve de M.

Il appert aux conventions de vente conditionnelle que ces machines devaient \u00eatre install\u00e9es sur les pr\u00e9misses faisant l\u2019objet du contrat ci-dessus, dont Georges V\u00e9zina, Limit\u00e9e, d\u00e9clarait \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire.\nSur la foi de ces repr\u00e9sentations, l\u2019intervenante ne donna pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avis requis par l\u2019article 1622 du code civil, ne croyant pas \u00e0 l\u2019existence possible d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge pour loyer.\nGeorges V\u00e9zina, Limit\u00e9e, tomba en faillite le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1930.\nLe 5 d\u00e9cembre 1930, la compagnie d\u00e9posa son bilan et porta \u00e0 son actif les immeubles en question, avec boutique, maison et autres b\u00e2tisses dessus construites, \u00e9valu\u00e9es \u00e0 $15,400, avec, en outre, machinerie et outillage \u00e9valu\u00e9s \u00e0 $21,400.81. Le nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e para\u00eet comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re hypoth\u00e9caire en vertu d\u2019une obligation pour $14,190.\nLe 10 d\u00e9cembre 1930, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u copie du bilan, produisit sa d\u00e9claration solennelle entre les mains des syndics, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la compagnie \u00e9tait, \u00e0 la date du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1930, justement endett\u00e9e envers elle pour la somme de $14,391.50 et qu\u2019aucune personne en son nom avait, sur son ordre, \u00e0 sa connaissance ou \u00e0 son avis, eu ou re\u00e7u paiement ou garantie d\u2019aucune sorte, sauf et except\u00e9 comme suit:\nLe montant qui m\u2019est d\u00fb consiste en une balance due et les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur un bail et promesse de vente consenti \u00e0 Georges V\u00e9zina Limit\u00e9e.\nIl para\u00eet donc par ces documents que, lors de la faillite, les parties \u00e0 la promesse de vente ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme non avenu le terme accord\u00e9 pour le paiement des $16,000, et la compagnie a opt\u00e9 et voulu s\u2019acquitter en payant par anticipation \u00e0 la partie de premi\u00e8re part par les versements \u00e0 \u00e9cheoir; et cette d\u00e9claration au bilan signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e semble suffisante pour constituer l\u2019avis \u00e9crit de trois mois de faire tel paiement d\u2019avance. La promesse de vendre, unilat\u00e9rale jusque-l\u00e0, \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9e, pour sa r\u00e9alisation, \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 de l\u2019acheteuse \u00e9ventuelle; cette derni\u00e8re ayant manifest\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 d\u2019acheter, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pouvait pas se d\u00e9rober \u00e0 sa promesse (Voir: 10 Planiol & Ripert, Droit Civil fran\u00e7ais, page 187). En effet, elle semble elle-m\u00eame avoir accept\u00e9 cette situation et avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 agir en vertu du bail pour ex\u00e9cuter la stipulation de promesse de vente. Elle pouvait, dans les trois mois du 1er d\u00e9cembre 1930, \u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme en arr\u00e9rage, demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat. Loin de le faire, elle a produit sa r\u00e9clamation comme susdit. De consentement mutuel, Ton peut donc dire, la compagnie a pris possession comme propri\u00e9taire des immeubles en question; et la demanderesse, renon\u00e7ant \u00e0 agir comme propri\u00e9taire ou locatrice, a produit sa r\u00e9clamation pour la balance du prix de vente convenu.\nTelle \u00e9tait la situation en d\u00e9cembre 1930. Or, l\u2019intervenante, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e au bilan, obtint, le 16 juillet 1931, des syndics \u00e0 la faillite l\u2019autorisation de reprendre les machineries vendues \u00e0 la compagnie et envoya son repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 Chicoutimi dans ce but. C\u2019est alors que la demanderesse a cru devoir reprendre vis-\u00e0-vis de la compagnie la position de locatrice et a pris une saisie-gagerie des meubles meublants et effets mobiliers garnissant l\u2019immeuble en question, demandant, longtemps apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai de trois mois stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019acte, la r\u00e9siliation du contrat et la somme de $2,351.80 comme suit:\n1930\nD\u00e9cembre\n1.\nA terme \u00e9chu le 1er d\u00e9c. 1930 . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .\n$ 500 00\n\u201c\n1.\nA int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 6% sur balance prix vente $14,000\ndu 1er juin 1930 au 1er d\u00e9cembre 1930 . . . . . . .\n420 00\n\u201c\n1.\nA int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% sur arr\u00e9rage de $920 du 1er\nd\u00e9cembre 1930 au 1er juin 1931 . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n36 80\n\u201c\n16.\nA \u2018balance due sur prime d\u2019assurance feu . . . . .\n208 20\n\u201c\nA int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 8% sur $208.20 du 16 d\u00e9cembre 1930 au 1er juin 1931 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n7 60\n1931\nJanvier\n4.\nPolice n\u00b0 59573 Dominion Fire Ins.

L\u2019huissier ayant saisi les machineries qui sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 incontest\u00e9e de l\u2019intervenante, cette derni\u00e8re intervint pour prendre le fait et cause de la d\u00e9fenderesse, autant que cela pourrait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire, demanda le renvoi de l\u2019action et conclut, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire des machines saisies lui appartenant et \u00e0 ce que la saisie f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle et de nul effet.\nLes mis-en-cause B\u00e9dard & B\u00e9langer ont comparu sur l\u2019action principale mais n\u2019ont pas plaid\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 cette intervention et a pr\u00e9tendu n\u2019avoir jamais re\u00e7u avis du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intervenante avant l\u2019institution de l\u2019action; et elle all\u00e8gue la stipulation du contrat \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la promesse de vente est compl\u00e8tement distincte du bail, qui devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, pendant et apr\u00e8s sa dur\u00e9e, comme si cette promesse n\u2019e\u00fbt jamais exist\u00e9; que les relations entre elle et la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9taient celles de locatrice et de locataire; et qu\u2019elle avait, en cons\u00e9quence, le droit de faire saisir gager les meubles de l\u2019intervenante en la possession de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nCes pr\u00e9tentions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenues par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi, avec la dissidence de MM. les juges Rivard et Hall.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer que la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de Gravel v. Massicotte[2], avait devant elle un document qui contenait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la clause invoqu\u00e9e ici par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que\nla promesse de vente est compl\u00e8temeent distincte du bail, qui devait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 pendant et apr\u00e8s sa dur\u00e9e comme si ladite promesse de vente n\u2019e\u00fbt jamais exist\u00e9.\nL\u2019honoraible juge Bernier faisait alors les observations suivantes, qui peuvent parfaitement s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle:\nToutefois, les obligations du pr\u00e9tendu locataire paraissent \u00eatre, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le contrat, celles du tout propri\u00e9taire ordinaire.\nSans doute, les parties \u00e0 un semblable contrat peuvent bien lui donner le nom de bail; il n\u2019en est pas moins vrai cependant, que nos tribunaux ont eu souvent \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier de tels contrats; que parfois ils lui ont reconnu plut\u00f4t un caract\u00e8re de vente d\u00e9guis\u00e9e, alors surtout qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019immeubles avec translation de possession aux mains du locataire, avec assujettissement \u00e0 toutes les obligations d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire; dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le pr\u00e9tendu loyer est de $250 par mois, faisant $3,000 par ann\u00e9e; cependant, il y est stipul\u00e9 que les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 7% devront courir sur toute la balance du montant de $27,500: d\u2019autres clauses obligent le locataire \u00e0 entretenir les lieux, et \u00e0 payer les taxes et cotisations municipales, \u00e0 payer les assurances, etc.\nSans doute, un tell contrat en est un qui n\u2019est d\u00e9fendu par aucune loi; bail ou vente conditionnelle suivi de possession, il lie les parties contractantes; vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats cependant peuvent d\u00e9pendre de la valeur l\u00e9gale d\u2019un tel contrat, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce, il y aura \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la question de savoir si c\u2019est un bail ou plut\u00f4t une vente conditionnelle.\nMais, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il semble que la commune intention des parties ne peut pas \u00eatre douteuse, vu leur conduite r\u00e9ciproque lors de la faillite et durant l\u2019intervalle d\u2019au del\u00e0 de six mois pendant lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme venderesse non pay\u00e9e et la compagnie comme acheteuse de l\u2019immeuble en question. Cet immeuble, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier, forme partie de l\u2019actif de la compagnie insolvable; et la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9 cette situation en produisant sa r\u00e9clamation non pas pour le loyer, mais pour le solde total du prix de vente convenu. Elle a m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 vendre par les syndics \u00e0 M. Duperr\u00e9 le bois qu\u2019elle aurait pu saisir pour garantir le loyer, si elle avait voulu agir comme bailleresse. Peut-elle, apr\u00e8s six mois, pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019intervenante de reprendre son bien, suivant le consentement des syndics \u00e0 la faillite, prendre sans autorisation de justice une saisie-gagerie dans les circonstances relat\u00e9es ci-dessus?\nPour ma part, je crois que cette proc\u00e9dure constitue un abus; et je doute fort qu\u2019un juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure l\u2019aurait autoris\u00e9e si, comme le veut l\u2019article 126 de la loi des faillites, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait demand\u00e9 la permission sp\u00e9ciale requise pour proc\u00e9der contre les biens de la faillite; car la saisie-gagerie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour mettre sous la main de la justice les biens qui s\u2019y trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0, \u00e9tant encore sous la garde et en possession des syndics.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, d\u2019ailleurs, le reconna\u00eet avec candeur:\nIt is our well recognized jurisprudence that a seizure by garnishment cannot be taken against a debtor who has made an assignment without leave of the Bankruptcy Court, and the failure of a plaintiff to obtain that leave, would be an absolute bar to the action whether formerly pleaded or not.\nElle pr\u00e9tend cependant que, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une saisie de biens appartenant non au d\u00e9biteur, mais \u00e0 une tierce personne, l\u2019intervenante, sujets au privil\u00e8ge du locateur, mais n\u2019appartenant pas \u00e0 l\u2019insolvable, et qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas, en cons\u00e9quence, sujets \u00e0 l\u2019administration des syndics.\nCette argumentation ne saurait valoir en face de la proc\u00e9dure; car l\u2019huissier, d\u2019apr\u00e8s son proc\u00e8s-verbal, a saisi comme appartenant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse les meubles et effets y \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, entre autres les machineries de l\u2019intervenante, et l\u2019on a mis en cause les syndics. Pourquoi? s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas possession des machines? Je crois donc qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019article 126 de la loi des faillites Faction telle qu\u2019intent\u00e9e \u00e9tait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re; mais je suis aussi d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir choisi son recours en produisant sa r\u00e9clamation entre les mains des syndics pour la balance du prix de vente, ce qui constitue une demande en justice suffisante pour interrompre la prescription, en reconnaissant pendant six mois que les immeubles en question \u00e9taient devenus la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et formaient partie de l\u2019actif de la compagnie, ne peut pas souffler le chaud et le froid et poursuivre cette m\u00eame compagnie, non plus pour la balance du prix de vente, mais pour du loyer en vertu des clauses qu\u2019elle invoque. \u201cElect\u00e2 un\u00e2 vi\u00e2, non datur recursus ad alteram.\u201d\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier, la demanderesse ne semble pas avoir obtenu jugement contre la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse dans la pr\u00e9sente action. Le seul jugement qui nous soit soumis est celui sur l\u2019intervention. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider du bien ou du mal fond\u00e9 contre la d\u00e9fenderesse de cette r\u00e9clamation pour loyer accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une saisie-gagerie. Il est possible que la conduite des deux parties \u00e0 l\u2019acte depuis le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1930 \u00e9quivaille \u00e0 une renonciation \u00e0 la stipulation que le bail devra \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, pendant et apr\u00e8s sa dur\u00e9e, comme si la promesse de vente n\u2019e\u00fbt jamais exist\u00e9.\nQuoi qu\u2019il en soit, vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019un tiers de bonne foi, comme l\u2019intervenante en cette cause, cette stipulation, qui peut \u00eatre valide entre les parties (Art. 1023 C.C.), ne saurait avoir l\u2019effet de lui faire perdre son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en invoquant un pr\u00e9tendu privil\u00e8ge dont la demanderesse-intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019est jamais pr\u00e9value en temps utile contre la d\u00e9fenderesse; au contraire, elle me para\u00eet y avoir express\u00e9ment renonc\u00e9. Cette renonciation \u00e0 ses droits de locatrice dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire ne saurait \u00eatre ignor\u00e9e par les tribunaux. Ayant renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 de locatrice pour r\u00e9clamer comme venderesse, non pas du loyer, mais le solde du prix de vente, elle a renonc\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps aux droits et privil\u00e8ges que la loi assure au locateur contre le locataire, y compris la saisie-gagerie.\nLes faits sp\u00e9ciaux qui caract\u00e9risent cette cause en font une esp\u00e8ce toute particuli\u00e8re. Il ne s\u2019agit pas tant de d\u00e9finir le contrat intervenu entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse que de d\u00e9duire les cons\u00e9quences juridiques des actes que ces m\u00eames parties ont pos\u00e9s depuis la faillite. Mais il n\u2019est pas inutile de rappeler que des contrats de ce genre, mixtes ou complexes, empruntant des caract\u00e8res \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents contrats nomm\u00e9s, ont souvent, devant nos tribunaux, \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme promesses de vente. En effet, comme le disent Planiol et Ripert, 6 Droit civil, 1930, p. 53: Quand les r\u00e8gles sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 chacun ne peuvent \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es cumulativement ou concili\u00e9es,\nc\u2019est du but essentiel de l\u2019op\u00e9ration juridique que doit s\u2019inspirer l\u2019interpr\u00e8te pour assurer la pr\u00e9dominance de l\u2019une de ces r\u00e8gles ou un recours aux seuls principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\nLa Cour de revision, compos\u00e9e des juges Loranger, Davidson et Doherty, dans la cause de Evans v. Champagne[3], a refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre les droits du locateur dans une cause analogue. Le juge Mathieu a fait de m\u00eame dans une cause de De Chantai v. Ranger[4]. L\u00e9 juge Pagnuelo a agi de m\u00eame dans Picaud v. Renaud & Rochon[5]. Le juge-en-chef Langelier a jug\u00e9 de m\u00eame dans la cause de Irving v. Monchamps[6], comme suit:\nConsid\u00e9rant que bien que ledit acte soit intitul\u00e9: Promesse de vente et bail, et qu\u2019il contienne, en apparence, une (promesse de vente et un bail de l\u2019immeuble y d\u00e9sign\u00e9, il n\u2019est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, qu\u2019une vente dudit immeuble avec stipulation que l\u2019acheteur n\u2019en deviendra propri\u00e9taire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que l\u2019acheteur aura pay\u00e9 $500 sur le prix outre $500 pay\u00e9s comptant lorsqu\u2019il en prendra possession de suite, paiera l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la balance du prix stipul\u00e9 et que la vente sera r\u00e9solue s\u2019il manque de payer un montant quelconque du prix ou de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ladite action n\u2019en est pas une r\u00e9sultant des rapports entre locateur et locataire;\nConsid\u00e9rant que le demandeur n\u2019avait pas Je droit d\u2019instituer ladite action, comme ill l\u2019a fait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la proc\u00e9dure relative aux mati\u00e8res sommaires;\nMaintient d\u2019exception \u00e0 la forme du d\u00e9fendeur et d\u00e9boute la demanderesse de sadite action avec d\u00e9pens, sauf \u00e0 se pourvoir. Tout r\u00e9cemment, l\u2019honorable juge Stein, dans la cause de Morency v. St-Pierre[7], a jug\u00e9:\nL\u2019acte qualifi\u00e9 de bail d\u2019immeuble, fait pour sept ans, par lequel le pr\u00e9tendu preneur s\u2019engage \u00e0 payer au pr\u00e9tendu bailleur $15 par mois, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $900, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, et stipulant que le preneur, apr\u00e8s avoir ainsi pay\u00e9 capital et int\u00e9r\u00eat durant sept ans, aura droit \u00e0 un acte de vente quittanc\u00e9, n\u2019est pas un contrat de louage, mais une v\u00e9ritable vente.\nVoir aussi: Carey v. Carey[8] (Cour de revision).\nCette solution donn\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs cas analogues ne lie pas cette cour. Mais nous voulons indiquer la tendance de la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Nous n\u2019y d\u00e9rogeons pas en refusant de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019agir comme bailleresse contre l\u2019intervenante, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ses droits de propri\u00e9taire, lorsque tout indique que le contrat en question, ou pour employer l\u2019expression des auteurs, le but essentiel de l\u2019op\u00e9ration juridique, \u00e9tait d\u2019assurer \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019ayant pas les capitaux n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9aliser de suite l\u2019acquisition, non la possession pr\u00e9caire \u00e0 titre de locataire, mais bien la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitive de l\u2019immeuble en question.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u $10,000 \u00e0 compte et a accord\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai pour le reste. Lorsque la faillite a fait perdre \u00e0 l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du terme convenu, les parties, d\u2019un commun accord et suivant la v\u00e9ritable intention de l\u2019acte, ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la compagnie \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire; d\u2019un commun accord, elles ont laiss\u00e9 les immeubles et les b\u00e2tisses dans le patrimoine du d\u00e9biteur et ont produit et accept\u00e9 une r\u00e9clamation privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e pour le plein montant d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Nous ne saurions permettre \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de r\u00e9clamer, en outre du solde de $14,391.50, montant de sa r\u00e9clamation dans la faillite, une somme additionnelle de $2,351.80 par une saisie-gagerie prise six mois plus tard.\nJe crois que l\u2019intervenante a eu raison de demander le renvoi de cette action en autant qu\u2019elle pouvait affecter ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les machines \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es au paragraphe 1er de son intervention, dont elle doit \u00eatre reconnue propri\u00e9taire.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, avec d\u00e9pens contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la saisie-gagerie doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e et mainlev\u00e9e donn\u00e9e en autant que l\u2019intervenante et ses biens sont concern\u00e9s, le tout avec d\u00e9pens en faveur de l\u2019intervenante contre la demanderesse en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Co., a foreign corporation, owner of a patent, sued defendant in the Exchequer Court of Canada for infringement of it. Defendant admitted infringement, but denied that plaintiff had suffered damages. On May 31, 1932, judgment was given for plaintiff upon the pleadings, a reference being directed as to damages. The referee found special damages of $10,013.17, and general damages of $1,000. The patented articles were manufactured and sold in Canada by D. a. Co., practically all the shares of which were owned by a. Co., whose profits from D. a. Co.\u2019s operations were only through dividends on said shares. The special damages found were based on the profit which would have been made by D. a. Co. on articles sold by defendant which the referee found would otherwise have been sold by D. a. Co. Subsequent to the referee\u2019s report, a. Co. obtained an order adding D. A. Co. as a co-plaintiff, and the Exchequer Court gave judgment to plaintiffs for $8,683.14 (reducing the special damages found by the referee but otherwise confirming his report). The defendant appealed.\nHeld (1) D. a. Co. was, upon the facts in evidence, only allowed by a. Co. to make and sell the subject of the invention. A. Co. only, and not D. A. Co., had a cause of action within the pleadings against defendant. D. A. Co., not being the \u201cpatentee\u201d or the \u201clegal representative\u201d of the patentee, had no right, at any rate after the judgment of May 31, 1932, to be a party to the action. (Patent Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 150, ss. 2 (e), 2 (c), 30, 32, considered; Hussey v. Whitely, 2 Fish. Pat. Cas. 120, Heap v. Hartley, 42 Ch. D. 461, cited). (2) A. Co. was not entitled to damages on the basis adopted below. There was no evidence to shew that the dividends on the stock of D. A. Co. were in fact affected by the infringement or that the value of the shares of D. \u00c0. Co., owned by A. Co., were injuriously affected in any way by the infringement. But A. Co was entitled to substantial damages for infringement, which this Court fixed at $750. (Rain-ham Chemical Works Ltd. v. Belvedere Fish Guano Co. Ltd., [1921] 2 A.C. 465, at 475; Couette v.

C. H. Cassels K.C. for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar K.C., R. S. Smart K.C. and M. B. Gordon for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHughes, J.\u2014This action was brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada by Art Metal Works Incorporated, a New Jersey corporation, against the appellant for infringement of letters patent No. 288148 and for an injunction and other relief. The prayer when the statement of claim was filed on the 24th day of September, 1931, read in part as follows:\nThe plaintiff therefore claims:\n(c) $1,000 damages or alternatively an account of profits as the plaintiff may elect.\nOn the 23rd day of November, 1931, the appellant delivered its statement of defence consisting of four paragraphs, denying that the plaintiff was the owner of the patent, denying the infringement and impeaching the patent.\nOn the 30th day of May, 1932, the appellant served a notice of motion for an order amending its statement of defence by striking out the whole four paragraphs above mentioned and substituting therefor the following single paragraph:\nThe defendant admits the truth of the facts set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim herein, but denies that the plaintiff has suffered any damages or that the defendant has made any profits from the alleged infringement.\nOn Tuesday, the 31st day of May, 1932, an order was made in the Exchequer Court of Canada as follows:\nUPON the application of the defendant for an order permitting it to amend its statement of defence in this action by substituting for paragraphs 1 to 4 thereof the following paragraph, namely,\n\u201cThe defendant admits the truth of the facts set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim herein but denies that the plaintiff has suffered any damages or that the defendant has made any profits from the alleged infringement,\u201d upon reading the affidavit of Birger Elias Ekblad filed and the pleadings herein, and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel for both parties, This Court was pleased to order that the statement of defence be amended as prayed, counsel for defendant consenting that judgment be rendered upon the pleadings as amended, and upon reading the pleadings as so amended;\nTHIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that as between the plaintiff and the defendant the Letters Patent of the plaintiff, No. 288,148 bearing date the 26th day of March, 1929, for Improvements in Cigar Lighters, are valid, and infringed by the defendant.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant, its officers, servants, workmen and agents be and they are restrained from infringing said Letters Patent owned by the plaintiff and No. 288,148, and from making, constructing, using and vending to others to be used in the Dominion of Canada the said invention as described in the specification attached to the said Letters Patent during the continuance of the said Letters Patent:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant do forthwith deliver up to the plaintiff all products or articles in the possession or control of the defendant which infringe the said Letters Patent;\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff such damages as it may have suffered or be entitled to by reason of the infringements complained of, and doth direct that there be a reference to the Registrar of this Court to enquire into and report as to the amount of such damages, if any;\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant do pay to the plaintiff its costs of this action forthwith after taxation thereof, and that the costs of the reference, if any, be reserved.\nBy the Court,\n(Sgd.) \u201cARNOLD W. DUCLOS,\u201d\nRegistrar.\nThe parties duly appeared before the Registrar and on the 15th day of August, 1932, the Registrar issued his report in which he found special damages of $10,013.17 and general damages of $1,000, making a total sum of $11,013.17. On the 18th day of November, 1932, the learned President of the Exchequer Court of Canada heard a motion to confirm the report of the Registrar and also a motion of the appellant to vary or set aside the report. On this motion, the learned President gave leave to the New Jersey corporation to amend its statement of claim so as not to restrict its claim for damages to $1,000. The learned President also gave leave to the New Jersey corporation to move to add a Canadian corporation known as Dominion Art Metal Works Limited as a party plaintiff, it appearing according to counsel for the appellant, that the evidence before the Registrar was to the effect that the New Jersey corporation did not carry on business in Canada and that it was the Canadian company, if any, that had suffered damage by the infringement.\nThe New Jersey corporation thereupon applied for, and on the 16th day of December, 1932, obtained, an order for the joinder of the Canadian company as a co-plaintiff.\nOn the 6th day of February, 1933, the learned President gave judgment in favour of the respondents, reciting the two amendments above mentioned and reducing the damages to $8,663.14 plus interest and costs.\nIt was argued before us by the appellant that the Exchequer Court of Canada should not have permitted an increase in the amount of the claim for damages of the New Jersey corporation, and should not have permitted the joinder of another plaintiff in view of the fact, as the appellant\u2019s counsel alleged, that the judgment of the 31st day of May, 1932, was tantamount to a consent judgment.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondents contended that the two orders permitting the amendments, respectively above mentioned, were interlocutory orders of the Exchequer Court of Canada and that no appeal lay to the Supreme Court of Canada; that, even if they were final orders, they could not then be appealed as the thirty days referred to in section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act had long since expired, and lastly, that the appellant had appealed only against the final judgment of the 6th day of February, 1933.\nIt is not necessary to consider all of these arguments, and they are recited merely in order that the history of the proceedings may be clear. The statement of claim alleges, the judgment of the 31st day of May, 1932, recites, and the evidence before the Registrar shows that the New Jersey corporation was the owner of the patent in question.\nSection 2 (e) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1927, Chapter 150, is as follows:\n2. (e) \u201cpatentee\u201d means the person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent.\nSection 32 of the Patent Act is as follows:\n32. Every person who, without the consent in writing of the patentee, makes, constructs or puts in practice any invention for which a patent has been obtained under this Act or any previous Act, or who procures such invention from any person not authorized by the patentee or his legal representatives to make or use it, and who uses it, shall be liable to the patentee or his legal representatives in an action of damages for so doing; and the judgment shall be enforced, and the damages and costs that are adjudged shall be recoverable, in like manner as in other cases in the court in which the action is brought. 1923, c. 23, s. 32.\nSection 2 (c) of the Patent Act is as follows:\n\u201cLegal representatives\u201d includes heirs, executors, administrators, guardians, curators, tutors, assigns or other legal representatives;\nSection 30, subsection 1, of the Patent Act is as follows:\nEvery patent issued for an invention shall be assignable in law, either as to the whole interest or as to any part thereof, by any instrument in writing.\nIt was not suggested that the patent had been assigned either as to the whole interest or any part thereof to the Canadian corporation.\nSubsection 2 of section 30 reads:\n2. Such assignment, and every grant and conveyance of any exclusive right to make and use and to grant to others the right to make and use the invention patented, within and throughout Canada or any part thereof, shall be registered in the Patent Office in the manner from time to time prescribed by the Commissioner for such registration.\nSubsection 3 provides that every assignment shall be null and void against any subsequent assignee unless duly registered.\nThe section does not say that every grant and conveyance of any exclusive right to make and use and to grant to others the right to make and use the invention patented within and throughout Canada or any part thereof must be in writing and the statute is silent as to the effect of non-registration. Dalgleish v. Conboy[1].\nOn the relationship existing between the New Jersey corporation and the Canadian corporation, the following questions and answers in the cross-examination of Alexander Harris, secretary-treasurer of the New Jersey corporation, are relevant:\nQ. Have you any agreement between the Art Metal Works Incorporated and the Dominion Art Metal Works Limited which gives them the right to manufacture under the patent of Art Metal Works Incorporated?\u2014A. I do not believe any specific agreement exists in view of the fact that the Canadian company is wholly owned by the United States company.\nQ. Just an implied agreement?\u2014A. Yes, I think so.\nQ. I suppose the Dominion Art Metal Works Limited does not pay any royalty to Art Metal Works Incorporated?\u2014A. No, sir, it does not.\nQ. The profit of Art Metal Works Incorporated is through dividends on shares of Dominion Art Metal Works Limited?\u2014A. Yes.\nThis is not evidence of a \u201cgrant and conveyance of any exclusive right to make and use and to grant to others the right to make and use the invention patented within and throughout Canada or any part thereof.\u201d\nIt is rather evidence of a licence.\nIn Hussey v. Whitely[2], referred to in Dalgleish v. Conboy, supra, at page 261, the complainant had by a writen instrument granted the exclusive right to make and sell the subject of his invention, during the continuance of his patent, in twenty-three counties of Ohio, including that in which the defendants\u2019 factory was carried on, but the patentee expressly reserved to himself the right of sending machines of his own manufacture into the territory embraced in the contract. This was held to be a mere licence.\nIn Heap v. Hartley[3], the court considered the words which in section 2 (e) of our Act constitute the definition of a patentee, namely, \u201cthe person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent,\u201d 46-47 Victoria, chap. 57, sec. 46. In that case a patentee of machinery, by deed, granted to the plaintiff the full and exclusive licence to use and exercise the patented invention within a specified district for a limited period, and covenanted during that period not to sell or to grant any licence to exercise or use the invention to any other person in the same district; and in case the patent should be infringed, he covenanted to take all necessary proceedings for defending the same, and that in default of his so doing, it should be lawful for the plaintiff to take such proceedings in his (the patentee\u2019s) name. The defendants had bought two of the patented machines from some person other than the plaintiff and were using them within the district.\nAn action was brought by the plaintiff in his own name and without joining the patentee against the defendants and was dismissed.\nCounsel for the appellant unsuccessfully contended, page 465, that since a patentee was according to section 46 of the Patents Act, 46-47 Victoria, chapter 57, \u201cthe person for the time being entitled to the benefit of a patent,\u201d an exclusive licensee for a particular district was qua that district, and during the term of the licence, in the position of a person to whom the patentee had given his monopoly and all his beneficial rights, that he was practically an assignee pro tanto of the patent, and was entitled to maintain an action for infringement of his rights within the district in his own name, and without joining the patentee.\nThe distinctions between a grant of an interest and a licence are discussed fully in the judgments of Cotton L.J., and Fry L.J. The latter said at page 470:\nThe plaintiff in this case sues under an exclusive licence to use a certain invention for a certain time, and within a limited district. He sues a person who he says is using that patented invention within the district, and without his licence. * * * He says: \u201c* * * as exclusive licensee, I am in the position of an assign of the letters patent for that district and for that term, and as an assign of letters patent, I have a right to restrain any person who is infringing within the district.\u201d That argument appears to be based on an entire error with regard to the nature of a licence. An exclusive licence is only a licence in one sense; that is to say, the true nature of an exclusive licence is this. It is a leave to do a thing, and a contract not to give leave to anybody else to do the same thing. But it confers like any other licence, no interest or property in the thing. A licence may be, and often is, coupled with a grant, and that grant conveys an interest in property, but the licence pure and simple, and by itself, never conveys an interest in property. It only enables a person to do lawfully what he could not otherwise do, except unlawfully. I think, therefore, that an exclusive licensee has no title whatever to sue.\nIt appears, therefore, that only the New Jersey corporation had a cause of action within the pleadings against the appellant; and that the Canadian corporation, Dominion Art Metal Works, had no cause of action within the pleadings against the appellant.\nIt must follow that the Canadian corporation, not being the patentee or the legal representative of the patentee, had no right, at any rate after the judgment of the 31st day of May, 1932, to be a party to the action in the Exchequer Court of Canada at all. It was not contended before us by the respondents that it was not open to the appellant after the judgment of the 31st day of May, 1932, to deny the right of the New Jersey corporation to the damages sustained either by it or by the Canadian company. This point was mentioned in the report of the Registrar, but possibly was abandoned when on the 16th day of December, 1932, the New Jersey corporation secured from the Exchequer Court of Canada an order adding the Canadian corporation as a party plaintiff.\nThe learned President in his preliminary reasons for judgment dated November 18, 1932, made the following among other findings:\nThe Canadian business of the plaintiff is carried on by a Canadian corporation, known as The Dominion Art Metal Works Ltd., with headquarters at Toronto, and this company manufactures and sells in Canada the lighter which is the subject matter of the plaintiff\u2019s patent. No formal licence apparently issued from the plaintiff to the Canadian company, but the latter was impliedly licensed to manufacture and sell in Canada, the invention covered by the plaintiff\u2019s patent. The plaintiff company own all the shares in the Canadian company, and the officers of both companies appear to be the same. No royalty was paid by the Canadian company to the plaintiff company for the use of the plaintiff\u2019s invention, and the only profit accruing to the plaintiff from the Canadian company was in the way of dividends upon the shares it held in that company. At the time material here the major portion of the business of the Canadian company consisted in the manufacture and sale of lighters.\nThe registrar has reported, awarding damages to the plaintiff in the sum of $11,013.17. This amount was ascertained by taking the number of lighters admittedly sold by the defendant, viz., 5,553, and multiplying that by the profit which the Canadian company ordinarily made on each lighter sold by it in Canada, viz., $1.84, which would amount to $10,217.32; the Registrar allowed an additional sum of $1,000 in the nature of general damages for injury to the business, apparently, of the Canadian company.\n* * * I do not think any injustice will be done the defendant if I allow the plaintiff to amend its statement of claim in such a way as will not restrict its claim for damages to $1,000, and this I do. * * *\nThe most serious point raised by the defendant\u2019s counsel was that the plaintiff could not recover damages, other than nominal damages, because it was the Canadian company that suffered damage, if any damage was caused by the defendant\u2019s infringement. And this point was raised by defendant\u2019s counsel before the Registrar. All the evidence given before the Registrar was apparently directed towards showing loss of profits or damages suffered by the Canadian company. Now it would seem to me to be unfortunate, there being some damages in the offing for some one, if the issue as to the amount of damages and to whom they should go, could not be concluded in this proceeding and without further litigation, particularly as infringement has been admitted. It seems to me therefore that the question as to whether or not the Canadian company should be added as a party to the cause should be determined before I proceed further. On the 6th day of February, 1933, the learned President in his reasons for final judgment referred to the assessment of damages by the learned Registrar as follows:\nThe Registrar assessed the damages under two heads. First, he allowed $10,217.52, that amount being reached by multiplying the number of lighters sold by the defendant by $1.84, the amount of profit the Canadian company claimed to make on each lighter which it manufactured and sold, but from this amount he made a deduction of 2 per cent, representing sales which the defendant made but which the plaintiff might\u2019 not have made; and he allowed $1,000 in addition to cover damages generally for loss of profits, and for disruption of business, suffered by the plaintiffs, owing to the sale of the infringing article.\nCounsel for respondent contended at bar that the New Jersey corporation owned all the shares or nearly all the shares of the Canadian corporation, and that it was therefore entitled to the damages which were awarded by the learned President as owner of all, or nearly all, the shares of the Canadian corporation, and therefore as recipient of all, or nearly all, the dividends paid by the Canadian corporation.\nCounsel for the respondent also contended that the case came within the decision of this Court in Palmolive Manufacturing Co. (Ontario) Ltd. v. The King[4].\nThere was, however, no evidence adduced before the learned Registrar to shew that the dividends on the stock of the Canadian company, if they went to the New Jersey corporation, were in fact affected by the infringement or that the value of the shares of the Canadian corporation, owned by the New Jersey corporation, were injuriously affected in any way by the infringement.\nCounsel for the respondent also contended that the New Jersey corporation owned all the assets of the Canadian corporation and that through this conection the former was entitled to the damages awarded by the learned President. This contention, however, cannot be well founded in the light of the evidence of Alexander Harris above set out.\nAs Lord Buckmaster said in Rainham Chemical Works Ltd. v. Belvedere Fish Guano Co. Ltd.[5]:\nIt not infrequently happens in the course of legal proceedings that parties who find they have a limited company as debtor with all its paid-up capital issued in the form of fully-paid shares and no free capital for working suggest that the company is nothing but an alter ego for the people by whose hand it has been incorporated, and by whose action it is controlled. But in truth the Companies Acts expressly contemplate that people may substitute the limited liability of a company for the unlimited liability of the individual, with the object that by this means enterprise and adventure may be encouraged. A company, therefore, which is duly incorporated, cannot be disregarded on the ground that it is a sham, although it may be established by evidence that in its operations it does not act on its own behalf as an independent trading unit, but simply for and on behalf of the people by whom it has been called into existence.\nMoreover, in Collette v. Lasnier[6], this Court held that in the circumstances of that case the profits made by the defendants were not a proper measure of damages; that the evidence furnished no means of accurately measuring the damages, but that substantial justice would be done by awarding $100.\nBut the New Jersey corporation is undoubtedly entitled to substantial damages for infringement. In Meters Ltd. v. Metropolitan Gas Meters Ltd.[7], Fletcher Moulton L.J., at page 163, said:\nThe defendants seek to diminish the damages by a variety of affidavits intended to show that the particular purchasers for whom they manufactured these infringements were customers who would not have purchased from the plaintiffs if they had not purchased from them. I am not for a moment going to say that evidence of that kind may not be relevant, but the argument based upon it was, that where a plaintiff proves the sale of infringing instruments by the defendants he does not establish any right to damages unless he shows how many of those particular instruments would have been purchased from him if the defendant had not sold them; and the counsel for the defendants were bold enough to say that in this case of infringement on a large scale there ought to be only nominal damages.\nAnd at page 164:\nIn the assessment of damages every instrument that is manufactured or sold, which infringes the rights of the patentee, is a wrong to him, and I do not think that there is any case, nor do I think that there is any rule of law which says that the patentee is not entitled to recover in respect of each one of those wrongs.\nAnd in Watson, Laidlaw & Company, Limited v. Pott, Cassels & Williamson[8], Lord Shaw of Dunfermline said at page 31:\nThe argument is\u2014for indeed this instance covers sufficiently the whole ground\u2014the argument is: Here it is demonstrated that the patentees have lost no trade which they could have obtained. And under the cover of certain judicial dicta the infringers are entitled to say that the entire measure of the patentees\u2019 damage is exhausted when restoration of the status quo ante has been obtained.\nAnd at page 32:\nBut in addition there remains that class of business which the respondents would not have done; and in such cases it appears to me that the correct and full measure is only reached by adding that a patentee is also entitled, on the principle of price or hire, to a royalty for the unauthorized sale or use of every one of the infringing machines in a market which the patentee if left to himself, might not have reached. Otherwise that property which consists in the monopoly of the patented articles granted to the patentee has been invaded, and indeed abstracted, and the law, when appealed to, would be standing by and allowing the invader or abstracter to go free. In such cases a royalty is an excellent key to unlock the difficulty, and I am in entire accord with the principle laid down by Lord Moulton in Meters, Limited (1). Each of the infringements was an actionable wrong, and although they may have been committed in a range of business or of territory which the patentee might not have reached, he is entitled to hire or royalty in respect of each unauthorized use of his property. Otherwise the remedy might fall unjustly short of the wrong.\nThe result is that the judgment of the 6th day of February, 1933, and the report of the Registrar dated the 15th day of August, 1932, will be vacated and set aside and in lieu thereof the New Jersey corporation will have judgment against the appellant for damages which we fix at $750 with the costs of the action down to and including the judgment of the 31st day of May, 1932, only, and the appellants will have the costs of this appeal.\nJudgment accordingly.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

Martin (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: June 12, 13, 28.\nPresent: Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon and Hughes JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO (SITTING IN BANKRUPTCY).\nConditional sale\u2014Bill of sale\u2014Validity as against trustee in bankruptcy\u2014Trust\u2014Estoppel.\nRespondent, as trustee in bankruptcy of an automobile dealer in Ontario, disputed the right claimed by appellant, as vendor to the dealer under conditional sale agreements, in certain automobiles, in stock on the dealer\u2019s premises at the time of the assignment in bankruptcy. Two of the automobiles, Viking cars, had been ordered by the dealer from the maker, and shipped to the dealer by freight, the bills of lading being sent to a bank with draft for price attached, so that the dealer. could get possession by payment of the draft. The dealer, having ascertained the serial numbers of the cars, executed an \u201cindenture,\u201d in reality a bill of sale, purporting to sell, assign, transfer, and set over the cars to appellant in consideration of the price represented by the drafts. The bill of sale was not registered. The appellant and the dealer then executed a conditional sale agreement (which was registered) by which appellant agreed to sell the cars to the dealer for the amounts represented by the drafts, the property in the cars to remain in appellant until the price was paid. Appellant then gave cheques to the dealer with which the dealer paid the drafts and got possession of the cars. In the case of the other cars, the dealer, when ordering one, sent its driver to the maker\u2019s factory with the dealer\u2019s blank cheque, which was filled in for the price and handed to the maker, the driver then taking possession of the car and driving it to the dealer\u2019s place of business, where it went into stock. The dealer then executed an \u201cindenture,\u201d or bill of sale (not registered), of the car to appellant, which then executed a conditional sale (registered) of it to the dealer for the original price, or 90% of it, and gave its cheque to the dealer for that sum, thus enabling the dealer to meet its cheque to the maker of the car.\nHeld (affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal, Ont., [1932] O.R. 712), that, as against respondent, the bills of sale and conditional sale agreements were invalid.\nAs to the Viking cars\u2014Per Rinfret, Smith and Hughes JJ.: The attempted transfer of ownership from the dealer to appellant, by means of the \u201cindenture\u201d or bill of sale and payment by appellant of the drafts, came within s. 14 of the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 164 (s. 14 extending the Act to a sale of goods which may not be the property of or in the possession, custody or control of the bargainer or any person on his behalf at the time of the making of the sale), and, in the absence of registration, was void as against respondent. The presence of s. 14 in the Ontario Act distinguishes this case from In re Estate of Smith & Hogan Ltd., [1932] Can. S.C.R. 661, which would have applied had s. 8 of the Act stood alone, as s. 8 (like s. 6 of the New Brunswick Act dealt with in the Smith & Hogan case) does not apply to a transfer of a mere right to acquire ownership of chattels (Ontario cases cited), and, at the time of execution of the \u201cindenture,\u201d ownership was still in the shipper, and all the dealer had was a right to acquire ownership by payment of the draft, and this right or interest in the property was all that passed by virtue of the \u201cindenture.\u201d Per Lamont J. (concurring that the bills of sale were invalid, but on different grounds): The documents and course of dealing clearly established an intention of the dealer and appellant that the dealer should acquire title to the cars from the shipper and then, having the property in them, should sell them to appellant, and appellant, should in turn sell them back to the dealer under a conditional sale agreement. The bill of sale was, for convenience, drawn up and executed preparatory to completion of the transaction, but was not to operate as a bill of sale until the dealer had the cars upon its premises. The order of the steps toward completion was immaterial, the documents were effective from the moment the parties intended they should become operative. The Smith & Hogan case (supra) did not apply because, in the present case, a court could not, without doing violence to the language used in the bill of sale, find as a fact that the intention was that appellant, in consideration of the cheques which it advanced, was to have only an equitable right to acquire the ownership and possession of the cars, and not the absolute property in them.\nAs to the other cars\u2014The ownership and property therein vested in the dealer upon delivery to it, and the \u201cindenture\u201d or bill of sale by it to appellant, without change of possession or registration, came within s. 8 of the Act and was void as against respondent.\nOwnership never having passed to appellant as against respondent, appellant was not, as against respondent, in a position to make a conditional sale of the cars to the dealer, retaining the ownership.\nAppellant\u2019s contention that, in view of the general course of dealings between the dealer and appellant in connection with the financing of the purchase of the cars, a trust was created, by which the dealer held the cars in trust for appellant, and unaffected by said Act, was rejected.\nIt was held further, that the giving up by respondent to appellant of possession of the cars had not, under the circumstances in question, raised an estoppel against respondent.\nAPPEAL (by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing an appeal by the present appellant from the judgment of Sedgewick J.[2], sitting as a Judge in Bankruptcy upon the trial of an issue between the parties, whereby it was declared that certain alleged bills of sale (not registered) and conditional sale agreements (registered) were invalid as against the present respondent (trustee in bankruptcy of Grand River Motors Ltd.), and whereby it was ordered that the present respondent should recover from the present appellant the sum of $9,487.12, the value of certain automobiles mentioned in the said alleged bills of sale and conditional sale agreements, and which had been delivered by the present respondent to the present appellant.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.C. McRuer K.C. and F.A. Brewin for the appellant.\nJ.M. Bullen and L. Davis for the respondent. The judgment of Rinfret, Smith and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nSMITH, J.\u2014Grand River Motors Limited, the debtor, carried on business in Galt and Hamilton as automobile dealers, and, in the course of their business, ordered and received the following automobiles, of the values set out:\nLa Salle coup\u00e9, Serial No. 413537....................... $2,789 50\nViking sedan, Serial No. V.D.S. 979..................... 1,900 00\nOldsmobile coup\u00e9, Serial No. 27311.................... 780 43\nViking sedan, Serial No. V.B. 353......................... 1,800 00\nOldsmobile coup\u00e9, Serial No. 27529.................... 708 27\nOldsmobile coach, Serial No. 27588.................... 793 92\nOldsmobile coach, Serial No. 27456.................... 715 00\n_____________\n$9,487 12\nThese automobiles were in stock in the debtor\u2019s premises at the time of the assignment.\nThe two Viking automobiles were ordered from the makers in the United States, and were shipped to the debtor by freight, and the bill of lading was sent to a bank with a draft for the price attached, so that the debtor was able to get possession by payment of the draft. The debtor ascertained from the bill of lading at the bank the serial numbers of the cars, and then went to the appellant company, and executed an \u201cindenture\u201d in form Exhibit 2 (b), in reality a bill of sale, purporting to sell, assign, transfer and set over to the appellant company these automobiles described by their serial numbers, in consideration of the price represented by the drafts. These bills of sale were not filed, as provided by the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act.\nThe appellant and the debtor then executed a conditional sale agreement, by which the appellant agreed to sell the automobiles to the debtor for the amounts represented by the drafts, this purchase price to be paid by the debtor to the appellant at stated times, the property in the automobiles to remain in the appellant until the price should be paid.\nOn completion of these documents, cheques for the amount of the drafts payable to the bank were given the debtor, with which the debtor paid the drafts and got possession of the bills of lading, and the cars. These facts place the transaction in connection with the two Viking cars practically on all fours with the facts in In Re Estate of Smith & Hogan Ltd.[3]. The statutes having a bearing in that case were, the Bills of Sale Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, ch. 151, and the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.N.B. 1927, ch. 152. The gist of the decision in that case was that the vendor in the conditional sale agreement had acquired the legal title and ownership of the cars at the time the conditional sale agreement was made, and that this legal ownership had never passed to or become vested in the dealer, who was the purchaser under the conditional sale agreement. In both cases the cars were ordered by the dealer, were shipped to the dealer, and bills of lading sent with sight draft attached. The legal ownership, therefore, was retained by the shipper, and the dealer\u2019s only right at that stage was a right to obtain legal ownership by payment of the draft.\nIn the Smith & Hogan case3 it was held that, by virtue of the various documents and the payment of the draft, the legal title and ownership, on payment of the draft, passed to the vendor in the conditional sale agreement, and not to the dealer, who was the vendee in that agreement.\nHere, also, the dealer\u2014that is, the debtor\u2014obtained no legal title or ownership to the cars by virtue of the shipment and the sending of the bills of lading with sight draft attached; the title, at that stage, being still in the shipper. The \u201cindentures\u201d or bills of sale from the debtor to the appellant did not pass the legal title to the appellant, because the title or ownership still remained in the shipper, and could not be transferred to the appellant until the drafts were paid. Ownership, however, would, as between the two parties, pass to the appellant on payment of the draft, which would give the appellant complete title and ownership of the cars, unless the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 164, makes a transfer of legal ownership by that method void as against the creditors.\nIn the Smith & Hogan case3 it was held that the Bills of Sale Act of New Brunswick, sec. 6, has to do with a transfer or sale of chattels where the transferor or seller has the ownership of the chattels at the time of transfer or sale, and does not apply to a transfer of a mere right to acquire ownership of chattels.\nThis principle seems to have been well established by Ontario decisions under sec. 8 of the Ontario statute.\nIn Burton v. Bellhouse[4], it was held that a verbal agreement to buy from a manufacturer two half-finished locomotives, to be finished, passed the property, and that the Chattel Mortgage Act did not apply.\nIn Coyne v. Lee[5], it was held that a chattel mortgage of goods to be acquired by the mortgagor was good as against creditors, on the ground that the mortgagee acquired an equitable title, which became a legal title as soon as the goods were acquired.\nIn Horsfall v. Boisseau[6], Hagarty, C.J.O., says:\nBefore the passing of the Act of 1892, there does not appear to have been any statutable provision respecting future goods brought into a stock in trade on which a chattel mortgage was given.\nIn Banks v. Robinson[7], Boyd, C., says:\nMy opinion is, that the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgages Act, R.S.O., ch. 125, 1887, was not intended to cover agreements creating equitable interests in non-existing and future-acquired property. The Act relates to existing chattels capable of manual delivery and susceptible of full and certain description for the purpose of identification, at the date of the instrument.\nMany other cases to the same effect might be cited. Here the goods were in existence, and fully identified, but, as already stated, the debtor had not the property in them, and they were not capable of delivery by the debtor at the date of the instrument; and a mere equitable title was transferred at that stage, capable of being converted into a full legal title by acceptance and payment of the draft.\nR.S.O. 1927, ch. 164, sec. 8, is the same as sec. 6 of the New Brunswick statute and, if it stood alone, I am unable to see any distinction between the Smith & Hogan case[8] and this one, as far as these Viking cars are concerned. The \u201cindenture\u201d, or bill of sale, in this case could not transfer the property and ownership in the cars to the appellant, because the debtor did not have such property and ownership, and surely could not transfer a property that it did not own, but which was still owned by the shipper. All that the debtor had when this \u201cindenture\u201d was executed was a right to acquire the ownership by payment of the draft, and this right or interest in the property was all that passed by virtue of the \u201cindenture\u201d.\nSection 8 referred to, like sec. 6 of the New Brunswick Act, deals only with a sale of chattels, which means a transfer of the ownership. On this principle it was held in the Ontario courts that the provisions of section 8 did not apply to property to be acquired by the vendor in future, or not capable of immediate delivery. The scope of sec. 8 in the original Act was enlarged, in 1892, by 55 Vict., ch. 26, sec. 1, which is now sec. 14, and reads as follows:\nThis Act shall extend to a mortgage or sale of goods and chattels which may not be the property of or in the possession, custody or control of the mortgagor or bargainor or any person on his behalf at the time of the making of the mortgage or sale, and notwithstanding that such goods or chattels may be intended to be delivered at some future time, or that the same may not at the time of the making of the mortgage or sale be actually procured or provided or fit or ready for delivery, or that some act may be required for the making or completing of such goods and chattels or rendering the same fit for delivery.\nThis section seems to cover precisely the attempted transfer of the ownership in these Viking cars by means of the \u201cindenture,\u201d or bill of sale, and payment of the drafts by the appellant. It was a sale, or attempted sale, of goods and chattels which were not the property of or in the possession, custody or control of the bargainor, or any person on his behalf, at the time of the making of the sale, which comes within the precise words of this section of the statute. That transfer, not having been filed or registered pursuant to the Act, becomes, by virtue of the Act, void as against creditors of the transferor. The language of the section is, no doubt, open to criticism, because it is difficult to understand how one is able to sell goods and chattels that are not his property, though there can be no doubt of his ability to transfer an interest which he may have in goods and chattels that he does not own. This section, however, in terms extends to any instrument that purports to sell goods of which the vendor is not the owner, and therefore extends to any interest in chattels transferred by such instrument.\nMr. McRuer realized that this section in the Ontario statute distinguishes the present case from the case of Smith and Hogan Ltd[9], and sought, in a very able argu- ment, to overcome this difficulty upon the theory that a trust was created by which the debtor held these cars in trust for the appellant, to which the Bills of Sale and Chattel Mortgage Act does not apply. Before dealing with this contention, I shall refer to the remaining cars in dispute, which were dealt with in an entirely different manner.\nThese were all purchased from the General Motors of Canada, Limited. When the debtor was ordering one of these cars, it would send its driver to the factory of the General Motors with a blank cheque of the debtor, which would be filled in for the price of the car to be taken over, and would be handed to the General Motors Limited. The driver would then take possession of the car, and drive it to the place of business of the debtor, where it would be taken into stock. The debtor would then execute an \u201cindenture,\u201d or bill of sale of the car to the appellant, who would then execute a conditional sale of it to the debtor for the original price, or ninety per cent of it, and the debtor would receive appellant\u2019s cheque, payable to the debtor, for the purchase price stated in the conditional sale agreement. The debtor would then deposit this cheque to its credit in the bank, which would provide the funds required to meet the cheque given to the General Motors, if no funds, or no sufficient funds, were otherwise on hand to meet such cheque.\nIt seems to me impossible to argue that the ownership and property in these cars, purchased from the General Motors Limited, did not vest in the debtor upon delivery. The \u201cindenture\u201d or bill of sale of these cars to the appellant, without change of possession, and without registration, is a document coming precisely within the provisions of section 8 of the Act, and void as against creditors of the debtor. As against creditors, therefore, the appellant acquired no title or ownership by virtue of the bills of sale, and therefore, as against creditors, was not in a position to make a conditional sale of the cars to the debtor, retaining the ownership, because, as against the creditors, that ownership never passed to the appellant.\nThis difficulty, again, is sought to be avoided upon the theory of a trust having been created by the act and intention of the parties. It is argued that, in view of the general course of dealings between the debtor and the appel- lant in connection with the financing of the purchase of these cars by the debtor, it should be held that such a trust was created. As between themselves, there was no occasion for the creation of any trust, because, as against the debtor, the appellant obtained complete title and ownership to these automobiles, and the conditional sale agreement was perfectly valid. In order to hold that the debtor was a trustee for the appellant, it must be determined that the legal title and ownership was vested in the debtor and the beneficial interest in the appellant. The very reverse was, however, the real situation, the appellant\u2019s difficulty being that its legal ownership, by virtue of the Act, was void as against creditors.\nThe argument of the appellant must be that the provision of the Act that makes the appellant\u2019s title void has, at the same time, the effect of vesting or retaining the legal ownership in the debtor as trustee, with a valid equitable ownership in the appellant. To hold that a trust in favour of the appellant was thus created, unaffected by the provisions of the statute, would virtually render the statute of no effect. This argument seems to be untenable.\nIt was also contended that the respondent was estopped by his own conduct from recovering the amount claimed. The appellant demanded from him, and obtained, possession of the cars, which the appellant sold; and it is argued that this giving up of possession by the trustee amounts either to an actual abandonment of the property by the trustee or is in the nature of an estoppel against the trustee. The learned trial judge holds that the trustee did not agree with the appellant that the appellant was entitled to possession of the cars by virtue of its securities, but intimated, in giving up possession, that the question of appellant\u2019s title was not admitted, and was being investigated by its solicitors. He further points out that the trustee cannot, without the authority of the inspectors, give up any right which the trustee has in respect of the debtor\u2019s property, and that therefore no act of the trustee, unauthorized by the inspectors, can raise an estoppel against the trustee.\nI agree with the finding of the trial judge that there was no estoppel under the circumstances.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. LAMONT, J.\u2014In this case I concur in the conclusion reached by my brother Smith. In so far as the automobiles purchased from the General Motors are concerned, I concur for the reason stated in my brother\u2019s judgment. In so far as the two Viking cars are concerned, I concur for the reason that the evidence, in my opinion, clearly establishes an intention on the part of both the dealer (The Grand River Motors, Limited) and the Commercial Finance Corporation that the dealer should acquire title to the cars from the shipper and then, having the property in them, should sell them to the Corporation. The Corporation, it was understood, would in turn sell them back to the dealer under a conditional sales agreement. That such was the mutual intention is made clear by a perusal of the documents and an examination of the course of dealing between the parties.\nWhen the cars arrived from the shipper, and the dealer was notified that the bill of lading with a draft attached for the price was at the bank, the dealer inspected the cars and ascertained the descriptive number and model of each. These numbers it took to the Corporation, got the Corporation\u2019s cheque for the price and gave the Corporation a bill of sale of the cars, which were still in the possession of the railway company, and which were to be delivered to the dealer on payment of the draft. The cheque of the Corporation paid the draft; the cars were handed over to the dealer, and were placed in the dealer\u2019s warehouse. That the dealer was to acquire the property in the cars before selling them is shewn by the bill of sale (designated an \u201cIndenture\u201d), given by the dealer and accepted by the Corporation. In that document the dealer is described as \u201cvendor\u201d and the Corporation as \u201cpurchaser.\u201d The document contains the following:\u2014\nWITNESSETH that, in consideration of the said total selling price of lawful money of Canada paid by the PURCHASER to the VENDOR (the receipt thereof is by him acknowledged) the VENDOR hath sold, assigned, transferred and set over and doth hereby sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the PURCHASER, its successors and assigns, the motor vehicles of the respective numbers, makes and models and for the respective prices shewn on the margin hereof, which said motor vehicles are contained in, upon or about the premises of the VENDOR, situate and being at No. 70 John Street North, in the City of Hamilton, and County of Wentworth, Ontario.\n* * * THE VENDOR hereby represents and warrants to the PURCHASER that the said motor vehicles are brand new, and COVENANTS that he, the VENDOR, is rightfully and absolutely possessed of and entitled to the said motor vehicles and rightfully entitled to sell the same to the PURCHASER, and that the latter has, by virtue hereof, become the rightful owner thereof by a good and sufficient title free and clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances whatsoever\nBy this document the parties in the clearest and most explicit language have declared:\n1. That the dealer was selling to the Corporation the cars described in the document.\n2. That the dealer was rightfully and absolutely possessed of the cars.\n3. That it was entitled to sell them to the Corporation, and\n4. That the Corporation, by virtue of this bill of sale, had become the rightful owner of the cars.\nI do not think language more definite or explicit could be used to convey the idea that the dealer was selling to the Corporation and the Corporation was purchasing cars of which the dealer was the owner and of which it had absolute property.\nIt was, however, argued that at the moment the bill of sale was signed the dealer did not have title to the cars, that the title was then in the shipper and, therefore, the dealer could not pass to the Corporation property in the cars which he did not possess. The answer to this argument, in my opinion, is that the bill of sale was executed at that particular time for the convenience of the dealer in the ordinary course of business and to avoid the necessity of returning to execute it after he had paid the shipper\u2019s draft. It was, however, not intended to operate as a bill of sale until the dealer had the cars upon its premises, where he could not have them until after the draft was paid. This is shewn by the language used in the first of the above quoted paragraphs in which it is declared that the cars being sold\nare contained in, upon or about the premises of the Vendor, situate and being at No. 70 John Street North, in the City of Hamilton,\nand also by the declaration that the dealer was selling its own cars. What took place in this case was just an ordinary, everyday transaction in which the conveyance was drawn up and executed preparatory to the completion of the transaction. I cannot think that the legal effect of such a transaction can be made to depend upon whether the dealer executes the bill of sale before he pays the shipper\u2019s draft and receives the bill of lading, or afterwards. The order in which the various steps toward completion are taken is immaterial, the documents are effective from the moment the parties intended they should become operative. The appellant strongly relied upon the judgment of this court in In re Estate of Smith and Hogan, Limited[10]. In my opinion that case has no application to the one before us. In the Smith and Hogan case10, which in some respects resembles the present one, there was no bill of sale from the dealer to the financial company which was supplying the dealer with money to carry on its business. There was, in that case, nothing to indicate the real nature of the transaction except the cheques representing the moneys advanced, the conditional sales agreement from the financial company to the dealer, and the course of business between the parties. There was no evidence, verbal or written, that the dealer had ever agreed to sell to the financial company, or that the company had agreed to purchase the automobiles described in the conditional sales agreement. The intention of the parties, therefore, had to be inferred from the conditional sales agreement and the course of dealing between the parties. This court, by a majority, drew the inference (p. 668),\nthat both parties intended that the cheque was given on the condition that title was to pass to appellants, and it could only be so passed by use, on appellant\u2019s behalf, of Smith & Hogan\u2019s right to acquire ownership and possession.\nand (p. 669)\nthat an agreement was arrived at * * * by which Smith & Hogan, Limited, in consideration of the cheques, transferred to the appellant their right to acquire ownership and possession of the cars.\nThe ratio of that decision, therefore, was that both parties understood and intended that what the company was to obtain for its cheque was a transfer of the dealer\u2019s right to acquire ownership and possession of the cars, and not the cars themselves. In other words, the company was to receive what, in effect, would be an assignment of the dealer\u2019s rights under its contract to purchase.\nAs I have said, that case, in my opinion, can have no application here, for, in the case before us, it seems to me\nimpossible for a court, without doing violence to the language used in the bill of sale, to find as a fact that the intention of the parties was that the Commercial Finance Corporation, in consideration of the cheques which it advanced, was to have only an equitable right to acquire the ownership and possession of the cars, and not the property in the cars themselves. The question involved, in my opinion, is one of fact.\nCANNON J., without delivering written reasons, held that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Briggs, Frost & Birks.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Company.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 712; 14 C.B.R. 165; [1932] 4 D.L.R. 657.\n[2] [1932] O.R. 101; 13 C.B.R. 107; [1932] 1 D.L.R. 565.\n[3] [1932] Can.

Y.\u2019s wife was riding with him. Y. and his wife sued M., and M. counterclaimed against Y., for damages. It was alleged against each driver that he was on the wrong side of the road. The jury found that negligence of M. and Y., equally, caused the collision, the negligence consisting, on M.\u2019s part, \u201cby being too far over on his wrong side, swerved to east (his right) side of road but was too late to avoid the accident,\u201d and on Y.\u2019s part, \u201con seeing M.\u2019s car coming towards him, swerved to the east (his wrong) side of the road in the direction of oncoming car.\u201d Based on the jury\u2019s findings (and having regard to the Negligence Act, Ont., 1930, c. 27), judgment was entered for Y. against M. for one-half of Y.\u2019s damages, and for M. against Y. for one-half of M.\u2019s damages, and for Y.\u2019s wife against M. for the whole of her damages, and M. was awarded indemnity against Y. for one-half of the damages awarded to Y.\u2019s wife. This judgment was varied by the Court of Appeal, Ont., which allowed Y. his full damages and dismissed M.\u2019s counterclaim (leaving undisturbed Y.\u2019s wife\u2019s judgment against M. and not allowing indemnity to M. against Y. in respect thereof). M. appealed.\nHeld: The judgment at trial should be restored, except that M. should have no indemnity against Y. as to damages awarded to Y.\u2019s wife.\nIn view of all the evidence, the charge to the jury and the jury\u2019s findings, there was not adequate ground for holding that M., \u201cby being too far over on his wrong side,\u201d had created a sudden emergency such as to relieve Y. from blame for his act (as found by the jury) of swerving to his left; and the finding of negligence against Y. should not be set aside.\nThe court could not award to M. indemnity against Y. in respect of the damages awarded to Y.\u2019s wife; s. 3 of the Negligence Act (supra) provided for contribution and indemnity only in the case of joint and several liability, and, under the law (Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 182, s. 7), Y. could not be sued by his wife for damages caused by the accident, and therefore was not and could not be found liable jointly and severally with M. to her. (McDonald v. Adams, 41 Ont. W.N. 145, approved on this point; Ralston v. Ralston, [1930] 2 K.B. 238; Gottliffe v. Edelston, [1930] 2 K.B. 378; Goldman v. Goldman, 61 Ont. L.R. 657, Coupland v. Marr, [1931] O.R. 707; Tetef v. Riman, 58 Ont. L.R. 639, referred to).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which varied, in favour of the plaintiff James A. Young, the judgment of Rose, C.J., on the findings of a jury.\nThe action was for damages caused by a collision between two motor cars, the one driven by the plaintiff James A. Young, in which his wife (the other plaintiff) was riding, and the other driven by the defendant. The plaintiffs charged the defendant, and the defendant (who counter-claimed) charged the plaintiff James A. Young, with negligence causing the collision.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nAt the trial the jury found negligence, causing the collision, in both the defendant and the plaintiff James A. Young, in equal degree, the negligence consisting, on defendant\u2019s part, \u201cby being too far over on his wrong side, swerved to east (his right) side of road but was too late to avoid the accident\u201d; and on plaintiff\u2019s part, \u201con seeing Macklin\u2019s car coming towards him, swerved to the east (his wrong) side of the road in the direction of oncoming car.\u201d The jury found that the damages to the plaintiff James A. Young were $850, to the plaintiff Mrs. Young $1,000, and to the defendant $4,958.\nOn these findings, judgment was given at trial to the plaintiff Mrs. Young against the defendant for $1,000; and (having regard to the provisions of The Negligence Act, 1930, c. 27, s. 3), to the defendant for indemnity against the plaintiff James A. Young to the extent of one-half the amount recovered by the plaintiff Mrs. Young, to the plaintiff James A. Young against the defendant for $425, and to the defendant against the plaintiff James A. Young for $2,479.\nThis judgment was varied by the Court of Appeal (which held that, upon the facts and circumstances in evidence, the finding against plaintiff of negligence causing the collision was not justified), the judgment, as so varied, being that the plaintiff James A. Young recover from defendant $850; that the plaintiff Mrs. Young recover from defendant $1,000; and that defendant\u2019s counterclaim be dismissed.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. By the judgment of this Court, the appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge restored, with the variation that (for reasons stated in the judgments now reported) the paragraph, in the formal judgment at trial, giving indemnity to the defendant against the plaintiff James A. Young, be struck out.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and Duff Slemin for the appellant.\nC.W.R. Bowlby for the respondents.\nReasons were delivered, by Smith J. (dealing more at length, than in the reasons delivered by Hughes J., with the said question of indemnity to defendant), concurred in by Rinfret and Lamont JJ.; and by Hughes J., concurred in by Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nSMITH J. (Concurred in by Rinfret and Lamont JJ.)\u2014I agree with my brother Hughes, for the reasons stated by him, that this appeal should be allowed, and that judgment should be entered on the basis of the findings of the jury. According to these findings, the appellant Macklin and the respondent James A. Young were both negligent, and contributed to the accident in equal degrees. The respondent Mary I. Young, wife of the respondent James A. Young, was awarded $1,000 damages, which she is, of course, entitled to recover in full against the appellant.\nFormal judgment in the trial court adjudges that the defendant (appellant) be entitled to be indemnified by the plaintiff (respondent) James A. Young to the extent of one-half of the amount so recovered by the plaintiff Mary I. Young (respondent). This point was not raised in the pleadings, but was discussed at the trial, as follows:\nHis LORDSHIP: I suppose she is entitled to her judgment against Macklin regardless of the finding of the contributory negligence of Young, but I suppose that under the statute Macklin is entitled to contribution from Young to that\u2014\nMr. BOWLBY: I think that would be the result.\nOn behalf of the respondent James A. Young it was submitted in respondent\u2019s factum and on the argument that the appellant is not entitled to indemnity for any part of the damages awarded to the respondent Mary I. Young. No cross appeal was taken against this provision in the judgment, but we are of opinion that, in accepting the findings of the jury, this court ought to order the proper judgment that should follow from these findings to be entered. It therefore becomes necessary to adjudicate upon this point raised in the factum and upon the argument. The objection to the clause of the trial judgment referred to is that the respondent Mary I. Young, being the wife of the respondent James A. Young, had no right of action against her husband, and that the appellant, in consequence, has no right to indemnity for any part of the damages awarded against the appellant to the respondent Mary I. Young.\nSection 7 of The Married Women\u2019s Property Act, R.S.O., 1927, ch. 182, reads as follows:\n7. Every married woman shall have in her own name against all persons whomsoever, including her husband, the same remedies for the protection and security of her own separate property as if such property belonged to her as a feme sole, but, except as aforesaid no husband or wife shall be entitled to sue the other for a tort.\nThis section is almost an exact copy of sec. 12 of the English Married Women\u2019s Property Act. Under that section it was held by Macnaghten J., in Ralston v. Ralston[2], that no action lay, by a wife against a husband, for libel, and this was followed by McCardie J., in Gottliffe v. Edelston[3], in an action for personal injury.\nThe same view, under sec. 7 of the Ontario Act, has been taken by Wright J. in Goldman v. Goldman[4], and by the Appellate Division in Coupland v. Man[5]. This is clearly the correct view, and, having regard to the words of the statute, would seem hardly to require argument, were it not for the suggestion that the wife might ground a right of action on an implied contract by the husband to carry her with reasonable care, rather than on tort. Such an argument, however, is not tenable, in view of the ultimate result of the authorities which are exhaustively reviewed by Mr. Justice Middleton in Tetef v. Riman[6].\nIn the present case, therefore, Mary I. Young had no right of action against her husband, James A. Young, for damages sustained by her through his negligence, and the appellant can have no right of indemnity against the husband unless it is expressly provided for by the statute. The statute relied upon is The Negligence Act, 1930, ch. 27; sec. 3 of which reads as follows:\nIn any action founded upon the fault or negligence of two or more persons the court shall determine the degree in which each of such persons is at fault or negligent, and where two or more persons are found liable they shall be jointly and severally liable to the person suffering loss or damage for such fault or negligence, but as between themselves, in the absence of any contract express or implied, each shall be liable to make contribution and indemnify each other in the degree in which they are respectively found to be at fault or negligent.\nThe jury has found that the damage to Mary I. Young was the result of the negligence of the appellant and her husband, but, under the law as already stated, the husband was not and could not be found liable jointly and severally with appellant to the wife, and it is only in the case of joint and several liability that the section provides for contribution and indemnity.\nI am therefore in accord with the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in McDonald v. Adams[7], where it is held that there is no right to contribution under such circumstances. The appeal will therefore be disposed of as set out in the reasons of my brother Hughes.\nHUGHES J. (Concurred in by Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.).\u2014This action arose out of a collision between two motor vehicles, which occurred after dusk on the evening of the 3rd day of November, 1930, on a paved highway which runs approximately in a northerly and southerly direction between the city of Brantford and the town of Simcoe in the province of Ontario. Fred T. Macklin was driving his motor vehicle in a northerly direction and had come around a gradual curve. The plaintiff James A. Young, accompanied by his wife, the plaintiff Mary I. Young, was driving his motor vehicle in a southerly direction and accordingly was approaching the same curve. The accident occurred approximately fifty feet north of the end of the curve and therefore at a place where the road was straight. The plaintiffs alleged that the motor vehicle of the defendant was wholly or partly on the west side of the road at the time of the collision. The defendant, on the other hand, contended that the motor vehicle of the plaintiff, James A. Young, was wholly or partly on the east side of the road at the time of the collision.\nThe action was tried before the Chief Justice of the High Court with a jury at Hamilton on the 11th, 12th and 13th days of April, 1932. The jury retired at 3.25 p.m., returned several times and finally brought in their verdict at 8.20 p.m., a duration of almost five hours.\nThe jury found that the drivers were equally negligent and answered the questions as to liability as follows:\nQ. 1. Was the collision caused by the negligence of Macklin?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. 2. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\u2014A. By being too far over on his wrong side, swerved to east side of road but was too late to avoid the accident.\nQ. 3. Was the collision caused by the negligence of James Young?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. 4. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\u2014A. On seeing Macklin\u2019s car coming towards him, swerved to the east side of the road in the direction of oncoming car.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs thereupon submitted to the learned trial judge that the answer to question no. 4 was not negligence in law. This discussion is important. It is as follows: Mr. BOWLBY: Well, my submission would be, my Lord, that the answer to question number 4, that is, the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, is not negligence in law at all.\nHis LORDSHIP: Why? \u201cOn seeing Macklin\u2019s car coming towards him, swerved to the east side of the road in the direction of the oncoming car.\u201d Why isn\u2019t it?\nMr. BOWLBY: Because, my Lord, the answer to question number 2 makes it clear that the defendant, as the plaintiff has always contended in this case, was driving on the wrong side of the road, and so far on the wrong side of the road that it was necessary for him to go to his right side in order to avoid an accident.\nHis LORDSHIP: In order for whom to go?\nMr. BOWLBY: For the defendant.\nHis LORDSHIP: That is what he was endeavouring to do, according to the jury.\nMr. BOWLBY: No; they said he went too late.\nHis LORDSHIP: \u201cBy being too far over on his wrong side, swerved to east side of the road.\u201d He swerved to the east; that is to his right.\nMr. BOWLBY: That is his right.\nHis LORDSHIP: But was too late to avoid the accident.\nMr. BOWLBY: Yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: What they mean is, I take it, that coming around the bend he took the larger side of the curve, the outside, and coming into the straight his intention was to get back on to the right side, and to give Young his half of the road, but that he put that off too long; and then they think that Young, making the little left turn that has been described, or the big left turn, whichever it was, frustrated that attempt of Macklin\u2019s.\nMr. BOWLBY: Well, of course, I do not want to enter into a long argument, but my submissions would be that if Macklin is on the wrong side of the road, and, as the evidence shows, coming straight for Young on his wrong side of the road, there was really nothing, in the flash of time that there was, that Young could do that could be negligence. As has been said by the courts, if A puts B in a position of grave danger and emergency, and B does the wrong thing, B is not negligent.\nHis LORDSHIP: In order that you can succeed at all, you have got to uphold the second finding, the finding of Macklin\u2019s negligence.\nMr. BOWLBY: Oh, yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: Now, if that finding is justified, and Macklin was really trying to get back to the right side, the very least little turn by Young to the left would frustrate that attempt, or might; and I should think the answer to the fourth question could for that reason be supported if the answer to the second question can stand. I think that the attack, if there is to be an attack, upon the findings would be rather against the answer to the second question than the answer to the fourth. If the fourth stood all by itself without the second, then there might be force in your suggestion, but, the second standing, I do not believe I can say there was no evidence to justify the fourth.\nMr. BOWLBY: It is not a question of no evidence, my Lord; it is a question of the negligence that the jury find not being negligence in law under the authorities.\nHis LORDSHIP: Simply because it is done in an emergency.\nMr. BOWLBY: Yes\u2014on all the evidence. Of course, the plaintiff\u2019s contention from start to finish in this case has always been that Macklin was on his wrong side of the road. His LORDSHIP: I know.\nMr. BOWLBY: And the jury find that. Now, under those circumstances\u2014I have authorities to bear out my contention\u2014under those circumstances, there was only, on all the evidence, a flash of time.\nHis LORDSHIP: Yes, but I cannot conceive how a reasonably competent driver could, even in such an emergency as Young thought existed, have adopted the course that Young adopted.\nMr. BOWLBY: Well, there is a case on all fours\u2014I mean, the facts are absolutely identical with this case, and Mr. Justice Orde said\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, they are not identical; you never saw facts that were identical.\nMr. BOWLBY: However, I think there is a very strong contention there.\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, I do not know what you are going to do about it if you want\u2014my present impression is against you on that. I have been thinking about it a bit since the verdict was rendered, and my present impression is, as I said before, that if the second answer stands the fourth can be supported, and that it was really for the jury to say whether this was a mere failure to do the best thing in a sudden emergency, or whether, having regard to all the facts, it was an act of want of reasonable skill, which, in the case of the driver of a motor car, is negligence, because it is negligent to be in charge if you have not reasonable skill.\nThe learned trial judge reserved judgment and on April 20, 1932, he gave judgment. After referring to Harding v. Edwards[8], and Smith v. Cowan[9], the learned trial judge said in his written reasons:\nThe point made is that the act which the jury say was negligence on the part of Young was one of those errors of judgment in a sudden emergency which the courts have said ought not to be called negligence, and the two cases cited are cases in which the trial judge, in considering an act somewhat like the act of Young, came to the conclusion that the act, because an act done in a sudden emergency, was not properly to be called an act of negligence. But this case is a case tried with a jury, and I think it was for the jury to say whether the act was an act of the class to which I have been referring or was an act of incompetence amounting to negligence; and my recollection is that I put to the jury the question\u2014not in writing, but for their consideration\u2014as to the category into which Young\u2019s act or any act of Young might fall. The jury, upon a charge which was not objected to, have said that Young was negligent; that means, I think, that they have found that Young\u2019s act was not an act falling within the category in which the acts referred to in the cases cited were found to fall, but an act falling within the other category. I see, therefore, no necessity of postponing the matter further in order to hear counsel for the parties who are not represented here today, and I shall proceed to direct the entry of judgment in accordance with the findings of the jury.\nFormal judgment accordingly was entered for the plaintiff, James A. Young, for $425, being one-half of his dam- ages, and for the plaintiff, Mary I. Young, for $1,000, against the defendant; for the defendant on his counterclaim for $2,479, being one-half of his damages, against the plaintiff, James A. Young, and the defendant was awarded indemnity against the plaintiff, James A. Young, for one-half of the damages awarded to the plaintiff, Mary I. Young.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, on the grounds, among others, that the verdict was unreasonable, that the effective cause of the accident was the negligence of the defendant, that the defendant had created an emergency, and that, accordingly, the act of Young in turning to the left was not negligence in law. On the 25th day of November, 1932, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the plaintiffs and varied the judgment below by allowing the plaintiff, James A. Young, the full amount of his damages of $850 against the defendant, by dismissing the counterclaim of the defendant and by awarding costs throughout to the plaintiffs.\nThe learned Chief Justice in appeal was of opinion that the negligence of Macklin was the sole effective cause of the collision, and that the finding of the jury that Young was negligent was not a finding of negligence in law. Mr. Justice Riddell was of opinion that the finding of the jury was unreasonable; and Mr. Justice Fisher, that the defendant had created an emergency and was solely to blame.\nFrom the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the defendant appealed to this Court.\nCounsel for the respondents, when called upon, contended before us that the answer of the jury to question number 2 made it clear that the jury did not believe the evidence adduced by the appellant, that all the evidence at the trial which the jury did believe supported the contention of the respondents that the appellant had created a sudden emergency, and that, therefore, the remarkable act of the respondent, James A. Young, in turning his motor vehicle to the left was not, in the circumstances, negligence in law.\nThere was a serious conflict of testimony at the trial.\nThe respondents swore that the motor vehicle of the appellant was wholly or partly on the west side of the road, both before and at the time of the collision, The following witnesses, however, called by the appellant, were respectively asked the following questions and made the following answers, among others:\u2014\nS. H. Carson:\nQ. Now, down to that time, you having the lights of the Macklin car in view, what side of the highway was he travelling on, the right or the left?\u2014A. When Mr. Macklin came around the curve he was on the\u2014what he would call his right side of the road; my left hand side.\nQ. Your left hand side; that would be his right hand side?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Now, from that time, as he came around the curve on his own right hand side of the pavement, down to the time that Young made the turn that you have told us about, did Macklin come over to the other side of the pavement at all?\u2014A. You mean did he come\u2014\nQ. Did he come over on his wrong side of the pavement?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Did he\u2014you can tell us, because you say you were watching his lights until Young turned\u2014did he deviate at all from his own side of the pavement, did Macklin?\u2014A. Macklin\u2014I couldn\u2019t tell his position until he rounded the curve, but after he rounded the curve he was in his proper position.\nQ. And then when he had rounded the curve did you see him as he came along before Young made the turn?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And when you saw him coming along after\u2014Macklin I am talking about now?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. As you saw Macklin coming along after he had rounded the curve and made the turn, did Macklin or did he not continue on his own right hand side?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And was he or was he not on his right hand side at the time Young turned over?\u2014A. Yes.\nH. Persall:\nQ. Were you or were you not able to see the Macklin car when it got to the end of the curve and straightened out, if it did?\u2014A. Yes, I was.\nQ. And at that time can you tell us about how far you were behind it?\u2014A. I couldn\u2019t say; a hundred feet or more is what I was following him, but I couldn\u2019t say just exact.\nQ. Well, would it or would it not be much more than a hundred feet?\u2014A. No, I wouldn\u2019t think it would be.\nQ. You wouldn\u2019t think it would be much more than a hundred feet that you were behind. Perhaps that answers it, my Lord. Then were you or were you not able to see at that time upon what part of the highway the Macklin car was travelling?\u2014A. He was on his right hand side.\nJ. Davis:\nQ. Then you have told us that you observed the car which was going along the highway in the Brantford direction ahead of you; did you notice upon what portion of the pavement it was proceeding?\u2014A. It was on the pavement on the right side.\nDr. Quinn:\nQ. Was, was he or was he not coherent in what he said?\u2014A. He appeared to me to be a man who was very much confused at the office and at the time of the accident. Q. And was he or was he not able to give you any rational account of what had occurred?\u2014A. Naturally, knowing this road and having driven it so often, I was interested to know how an accident of this sort could occur on a slow curve, and Mr. Young expressed to me that he had become very confused and apparently had taken the wrong side of the road.\nHis LORDSHIP: Q. And what?\u2014A. Apparently had taken the wrong side of the road.\nQ. Oh, don\u2019t say apparently had done anything. Tell what he said?\u2014A. Well, that is what I recall, sir\u2014\nQ. Listen: is that your gloss or his statement?\u2014A. His statement, sir.\nB. Milligan:\nQ. When you spoke to Mr. Young, was he or was he not, as nearly as you could judge, able to answer you coherently?\u2014A. Yes, I think so. I asked him\u2014I asked for the drivers of the cars first. Someone told me that the driver of the coupe had been taken to the hospital, and Mr. Young came forward as the driver of the Nash sedan, and I asked him, I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw the lights of this car coming\u2014appeared to be coming towards me.\u201d\nQ. He said?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. \u201cAnd I turned over to the left to avoid them.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you pull over here to the right and stop?\u201d Showed him the space on the right hand side. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge charged the jury fully on their duty if they found that Macklin had created a sudden emergency, using the following words:\nSupposing Macklin was on the wrong side of the road, then what about Young? Could Young have done something better than he did do, and ought he to have done something better than he did do? Now, it is true, as counsel have stated to you, that in a sudden emergency for which you are not responsible you are not held to be negligent simply because you did not do the thing which, thinking about it afterwards calmly, you can say was the right thing. You are bound\u2014and I come back to what I started with\u2014you are bound to use reasonable care, that is, the care of a reasonably careful man, you are bound to use reasonable skill, and if you have not reasonable skill you have no right on the road in control of a motor car, and reasonable skill is the skill of a reasonably competent driver, in this case; but you are not supposed to be a superman, you are not supposed to be able to think and to act, in a sudden emergency which you have not created, more quickly and more accurately, correctly, than the reasonably competent, careful man. And so, if you find that Macklin was on Young\u2019s side of the road, you will ask yourselves whether Young\u2019s act in turning, if you think he did turn, was the right act under the circumstances, or if it was not the right act whether it was an act that ought to be called a negligent act.\nThen, supposing you find that Macklin was not on Young\u2019s side of the road\u2014let me pause there a moment before I go to that question. In considering Young\u2019s act I think you ought to inquire as to how long it had been apparent to Young, or how long it would have been apparent to Young had he been paying all the attention that he ought to have been paying, that Macklin was on the wrong side of the road. Young does not speak of seeing Macklin\u2014you will correct me if I am wrong\u2014I think Young does not speak of seeing Macklin while Macklin was on the curve; I think Young\u2019s knowledge of Macklin\u2019s lights, according to Young, begins when Macklin was in or getting into the straight. Now, suppose that Macklin in the straight was on or partly on Young\u2019s side of the road; did Young become aware of that fact as soon as a reasonably competent, careful driver would have become aware of it? If not, was failure to become aware of Macklin\u2019s position sooner a bit of negligence which had to do with or was a cause of this accident?\u2014because of course you are not concerned with any bit of negligence that did not enter into the accident itself.\nWell, supposing Macklin, as I say, was on the wrong side of the road, then, having regard to the duty to see, and having regard to what I have said about action in an emergency, was Young negligent in what Young did if Young pulled to the left instead of pulling to the right, or instead of stopping, or instead of doing whatever else may be suggested?\nThere is no doubt that the jury weighed the conflicting evidence seriously. At one time the jury returned and the following discussion took place between the learned trial judge and the jury:\nJUROR: We are deadlocked as to the testimony of several witnesses, and that is where we stand just at present.\nHis LORDSHIP: Do you mean deadlocked as to what the witnesses said, or as to\u2014\nJUROR: As to whether we consider\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: They ought to be believed?\nJUROR:\u2014they are right to the points or as to whether we should accept or reject\u2014\nHis LORDSHIP: I see. It is not any doubt as to what they said?\nJUROR: No, your Lordship.\nThe respondents have no finding from the jury that there was a sudden emergency. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence from which the jury may well have inferred that the respondent, James A. Young, if he had been keeping a proper look out, could, with or without a slight reduction of speed, have allowed Macklin to pass safely on the east side of the road.\nThe following questions and answers in the cross-examination of the respondent, James A. Young, are apposite:\nQ. Yes, that is correct. We have already heard that this was November; the trees, of course, were bare of leaves, weren\u2019t they?\u2014A. I would expect they would be, yes.\nQ. Very much as the photograph, Exhibit 2, indicates?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. No obstacle to prevent you seeing the headlights, the full headlights, of the Macklin car shining as it came into the curve, was there?\u2014A. If I had been looking down that far, I couldn\u2019t\u2014\nQ. Well, that is it, Mr. Young. Now perhaps you will tell us, why weren\u2019t you looking?\nMr. BOWLBY: He said if he had been looking that far. Mr. BELL: Q. Why weren\u2019t you looking?\u2014A. Well, ordinarily driving you look fifty or a hundred feet ahead.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. In around that direction.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. This car came very rapidly into the orbit of my vision.\nQ. And did you or did you not know that there was a curve there?\u2014A. Not until afterwards, no.\nQ. So that the situation is this, that, not knowing there was a curve there, you were not prepared for the appearance of anything swinging around the curve, and you could not tell whether or not it had got over to your side; is that putting it fairly?\u2014A. No, that is not the way of it. The car was on my side when I saw it.\nThe respondents, moreover, have not a finding of the jury that the appellant was wholly or partly on the west side of the road at the time of the accident. In fact, it may be contended that the appellant has a finding of the jury that he was back to the east side of the road but was too late to avoid the accident, because the respondent, James A. Young, also swerved to the east side of the road.\nNor have the respondents a finding of the distance between the cars when the appellant swerved to the east side of the road except by inference from the words \u201ctoo late,\u201d the tardiness therein expressed possibly having a causal relationship to the accident only by reason of the frustration spoken of by the learned trial judge.\nIn Smith v. Schilling[10], Lord Justice Scrutton said:\nGreat attention is always paid to the view which the judge at the trial takes of the verdict of the jury.\nThis jury, fully charged, did not find any sudden emergency and put Young into the category of a negligent person. It is impossible to remove him from this category on the findings of the jury without also weighing directly conflicting evidence; and we do not suggest that, if we were permitted to weigh the evidence, we should exonerate him.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be allowed with costs against the respondent James A. Young here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored, with this variation, however, that in accordance with McDonald c. Adams[11], with which we agree, paragraph 3 of the formal judgment which gave the appellant indemnity against the respondent James A. Young for one-half of the damages awarded to the respondent Mary I. Young should be struck out.\nAppeal allowed with costs; judgment at trial restored with variation.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bowlby & Turville.\n[1] (1932) 41 Ont.

The agreement between the Dominion and Manitoba provided (and clauses in the other agreements were to the like effect) that the Crown\u2019s interest in Crown lands, etc., and all sums due or payable for such lands, etc., should belong to the Province, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Crown in the same, and that \u201cany payment received by Canada in respect of\u201d any such lands, etc., before the agreement came into force, should continue to belong to Canada whether paid in advance or otherwise, the expressed intention being that (except as in the agreement otherwise specially provided) Canada should not be liable to account for any payment made in respect of any of the lands, etc., before the agreement came into force, and that the Province should not be liable to account for any such payment made thereafter; and that the Province would \u201ccarry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease \u201c any Crown lands, etc., \u201cand every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown.\u201d\nField: The obligation to refund dues as aforesaid was, under the terms of the agreement, upon the Province.\nThe obligation to refund was a term of an \u201carrangement\u201d whereby the homesteader had \u201cbecome entitled to an interest\u201d in \u201cCrown lands\u201d \u201cas against the Crown,\u201d within the meaning of the agreement. (A homesteader\u2019s rights and the character thereof, with regard to timber on the land, discussed, with reference to the Dominion Lands Act and Regulations).\nThe moneys so received by the Dominion as timber dues were \u201cpayments\u201d (and continued to belong to Canada without liability to account) within the contemplation of the agreement.\nSaid S. 47 (\u0192) of the Regulations was validly promulgated under authority of the Dominion Lands Act (ss. 57 (1), 57 (26) and 74 (k) of the Act particularly referred to and considered).\nHeld, further: The patentee of a homestead has, by force of the B.N.A. Act, 1930 (confirming the agreements and giving them \u201cthe force of law\u201d), a direct recourse, for such refund, against the Province.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, under the provisions of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, to the Supreme Court of Canada, of the questions set out below.\nThe Reference was made by Order in Council dated May 4, 1933, which proceeded upon a report from the Acting Minister of Justice, with reference to the provisions of the regulations governing the granting of yearly licences and permits to cut timber on government lands in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and in what are commonly known as the \u201cRailway Belt\u201d and \u201cPeace River Block\u201d in British Columbia, which timber regulations were established by Order in Council of March, 26, 1924, and subsequent amending Orders in Council, under the authority of the Dominion Lands Act, now R.S.C, 1927, c. 113, and with reference, in particular, to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (\u0192) of s. 47 of the said regulations (which paragraphs (e) and (\u0192) are set out in the judgment now reported).\nPrior to the coming into force of the several Agreements entered into between the Government of the Dominion of. Canada and the Governments of the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, respectively, whereby provision was made for the transfer to the said Provinces, respectively, on the terms and conditions therein set forth, of the natural resources therein described (which said Agreements were confirmed and given the force of law by the British North America Act, 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 26 (Imp.)), permits to cut timber were, pursuant to the terms of paragraph (\u0192) of s, 47 of the Timber Regulations; granted to entrants for homesteads, etc., on Dominion lands within the said several Provinces, and dues required to be paid, under said paragraph (\u0192) of s. 47, were paid by the permittees to the Dominion Government. Under said paragraph (\u0192) of s. 47, the amount so paid was to be refunded when the permittee secured his patent.\nSubsequently to the coming into force of the said Agreements between the Dominion and the said respective Provinces, many of such permittees became entitled to and received patents, for the lands for which they had made entry, from the Crown in the right of the Province within which such lands were respectively situate, and thereupon became entitled to a refund of dues paid by them as aforesaid. The question then arose between the Dominion Government and the Government of each of the said Provinces, whether the obligation to make the refund of dues in such cases was, under the terms of the said Agreements, an obligation of the Provincial Governments, respectively, or of the Dominion Government.\nThe questions referred were as follows:\n\u201c(a) Under the terms of the several Agreements aforementioned, is the obligation to refund dues, pursuant to the terms of paragraph (\u0192) of section 47 of the Timber Regulations, in the cases aforementioned, an obligation of the Dominion or of the respective Provinces?\n\u201c(b) If the obligation be that of the Dominion, is the Dominion entitled to be recouped by the Provinces respectively, the amount of the dues so refunded?\u201d\nC. P. Plaxton, K.C., and E. Read, K.C., for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nW. J. Major, K.C., Attorney-General of Manitoba.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan and the Attorney-General of Alberta.\nE. F. Newcombe, K.C., for the Attorney-General of British Columbia. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff C.J.\u2014Our opinion is required touching matters involved in questions addressed to us by His Excellency the Governor in Council, in an order dated the 4th of May, 1933. These interrogatories concern the scope of a stipulation found in agreements between the Dominion of Canada and the provinces, British Columbia, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan, respectively. They are in these terms:\n(a) Under the terms of the several Agreements aforementioned, is the obligation to refund dues, pursuant to the terms of paragraph (\u0192) of section 47 of the Timber Regulations, in the cases aforementioned, an obligation of the Dominion or of the respective Provinces?\n(b) If the obligation be that of the Dominion, is the Dominion entitled to be recouped by the Provinces respectively, the amount of the dues so refunded?\nThe general effect of the agreements, with Alberta (October 1, 1930), with Saskatchewan (October 1, 1930), and with Manitoba (July 15, 1930), is to provide for the transfer of the lands, mines and minerals of the Crown in the right of the Dominion, in these several provinces, to the provinces in which they are situate. The agreement with British Columbia provides for the re-transfer to the province of the Crown lands, mines and minerals in the areas known respectively as the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block.\nThe precise issue is whether or not the provinces severally assumed, by these agreements, an obligation to repay moneys received by the Dominion, as dues in respect of timber permits granted to entrants in occupation of homesteads, under regulations professedly promulgated under the Dominion Lands Act. The regulation which gives rise to the obligation to repay is no. 47 (\u0192). We quote it textually, as well as no. 47 (e):\n(e) Any holder of an entry for a homestead, a purchased homestead or a pre-emption, who, previous to the issue of letters patent, sells any of the timber on his homestead, purchased homestead or pre-emption, to owners of saw-mills or to any others without having previously obtained permission to do so from the Minister, is guilty of a trespass and may be prosecuted therefor before a justice of the peace and, upon summary conviction, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars, and the timber so sold shall be subject to seizure and confiscation in the manner provided in the Dominion Lands Act.\n(\u0192) If the holder of an entry as above described desires to cut timber on the land held by him, for sale to either actual settlers for their own use or to other than actual settlers, he shall be required to secure a permit from the Crown timber agent in whose district the land is situated, and shall pay dues on the timber sold to other than actual settlers at the rate set out in section 42 of these regulations, but the amount so paid shall be refunded when he secures his patent.\nThe articles of the several agreements in virtue of which, in the view of the Dominion, the provinces have assumed the repayment provided for in regulation 47 (\u0192) are (we quote clauses 1 and 2 of the Manitoba agreement which, admittedly, are in substantially identical terms with the cognate clauses of the other agreements):\n1. In order that the Province may be in the same position as the original Provinces of Confederation are in virtue of section one hundred and nine of the British North America Act, 1867, the interest of the Crown in all Crown lands, mines, minerals (precious and base) and royalties derived therefrom within the Province, and all sums due or payable for such lands, mines, minerals or royalties, shall, from and after the coming into force of this agreement, and subject as therein otherwise provided, belong to the Province, subject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Crown in the same, and the said lands, mines, minerals and royalties shall be administered by the Province for the purposes thereof, subject, until the Legislature of the Province otherwise provides, to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada relating to such administration; any payment received by Canada in respect of any such lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement shall continue to belong to Canada whether paid in advance or otherwise, it being the intention that, except as herein otherwise specially provided, Canada shall not be liable to account to the Province for any payment made in respect of any of the said lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement, and that the Province shall not be liable to account to Canada for any such payment made thereafter.\n2. The Province will carry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals and every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown, and further agrees not to affect or alter any term of any such contract to purchase, lease or other arrangement by legislation or otherwise, except either with the consent of all the parties thereto other than Canada or in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province or to interests therein, irrespective of who may be the parties thereto.\nThese clauses must, of course, be read together, and in light of the objects of the compacts as disclosed by their recitals, their provisions as a whole, and the circumstances all parties had in view in concluding them; but the matter in controversy may fairly be stated thus: Is the obligation to repay a term of an \u201carrangement\u201d under which \u201cany person became entitled to an interest\u201d (within the meaning of these clauses) in any \u201cCrown lands * * * as against the Crown\u201d? The Dominion contends that the obligation is a term of an \u201carrangement\u201d creating such an \u201cinterest\u201d in one or both of these senses: first, as one of the terms under which the entrant acquired and held his homestead; and, second, as a term of the \u201carrangement\u201d under which the entrant obtained a permit to cut timber under regulation 47 (\u0192).\nBy the Dominion Lands Act (s. 2(h)) \u201chomestead\u201d is defined thus:\n\u201chomestead\u201d means the land entered for under the provisions of this Act or of any previous Act relating to Dominion lands for which a grant from the Crown may be secured through compliance with the conditions in that respect prescribed at the time the land was entered for.\nBut this definition does not, of course, exhaustively describe the entrant\u2019s rights in relation to his homestead. The statute declares (s. 8) that lands of the character described in the section are open for homestead entry; it provides for application for entry (s. 11); and by subsection 2 of the last mentioned section it is enacted:\n2. When application is so made for land then open to homestead entry, the local agent or officer acting for him shall accept it upon payment of the said fee and shall give the receipt hereinafter provided for; and the acceptance by the local agent, or the officer acting for him, of the said application and of the fee shall constitute entry, and the receipt given to the applicant in form D shall be a certificate of entry and shall entitle the recipient to take, occupy, use and cultivate the land entered for, and to hold possession thereof to the exclusion of any other person, and to bring and maintain actions for trespass committed on the said land; and the land shall not be liable to be taken in execution before the issue of letters patent therefor: Provided that occupancy, use and possession of land entered for as a homestead, shall be subject to the provisions of this Act or of any other Act affecting it, or of any regulations made thereunder.\nSections 16 and 25 prescribe the conditions upon which the entrant becomes entitled to conveyance of the lands comprised within his homestead by letters patent. They are in these words:\n16. Every entrant for a homestead shall, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be required, before the issue of letters patent therefor,\n(a) to have held the homestead for his own exclusive use and benefit for three years;\n(b) to have resided thereon at least six months in each of three years;\n(c) to have erected a habitable house thereon;\n(d) to have cultivated such an area of land in each year upon the homestead as is satisfactory to the Minister; and\n(e) to be a British subject.\n25. The entrant for a homestead, or, in the event of his death, his legal representative or his assignee, or, in the event of his becoming insane or mentally incapable, his guardian or committee or any person who, in the event of his death, would be his legal representative, may, after the expiration of the period fixed by this Act for the completion of the requirements for obtaining letters patent for a homestead, make application therefor; and upon proving to the satisfaction of the local agent, or the officer acting for him, that the said requirements have been fulfilled, if the proof is accepted by the Commissioner of Dominion Lands, the entrant, or, in the event of his death, his legal representative or his assignee, shall be entitled to letters patent.\nA word of comment on these enactments will not be superfluous. The holder of a homestead during the term of his occupation, antecedent to the issue of the letters patent, has, subject to limitations not at present material, an exclusive right of occupation. It is not very profitable to seek, in the types of interests in land recognized by the common law, for some sort of common law description which may be supposed, by force of analogy, to be appropriate to the holder\u2019s interest in the land comprised within his homestead. That interest is most conveniently envisaged as a statutory interest sui generis, the character of which, as well as the rights annexed or incidental to it, must be ascertained from the Dominion Lands Act, and other statutes, as well as from any statutory regulations, \u201caffecting it\u201d. (R.S.C, 1927, c. 113, s. 11(2)).\nAs to the entrant\u2019s rights in relation to the timber on his homestead, in which we are especially concerned, the statutory conditions require him to hold \u201cthe homestead for his own exclusive use and benefit\u201d for the statutory period; to reside there six months in each of the three years; to cultivate \u201csuch an area * * * in each year * * * as is satisfactory to the Minister\u201d.\nThese requirements seem clearly to imply, having regard to the well known conditions under which homestead duties are usually performed, a right, in addition to the right of protection against trespass, to cut timber, not only for the purposes of cultivation, but also for fencing, for building, for fuel and for all other purposes involved in the maintenance of his occupation and in the working of the homestead, in the manner contemplated by the statute. If there could be any doubt of this, it would be swept away by reference to regulations 50, 51, 52 and 54 quoted in the Dominion\u2019s factum, and to s. 103 of the statute, of which regulation 47 (e) is a textual reproduction.\nThe right to cut, for the purposes of enabling him to enjoy the homestead as exclusive occupant, as cultivator and for his own domestic purposes, seems to be all that can reasonably be implied, as necessary or incidental to the exercise of rights expressly conferred, or necessary to enable him to perform his duties. Furthermore, s. 103 of the Act which, as already mentioned, is textually reproduced in 47 (e), must be taken into account, for the purpose of ascertaining the character of the holder\u2019s right in relation to the timber on his land. That section seems to imply that possession of the timber on the land (which includes trees standing, fallen or cut (s. 2 (j)) remains in the Crown. Moreover, by s. 63 of the statute, no person cutting or carrying away any timber from Crown lands acquires any right to such timber. By s. 65, where it is mixed with other timber so that it is impossible to identify it, the whole mass is deemed to have been cut without authority, and, further, the property of the Crown is not lost by reason of the fact that it has been used for building purposes.\nThe right given by regulation 47 (\u0192) is a right conditional upon obtaining a permit to cut timber either for sale to actual settlers for their own use or to others than actual settlers.\nIt is of no importance whether you regard this right to cut timber for commercial purposes, given by the regulation, as (1) an item in the sum of rights of the entrant as the holder of a homestead, or as (2) a separate right. It is plain that the right must be exclusive, as, admittedly, the statute does not contemplate the issue of licences or permits for cutting timber, on land within the boundaries of a subsisting homestead, to others than the holder; and, from either point of view, this right to cut timber would appear to vest in the holder of it an \u201cinterest in land\u201d within the meaning of the agreements.\nWe think the former of these two ways of regarding this right is the better one. In effect, the statute and the regulations together give to the entrant the right to cut timber on his homestead \u201cwithout stint\u201d, provided he complies with the conditions of the regulation. From this point of view, his right on obtaining his Crown grant to be repaid the dues paid by him under his permit seems to be plainly one of the \u201cterms\u201d of \u201cthe arrangement\u201d under which he acquires, first, the rights enjoyed during his occupancy, and, afterwards, his right to a patent.\nBut, even considering the right to cut under the regulation as a separate right, we think it constitutes \u201can interest\u201d in \u201cCrown lands * * * as against the Crown\u201d within the meaning of s. 2 of the agreements. Indeed, any other construction of these words would lead to singular results.\nBy s. 57 of the statute, the Governor in Council is authorized to make regulations for the \u201c issue (to settlers) of permits to cut timber for building purposes on their farms or for fuel for themselves\u201d; \u201cto steamboat owners, for use on their steamboats\u201d; \u201cin connection with * * * mining * * * operations\u201d; \u201cfor the construction of railways, bridges, churches, schools and public buildings, or any public works\u201d; \u201cfor sale as cordwood\u201d; \u201cfor pulp-wood\u201d. By s. 57 (2) the Governor in Council may make regulations for the issue of permits \u201cto cut timber as cordwood, pulpwood, fence posts, telegraph poles or props for mining purposes or for any other purpose\u201d. Acting under the powers so conferred upon him, the Governor in Council promulgated regulations authorizing permits in most, if not all, of these cases.\nConsider a permit, for example, under s. 57 (1g) to cut timber \u201cfor sale as cordwood\u201d, or, under s. 57 (2b), for \u201ctelegraph poles\u201d, and in force on the date when the agreements took effect. It would be strange if the rights of the holder of such a permit were not protected by the agreement; and we think such protection was intended to be and is provided by the words of clause 1,\nsubject to any trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any interest other than that of the Crown in the same,\nwhen read and construed (as they must be) together with the correlated words of clause 2,\nevery other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown.\n\u201cInterest,\u201d in our opinion, includes, at least, every interest which it was the duty of the Crown to recognize, as trust embraces every obligation savouring of the nature of trust or equitable obligation affecting the lands, mines and minerals transferred, to which the Crown was under duty to give effect. From this point of view the right of repayment is one of the terms upon which he acquires his permit.\nBut it is necessary to notice an argument addressed to us to the effect that the right of the patentee to repayment is not a right arising under an \u201carrangement,\u201d within the meaning of the agreements. The words of clause 2, \u201cand every other arrangement whereby,\u201d etc., must, it is argued, be construed in compliance with the rule noscitur a sociis as extending only to arrangements of a \u201ccontractual nature.\u201d\nThe subject of the clause comprises two classes of arrangements, (1) contracts \u201cto purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals,\u201d and, (2) \u201cevery other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown\u201d.\nIt is quite impossible, of course, to contend that the second class includes only arrangements which are strictly contracts, because if that had been the purpose of the clause, the word \u201ccontract\u201d would have been used, instead of \u201carrangement,\u201d to describe the kind of transactions falling within it.\nThen, is the statutory system, under which the homestead entrant becomes entitled to the rights which the statute conditionally gives him, an \u201carrangement,\u201d within this second class? It would not be misleading, though, perhaps, not technically accurate, to speak of the provisions of the statute as an offer, and the performance of the conditions as an acceptance, and the resulting statutory rights as rights arising from the offer so made and so accepted. This is, we repeat, not a precise legal description of what takes place, but at least it may be stated that, if this statutory system under which these rights arise, involving, as it does in its working, co-operation between the entrant, in the performance of the prescribed statutory conditions, and the Crown and the officers of the Crown, in recognizing the resulting statutory rights of the entrant, and giving effect to them, is not an \u201carrangement\u201d or does not involve arrangements of such a nature as to bring it within the second class, then the scope of that class, except in so far as it comprehends transactions which are simply and strictly contracts, embraces only an extremely narrow field. We think the language of the clause is altogether too explicit to justify such a restriction of its scope. It seems to us that the character of the arrangements contemplated is clearly defined by the adjectival phrase \u201cwhereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown\u201d; and that these words should be construed in their ordinary sense.\nAs to the term \u201carrangement\u201d itself, comment seems unnecessary. It clearly extends to the transaction or series of transactions, by which the entrant becomes entitled, first, to his homestead, and afterwards to his Crown grant; as well as to the transaction by which he acquires his rights under a permit.\nWe now turn to an argument vigorously urged upon us by the provinces and,, especially, and very ably, in the factum filed on behalf of Manitoba. It is based upon this sentence in clause 1:\nany payment received by Canada in respect of any such lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement shall continue to belong to Canada whether paid in advance or otherwise, it being the intention that, except as herein otherwise specially provided, Canada shall not be liable to account to the Province for any payment made in respect of any of the said lands, mines, minerals or royalties before the coming into force of this agreement, and that the Province shall not be liable to account to Canada for any such payment made thereafter.\nThe argument is that the moneys received by the Dominion as timber dues under the regulation are not \u201cpayments,\u201d within the contemplation of the agreement. In one form of the argument, it is contended that these moneys are in the nature of a security for the performance of the conditions entitling the holder of the permit to a patent. It is also put in this way: the Dominion did not acquire these moneys, it is said, as owner, but held them only in trust or in medio, for disposition, according to the event, on the issue of letters patent, or the abandonment or cancellation of the homestead, as the case might be.\nWe see nothing to justify the conclusion that the Dominion did not receive these moneys as owner. There is nothing to indicate that they are to pass to a separate fund, or that they are to be dealt with in any other way than moneys received from any other source of revenue. It is impossible to doubt that, in considering the facts bearing upon the financial readjustments provided for, or contemplated by the agreements, moneys received from this source would be taken into account as against the Dominion. In our view, the contemplated character of the transactions in respect of these moneys is precisely what they appear to be on their face: first, a receipt of timber dues as revenue, dealt with in the same way as all such revenues are dealt with; secondly, a payment back to the patentee, of the moneys so paid in, under a statutory right, which came into existence on the issue of the patent. We are, therefore, unable to give effect to this contention. There remains the question whether regulation 47 (\u0192) was promulgated under statutory authority. We think this question must be answered in the affirmative on two grounds. First, the authority given by s. 57 (2b) which is in these words:\npermits to cut timber as cordwood, pulpwood, fence posts, telegraph poles or props for mining purposes or for any other purpose, over tracts of land not exceeding one square mile in area, except in the case of permits to cut pulpwood which may apply to tracts of such area as may be determined by the Governor in Council:\nseems to us to be adequate to support the regulation.\nThere was some suggestion that the words \u201cfor any other purpose\u201d must be limited in obedience to noscitur a sociis in such a way as to exclude a regulation like regulation 47 (\u0192) from its purview. We think you cannot exclude commercial purposes from the scope of the phrase \u201cany other purpose\u201d. When the whole of s. 57 is looked at it is plain that there is much overlapping and, we think, you cannot, in construing it, assume a series of strict logical disjunctions. We doubt if, regarding the section as a whole, the ejusdem generis rule has any proper application to the phrase \u201cany other purpose\u201d. We are satisfied, moreover, that regulation 47 (\u0192) falls within the ambit of the powers conferred on the Governor in Council by s. 57(1).\nAdmittedly, as already observed, the statute does not contemplate subjecting land held under homestead to the same regulations respecting the grant of permits or licences to cut timber as those governing the granting of such permits or licences in respect of lands still in possession of the Crown. But s. 57 does not itself regulate the issue of permits; it leaves the whole subject to the Governor in Council, and we see no reason for concluding that Crown timber on homestead land is not within the regulatory authority conferred by the section, which must, of course, be exercised in consonance with other provisions of the statute relating to homesteads.\nThere is another basis upon which the regulation can be sustained. By s. 74 (k) the Governor in Council is empowered to\nmake such orders as are deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, according to their true intent, or to meet any cases which arise, and for which no provision is made in this Act; and further make any regulations which are considered necessary to give the provisions of this section full effect. We cannot think of any reason for excluding such regulations as 47 (e) and (\u0192) from the ambit of the authority hereby created.\nThere is still a further question, and that is whether or not the patentee has, by force of the statute, a direct recourse against the province. Had we felt any doubt on the subject, we should have considered it improper to answer the question in the absence of some argument in the interest of the patentees. It is clear to us, however, that the B.N.A. Act, 1930, gives statutory force to the obligations of the provinces under arts. 1 and 2 of the agreements; this, we think, is the effect of s. 1 of the statute which is in these terms:\n1. The agreements set out in the Schedule to this Act are hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Act, 1867, or any Act amending the same, or any Act of Parliament of Canada, or in any Order in Council or terms or conditions of union made or approved under any such Act as aforesaid.\nThe phrase \u201cshall have the force of law,\u201d when found in the statutory enactment and in the context in which it appears, can, we think, have no other meaning.\nThe answers which we shall respectfully submit to His Excellency are:\nTo the Interrogatory numbered one: The said obligation is an obligation of the respective provinces;\nTo the Interrogatory numbered Two: In view of the answer to Interrogatory No. One, this question does not arise; but, if our view had been that the provinces were not under a direct obligation to refund, we should have considered that the Dominion, on refunding such dues, would be entitled to recoupment from the province concerned.\nQuestions answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W. Stuart Edwards.\nAttorney-General of Manitoba: W. J. Major.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan: Alex. Blackwood.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Alberta: J. J.

Act, 1930)\u2014B.N.A. Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92. Appellant was holder of a lease from the Dominion Government, granted under the regulations of March, 1910 and 1911 (made under authority of the Dominion Lands Act, 1908, c. 20), of a tract of land in the Turner Valley gas field, in the province of Alberta, for the purpose of mining and operating for petroleum and natural gas. Sec. 2 of the agreement between the Dominion and the Province, dated December 14, 1929 (respecting transfer to the Province of public lands, etc.; and which agreement was confirmed and given \"the force of law\" by the B.N.A. Act, 1930, c. 26) provides that \"the Province will carry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals and every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown, and further agrees not to affect or alter any term of any such contract to purchase, lease or other arrangement by legislation or otherwise\" except with consent or \"in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province * * *.\" In 1932 (c. 6) the Province passed the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Act, the broad purpose of which was to reduce the loss of gas in the said field by burning as waste, and which subjected a lessee's operations to the control of a Board whose duty it was to limit the production of natural gas, in the said field, and from any particular well by reference to the amount of naphtha the well ought, in the Board's opinion, to be permitted to produce.\nHeld: The said Act of the Province \"affected\" the \"terms\" of the lease and of similar leases made under said regulations, within the meaning of s. 2 of said agreement (and did not come within the exceptions in said s. 2), and was, in so far as it affected such leases, incompetent. (Judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1932] 3 W.W.R. 477, [1932] 4 D.L.R. 750, reversed in this respect).\nThe Act \"affected\" the lease, notwithstanding that the lease required the lessee to work the mines \"in such- manner only as is usual and customary in skilful and proper mining operations of similar character when conducted by proprietors themselves on their own lands.\" Conforming to such standard of working did not require following methods dictated by considerations of public policy, as contradistinguished from the interests of proprietors as proprietors.\nSec. 29 of the Dominion regulations of 1928 (published in 1930), which (among other provisions) required a lessee to take precautions against \"waste\" of natural gas, did not apply to the lease in question. The rule that a legislative enactment is not to be read as prejudicially affecting accrued rights, or \"an existing, status\" (Main v. Stark, 15 App. Cas. 384, at 388), unless the language in which it is expressed requires such a construction, operated against such application; the Order in Council bringing s. 29 into force contained nothing in its language to indicate that s. 29 was intended to take effect upon the mutual rights of lessors and lessees arising under the terms of leases granted pursuant to the regulations of 1910 and 1911. Neither the terms of the lease itself, nor the regulations of 1910 and 1911, justified a construction by which s. 29 was made to constitute a part of the contract. But even assuming that s. 29 applied, it afforded no escape from the conclusion that the terms of the lease were disad-vantageously \"affected\" by the provincial Act; whatever might be the exact effect of such a requirement against \"waste\" (if it applied to the lease), the provincial Act, limiting arbitrarily the gross production of the field, and subjecting the lessee, in respect of the production of gas, to the \"uncontrolled discretion\" (s. 13 of the Act) of an administrative Board, in this respect radically altered the status of the lessee under the terms of his lease.\nSec. 2 of said agreement between the Dominion and the Province precluded the Province from legislating in such a way as to \"alter\" or \"affect\" any \"term of any such lease,\" irrespectively of any possibility that such legislation might be of such a character as to fall under powers of legislation possessed by the Province prior to the agreement. But, further, had the provincial Act in question been passed prior to the agreement, and while the public lands were still held by the Dominion, it would have been inoperative, as regards such leases as that in question, on the grounds (1) that it was repugnant, in so far as it affected tracts leased under the regulations of 1910 and 1911, to those regulations, and the Dominion statute under which they were promulgated; and (2) that, in so far as it authorized the Board to make regulations (taking effect by orders of the Board which were given statutory force) concerning the production of natural gas and naphtha from lands held under lease from the Dominion for the purpose of working them for the production of those minerals, it was legislation strictly concerning the public property of the Dominion (reserved for the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion by s. 91 (1) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867).\nHeld also (agreeing in this respect with the judgment of the Appellate Division, supra): The Act of the province could not be said to be invalid on the ground that, as a whole, it dealt with matters falling strictly under s. 91 (2) (regulation of trade and commerce), or, at all events, with matters outside the scope of s. 92, of the B.N.A. Act, 1867. (Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia Ltd. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580, at 587, cited). The Act was, in substance, legislation providing for the regulation of the working of natural gas mines in the Turner Valley area from a provincial point of view and for a provincial purpose; nothing had been shown to indicate that the working of the mines (excepting the wells upon lands leased from the Dominion) was a matter which, by reason of exceptional circumstances, had ceased to be, or had ever been, anything but a matter \"provincial\" in the relevant sense.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1].\nThe plaintiff Spooner was the holder of a lease of land dated August 31, 1912, from His Majesty the King, represented therein by the Minister of the Interior of Canada, for the \"sole and only purpose\" of mining and operating for petroleum and natural gas, and of laying pipe lines, etc The lease was granted under the Regulations of March, 1910 and 1911, made under the authority of the Dominion Lands Act, 1908, c. 20, s. 37. The appellant company was the owner in fee simple of certain lands, and held a sub-lease of sixty acres of the tract leased to the plaintiff Spooner. All the lands were in the Turner Valley gas field in the province of Alberta. The plaintiffs brought an action, attacking an order made by The Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board as being illegal and unauthorized (The plaintiffs' contention below that the Board's order was not authorized by the provincial Act in question was not argued in the present appeal); attacking the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Act, Statutes of Alberta, 1932, c. 6, as being contrary to the terms of s. 2 of the agreement dated December 14, 1929, made between the Government of the Dominion of Canada and the Government of the Province of Alberta (respecting transfer to the Province of public lands, etc.), and set out as a schedule to c. 26 of the Imperial Statutes of 1930 (the British North America Act, 1980, which confirmed said agreement and gave it \"the force of law\"); and attacking the said Act of the Province as being legislation in regard to the \"regulation of trade and commerce\" (B.N.A. Act, 1867, s. 91 (2)), and therefore ultra vires; and attacking s. 20 of the said Act of the Province as imposing indirect taxation and being, therefore, ultra vires. Ewing J. dismissed the action[2]. The Appellate Division [3] varied his judgment so as to declare that ss. 20, 21 and 22 of the said Act of the Province were ultra vires (as imposing indirect taxation. Ewing J., for reasons stated in his judgment, did not make a declaration ;on this point), and in all other respects affirmed his judgment. The plaintiffs appealed (by leave of the Appellate Division) to the Supreme Court of Canada. (There was no cross-appeal against the declaration that ss. 20, 21 and 22 were ultra vires, and this matter was not in issue in the present appeal).\nThe material facts, and the questions in issue on the present appeal, are more fully set out in the judgment now reported.\nThe appeal was allowed with costs, and judgment was directed- declaring that the impeached legislation was invalid as respects the leasehold properties of the appellants.\nH. S. Patterson, K.C., for the appellants.\nW. S. Gray, K.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014The appellant Spooner is the holder of a \"lease\" of a tract of land in the Turner Valley gas field, which gives him the right to work the tract for petroleum and natural gas. The term of the lease is twenty-one years and is renewable at its expiration. The lease was granted under the Regulations of March, 1910 and 1911, and it will be necessary to consider the provisions of it with some particularity.\nThe Turner Valley gas field is what is known as a \"wet-field \"; one, that is to say, where the natural gas coming to the surface holds crude naphtha in suspension. The practice of the operators in that field was, up to the time the impugned legislation was enacted, to extract the naphtha from the natural gas by passing the gas through separators, and thereby effecting a liquefaction of the naphtha.\nFor the natural gas produced in this field there is no sufficient market, and, since, to allow it to escape into the atmosphere (after the extraction of the naphtha) might endanger the health of people living in the vicinity, it is for the most part burned as refuse. Some of it is transported to Calgary and Lethbridge for consumption there in the production of light and heat; and some is used in refineries; but, while the ratio of the volume of gas consumed as waste to that which is usefully consumed varies from month to month, it may be stated, without substantial inaccuracy, that very little more than ten per cent. of what passes out of the wells is, except for the recovery of naphtha, applied to any useful purpose.\nIn 1932 the Legislature of Alberta passed a statute, The Turner Valley Gas Conservation Act (1932, c. 6); the broad purpose of which is to reduce the loss of gas in this field by burning as waste. A Board is constituted, The Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, the general function of which, the statute declares, is to take measures for the conservation of gas in the Turner Valley field.\nThe appellant company are the owners, in fee simple, of several tracts in the field, and hold a sub-lease of sixty acres of the tract leased to the appellant Spooner. The appellants, who are plaintiffs in the action, seek a declaration that the legislation of 1932 is ultra vires, as a whole, on the ground that it deals with matters falling within the ambit of s. 91 (2) of the British North America Act, or, at all events, with matters outside the scope of s. 92. They contend, in the alternative, for a declaration that, in so far as the legislation affects the rights of the appellants under the lease mentioned (as well as of other holders of similar leases), it is an invasion of the legislative sphere reserved to the Dominion by s. 91 (1) of the B.N.A. Act in respect of \"The Public * * * Property\", and consequently, to that extent (if not in its entirety), ultra vires, and further that the legislation \"affects\" the provisions of such leases within the meaning of s. 2 of the compact between the Province and the Dominion, to which the B.N.A., 1980, gives \"the force of law\", and is, therefore, incompetent. Article 2 of the compact is in these words:\nThe province will carry out in accordance with the terms thereof every contract to purchase or lease any Crown lands, mines or minerals and every other arrangement whereby any person has become entitled to any interest therein as against the Crown, and further agrees not to affect or alter any term of any such contract to purchase, lease or other arrangement by legislation or otherwise, except either with the consent of all the parties thereto other than Canada or in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the province or to interests therein, irrespective of who may be the parties thereto.\nWe have come to the conclusion that the first of these contentions fails, and we shall postpone the discussion of that for the present. We are unable, however, to agree with the decision of the courts below with regard to the second contention.\nWe think that the legislation of 1932 does \"affect\" the \"terms\" of the appellant's lease, and of similar leases, within the meaning of the article quoted, and that it is, therefore, incompetent in so far as it does so \"affect\" such leases.\nContrasting the rights of the appellant Spooner and of any lessee, as lessee, under the provisions of a lease, granted under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, and under the Regulations, a copy of which is annexed to Spooner's lease, with the position of a lessee under a lease of identical terms, but brought under the dominion of the provincial statute, there can, we think, be no dispute that the terms of leases governed by the regulations alone and the rights of the lessee under such terms are \"affected\" in a substantial degree by the legislation; if the legislation can take effect upon such leases.\nWe quote textually two clauses of Spooner's lease which are the only provisions immediately pertinent:\nNOW THEREFORE THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH that in consideration of the rents and royalties hereinafter reserved and subject to the provisos, conditions, restrictions and stipulations hereinafter expressed and contained, His Majesty doth grant and demise unto the lessee, for the sole and only purpose of mining and operating for petroleum and natural gas, and of laying pipe lines and of building tanks, stations and structures thereon necessary and convenient to take care of the said products,\nthe tract demised for the term defined, and renewable as stipulated.\nBy article 8 it is agreed,\nThat the lessee shall and will during the said term, open, use and work any mines and works opened and carried on by him upon the said lands in such manner only as is usual and customary in skilful and proper mining operations of similar character when conducted by proprietors themselves on their own lands, and when working the same shall keep and preserve the said mines and works from all avoidable injury and damage, and also the roads, ways, works, erections and fixtures therein and thereon in good repair and condition, except such of the matters and things last aforesaid as shall from time to time be considered by any inspector or other person authorized by the Minister to inspect and report upon such matters and things to be unnecessary for the proper working of any such mine, but so that no casing placed in any mine shall be removed or impaired, and in such state and condition shall and will at the end or sooner determination of the said term deliver peaceable possession thereof and of the said lands to His Majesty.\nThe lessee has, under the terms of the lease, the right, during the currency of the term, of \"mining and operating for petroleum and natural gas\" subject only to the conditions and restrictions prescribed by the provisions of article 8. Under that article, the standard by which the lessee is to govern himself in opening, using and working \"any mines and works opened and carried on by him\" is the standard set by the manner of doing so \"in skilful and proper mining operations\", which is \"usual and customary\" among proprietors working their own lands. This involves two things: the lessee's manner of working the demised property is to conform to that which is \"usual and customary\" with proprietors working their own lands; but that again is qualified by the condition that the manner of working must conform to what is \"usual and customary\" in \"skilful and proper mining operations\" carried on by such persons in such lands.\nThere is no suggestion here that, in working his property conformably to the standard of \"skilful and proper mining operations\", the proprietor is supposed to be aiming at any object other than exploiting his own property in a profitable way. Any method of working lands for gas and petroleum which is \"usual and customary\" among proprietors exploiting their own property, for their own profit, and which, from that point of view, is \"skilful and proper\", could not be condemned, as in contravention of article 8, merely because considerations of public policy, as contradistinguished from the interests of proprietors as proprietors, might dictate a different course.\nTurning now to the enactments of the statute of 1932. The Act (s. 13) requires the Board to\nproceed to reduce the production of gas from all the wells in the area to an aggregate amount of not more than two hundred million cubic feet of gas per day, and to prescribe the daily rate of permitted production for each of every such well, * * *\nIt is also enacted that, for this purpose, the Board\nmay by order prescribe the periods during which any specified well or wells may be permitted to produce, and the total amount of the production which may be permitted during any such period from any such well or wells, and the working pressure at which all wells or any specified well shall be operated, and may by subsequent order and from time to time increase or reduce the amount of the permitted production of any well as the Board in its uncontrolled discretion deems proper.\nThe Board is further directed, (after certain tests provided for have been made) to determine the total amount of daily production which ought to be permitted for the time being from all wells and from each well in the area.\nThe operations of the lessee are subjected, by the statute, to the control of a Board whose duty it is to limit the production of natural gas in the whole of the Turner Valley field; and to limit the production of natural gas, from any particular well, by reference to the amount of naphtha the well ought, in the opinion of the Board, to be permitted to produce. The effect of the Order of the Board, of which the appellants complain (and this we mention by way of illustration only), upon the operations of the appellant company has been to reduce its production of naphtha by something like 95%.\nOn the 4th of May, 1932, the Board issued an order known as Order No. 1 in which, inter alia,\n* * * the Board does order and prescribe that on and after the ninth day of May, 1932, the amount of gas permitted to be produced daily from the respective wells set out in (the schedule to the Order) shall not be greater than is required to produce the amount of naphtha set out opposite the description of each such well in said schedule following * * *\nThe Order further requires that every person operating a well set out in the schedule to the Order\nshall so operate it so as not to permit such well to produce a greater daily flow of gas than will produce the number of barrels of naphtha set in said schedule opposite the description of such well.\nIt may be observed, although our conclusion is in no way dependent upon it, that it seems to be conceded that, as a rule, proprietors in the Turner Valley field carried on their operations in the manner above described; and that there really is no evidence to show, nor indeed is there any suggestion, that such a method of working a well of the type found in that field, which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the Order of the Board, was a method not permitted by article 8 of the appellant's lease. There is nothing pointing to the conclusion that such a manner of working is not a manner\nusual and customary in skilful and proper mining operations of similar character when conducted by proprietors themselves on their own lands.\nBy the terms of the lease, the lessee undertook certain obligations therein defined. What the legislation professes to do is to substitute for these obligations a discretionary control by an administrative body which is governed, in the exercise of its discretion, by general principles and rules laid down in the statute, pursuant to a policy of conserving natural gas in the entire field in the general public interest; with no regard (or at all events only in a very subordinate degree) to the standards, or the rules governing proprietors acting in the usual and customary manner in skilfully and properly working their own land for their own profit.\nThe respondents advance the argument that this reasoning is met by reference to s. 29 of the Regulations of 1928 which were published in 1930. That section contains this provision:\nIn case natural gas is discovered through boring operations on a location, the lessee shall take all reasonable and proper precautions to prevent the waste of such natural gas, and his operations shall be so conducted as to enable him, immediately upon discovery, to control and prevent the escape of such gas.\nThe respondents rely upon that part of the provision which relates to \"waste\". Several points are involved in the examination of this contention.\nFirst (assuming s. 29 to apply to leases granted under the regulations of 1910 and 1911) the provision quoted does not afford to the respondents a way of escape from the conclusion that the terms of the lease are disadvan-tageously \"affected\" by the legislation of 1932. The obligation under s. 29, upon which the argument is founded, is to \"take all reasonable and proper precautions to prevent the waste\" of natural gas. Whether the use of the natural gas for the purpose of recovering the naphtha held in suspension is \"waste\" within the meaning of this provision would, in a controversy between the Crown and the lessee, be a question to be determined by the courts.\nThe application of gas to the useful purposes of creating light and heat necessarily involves the destruction of it. The production of gas for the purpose of recovering from it the naphtha in suspension necessarily (necessarily, that is to say, in a practical business sense) involves the loss of the gas for which there is no market as gas. From the point of view of the proprietor there is no evidence that this loss of gas is not more than compensated for by the value of the naphtha recovered; and, as already observed, there are no facts before us justifying the conclusion that the obligation to \"take all reasonable and proper precautions to prevent waste\" imports a prohibition upon production for such a purpose. The legislation of 1932 limits, but does not prohibit, such production and neither the enactments of the statute nor the orders of the Board go to the length of declaring, that such production necessarily involves waste, which, from any point of view, ought to be prohibited.\nWhatever be the exact effect of this provision of s. 29, it is quite clear that, while if, in the opinion of the Minister, the lessee infringes it, the Minister may call upon him to answer for his delinquency in the courts, yet, under the provision, such appeal to the courts is, apart from the cancellation of the lease, his only remedy. The enactments of the provincial statute, limiting arbitrarily the gross production of the field, and subjecting the lessee, in respect of the production of gas, to the \"uncontrolled discretion\" of an administrative Board, in this respect radically alter the status of the lessee under the terms of his lease. This appears to have been, in substance, the view of the Apellate Division.\nThe next point for consideration is whether s. 29 applies to leases granted under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911. It must be examined from two aspects. The first aspect is that under which it was envisaged by the learned trial judge (who held that the rights of the lessee are governed by the section), in which s. 29 is regarded simply as a regulation made under the regulative authority conferred upon the Governor in Council by s. 35 of the Dominion Lands Act (c. 113, R.S.C. 1927) (which does not in any pertinent sense differ from s. 37 of the Act of 1908). The appropriate rule of construction has been formulated and applied many times. A legislative enactment is not to be read as prejudicially affecting accrued rights, or \"an existing status\" (Main v. Stark[4]), unless the language in which it is expressed requires such a construction. The rule is described by Coke as a \"law of Parliament\" (2 Inst. 292), meaning, no doubt, that it is a rule based on the practice of Parliament; the underlying assumption being that, when Parliament intends prejudicially to affect such rights or such a status, it declares its intention expressly, unless, at all events, that intention is plainly manifested by unavoidable inference. On the construction of this paragraph of s. 29 for which the respondents contend, the paragraph, if applicable, imposes ab extra by the force of law new terms, as broad, in scope, as the statute of 1932, which, as already observed, radically alter, to his prejudice, the rights and duties of the lessee under the stipulations of the existing contract of lease. The same thing could properly be stated of any construction which would leave it to the Crown to determine in its \"uncontrolled discretion\" what is and what is not \"waste\" within the meaning of the section. Moreover, the argument seems to involve the proposition that the whole of s. 29, and not alone the particular paragraph relating to \"waste\", applies to the leases in question; and there are still other provisions of s. 29, which, if operative, would, apart altogether from that provision, most materially affect his contractual rights and obligations.\nFirst, there is the provision reserving to the Minister the right to make additional regulations, as it may appear necessary or expedient to him, governing the manner in which the boring operations shall be conducted, and the manner in which the wells shall be operated.\nThen, there is the further provision vesting in the discretion of the Minister the power of cancellation in the event of non-compliance with the requirements set out in the section in relation to boring operations, or with any requirement which the Minister may consider it necessary to impose with respect to boring or operating.\nWe think there is nothing in the language of the Order in Council bringing into force this section 29 which requires us to hold that it was intended to take effect upon the mutual rights of lessors and lessees arising under the terms of leases granted pursuant to the Regulations of 1910 and 1911.\nThe other aspect, from which this point must be considered, presents for examination the question whether s. 29 constitutes a part of the contract, between the Crown and the lessee, by force of the contract itself. We think this question must be answered in the negative.\nThe lease declares, in express terms, that it is granted by the Minister of the Interior, pursuant to regulations made for the disposal of petroleum and natural gas rights, by Orders in Council dated respectively the 11th days of March, 1910 and 1911, \"a copy of which regulations is hereto appended\".\nThe term is twenty-one years and the lease is\nrenewable for a further term of twenty-one years provided the lessee furnishes evidence satisfactory to the Minister of the Interior to show that during the term of the lease he has complied fully with the conditions of such lease and with the provisions of the regulations under which it was granted.\nAmong the \"provisos, conditions, restrictions and stipulations\" of the lease there is this:\n2. That the lessee shall and will well, truly and faithfully observe, perform and abide by all the obligations, conditions, provisos and restrictions in or under the said regulations imposed upon lessees or upon the said lessee.\nThe Regulations \"appended\" to the lease contain the following:\n21. The lease shall be in such form as may be determined by the Minister of the Interior, in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations.\nIt appears that the lease is framed upon the view that the rights of the parties inter se are to be ascertained from the provisions of the lease, from the Regulations, a copy of which is appended thereto, and such further orders and regulations and directions as may be made from time to time during the currency of the lease under article 9 of the lease or sections 23 and 24 of the Regulations. The last mentioned sections are in these words:\n23. No royalty shall be charged upon the sales of the petroleum acquired from the Crown under the provisions of the Regulations up to the 1st day of January, 1930, but provision shall be made in the leases issued for such rights that after the above date the petroleum products of the location shall be subject to whatever Regulations in respect of the payment of royalty may then or thereafter be made.\n24. A royalty at such rate as may from time to time be specified by Order in Council may be levied and collected on the natural gas products of the leasehold.\nBut, it is argued that, notwithstanding the form of the lease itself, the concluding words of s. 1 of the Regulations of 1910 and 1911 have the effect of incorporating, as conditions of the lease, all subsequent regulations made during the currency of the term. The sentence in which these words occur is this:\nThe term of the lease shall be twenty-one years, renewable for a further term of twenty-one years, provided the lessee can furnish evidence satisfactory to the Minister to show that during the term of the lease he has complied fully with the conditions of such lease and with the provisions of the Regulations in force from time to time during the currency of the lease. \"The Regulations in force from time to time during the currency of the lease\" should be read, it is argued, as embracing all subsequent regulations whether incorporated in the terms of the lease, by force of some provision of the lease or of the existing Regulations, or not.\nWe cannot agree with this view of the effect of these words.\nWe think the better view is that they extend only to regulations made in exercise of a right reserved by the regulations of 1910 and 1911 or of the lease itself. Sections 23 and 24 contemplate such regulations, while by stipulations in the lease itself, the terms of which are left to his discretion, the Minister may, of course, consistently with the existing regulations, reserve the right to make further regulations. Article 9 of the lease in question contains such a reservation.\nThe view suggested involves the result that the terms of the contract may in every respect be altered (as regards rental, as regards royalties, as regards the obligations of the lessee in respect to the working of the mine); and by one party to the lease acting alone, without consultation with the other; and with the result (a result which, as we have seen, actually follows in this case from the acceptance of the respondent's contention) that a contract radically new, in its essential terms, may be substituted for that explicitly set forth in the document executed by the parties and the specific regulations that it incorporates.\nIt will be observed that the proviso, in express terms, affects only the right of renewal. On the supposition that the proviso relates to this right of renewal, and to that right alone, we arrive (on the construction advocated by the respondents) at the truly extraordinary result, that, even under the renewed lease, the lessee is not bound by s. 29; although his right of renewal is dependent upon compliance with that section prior to the completion of the original term. It is difficult, no doubt, to think it could have been intended that the lessee's right of renewal should be conditioned upon the performance, during the term antecedent to its renewal, of obligations which the lessee was not required to observe as contractual terms of the lease. But to us it seems clear that, if it had been intended to incorporate, as one of the terms of the lease, a stipulation that all future regulations touching the working of the property should become part of the lease as contractual stipulations, that intention would have been expressed, not inferentially, but in plain language.\nReverting to the form of the lease itself, as distinguished from the Regulations, and to the evidence it affords as to the view of the Minister, that the existing Regulations alone, and not Regulations subsequently enacted, are em-bodied in the lease, as forming part of the contract between the lessor and the lessee; it is not immaterial to recall what has already been stated, that, admittedly, this lease was in the usual form. The practice of the Department based upon this view of the effect of the Regulations of 1910 and 1911 is not without weight in a controversy as to its proper construction (Webb v. Outrim[5]). It may further be observed that, on this point, neither the Appellate Division nor the trial judge expressed an opinion in the respondent's favour. On the contrary, the Appellate Division appears to have entertained the view we have now expressed.\nWe turn now to the question which the Appellate Division regarded as the question of substance on the appeal. That court has taken the view that article 2 of the Compact has not the effect of depriving the provinces of any power of legislation which they possessed anterior thereto. This view is challenged by the appellants.\nThe question which thus arises is strictly a narrow one. The legislation of 1932 provides for the regulation of mining operations, for the production of natural gas, having naphtha in suspension, with the object of conserving the natural gas in the Turner Valley field. By its terms, it extends to operations in lands which (but for the B.N.A. Act, 1980) would have been public lands of the Dominion, as well as lands owned in fee simple by private individuals. The question may be put thus: Would it have been competent to the provincial legislature, if these public lands had not been transferred to the province, to regulate or to authorize an Administrative Board to regulate such operations, in private lands as well as Dominion public lands (held under lease to private individuals), by orders having the force of statute in the manner directed or contemplated by this legislation. The lessees, in virtue of leases under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, became, by force of Dominion statute, entitled to exercise the rights vested in them by the leases. Indeed, the public lands of the Dominion are vested in Parliament, in the sense that only by virtue of Parliamentary authority can such lands be disposed of or dealt with. The right of the lessee, in each case, is to take from a specified tract of land, which is leased to him for that purpose alone, certain substances and to convert them to his own use. Until so taken, they remain, subject to his right to take them during the specified term, the property of the Dominion\u2014part of the public lands of the Dominion. To take away this right, or to prohibit the exercise of it, would be to nullify pro tanto the statutory enactment creating the right. It is obvious, of course, that the provincial legislature could not validly have passed the enactments of the Dominion Lands Act, or the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, under which the lessee became entitled to exercise his rights. The appropriate principle seems to be that expressed by Lord Haldane in Great West Saddlery Co. Ltd. v. The King [6] in the words:\nNeither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have authority under the Act to nullify, by implication any more than expressly, statutes which they could not enact.\nThe principle applies to such a measure of regulation as that which is attempted by the legislation of 1932. It is nothing to the purpose that the legislation is expressed in general terms, applying to all wells in the Turner Valley area. The regulation takes effect by orders of the Board constituted under it, having the force of statute, which may apply, not only to the field generally, but to each well eo nomine. Every such order constitutes in effect a statutory edict, governing the operations in, and connected with, each several well against which it is directed.\nNor is it material that, by the lease, an interest in the tract has passed to the lessee. The Dominion Lands Act, and the Regulations enacted pursuant to it, give statutory effect to plans for dealing with Dominion public lands, including lands containing petroleum and natural gas, which, it must be assumed, were conceived by Parliament, and the authorities nominated by Parliament, as calculated to serve the general interest in the development and exploitation of such lands and the minerals in them. It is not competent to a provincial legislature pro tanto to nullify the regulations, to which Parliament has given the force of law in execution of such plans, by limiting and restricting the exercise of the rights in the public lands, created by such regulations in carrying the purpose of Parliament into effect. Indeed, an administrative order, which the legislature has professed to endow with the force of statute, directed against a tract of public land, the property of the Dominion, held by a lessee under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, and which professed to regulate the exercise, by the lessee, of his right to take gas and petroleum from the demised lands, would truly be an attempt to legislate in relation to a subject reserved for the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion by s. 91(1), \"The Public * * * Property\" of the Dominion.\nOn these two grounds, therefore, first, that the legislation of 1932 is repugnant, in so far as it affects tracts leased under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, to those Regulations, and the statute under which they were promulgated; and, second, on the ground that, in so far as it authorizes the Board to make regulations concerning the production of natural gas and naphtha from lands held under lease from the Dominion for the purpose of working them for the production of those minerals, it is legislation strictly concerning the public property of the Dominion; on both of these grounds, the legislation of 1932 would, if these public lands were still held by the Dominion, be inoperative, as regards the leases with which we are concerned.\nAs respects tracts of land held in fee simple, totally different considerations apply. Such tracts have ceased to be the public property of the Dominion, and in the absence of some Dominion enactment relating to matters comprised within the subject of the public property, that would have the effect of limiting the jurisdiction of the provinces (under s. 92 (10), (13) and (16)), there is no ground on which such legislation could, as affecting such lands, be held to be ultra vires. (McGregor y. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co.[7]). We have not considered it necessary to attempt the formulation of any general rule by which (apart from the enactments of the B.N.A. Act, 1930) the validity of provincial legislation affecting the holders of leases and other particular and limited interests in the public lands of the Dominion may be tested. Speaking broadly, it may be stated without inaccuracy that such legislation cannot lawfully take effect if it is repugnant to some statutory enactment by the Dominion passed in exercise of its powers to legislate in relation to its public lands. This is involved in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Great West Saddlery Co. case [8] already cited. The occupant of Dominion lands under a legal right may be taxed in respect of his occupancy. But it is necessary to be cautious in inferring from this that such taxation can in every case be enforced by remedies involving the sale or appropriation of the occupant's right, without regard to the nature of that right. Where the right is equivalent to an equitable title in fee simple, probably no difficulty would arise (Calgary and Edmonton Land Co. v. Attorney-General of Alberta[9]); but if the enforcement of a tax, imposed by provincial legislation, would involve a nullification in whole or in part of competent Dominion legislation under which the right is constituted, then it is, to say the least, doubtful, whether such provisions could take effect.\nThe judgment in the Great West Saddlery Co. case8 discussed the matter of the enforcement of a provincial tax levied upon a Dominion company incorporated under the residuary clause of s. 91. Lord Haldane there adverts to some of the difficulties attendant upon holding that it is competent to a provincial legislature to enforce the payment of a tax upon a Dominion company by a penalty involving the abrogation of some capacity or power competently bestowed upon it by the Parliament of Canada. Similar questions may be suggested as arising in other connections; for example, the question whether it is competent to a legislature to sanction measures for the enforcement of a tax imposed upon a Dominion railway which would involve the dismemberment of the railway.\nIn Smith v. Vermilion Hills[10], the proceeding was an action against Smith, who was assessed as tenant. The sole question in the action was that of Smith's personal liability to pay the tax. He\nwas duly assessed in respect of the land comprised in the two leases, and the question is whether the assessment was valid. (P. 573.)\nThe real question is whether this restriction (the restriction in virtue of s. 125 of the B.N.A. Act) prevents (the legislature of Saskatchewan) from imposing the tax in controversy upon a tenant of Crown lands. (P. 572.)\nNo question arose as to any remedy by proceedings affecting the title to the lands or the lease. This point was adverted to in this Court in Smith v. Vermilion Hills[11].\nIn City of Montreal v. Attorney-General for Canada[12], Lord Parmoor points out that the remedy of the municipality was necessarily limited in such a way as to exclude the operation of the provisions of the Charter of Montreal giving recourse against the immoveable occupied by the tenant.\nOnce again, as regards the amenability of occupants of Crown property to provincial laws in respect of nuisances (such as, for example, legislative provisions for the suppression of noxious weeds, mentioned in the judgment) which, as a rule, impose upon occupiers generally duties enforceable against the occupier personally by penalty, it is not out of place to observe that the validity of legislation empowering an administrative board to prescribe rules in relation to such matters, having the force of statute, with respect to any individual tract of land, including tracts which are the public property of the Dominion, might possibly, as affecting such tracts, be subject to different considerations. Where the regulations, under which Dominion lands are leased, or the stipulations of such leases, contain provisions dealing with the very subject matter of the provincial legislation, then it is quite obvious that such regulations and stipulations must prevail in case of conflict. (Madden v. Nelson & Fort Sheppard Railway Co.[13]; Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours[14]; Can. Pac. Ry. Co. v. The King[15]; Great West Saddlery Co. Ltd. v. The King[16]. We think it desirable to say this much, in order to indicate the difficulty of drawing an abstract line, assigning boundaries to the provincial fields of the general powers vested in the provinces by s. 92, and marking them off from the sphere of the essential powers of the Dominion, under one of the enumerated heads of s. 91, and s. 91 (1) in particular, or from the larger sphere which includes the Dominion's ancillary powers as well.\nIt may be observed, in view of some observations made by the Appellate Division, that land held under an estate in fee simple in a province is not necessarily subjected to an unlimited control by the province in the field of \"property and civil rights.\" Such is not the case, for example, where land so held is part of a Dominion railway. (Wilson v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co.[17]).\nIt may be proper also to utter a word of caution with regard to the authority of the provinces in relation to the \"confiscation\" of property.\nThe term \"confiscation,\" of course, connotes, according to ordinary usage, something in the nature of privilegium, of a special law dealing with a particular case. Now, it might be difficult, in most cases, to hold that a statute specifically appropriating to the Crown in the right of the province the interest of a lessee in Dominion lands, was not legislation dealing with the subject of the public property of the Dominion; and apart from that, it would probably also be difficult, in most cases, to escape the conclusion that an attempt to substitute the Crown as lessee, in place of a lessee, for example, who has acquired his lease under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911, was repugnant to such regulations and to the statute by which they were authorized.\nWe are, therefore, unable to concur with the Appellate Division in the reasons which led them to dismiss the appellant's appeal from the learned trial judge. We agree with them that the legislation of 1932 does not come within the exception set out in s. 2 of the compact. The exception is in these words:\nexcept either with the consent of all the parties thereto other than Canada or in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province or to interests therein, irrespective of who may be the parties thereto. Admittedly there was no consent, and it is hardly disputed that the legislation does not apply \"to all similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province or to interests therein.\"\nWe cannot, however, agree with the Appellate Division that the governing consideration, in applying s. 2 of the agreement, is that upon which they base their judgment. That section deals in specific terms with specific things. The Province is not to \"alter,\" nor is it to \"affect,\" except under conditions which, as we have said, do not exist here, (\"by legislation or otherwise\") \"any term of any such * * * lease\" of \"Crown lands, mines or minerals.\"\nWe think the natural reading of these words is that which precludes the province from legislating in such a way as to \"alter\" or \"affect\" any \"term of any such lease,\" irrespectively of any possibility that such legislation might be of such a character that it would fall under the powers of the provincial legislature, even if the public lands of the Dominion had not been transferred to the province.\nWe have said something to indicate some of the difficulties in the process of ascertaining the precise limits of the powers of the province to enact legislation affecting the public property of the Dominion. We think that the limits of these powers, as exercisable after the transfer of the land, were intended to be fixed by the stipulations of the agreement, as regards the matters therein dealt with; and must now, in any particular case, be determined by reference to the true construction of those stipulations.\nIt follows from all this that the impugned legislation is invalid in so far as it affects leases under the Regulations of 1910 and 1911.\nIt was not contended before us that the effect of this is to invalidate the impugned enactments in their entirety. It was not argued that, on the grounds we have been considering, the legislation ought to be held invalid in so far as it provides for the regulation of wells held under a title in fee simple. On this point we express no opinion and our judgment will be limited accordingly.\nWe have still to consider the question whether the statute is invalid on the ground that, as a whole, it deals with matters falling strictly under s. 91 (2), or, at all events, with matters outside the scope of s. 92. The subject has been discussed fully, and very ably, in the judgment of the Appellate Division, and we think it right to say that, in this respect, we are in complete agreement with that judgment.\nIn Union Colliery Company of British Columbia Ltd. v. Bryden[18], Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said, at p. 587, that the Coal Mining Regulations, there in question might \"be regarded as merely establishing a regulation applicable to the working of underground coal mines,\" and he added that if that had been \"an exhaustive description of the substance of the enactments, it would be difficult to dispute that they were within the competency of the provincial legislature, by virtue either of s. 92, subs. 10, or s. 92, subs. 13.\" We think that is what this legislation now before us in substance is: legislation providing for the regulation of the working of natural gas mines in the Turner Valley area. It rests upon those who impeach the statute as ultra vires on the ground that it deals with matters outside the scope of s. 92, to adduce some reason for ascribing to it another character. In this we think the appellants have failed.\nThe statute provides for the regulation of the wells in that area from a point of view which is provincial and for a purpose which is provincial,\u2014the prevention of what the legislature conceives to be a waste of natural gas in the working of them. In its substance it deals neither with \"trade in general\" nor with trade in any \"matter of inter-provincial concern \"; nor is there anything before us to indicate that the working of these mines (excepting, of course, the wells situate upon lands leased from the Dominion) is a matter which, by reason of exceptional circumstances, has ceased to be, or has ever been, anything but a matter \"provincial\" in the relevant sense.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and judgment given for the plaintiffs in accordance with the views herein expressed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

The appellants, husband and wife, brought an action for damages against the city respondent for personal injuries to Daisy Carmichael caused by falling on an icy sidewalk. The respondent alleged lack of notice of the accident within the delays prescribed by section 519 of the city charter. Subsection 1 provides that no action can be brought against the city in any case of injury due to negligence, unless notice is served within sixty days of the happening, of the accident and within ten days \"in the case of personal injury caused by snow or ice on a sidewalk.\" Subsection 2 further provides that \"the want or insufficiency of the notice * * * shall not be a bar to an action if the \"trial judge\" considers there is reasonable excuse * * * and that the city has not thereby been prejudiced in its defence.\" The first notice was given by the appellants ten weeks after the accident and the city respondent had no knowledge of it until then.\nHeld that the appellants' action should be dismissed for want of notice required by section 519 of the respondent's charter. The inherent probability of prejudice to the respondent in making its defence arises from the undisputed circumstance of the lack of notice within ten days of the accident, coupled with the established lack of knowledge of the respondent. The respondent was deprived of any opportunity of inspecting, the locality or condition of the sidewalk within ten days of the accident, and, after the lapse of ten weeks, no evidence of any weight upon these points could be procured.\nHeld, also, that the findings of the trial judge, that there was reasonable excuse for the appellants' delay in giving notice of the accident and that the respondent city had not been prejudiced in its defence by such delay, can be reviewed upon appeal; the words in subsection 2 of s. 519 \"if the judge considers\" do not give any discretion to the trial judge, the exercise of which should not be reviewed on appeal.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1933] 1 W.W.R. 533) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial court, Ives J., and dismissing the appellants' action for damages. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellants.\nG. B. O'Connor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The appellants, husband and wife, sue for damages resulting from the wife, just after midnight on the 23rd of December, 1931, having slipped and fallen on an alleged icy part of a sidewalk in the city of Edmonton. Her leg was broken, and the fracture has not yet knit.\nNo notice was given to the respondent within ten days, as provided by section 519 of the Edmonton Charter, which reads as follows:\u2014\n519. Save as otherwise by law provided, no action shall be brought by reason of the death of or any injury to any person or any injury to the property of any person arising out of any accident alleged to be due to the negligence of the City, its officers, employees or agents, unless notice in writing of the accident and the cause thereof has been served upon the City Clerk or the City Commissioners, within sixty days of the happening of the accident, (except in the case of personal injury caused by snow or ice on a sidewalk, in which case such notice shall be served within ten days of the happening of the accident) and any action for damages brought in respect thereof shall be commenced within six months after such right of action shall be barred and extinguished.\n(2) In case of the death of any such person, the want of notice shall not be a bar to the maintenance of the action, and in other cases the want or insufficiency of the notice hereby required shall not be a bar to an action if the court or judge before whom the action is tried considers there is reasonable excuse for the want of such notice or insufficiency thereof, and that the City has not thereby been prejudiced in its defence.\nThe first notice was given to the respondent corporation ten weeks after the accident, and the corporation had no knowledge of it until then.\nThe evidence of the appellants and of witnesses for the appellants who examined the place where the accident occurred in the morning, a few hours after the accident, and of other witnesses who had observed the condition at this place for some time before and after the accident, was to the effect that the surface of the vacant lot adjoining the sidewalk at the west was considerably higher than the sidewalk, and that ice had accumulated on the sidewalk all along the frontage of this vacant lot, including the place where the accident happened, extending over the westerly two-thirds of the sidewalk, being about eight inches thick adjoining the higher land of the lot, and sloping from there over the two-thirds width of the walk to a feather edge, the slippery and sloping surface making the place specially dangerous.\nOn behalf of the respondent corporation, the city street foreman and five men working under him testified that they were cleaning out ice and snow from the gutters on the 21st of December, 1931, and that they cleaned off the whole sidewalk at the place of the accident down to the cement, that the ice and snow came off in flakes, and was carted away with the ice and snow that was being taken away from the gutters; and that, when the ice was removed in this way, the sidewalk was left so clean that it was not slippery, and that it required no ashes.\nOn this contradictory evidence, the learned trial judge accepted the evidence on behalf of the appellants, and held that the sidewalk was in the dangerous condition alleged, and that the city was guilty of gross negligence. He also held that the female plaintiff (appellant) was excused by reason of her condition and suffering from giving notice within ten days, as required by section 519; and that the city was not prejudiced, within the meaning of that section; and gave the female plaintiff judgment for the damages.\nThe respondent appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which did not disturb the trial judge's findings that there was gross negligence and that the lack of notice within ten days was excused; but reversed the finding of no prejudice. All the judges assumed, without expressly so holding, that the lack of notice within the ten days was excused, and, with the exception of Mr. Justice Clarke, based their conclusions upon the view that the defendant (respondent) was prejudiced in its defence. Mr. Justice Clarke took the view that even if there was excuse for not giving the notice within ten days, the female plaintiff was still bound to give notice within sixty days, and that there was no excuse for failure to give notice within that longer period. He expressed no opinion upon the other questions discussed. The judgment appealed from was therefore set aside and the action dismissed; and from that judgment the plaintiffs appeal.\nThe appellants contend that the words \"if the judge considers\" give a discretion to the trial judge, the exercise of which should not be reviewed on appeal. Ormerod v. Todmorden Mill Co.[2], is cited, which holds that there must be a plain and clear case to justify the Court of Appeal in interfering with the discretion of the judge below, but the Court of Appeal will review the discretion if it be exercised in consequence of an opinion on a point of law which is wrong.\nThe cases of Shotts Iron Co. Ltd. v. Fordyce[3]; Burrell v. Holloway[4], and Hayward v. West Leigh Colliery Co.[5], are also cited. These three cases, however, arose under the English Workmen's Compensation Act, where there is no appeal on a question of fact, and the finding can be reviewed only on questions of law. They therefore turned on the question of law as to whether or not there was any evidence upon which the trial judge could reasonably base his conclusion.\nIn City of Kingston v. Drennan[6], Sedgwick J., delivering the judgment of the majority of the court, said:\nI do not feel called upon to decide whether, in the present case, the certificate of the trial judge is reviewable.\nThe trial judge, in considering whether there was or was not prejudice, must come to his conclusion from considering and weighing the evidence and facts bearing on the question, and the conclusion that he reaches in this way is in fact an adjudication. His finding therefore, in my view, can be reviewed upon appeal, the same as other findings by a trial judge. It may be that in some cases the trial judge's finding as to prejudice would depend upon contradictory evidence relevant to the question of prejudice or no prejudice, and in such case a court of appeal would follow the usual rule in reference to a trial judge's finding of fact after weighing the evidence. In the Ontario courts, the law seems to be settled that the finding of the trial judge on the question of prejudice is open to review upon appeal: O'Connor v. City of Hamilton[7]. Here there seems to be no dispute as to the facts relevant to the question of prejudice or no prejudice. No fact on that issue is in dispute. The respondent had no notice or knowledge of the accident until ten weeks after it happened, according to the only evidence on the record.\nIn the Hayward case[8], Lord Loreburn, discussing the arbitrator's finding of no prejudice from lack of statutory notice, says (p. 545):\u2014\nI do not think it means that there is to be a presumption one way or another, but simply if upon all the facts before him the arbitrator is not satisfied that there was no prejudice, then the appellant fails.\nThen after discussing the facts and circumstances, he refers, as a ground of his conclusion, to the fact of\nthere being no inherent probability that I can see from the facts that the company would be prejudiced by the absence of notice for a few days.\nWas there inherent probability of prejudice to the respondent in making its defence in this case? In my view there was. The respondent was deprived of any opportunity of inspecting the locality or having it inspected within ten days of the accident. It might, on receipt of notice within ten days, have had its foreman and five workmen, who claimed to have cleaned off the sidewalk on the 21st, make an inspection to ascertain the then condition and refresh their memory as to what they had done on the 21st. If this had been done, and they adhered to their story after such inspection, much more weight might have been given to their evidence. Other witnesses, who had opportunity of observing the conditions at the locality on or about the day of the accident, might have been questioned, and might have been able to give important evidence on the disputed question of the conditions of the sidewalk. After the lapse of ten weeks, no evidence of any weight upon these points could be procured.\nBurrell v. Holloway[9], mentioned above, was a decision of the Court of Appeal in England. The claim was by a workman for injuries where the requisite notice was not given. Cozens-Hardy, M.R., in delivering the judgment of the Court, says:\nEvery opportunity of challenging or testing the statement as to the source of the accident, the place where it happened, and the circumstances under which it happened, had been, I might almost say, lost to the employers by the delay.\n* * * It is a very different thing to go the following day or within two or three days of the accident, when everything is fresh in everybody's mind, and the matter can be properly investigated. I think that it would be a most dangerous thing if we were to allow the employers to be held liable in a case like this.\nThe provision of the charter itself requiring notice within the shorter period of ten days in the special case of an action based on gross negligence owing to the presence of ice and snow indicates that the legislature regarded the short notice as necessary to prevent prejudice to corporations in such cases in the absence of circumstances shewing the lack of prejudice.\nAgainst this inherent probability of prejudice arising from the bare circumstances, there might, in many cases, be offered by a plaintiff important evidence that there was no prejudice. If, for instance in the present case, the plaintiff had been able to shew that the respondent had actual knowledge of the accident within ten days, and as a result had investigated and had obtained such evidence as it could as a result of that knowledge and investigation, it might reasonably be held, on such evidence, that there was no prejudice. The inherent probability of prejudice, arising from the bare fact of the accident and the lack of notice, does not therefore necessarily prevail to counteract the excuse in every case. In the present case the inherent probability of prejudice arises from the undisputed circumstance of the lack of notice, coupled with the established lack of knowledge of the respondent; and there is absolutely no evidence that would go to refute the inference arising from these circumstances.\nFor these reasons, I agree with the conclusions of the majority of the Appellate Division, and find it unnecessary to discuss the point raised in the reasons of Mr. Justice Clarke.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1933] 2 D.L.R. 702; (1933) 1 W.W.R. 533.\n[2] (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 664.\n[3] [1930] A.C. 503.\n[4] (1911) 4 Butt.

Forlong, Formerly Carrying on Business in Partnership as Stobie, Forlong & Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1933: March 20, 21; 1933: June 28.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Cannon and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nBankruptcy\u2014Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 11, ss. 24, 104\u2014\u201cDebts provable in bankruptcy\u201d\u2014Action brought, without leave of court, against assignor in bankruptcy\u2014Costs\u2014Leave nunc pro tunc on conditions\u2014Action against stock brokers for unauthorized sale of shares and unauthorized use of proceeds\u2014Nature of claim\u2014\u201cBreach of trust\u201d\u2014Brokers acting on instructions of unauthorized person\u2014Latter\u2019s liability to person for whom he assumed to act, nature of claim against him and measure of damages.\nDefendants S. and F. carried on business in partnership as stock brokers. Defendant B\u2019s relation with them was that of \u201ccustomer\u2019s man\u201d; he received a share of commissions earned on business he brought to them, which included business of M.S. and F. held stocks on margin for M., who was, unknown to S. and F., too ill to do business. The prices of the stocks were falling, and, acting on instructions given (without M.\u2019s authority) by B. (and with concurrence of M.\u2019s son who acted in concert with B.), S. and F. sold the stocks, realizing, net, $41,822, and (again on unauthorized instructions as aforesaid) used this money in speculative trading, resulting in its loss. Subsequently S. and F. made an assignment in bankruptcy. Later the plaintiffs, representing the estate of M. (who had died), brought action, without obtaining leave of the court under s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act, against B., S. and F., their claims including an accounting; damages for wrongful conversion, breach of contract, fraud and fraudulent breach of trust; and, alternatively, an accounting and judgment for the amount of the proceeds of the sales of the stock. At trial, judgment was given against defendants for $41,822 (the sum above mentioned). This judgment was varied by the Court of Appeal, Ont. ([1932] O.R. 245), which held that the liability of S. and F. was a \u201cdebt provable in bankruptcy\u201d within s. 104 of the Bankruptcy Act, and, leave not having been obtained under s. 24, the action against them should be dismissed, without prejudice to rights of plaintiffs proceeding in bankruptcy; and that there should be a reference to determine the sum recoverable from B. Plaintiffs appealed. Held: The shares having been sold, even though wrongfully (which might well be open to question on the facts and circumstances), the proceeds, which were traceable, were in equity M.\u2019s property (Sinclair v. Brougham, [1914] A.C. 398, at 441-2). Having regard to the cause of action asserted, and S. and F. being (as found) innocent of fraud, the charge established against S. and F. in respect of the proceeds of sale was breach of trust; and the claim, being one arising out of a breach of trust (provable in bankruptcy under s. 104), was unenforceable against them except by leave under s. 24. But, under the circumstances, leave to bring action should be granted nunc pro tunc (Blais v. Bankers\u2019 Trust Corp., 14 D.L.R. 277, referred to with approval), and judgment given for said sum of $41,822 against S. and F., subject to conditions imposed (that plaintiffs do not use the judgment except as one determining the amount for which they may rank upon the estate in bankruptcy and then as no more than prima facie evidence of that amount); plaintiffs to pay costs of S. and F. throughout.\nAs to B., there were not sufficient reasons for reversing the trial judge\u2019s finding that he acted fraudulently; he was chargeable as having fraudulently brought about the breach of trust; and should be held liable to plaintiffs in said sum of $41,822 (statement of the law in 28 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, p. 204, par. 407, approved and applied; Gray v. Johnston, L.R. 3 H.L. 1, at 11, cited).\nCannon J. dissented in part, holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, as made and pursued, was such as entitled them to remedy against S. and F., as well as against B., in the present action as brought, and that the judgment at trial should be restored in its entirety, with costs to plaintiffs throughout.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which varied the judgment of Logie J. given in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs were the executors of the estate of Harry Miller, deceased, who died on December 22, 1929.\nThe defendants Stobie and Forlong formerly carried on business in partnership as stock brokers, under the name of Stobie, Forlong & Company. The defendant Brenner\u2019s relation with them was that of \u201ccustomer\u2019s man\u201d; he brought customers to Stobie, Forlong & Co., and received a share of commissions earned on business so brought to them, which included business of Miller. Stobie, Forlong & Co. held certain shares of stock on margin for Miller. The prices of these stocks were falling and, acting on instructions from Brenner (and with concurrence of Miller\u2019s son who acted in concert with Brenner), Stobie, Forlong & Co. sold them, realizing, net, $41,822, and (again on instructions as aforesaid) used the money in speculative trading, resulting in its loss. The said transactions (sale of the stocks and use of the proceeds) were (as found by the court) unauthorized by Miller, who was at the time too ill to do business (of which condition Stobie, Forlong & Co. were unaware).\nStobie, Forlong & Co. made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 11) on January 30, 1930.\nThe action was begun in May, 1930, without leave being obtained under s. 24 of the Bankruptcy Act. The plaintiffs claimed (a) an accounting, (b) \u201cdamages for wrongful conversion, breach of contract, fraud and fraudulent breach of trust,\u201d or in the alternative, (c) judgment for the amount found due to Miller at the time of the transfer of his account to Stobie, Forlong & Co., or in the alternative, (d) judgment requiring defendants to account for the proceeds of the sales of the stock and judgment for such amount. (The statement of claim is set out in full in the judgment of Cannon J. now reported).\nSecs. 24 and 104 of the Bankruptcy Act provide as follows:\n24. On the making of a receiving order or authorized assignment, no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor or shall commence or continue any action, execution or other proceedings for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy unless with the leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose.\n* * *\n104. Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise, or breach of trust, shall not be provable in bankruptcy or in proceedings under an authorized assignment.\n2. Save as aforesaid, all debts and liabilities, present or future, to which the debtor is subject at the date of the receiving order or the making of the authorized assignment or to which he may become subject before his discharge by reason of any obligation incurred before the date of the receiving order or of the making of the authorized assignment, shall be deemed to be debts provable in bankruptcy or in proceedings under an authorized assignment.\n3. The court shall value, at the time and in the summary manner prescribed by General Rules, all contingent claims and all such claims for unliquidated damages as are provable by this section, and after, but not before, such valuation, every such claim shall for all purposes of this Act, be deemed a proved debt to the amount of its valuation.\nThe action was tried before Logie J., who gave judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendants for $41,822 (which was the net sum realized on sale of the stocks as above mentioned). An appeal by the defendants was al- lowed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2], which varied the judgment below, the judgment, as so varied, dismissing the action as against Stobie and Forlong, \u201cbut without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs proceeding in bankruptcy\u201d as against the said defendants Stobie and Forlong; and directing a reference as to in what sum, if any, the defendant Brenner was liable to the plaintiffs.\nSubsequent to the delivery of reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, as reported2, that court delivered a \u201cmemorandum\u201d as follows:\nIn view of the dissatisfaction of the plaintiff with the judgment of the court, herein, as settled, we think it proper to state for the information of all concerned, as well as of any appellate tribunal which may be called upon to deal with it:\nWe had hoped that the case might be settled on the terms set out in the reasons for judgment, already handed out; but that hope has proved illusory, and all parties are insisting on their legal and strict rights.\nWe decided:\u2014\n1. The cause of action was the liability of an agent or bailee to account to the principal or bailor, for the proceeds of property improperly sold by him;\n2. The evidence indicated that Brenner, as agent, was liable in some sum; but that the sum found by the Trial Judge was so found on evidence, some of which, at least, was not admissible against him. Consequently, he was entitled to have the true amount determined by the Master;\n3. The brokers were originally liable on the same principle; but they had gone into bankruptcy, and consequently, as no leave had been granted by the court, the action against them was irregular and, in strictness, should be dismissed with costs.\nWe had hoped that the amount appearing by the evidence before the court, namely, $41,822 and interest, to be the amount due from the brokers would be accepted, and the matter arranged as is set out in [1932] O.R. at p. 253. But dealing with the case and the parties on their strict rights, we do not think that without the consent of the assignee in bankruptcy, we should declare that the insolvents were liable for the sum, which, were the action against them, regular, would seem to be proved\u2014the assignee, representing the body of creditors, may have evidence unknown, overlooked or intentionally left uncalled\u2014their interest in the matter was academic, at the time, whereas the interest of the assignee is actual and substantial. We think the assignee should have an opportunity to contest the claim, if so advised; and, consequently, we decline to adjudge against him in his absence that his estate is indebted in any sum whatever. We leave to the plaintiff to take such steps to establish a claim against the bankrupt estate as he may be advised.\nThis is his real and only objection taken before us\u2014he is not willing to prove his claim in bankruptcy, but desires to have a judgment binding upon the assignee, which was obtained in an irregular action without his being made a party. This we decline to declare, as it would be an obvious injustice.\nThere is nothing whatever to prevent the plaintiff proceeding regularly to prove any claim it may have against the bankrupt estate, and this, we think, in the absence of consent of the assignee is the only course for it to pursue; if it is supposed that we allowed the action to proceed, nunc pro tunc absolutely and without regard to opposition to the settlement we suggested, it is an error; if it could be suggested that such language as was used was an order to that effect, it is withdrawn, no formal order having been taken.\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and I. Levinter for the appellants.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the respondents Stobie and Forlong.\nL. Kert for the respondent Brenner.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont and Crocket JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF C.J.\u2014This case has been considered very fully by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. One naturally feels some diffidence in giving effect to views which are not entirely in agreement with that of judges who are so adequately fitted to deal with such matters, but it is, of course, one\u2019s duty to act upon one\u2019s own conclusions.\nThere are some findings of fact by the learned trial judge which are important. The initiation of the transactions out of which the dispute arises was a sale of certain shares held by Stobie, Forlong & Co. for Harry Miller. Harry Miller was at that time incapable of doing business. It is not disputed that Stobie, Forlong & Co. were unaware of this, and Meyer Brenner who, as the learned trial judge found, was acting in concert with one Ben Miller, the son of Harry Miller, was aware of it. Brenner\u2019s relation with Stobie, Forlong & Co. was that described by the phrase \u201ccustomer\u2019s man.\u201d He had an office of his own in the office of Stobie, Forlong & Co. He brought customers to them and received one-half of the commissions which Stobie, Forlong & Co. earned on the business so brought them.\nThe initial date is the 9th of May, 1928. On that date and succeeding dates, Stobie, Forlong & Co., acting on the instructions of Brenner who professed to be proceeding upon the instructions of Harry Miller, but had no authority from him, sold shares which had been transferred by Harry Miller from E.A. Pierce & Co., his brokers, to Stobie, Forlong & Co. The learned trial judge has found that the amount realized from these sales, over and above brokers\u2019 loans, was $41,822. There seems to me no ground for doubting the liability of Stobie, Forlong & Co. to account for these monies as trust monies. They proceeded on the instructions of Brenner, who was acting without any authority whatever from Harry Miller who was incapable of doing business during the period, to use these monies in speculative trading and, admittedly, the result of these operations was that Miller\u2019s credit disappeared. A broker is not strictly an express trustee, but the manner in which equity has treated monies received by a broker from the sales of his client\u2019s property may be stated in the words of Lord Parker in Sinclair v. Brougham[3],\nEquity treated the matter from a different standpoint. * * * the money in their hands was (treated) for all practical purposes (as) trust money. Starting from a personal equity, based on the consideration that it would be unconscionable for any one who could not plead purchase for value without notice to retain an advantage derived from the misapplication of trust money, it ended, as was so often the case, in creating what were in effect rights of property, though not recognized as such by the common law.\nIn my judgment, the claim against Stobie, Forlong & Co. is a claim arising out of breach of trust and, therefore, unenforceable against them except by leave under s. 24.\nIt may well be open to question whether on the facts Stobie, Forlong & Co. acted wrongfully in selling the shares originally placed in their hands by Harry Miller himself. The prices of these shares, which were held on margin, were falling and a call had been made. There was apparently no further money available (Harry Miller was in such condition that he could not be approached) and Stobie, Forlong & Co., in ignorance of his condition, acted as already mentioned upon the directions of Brenner with the concurrence of Miller\u2019s son, Ben Miller. The shares having been sold, even though wrongfully, the proceeds, if traceable, which is not disputed, were in equity the property of Harry Miller under the principle of Lord Parker\u2019s observations quoted above. At common law, Harry Miller could waive the tort and hold Stobie, Forlong & Co. accountable in assumpsit for the amount of the proceeds as monies received to his use.\nIn equity a trustee de son tort is accountable just as an express trustee would be in such circumstances. The statement of claim, which has been carefully analysed by Riddell J.A., treats these monies as monies held by Stobie, Forlong & Co. for the account of Harry Miller; and the cause of action asserted against all parties is fraud and fraudulent breach of trust in dealing with these monies. Stobie, Forlong & Co. were plainly not guilty of fraud and the only charge alleged and proved against them in respect of these monies is breach of trust, which is clearly established.\nIn point of law, Brenner\u2019s position is not precisely the same. He was not a trustee for Miller. It was not suggested that, even as regards the transactions in question, he was a partner of Stobie, Forlong & Co. The learned trial judge, however, has found that he assumed the responsibility of putting himself forward as acting on Miller\u2019s behalf which he knew he had no authority to do. He has also found that during one or two brief lucid intervals in the course of Miller\u2019s unfortunate malady he deliberately concealed his operations from Miller. He was not a participant in the physical acts which constituted the wrongful conversion of Miller\u2019s money; or, as observed, a partner of those who were. The question is not merely whether in the circumstances Brenner is liable to Miller\u2019s estate for his wrongful acts, but whether the estate has a claim against him arising out of breach of trust.\nIt is a proper inference, if not, indeed, an inevitable one, that had it not been for Brenner\u2019s conduct in misleading Stobie, Forlong & Co. they would not have proceeded to deal as they did with Miller\u2019s money. In a business sense, Brenner\u2019s instructions as coming from Miller were an integral part of the transactions. In the treatise on trusts which is a part of Lord Halsbury\u2019s collection, it is said, a\nperson renders himself liable for the consequent loss to the trust estate where he knowingly becomes an active party to a fraudulent or improper disposition of the trust property in breach of the trust affecting it. (28 Hals., p. 204, par. 407.)\nI think this passage correctly states the law and applies to the circumstances here.\nIn Gray v. Johnston[4] it was said by Lord Cairns that, in order to make bankers liable for breach of trust, there must be proof that the bankers are privy to the intent to make the misapplication of the trust funds. And to that I think I may safely add, that if it be shown that any personal benefit to the bankers themselves is designed or stipulated for, that circumstance, above all others, will most readily establish the fact that the bankers are in privity with the breach of trust which is about to be committed.\nIn the present case, Brenner was not merely \u201can active party\u201d or \u201cin privity,\u201d his was the mind that conceived\u2014he was the person who, acting on an unfounded assumption of authority, in effect directed\u2014the breach of trust; Stobie, Forlong & Co. being throughout the ignorant instrument in the \u201cimproper disposition\u201d of the funds.\nWe do not think there are sufficient reasons for reversing the finding of the trial judge that Brenner acted fraudulently. He industriously concealed the facts from Stobie, Forlong & Co. and, during the lucid intervals of Harry Miller, from him also. He is chargeable as having fraudulently brought about the breach of trust. We have fully considered the evidence and are satisfied it is ample to support the judgment of the learned trial judge in respect of the amount for which the parties are accountable.\nAs to Stobie, Forlong & Co., we think that there might have been formidable difficulties in the appellants\u2019 way if the action had not been directed against both parties, and that the appellants should have leave nunc pro tunc, subject to the conditions to be stated. We think the judgment of Beck J. in Blais v. Bankers\u2019 Trust Corporation[5], pronounced twenty years ago, was well decided.\nThere will be judgment against both parties for $41,822, but the appellants must undertake not to use this judgment against Stobie, Forlong & Co. except as a judgment determining the amount for which they may rank upon the estate of the bankrupt, and then as no more than prima facie evidence of that amount. The appellants will pay the costs of Stobie, Forlong & Co. throughout; Brenner will pay the costs of the appellants throughout.\nCANNON J. (dissenting in part)\u2014The statement of claim, issued on the 27th of May, 1930, represents:\n1. The plaintiffs are the executors and trustees of the estate of Harry Miller, late of the city of Toronto, in the county of York, who died on or about the 22nd day of December, 1929.\n2. The defendant, Meyer Brenner, is a stock broker residing in the said city of Toronto, and formerly carried on business either alone or in association with Stobie, Forlong & Company. The defendants Malcolm Stobie and Charles J. Forlong also reside in the said city of Toronto and prior to their bankruptcy carried on business in partnership as stock brokers under the name of Stobie, Forlong & Company. The said Malcolm Stobie and Charles J. Forlong made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act on the 30th day of January, 1930.\n3. Prior to the 9th day of May, 1928, the late Harry Miller had a brokerage account with the firm of E.A. Pierce and Company and the following stocks were held in the said account:\n4,000\nContinental Oil of Delaware,\n3,000\nDome Mines Limited,\n100\nLago Oil & Transport Corporation,\n2,500\nMarland Oil Company Limited,\n200\nNational Radiator Limited,\n13\/49\nNorth American Company,\n200\nPure Oil Company,\n1,000\nTexas Pacific Coal & Oil,\n100\nHudson Bay Mining & Smelting Company.\n1,000\nMining Corporation of Canada Limited,\n1,000\nTeck Hughes Gold Mines Limited.\n4. On or about the said 9th day of May, 1928, the said stocks were transferred to the defendants Meyer Brenner and to the said Stobie, Forlong & Company to hold the same for the said Harry Miller.\n5. The said defendant, Meyer Brenner, and Stobie, Forlong & Company duly paid E.A. Pierce and Company the amount required to transfer the stock and the said stock when transferred was placed in the account of the said Harry Miller.\n6. The plaintiffs allege and the fact is that at the time of the transfer to the said defendants, the said Harry Miller had an interest or equity in the stocks transferred to an amount in excess of $70,000.\n7. At the time of the said transfer the said defendants, according to the record furnished by the defendants to the plaintiffs, also held the following stocks for the said Harry Miller:\u2014\n1,000\nWright Hargreaves Mines Limited,\n1,000\nMining Corporation of Canada Limited,\n3,000\nAmulet Mines Limited,\n100\nMuirhead Cafeteria Limited,\n100\nHudson Bay Mining & Smelting Company.\n8. In or about the early part of June, 1928, without authority, instructions or consent from the said Harry Miller, in breach of faith and duty, the said defendants, Meyer Brenner and Stobie, Forlong & Company wrongfully, fraudulently and illegally commenced to trade with the said stocks above referred to with the exception of 100 shares of Muirhead Cafeteria Limited and to wrongfully, fraudulently and illegally deal with the same on their own initiative and without the consent or authority of the said Harry Miller, wrongfully, fraudulently and illegally sold and disposed of the said stocks and wrongfully, fraudulently and illegally misapplied the proceeds of the said stocks and converted them to their own use.\n9. The plaintiffs allege and the fact is that after the wrongful and fraudulent disposition and conversion of the said stocks were made, there was a credit in favour of the said Harry Miller in a sum approximating $42,000 plus 100 shares of Muirhead Cafeteria Limited, after allowing for any moneys that may have been owing thereon, which said amount was wrongfully converted by the defendants.\n10. The plaintiffs allege and the fact is that the defendants are responsible for the proceeds of the sale of the said stock in the said account, as having made profits or gain therefrom as agents of the said Harry Miller.\n11. The plaintiffs allege and the fact is that the said cause of action arose by reason of the fraud and fraudulent breach of trust on the part of the said Malcolm Stobie and Charles J. Forlong and Meyer Brenner.\n12. The plaintiffs therefore claim:\n(a) An accounting from the defendants in respect of all dealings between the said Harry Miller and defendants, Meyer Brenner and Stobie, Forlong & Company and for this purpose that all necessary references be had and accounts taken.\n(b) Damages for wrongful conversion, breach of contract, fraud and fraudulent breach of trust or in the alternative\n(c) Judgment for the amount found due to the said Harry Miller at the time of the transfer of the said account from E.A. Pierce & Company to the said defendants, or in the alternative\n(d) Judgment requiring the defendants to account for the proceeds of the sales of the said stock and judgment for such amount plus the value of 100 shares of Muirhead Cafeteria Limited or the recovery of the said 100 shares of Muirhead Cafeteria Limited.\n(e) The costs of this action.\n(f) Such further and other relief as the nature of the case may require.\nThe defendant Brenner, by a separate plea, denied that he carried on a brokerage business himself and alleged that he was, in effect, a salesman for the other defendants, admits the transfer of the stocks to the latter, denies all other allegations so far as they relate to him, and states that he did not at any time:\n(a) Receive or hold any stocks or securities or the proceeds thereof for the late Harry Miller.\n(b) Wrongfully, fraudulently or illegally sell or deal with any of the said stocks.\n(c) Wrongfully, fraudulently or illegally mis-apply the proceeds of the said stocks.\n(d) Convert any of the proceeds to his own use.\n(e) Make any profits or gains from or through the said stocks.\n(f) Commit any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.\n6. The said defendant, Meyer Brenner, further alleges that the said late Harry Miller duly authorized and instructed all transactions in relation to the shares and securities mentioned in the Statement of Claim of the said plaintiffs and was duly advised of what was done from time to time and further adopted and confirmed the same.\nThe defendants Stobie and Forlong denied the allegations in the statement of claim, and further said that any account of the late Harry Miller with the former partnership firm of Stobie, Forlong & Company was an ordinary trading account in which transactions were had from time to time by the said late Harry Miller, and the said account was closed in the lifetime of the said late Harry Miller.\nIn any event, these defendants said, on the 30th day of January, 1930, they made an assignment under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and one Norman L. Martin was subsequently, under the provisions of the said Act, appointed Trustee of their estate, and all the assets of these defendants thereupon became vested in the said Trustee for the benefit of their creditors. These defendants say that by reason of the said proceedings in bankruptcy the plaintiffs, even if they were otherwise entitled, cannot proceed to recover any remedy against the property or person of the debtors, or commence or continue this action.\nThis last allegation was, with some hesitation, dismissed by the trial judge, who condemned the brokers to pay the net proceeds of the sale of securities, viz $41,822; but it was accepted by the Appellate Division and the action dismissed with costs as against the brokers, because it was illegally taken after bankruptcy, it being a claim provable in bankruptcy. Sections 24 and 104 of the Bankruptcy Act. The finding of fraud against Brenner and the condemnation against him was also set aside and a reference ordered to ascertain the exact damages, if any, that he should pay to the appellants after their claim in bankruptcy should have been disposed of, and any dividend received from the insolvent estate duly credited.\nBoth parties, on the evidence, are liable. The fraudulent and deceitful conduct of Brenner is clearly shown, as found by the trial judge. The brokers should have kept for, or paid to Harry Miller the net proceeds of his stock, after deduction of their claim, instead of lending themselves to an orgy of speculation with Miller\u2019s money, reaping for Brenner, their close associate, and themselves, commissions amounting to $9,485.50, plus interest on large amounts allegedly advanced. The plaintiffs come before the court, expose how they have been defrauded by the joint wrongdoing of the defendants and ask for remedy. Have they, by asking alternative conclusions, waived their right of proceeding in tort? I do not think so. They have made no election and left it to the court to give the necessary order.\nThe trial judge\u2019s findings are as follows:\nBut, as I see the case, there was an unauthorized sale, on the instructions of both Ben Miller and Meyer Brenner, by Stobie Forlong of stocks which the late Henry Miller held with the latter company. That this sale was fraudulent, and was concealed from the late Harry Miller, I can have no doubt; Brenner said so to me. I think both Ben Miller and Meyer Brenner acted as the result of a conspiracy between them to deal with these stocks, in the way in which they were dealt with. It is true that Ben Miller put it on the ground of filial affection, and the danger of disclosure to his father\u2019s health, but I can come to no other conclusion than that both of them knew that Mr. Harry Miller could not transact business, and both of them took advantage of that condition in gambling with Harry Miller\u2019s money.\nUnder those circumstances I have no hesitation in finding that there was fraud. Ben Miller had no authority of any kind to authorize, or give instructions for the sale of these stocks by Stobie Forlong Company, or by any one. Therefore, Stobie Forlong having sold the stocks on the instructions of an unauthorized agent, ought to have held the proceeds for Harry Miller, instead of which they misapplied the money, the property of their principal, who was Harry Miller, by permitting it to be used in speculative transactions, and are unquestionably liable for the proceeds.\nThe only question remaining is whether the claim against Stobie Forlong Company should be proved in bankruptcy or not. Leave was not obtained. I have very grave doubt if such a claim, being in reality for deceit, is provable in bankruptcy under section 104; but I think it is better for the Appellate Division to determine whether the class of action disclosed by the evidence is provable in bankruptcy. It is true that the sale of the stocks might be described as a breach of contract with Harry Miller by Stobie Forlong, but I do not think that the claim arising out of the misapplication of funds is such a demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising out of a contract as is provable in bankruptcy. I will leave a higher court to correct me if I am wrong in that.\nThe learned trial judge, not the plaintiffs, directed that the proceeds of the unauthorized sales, of some of the tortious acts complained of in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the statement of claim, should be reimbursed to the victim of defendants\u2019 illegal and improper course. The fact that they deliberately took their action after Stobie Forlong\u2019s bankruptcy without claiming in bankruptcy and persistently considered, despite the latter\u2019s pleading, throughout the trial, that their claim was not provable in bankruptcy, shows that they never elected to make the unauthorized sale their own; they still persist in calling it a fraudulent conversion and they ask that the measure of damages resulting from the fraud be the net value of the securities when they were sold without Miller\u2019s knowledge or consent. The learned trial judge thought that they were entitled to what would have been saved from the wreck immediately after the unauthorized sale, if the defendants had not continued their tortious acts by gambling with the proceeds, the property of Harry Miller, when the latter was incapable of trans- acting any business. Those are the damages, unliquidated before the trial, but ascertained by the trial judge, representing the loss or damnum suffered by Harry Miller when his money was frittered away by the defendants. The latter did not pretend to act by reason of a contract, promise, or even in breach of a trust, but had no possible shadow of an excuse to act as they did: they purely and simply took for their own purposes what did not belong to them.\nUnder such circumstances, the action against the joint tort feasors should not be defeated by technicalities.\nSmith v. Baker[6] does not apply. In that case, the plaintiff did not commence any action in law for the tort, but resorted to the Court of Bankruptcy and made a successful application to have the bill of sale declared void. The plaintiffs here, as explained above, do not claim \u201cexclusively\u201d the proceeds of the sale, but mention them only as an alternative remedy against those who stole their money. They always treated both the sale and the subsequent transactions as tortious acts, and never acknowledged that Harry Miller had contracted with, or entrusted the defendants with his money. The plaintiffs explained how the transfer of shares had taken place and complained of the fraud through which subsequently a sick man had been victimized by people who knew that he was not capable of protecting his interest.\nI, therefore, with due respect, beg to differ from the holding of the Court of Appeal that the demand in tort was waived by the plaintiffs.\nIn Smith v. Baker[7] it is said:\nThere may be other instances where an act may amount to a conclusive election in point of law to waive the tort. But there is another class of cases in which an act is of an ambiguous character, and may or may not be done with the intention of adopting and confirming the wrongful act. In such cases the question whether the tort has been waived becomes rather a matter of fact than of law.\nIn Rice v. Reed[8], at page 64, Lord Russell of Killowen, C.J., says:\n* * * an application for the proceeds of goods said to have been tortiously dealt with is not conclusive proof of election to affirm the transaction. At page 65, Smith, L.J., says:\nIn the present case the plaintiff sued Soltan in trover, and in the alternative for money had and received. If nothing more had occurred, no court could say that the plaintiff, by suing in the alternative for tort and for money had and received, had waived the tort and elected to affirm the transaction. It is clear that no authority goes so far as that.\nAt page 66, Smith, L.J., agrees with the dictum in Smith v. Baker7 that the question whether a tort has been waived is a matter of fact rather than law.\nSee also Keating v. Marsh; Marsh v. Keating[9].\nAs pointed out by Brenner\u2019s counsel, \u201cthey (the appellants) never elected to confirm sales made by us\u201d (the respondents). There is no evidence that appellants waived their cause of action in tort by proving in the bankruptcy proceedings. And I find, like the trial judge, that, as a matter of fact, the appellants never waived their right of proceeding in tort for unliquidated damages, and they are therefore entitled to a remedy. The plaintiffs have proven their whole case; the defendant Brenner has failed to establish his plea, and, in view of the record, paragraph 6 thereof is a clear sample of bad faith and may be considered as a deliberate attempt to mislead the court. It was not disputed here, nor in the Court of Appeal, that the brokers are liable to the plaintiffs for the amount of the surplus of the proceeds, after deducting their claim against Miller for moneys paid on his behalf to E.A. Pierce & Company.\nBut Brenner says: If we had not sold the stocks, if the account had remained dormant till Harry Miller\u2019s death, the plaintiffs would have lost all the equity and would have suffered the same loss on account of the continued decline of the market prices of their securities. Therefore they are not entitled to damages.\nThis is sophistry. The case is not to be determined on what might have happened if the defendants had not done what they did. They jointly, illegally and without even colour of right, gambled with Miller\u2019s money\u2014the net proceeds of their first unauthorized sale of securities\u2014over and above what was required by Stobie & Forlong for marginal or other purposes. The amount is clearly established, is not even disputed. I believe that the trial judge took the right view of the whole case, refused to be stopped by ingenious but unfounded objections and applied himself to carry out his duty under the following section 15, subsection (h), of the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1927, chapter 88:\n15. In every civil cause or matter law and equity shall be administered according to the following rules:\n(h) The Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it by this Act in every cause or matter pending before it, shall have power to grant, and shall grant, either absolutely or on such reasonable terms and conditions as it shall deem just, all such remedies as any of the parties may appear to be entitled to in respect of any and every legal or equitable claim properly brought forward by them in such cause or matter so that, as far as possible, all matters so in controversy between the parties may be completely and finally determined and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of such matters avoided.\nThere is no need for a reference or for a retrial of this case before the Bankruptcy Court. The defendants should reimburse what they converted to their own purposes without even trying to consult with the owner thereof, or responsible members of his family; these funds so misappropriated amount to $41,822, as found by the trial judge. His judgment should be restored and the appeal maintained with costs here and before the Appellate Division against the respondents.\nAppeal allowed and judgment given in the terms as indicated in the judgment of Duff C.J.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Luxenberg & Levinter.\nSolicitors for the respondent Brenner: Singer & Kert.\nSolicitors for the respondents Stobie and Forlong: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 245; 13 C.B.R. 518; [1932] 2 D.L.R. 688.\n[2] [1932] O.R. 245; 13 C.B.R. 518; [1932] 2 D.L.R. 688.\n[3] [1914] A.C. 398, at 441-2.\n[4] (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 1, at 11.\n[5] (1913) 14 D.L.R. 277.\n[6] (1873) L.R. 8 C.P. 350.\n[7] (1873) L.R. 8 C.P. 350, at 355-6.\n[8] [1900] 1 Q.B. 54.\n[9] (1834) 1 Montagu & Ayrton\u2019s Bankruptcy Reports, pp. 582 and 592.\n"}

Ry. Co. and C.N. Ry. Co.) having head offices in the province of Quebec, at Montreal, where they were registered and transferable\u2014Owner at his death domiciled in the province of Ontario\u2014Whether subject to succession duties under section 5 of the Quebec Succession Duties Act, R.S.Q., 1925, c. 29, as modified by (Q.) 18 Geo. V, c. 17\u2014Powers of provincial legislature to fix situs of intangible property\u2014Specialties. The Crown, in the right of the province of Quebec, by its action claimed the sum of $15,776.95, as re-presenting succession duties alleged to be due by the respondent as sole trustee and executor of the estate of the late Sir Clifford Sifton who died in New York in 1929 and was at the time of his death domiciled in the province of Ontario. Amongst the assets of his estate were certain bonds or debentures of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company, respectively, guaranteed by the Government of Canada. These bonds or debentures, registered in Montreal, were at the time of Sir Clifford Sifton\u2019s death in the possession of the latter in Toronto. Succession duties were paid to the Government of the province of Ontario; but the Government of the province of Quebec also claimed succession duties on the ground that these bonds or debentures were to be considered for succession duty purposes as property situate in the province of Quebec according to the definition of the word \u201cproperty\u201d in section 5 of the Succession Duties Act (R.S.Q., 1925, c. 29), because the two companies debtors had their head offices at Montreal and the bonds and debentures were registered and transferable on the companies\u2019 registers in that city.\nHeld that these bonds or debentures had not, in the relevant sense, a local situation within the province of Quebec, and, therefore, were not subject to the payment of succession duties in that province. Brassard v. Smith ([1925] A.C. 371) dist.\nHeld, also, that a provincial legislature is not competent to prescribe the conditions fixing the situs of intangible property (which has no physical existence) for the purpose of defining the subjects in respect of which its powers of .taxation under section 92 (2) B.N.A. Act may be put into effect. Therefore, section 5 of the Quebec Succession Duties Act is ultra vires of the legislature of that province, when invoked by it for the purpose of claiming succession duties upon property which has no local situation in that province, within the definition laid down implicitly, if not explicitly, by decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Public Trustee ([1924] 2 Ch. 101); Atty. Gen. v. Bouwens ((1838) 4 M.& W. 171) discussed and referred.\nComments on the legal institution of the common law known as specialty. Debentures authorized by the Parliament of Canada and charged by statute upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund have the character of specialties. The Grand Trunk Pacific Ry. Co. has statutory powers to create bonds having the character of specialties. The bonds in this case must, as respects the obligation of the railway company, be considered specialties, although the head office of the company is fixed by statute in Quebec; and, in view of the statute law applicable to the case, it must be held such a specialty has its situs in Ontario. Neither, for the reasons fully stated in the judgment, have the bonds of the Canadian National Railway Company in question in this case a situs in Quebec.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q:R. 54 K.B. 351) affirmed. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Surveyer J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case, and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nChs. Lanctot, K.C., and Aim\u00e9 Geofjrion, K.C., for the appellant.\nA. Chase Casgrain, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDuff C. J.\u2014The statutory enactments under consideration are sections 3 and 5 of the Quebec Succession Duties Act. So far as pertinent, the provisions of these sections are as follows:\u2014\n3. All property, moveable or immoveable, the ownership, usufruct or enjoyment whereof is transmitted owing to death, shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of death * * *\n5. The word \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of this division includes all property, moveable or immoveable, actually situate within the province, and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or are payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province, or are due by a debtor domiciled therein; the whole whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province.\nThe property in respect of which the dispute arises consists of certain bonds or debentures of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company, respectively, guaranteed by the Government of the Dominion of Canada. These bonds were the property of Sir Clifford Sifton who, at the time of his death on the 17th of April, 1929, was domiciled in the province of Ontario where the bonds were in his possession.\nThe enactments of the statute purport to impose a tax upon property transmitted owing to death; and, therefore, they only affect subjects having a situs within the province (Woodruff v. Attorney General for Ontario[2]; Rex v. Lovitt[3]; Toronto General Trusts Corporation v. The King[4]; Brassard v. Smith[5]; Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr, P.C. Appeal No. 1 of 1933). The question we have to consider is whether or not these bonds have, in the relevant sense, a local situation within that province.\nSome propositions pertinent to that issue may, we think, be collected from the judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, if not laid down explicitly, at least, as implicit in them. First, property, whether moveable or immoveable, can, for the purposes of determining situs as among the different provinces of Canada in relation to the incidence of a tax imposed by a provincial law upon property transmitted owing to death, have only one local situation. In applying this proposition, of course, it is necessary to distinguish between a tax upon property and a tax upon persons domiciled or resident in the province. (Toronto General Trusts Corp. v. The King[6]; Brassard v. Smith[7]; Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr).\nThen, it seems to be a corollary of this proposition that situs, in respect of intangible property (which has no physical existence) must be determined by reference to some principle or coherent system of principles; and again, the courts appear to have acted upon the assumption that the British Legislature, in defining, in part, at all events, by reference to the local situation of such property, the authority of the province in relation to taxation, must be supposed to have had in view the principles of, or deducible from, those of the common law. (The King v. Lovitt[8]; Toronto General Trusts Company v. The King6; Brassard v. Smith7; Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[9].\nWe think it follows that a provincial legislature is not competent to prescribe the conditions fixing the situs of intangible property for the purpose of defining the subjects in respect of which its powers of taxation under s. 92 (2) may be put into effect.\nOn this appeal we are concerned with debts, or obligations to pay money. As is well known, rules for the determination of such situs for various purposes have been drawn from those which defined the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical tribunals respecting probate. (The Royal Trust Co. v. The Attorney General for Alberta[10]; English, etc., Bank v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue[11]. In those rules, a broad distinction was observed between specialties and simple contract debts. The latter were bona notabilia in the jurisdiction in which the debtor had his personal residence; the former, where the instrument constituting the specialty was found at the death of the testator. The case of judgment debts which were deemed to be situated where the judgment was recorded, may be regarded as a special one.\nSitus has been ascribed in conformity with these rules to such property, when regarded as items in a succession, \u201cfor the purposes of representation and collection,\u201d for the purpose of giving effect to testamentary dispositions, of ascertaining the incidence of stamp duties and of determining the incidence of death duties. (English, etc., Bank v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue[12].)\nIn the Royal Trust Co. v. Atty. Gen. for Alberta[13] the rule in relation to specialties was held to govern, for the now relevant purpose, the local situation of \u201cstatutory obligations of the Dominion of Canada evidenced by bonds\u201d which were \u201cauthenticated in the manner prescribed by the Legislature\u201d; and which were by statute (The Consolidated Revenue Act, s. 7) charged upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund; and it was there decided that the locality of such statutory obligations, evidenced by particular bonds, was at the place where the bonds were found at the death of the testator.\nIn the evolution of the legal principles derived from the rules governing the earlier practice and their application to new states of fact, novel questions will naturally arise. A corporation debtor may have more than one residence, and, consequently, it may be necessary to determine which of these is the residence of the corporation for the purpose of the inquiry. The reason given by Lord Field in Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[14] for assigning the locality of the debt to the place of the personal residence of the debtor is that there the assets for paying the debt may be presumed to be. Another reason has been given, viz., that there, in the ordinary course, payment of the debt may be enforced, or that there the debt is \u201cproperly recoverable.\u201d (N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Public Trustee, per Atkin L.J.[15]; West-lake, 7th ed. 209; Dicey, p. 342). The circumstances of a particular case may be such that, to them, none of the rules as formulated and applied in decided cases or books of authority is strictly appropriate; and then one must have recourse to analogy, and to the principles underlying the decisions or the rules as formulated or deducible therefrom. (N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Public Trustee)[16].\nApplying the rules and principles so ascertained, is it established that these bonds are locally situated in the province of Quebec?\nThe Crown puts its case on two grounds: First, it is said that the domicile, in each case, of the primary debtor, is in Quebec and that the locality of the obligation is, therefore, there. The contention of the respondent, that the situs of the obligation is determined in each case by the fact that it is a specialty, is met by the argument that the obligation receives its character from the law of Quebec, and that the institution of the common law, known as specialty, is not recognized by the law of that province. Secondly, it is argued that the bonds, in both cases, being registered in Quebec, and being, as the Crown contends, transferable only on the company\u2019s register in that province, the situs of the obligation is, by virtue of that circumstance, in that province, even assuming that the rule as to specialties would otherwise be applicable, and that the facts do not bring the case within the rule under which residence is the criterion.\nIt is convenient to examine, first the last mentioned contention.\nThe Crown argues that, as the bonds were transferable only on the company\u2019s register in the province of Quebec, the situs is fixed in that province by force of the rule laid down in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Brassard v. Smith[17]. The subjects of taxation in respect of which the controversy in that case arose were shares in the capital stock of the Royal Bank of Canada. It was held that, since, by the provisions of the Bank Act, the place of registration of the shares was in Nova Scotia, and there, and only there, except in circumstances having no relevancy, the shares could be validly transferred, they had locality in that province, and not in Quebec. The test applied is stated in the judgment of Lord Dunedin at p. 376 as, the circumstance that the subjects in question could be effectively dealt with within the jurisdiction\n(that is to say, in Nova Scotia).\nIt is an important rule that the scope of a decision should not, speaking generally, be determined by reference to expressions in the judgment, and without regard to the subject matter upon which the court is pronouncing. Judgments must be read, as the phrase is, secundum subjectam materiem. Their Lordships in Brassard v. Smith[18] were not dealing with debts., They were dealing with shares in the capital stock of a corporation, a different kind of property, and the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[19] requires us, we think, to hold that the decision of the matter now in debate is not ruled by the observation just quoted from the judgment of their Lordships in Brassard v. Smith18.\nIt was sought to liken (says Lord Merivale in the course of the judgment in the Royal Trust Co\u2019s case19) the bonds to the shares of a joint stock company so as to apply the principle affirmed in Brassard v. Smith18, that in the case of such shares the test of local situation is supplied by the question, \u201cWhere could the shares be effectively dealt with?\u201d But these securities were statutory bonds and not shares. The conditions of the bonds as to registration are in no way analogous to the provisions in articles of association for the incorporation of shareholders in a joint stock company by the entry of their names on the register of shareholders at its authorized place of being.\nIt may not be out of place to observe that the phrase cited by Lord Dunedin from the judgment in this court in Smith v. L\u00e9vesque[20] is, in the latter judgment, shewn to be a quotation from Mr. Dicey\u2019s book at p. 342, and that in the passage in that book where the phrase quoted occurs, the situs as determined by the test expressed in that phrase, when applied to debts, is \u201cthe country where\u201d the debt is \u201cproperly recoverable or can be enforced\u201d; which, it may be added, is the test given in the judgment of Atkin L.J. in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Public Trustee[21].\nThe judgment in Attorney General v. Bouwens[22], at the pages mentioned in the judgment delivered in this court (pp. 191-2)20, distinguishes simple contract debts from debts by specialty, as well as from debts embodied in negotiable instruments, that is to say, instruments the delivery of which effects a transfer of the debt. Negotiable instruments are treated as instruments\nof a chattel nature capable of being transferred by acts done here, and sold for money here\nas \u201cin fact a simple chattel\u201d; therefore, it is said,\nsuch an instrument follows the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate.\nThe criterion expressed in Mr. Dicey\u2019s words may fairly be said to be that approved in the judgment in Attorney General v. Bouwens[23]) as respects negotiable instruments and other kinds of intangible property which are \u201cdealt with\u201d ordinarily and naturally by transferring them. But, we do not doubt (independently of the binding force of the judgment in the Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[24]) that there is nothing in the judgment in Brassard v. Smith[25], or in the judgment in Attorney General v. Bouwens23, the principle of which that judgment adopts, to justify the conclusion that a specialty debt, non-negotiable, has (either necessarily, or prima facie) its situs at a place where some formality has to be observed in order effectually to transfer it.\nOn the contrary, the rules by which the courts have uniformly governed themselves in ascertaining the locality of specialties or simple contract debts (except in the case of negotiable instruments) have been those already stated, unless the circumstances have been such (as, for instance, in Toronto General Trust Corporation v. The King[26]) as to make them inapplicable. If the criterion adopted in Brassard v. Smith25 were to be considered appropriate to debts (other than specialties and negotiable instruments) then the words \u201cthe place where it can be effectively dealt with\u201d must be understood, as Mr. Dicey uses them, in relation to such debts, as denoting \u201cthe place where it is properly recoverable or can be enforced.\u201d (See Attorney General v. Glendinning[27] per Phillimore J.)\nThe bonds now under consideration were, in neither case, negotiable (transferable by delivery) at the date of the testator\u2019s death. As regards the bonds of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, we shall presently give our reasons for the conclusion that they are specialties. As regards the bonds of the Canadian National Railway, somewhat different considerations come into play. We are not satisfied that the obligation of the company itself, under these bonds, is a specialty debt; but the argument of the Crown, immediately under discussion, as respects these bonds, fails, nevertheless, on the facts. The clause dealing with the subject of registration is in the following terms:\nUnless registered tins bond shall pass by delivery. This bond may be registered as to the principal sum in the name of the holder on the books of the company at the head office of the corporate trustee in the borough of Manhattan city and state of New York, or at the office of the company in the city of Montreal, Dominion of Canada, such registration being noted thereon. After such registration no transfer shall be valid unless made at one of said offices by the registered holder in person or by his attorney duly authorized, and similarly noted hereon, but this bond may foe discharged from registration by being in like manner transferred to bearer, and thereupon transferability by delivery shall be restored; and this bond may again from time to time be registered or transferred to bearer as before.\nWe have quoted the pertinent provision in its entirety. It is quite plain that a bond registered in Montreal may be transferred in New York, and a bond registered in New York transferred in Montreal. Duplicate registers are obviously contemplated. Registration at either place is registration in both. The language of the bond is explicit and cannot properly be read as requiring transfer at the place of registration.\nIt is worth while, perhaps, to compare the language of this bond with the language of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company\u2019s bond, in which it is unequivocally stated that, after registration of the bond, transfer can be effectuated only \u201con the company\u2019s books at the office where such registration was made.\u201d\nComing then to the contentions (a) that the rule as to specialties is irrelevant, and (6) that the locality of the obligation is determined, in each case, by the residence of the corporation.\nWe shall first consider whether the bonds are, in the present connection, to be treated as specialties.\nThe view to which we have already referred, viz., that the rules for determining situs, in applying the enactment of s. 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act, must rest upon the principles of the common law of England, does not, by any logical necessity, involve the consequence that an obligation in its scope and nature governed by the rules of the law of Quebec is, for this purpose, a specialty, merely because such obligation created in like circumstances in one of the other provinces of the Dominion and having inter partes the like scope and effect, would, by the rules of the common law, fall within the category of specialty. It is unnecessary now to discuss or consider any such question.\nThe bonds with which we are concerned are the guaranteed bonds of Dominion railway companies. There can, we think, be no controversy as to the power of the Parliament of Canada to authorize a Dominion railway company to execute specialties. Normally, the undertaking of such a company is a work extending through two or more provinces of Canada; and such companies must, frequently, in the ordinary course, become concerned in transactions in provinces other than Quebec, which involve the execution of deeds of conveyance and deeds of covenant. The authority of the Dominion must necessarily extend to empowering such companies to execute instruments having the effect of a common law specialty, and the exercise of this power cannot be affected by the circumstance that the head office of the company is fixed by statute in Quebec.\nIt is unnecessary to consider what restrictions may affect the exercise of the power as respects transactions which, apart from Dominion legislation, would, ordinarily, under the accepted principles of private international law, be governed by the civil law of Quebec. There can be no doubt that, as regards bonds charged by trust deed or otherwise upon the company\u2019s undertaking as a whole, Parliament is competent to empower the company to execute transfers by deed having the effect of a deed at common law, to execute covenants having the force of, and being, specialties, at common law, and to give the same effect to the bonds and debentures to which securities attach; as well as to bonds and debentures not so secured, issued in the exercise of the borrowing powers of the Company. Nor have we any doubt that such is the effect of the statutes and Orders in Council by which the bonds now in question were authorized.\nFirst of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company. That company\u2019s bonds were guaranteed by the Government of Canada pursuant to the provisions of a statute known as the Grand Trunk Pacific Guarantee Act, 1914 (c. 34 of the statutes of that year).\nBy this statute, His Majesty, upon certain conditions, which have been fulfilled, may \u201cfor the purpose of aiding the company provide\u201d certain monies\nand upon and subject to the conditions hereinafter set out guarantee payment of the principal and interest of an issue of bonds to be made by the company.\nThe statute enacts (s. 4) that the bonds are to be secured by a trust deed or deeds \u201cgranting fixed and floating mortgages or charges\u201d; and, by s. 5,\nThe kind of securities to be guaranteed hereunder and the forms thereof, and the forms and terms of the new trust deed, and the trustee, and the times and manner of the issue of the guaranteed securities, and the disposition of the moneys to be raised thereon, by sale, pledge or otherwise, and the forms and manner of guarantee or guarantees shall be such as the Governor in Council approves, and such terms, provisions and conditions as the Governor in Council may consider expedient or necessary shall be included in the new trust deed.\nIt is unnecessary to go further for the purpose of establishing the power of the company to create bonds having the character of specialties.\nThe bonds are under the seal of the company. A seal is not necessary for compliance with the forms and conditions prescribed by the Railway Act (s. 132 (2), c 170, R.S.C 1927). It cannot be presumed that the execution of the bonds under seal, as prescribed by the Governor in Council, was an idle ceremony merely. The bonds must, we think, as respects the obligation of the company, be considered specialties.\nAs to the guarantee of the Government of Canada, the Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction by force of the enactments of s. 9128 to make laws in relation to the subject of the \u201cPublic Debt.\u201d We see no reason to think that the subject defined in these words does not include the form and the effect of the instruments authorized by Parliament to evidence the public obligations; and the case already cited (Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[28]) is conclusive authority for the proposition that debentures authorized by Parliament and charged by statute upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund have the character of specialties. By s. 6 of the Guarantee Act, it is enacted that,\nThe said guarantee shall be deposited with the trustee, signed by the Minister of Finance or such officer as is designated by the Governor in Council, and upon being signed and deposited as aforesaid His Majesty shall become liable as guarantor for the payment of principal and interest of the guaranteed securities according to the tenor thereof, and the said payment shall form a charge upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the guarantee so signed and deposited shall be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act respecting the guaranteed securities and the new trust deed and all matters relating thereto have been complied with.\nIn exercise of his powers under s. 5 (quoted above) the Governor in Council approved the form and the terms of a mortgage and of the bonds and the form and manner of the guarantee; and authorized the Minister of Finance, upon the due execution, delivery and deposit of the mortgage in the form approved, to sign and deposit with the trustee, the Royal Trust Co., a guarantee of the bonds. This guarantee is in the form of a certificate by which the Minister of Finance certifies\nthat the bonds * * * are guaranteed as to the payment of both principal and interest by the Dominion of Canada.\nOne of the stipulations of the bond itself is that it shall not become valid or obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by the certificate of the trustee endorsed upon it. In the certificate the trustee certifies that the\nbond is one of a series * * * guaranteed by the Government of Canada, described in the within-mentioned mortgage, executed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company to the undersigned as trustee.\nAnother stipulation of the bond is this:\u2014\nA copy of the guarantee of the Government of the Dominion of Canada is endorsed on this bond.\nBy Art. 4 (2) and (3) of the mortgage it is provided as follows:\u2014\nSection 2. The said guarantee shall be deposited with the trustee, signed by the Minister of Finance or such officer as is designated by the Governor in Council, and upon being signed and deposited as aforesaid, His Majesty shall become liable as guarantor for the payment of the principal and interest of the said bonds according to the tenor thereof, and the said payment shall form a charge upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund. A copy of the said guarantee, with a facsimile of the signature of the Minister of Finance, or such other officer, may be engraved upon the said bonds.\nSection 3. No extension, waiver, or other modification of the obligations of the company, given or granted pursuant to the provisions in this mortgage contained by the trustee, or by all or any of the bondholders, or by such bondholders and trustee acting together, shall release or discharge the Government from its obligations as guarantor of the said bonds or upon its covenants herein contained.\nFrom all this it is quite clear that, by force of s. 6 of the Guarantee Act, quoted above, His Majesty is liable \u201cas guarantor for the payment of principal and interest\u201d of each of the bonds \u201caccording to the tenor thereof\u201d; and that \u201c the said payment,\u201d that is to say, \u201cthe payment of principal and interest\u201d of the bonds, forms \u201ca charge upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\u201d.\nThe debt under the guarantee is, therefore, not only the debt of His Majesty, it is a debt by statute and as such is charged upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund. As regards the guarantee, these circumstances bring the obligation plainly within the principle of the Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[29].\nAs to the situs of the specialty,\u2014the bond was in the possession of the testator in the province of Ontario. The copy of the guarantee endorsed upon the bond in compliance with the terms of the approval of the Governor in Council, acting under statutory authority, together with the certificate of the trustee in the form approved by the Governor in Council acting under the same authority, constituted, and were intended to constitute, a representation to persons dealing in the bonds that the conditions of the statutory guarantee had been complied with, and that the charge, conditionally created by the statute, was operative. (Ex parte, Asiatic Banking Corp.[30]; Bhugwandass v. Netherlands &c. Insce Co.[31]. The bond, in the hands of the holder, in itself, constitutes the evidence, and it alone constitutes the evidence, of the holder\u2019s individual right to demand payment in execution of the guarantee. Again, on the principle of The Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta29, the proper conclusion seems to be that the specialty had its situs in Ontario.\nThe definition of His Majesty\u2019s liability under art. 4, s. 2, of the mortgage, which is to arise upon the fulfilment of the condition laid down in that section, is expressed in language which is identical with the language of s. 6.\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company\u2019s bonds are, therefore (as respects both the obligation of the company and the guarantee of the Government) specialties which had their situs in Ontario at the critical date.\nSecondly, of the Canadian National Railway Company\u2019s bonds. These bonds were executed by the Canadian National Railway Company, under the authority conferred by s. 26 of c. 13 of the Dominion statutes of 1919; and, pursuant to an Order in Council of the 13th of September, 1924, a guarantee was signed by the acting Minister of Finance on behalf of His Majesty. This Order in Council, and the guarantee given pursuant to it, were authorized by The Appropriation Act (No. 3) of 1924, being c. 75 of the statutes of that year and schedule \u201cA\u201d thereto.\nBy the last mentioned statute, the Governor in Council was empowered to pay and to apply a sum not exceeding $159,543.39 for the charges arid expenses of the public service from the 1st of April, 1924, to the 31st of March, 1925, not otherwise provided for (being the aggregate of two-thirds\u2014the residue\u2014of the amount of each of the several items, less deductions set forth in schedule \u201cA\u201d). Item 137 relates to a sum of $56,000,000 appropriated to meet expenditures made, and indebtedness incurred, by or on behalf of the Canadian National Railway Company or any one or more of its constituent companies; and it is enacted as follows:\nThe amount herein authorized may be applied from time to time, in the discretion of the Governor in Council:\u2014\n(a) To meet expenditures made or indebtedness incurred by the company in respect of railways, properties and works entrusted to the company as aforesaid.\n(b) By way of loans in cash, or by way of guarantee, or partly one way and partly the other, subject, however, as follows:\u2014\nIf by way of loans, the amount or amounts advanced shall be repayable on demand, with interest at the rate fixed by the Governor in Council, from time to time, payable half-yearly, secured if and when directed by the Governor in Council by mortgage or mortgages upon such properties, in such form and containing such terms and conditions, not inconsistent herewith, as the Governor in Council may approve.\nIf by way of guarantee, any such guarantee may be of the principal and interest of the notes and obligations or securities of one or more of the said companies specified by the Governor in Council, and may be signed by the Minister of Finance, on behalf of His Majesty, in such form and on such terms and conditions as the Governor in Council may determine to be appropriate and applicable thereto.\nWhile the language is not as precise as in the section already quoted from the Guarantee Act of 1914, the effect of the Appropriation Act and the schedule seems to be very clearly this: the Governor in Council may, by guarantee given within the period mentioned, of the principal and interest of notes and obligations or securities of the Canadian National Railway Company or one or more of its constituent companies, charge the Consolidated Revenue Fund with the payment of such notes, obligations or securities; the guarantee to be executed by the Minister of Finance on behalf of His Majesty, in such form and on such terms and conditions, as the Governor in Council may determine.\nThe form of the bonds, and of the trust deed referred to in it, were duly approved by the Order in Council mentioned. By the trust deed, an original counterpart of the guarantee is to be deposited with the corporate trustee, and a copy of it to be endorsed upon all the bonds with the same effect as if the original guarantee were endorsed thereon; the guarantee, when deposited with the corporate trustee, is to be absolute and unconditional; it is unnecessary for the trustees or for any holders of the bonds to take any steps or proceedings for enforcing their rights against the company in order to preserve or enforce their rights against the Government.\nThe bond itself declares the\npayment of the principal and interest of the bonds of this issue as and when the same become respectively due and payable is unconditionally guaranteed by His Majesty the King acting in the right of the Dominion of Canada, by guaranty, a copy of such guarantee being hereon endorsed with the same effect as if the original guarantee were hereon endorsed.\nIt is also stipulated that the bonds shall not be obligatory for any purpose until authenticated by the certificate of the corporate trustee under the trust agreement endorsed thereon.\nThe nature of the guarantee clearly appears to be that of an unconditional obligation resting upon His Majesty to pay the principal and interest of the bonds according to their tenor. The approval of the form of the bond and of the trust agreement by the Governor in Council, acting as the delegate of the legislature, and its direction to the Minister of Finance to execute the guarantee have the same effect as if such approval and direction formed part of an Act of Parliament. The debt incurred is a debt created by statute. And, once again, the individual right of the holder is evidenced by the bond, and by the bond alone, that is to say, by the instrument as a whole, the promise of the company, the declarations contained in the bond and the copy of the guarantee attached to, and the certificate of the trustee endorsed upon it. The instrument, in so far as it embodies an obligation of His Majesty unconditionally to pay principal and interest when due according to the terms of the bond, seems clearly, on the principle to which effect was given in The Royal Trust Co. v. Attorney General for Alberta[32], to be a specialty and to have had its situs, where it was at the testator\u2019s death, in his possession in the province of Ontario.\nIt is necessary, however, to consider the nature of the obligation of the company, which is not under the company\u2019s seal.\nFirst, we think the obligation of the company itself is not a specialty debt. It is not a specialty in form; and the obligation is clearly not a debt by statute within the meaning of the rule applied in the Royal Trust Co\u2019s case32.\nThen, treating the company\u2019s obligation as a simple contract debt. The company has its head office in Montreal. The company has, therefore, a residence there. The bonds as we have seen were registered there. On both grounds, as we have already noticed, it is argued that the situs of this obligation was in Quebec.\nThe effect of registration in Montreal has been discussed.\nWhat weight is to be attached to the fact that the head office of the company is in Quebec?\nThe evidence afforded by the public statutes and the evidence in the appeal book touching the amalgamation of the Canadian National Railway Company with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company require us to take notice of the fact that the Canadian National Railway Company carries on business in other provinces, including Ontario, as well as in Quebec. The debt of the company is primarily payable in New York. But the company is bound to provide for payment of the bonds at Toronto and at Ottawa as well as in New York and Montreal. Payment is not, moreover, contemplated at the head office of the company, or indeed at any office of the company. In each of the places mentioned the bonds are payable at the principal office of the Bank of Montreal.\nEither of the reasons, above mentioned, for the rule fixing the situs of simple contract debts by reference to the residence of the debtor, would justify the assignment of locality to the bonds in Toronto or Ottawa as well as in Montreal. New York is, as mentioned, the primary place of payment, and, again, there is sufficient evidence in the public statutes that the Canadian National Railway Company carried on business in the state of New York at the pertinent date, to require us to take judicial notice of that fact; although we cannot judicially know however notorious it may be, that the Canadian National Railway Company at that date carried on business in New York city.\nIn light of these facts, the residence of the debtor, in the circumstances stated, does not seem to afford, in itself, a criterion for the selection of any one among these jurisdictions as the situs of the bonds.\nOn the other hand, there are other considerations derived from the circumstances that are not without considerable weight.\nThe guaranteed bond is the sole evidence of the holder\u2019s individual right as against the company as well as against the Crown. Since the instrument embodies a specialty debt, that of the Crown, and since, being in Ontario, it was an asset there, and it could not justifiably be dealt with there, possession of it, for the purpose of transferring it, could not lawfully be assumed there, except by sanction of an Ontario probate, or an Ontario grant of administration (Attorney General v. N.Y. Breweries[33]. Moreover, as an asset having its situs in Ontario, it could not justifiably be reduced into possession in Ontario, for presentation on behalf of the estate of Sir Clifford Sifton for payment in New York or Montreal, except under such sanction.\nProbate or administration in Ontario would not, of course, alone entitle the executors to receive payment elsewhere than in Ontario. But the point I am now emphasizing is that, if the bond became due on the date named in it, or by the happening of any of the events having that effect under the trust deed, payment would, in the ordinary course, be provided for in Ontario, where Sir Clifford Sifton resided in his lifetime, and where on his death his legal personal representative in Ontario would be entitled to receive payment; and, in the last mentioned event, nobody would be entitled to take possession of it in Ontario for the purpose of presenting it for payment but such legal personal representative. Moreover, on fulfilment of the conditions entitling the holder of the bond to enforce payment directly against the company, the debt would be \u201cproperly recoverable,\u201d in every sense, in Ontario.\nFurthermore, the primary right of the holder of the bond, on default, is not to enforce the obligation directly against the company, it is to call upon the trustees to proceed on behalf of the holders of all the outstanding bonds. That right would appear to be a right primarily exercisable and situate in New York where the trustees are.\nAgain, in the event of default continuing for sixty days, the trustees are entitled to require payment to themselves in New York. The rights of the trustees could be asserted in Ontario or in New York as well as in Quebec.\nIt is unnecessary, therefore, for the purpose either of transfer or of collection, to resort to the province of Quebec, while for the purpose of asserting the holder\u2019s primary rights in case of default, resort to the trustees in New York is necessary, and, for the purpose of getting possession of the bond, probate or administration in Ontario, in the event of death, is necessary.\nThe question before us is a question as to the locality of certain assets of the estate of the testator. These assets are guaranteed bonds. In assessing the assets to succession duty, no attempt has been made, and probably such an attempt would be merely idle, to segregate the value of the obligation of the company from the value of the obligation of the Government, as an asset. In point of fact, the company was empowered only to issue a guaranteed bond, the payment of which was charged upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In view of the considerations just mentioned, it seems to be difficult to assign one situs to the bond as guarantee and another to the simple contract obligation of the company. There is a sense in which it may be said that the obligation of the company, if that obligation had a separate situs in Quebec, would receive its value from the fact that it is guaranteed by a statutory charge and that the situs of this charge is non ad rem; but the value derived from the statutory charge is nevertheless a value primarily attaching to something in Ontario; and, at the date of the event which happened, the event on which succession duties became payable, viz., the death of Sir Clifford Sifton, this thing was part of the bona notabilia of his estate in Ontario, and could not rightfully be taken possession of or realized except by an executor or administrator acting under the sanction of Ontario law.\nFor these reasons it seems to be the more conformable to the rules determining the situs of bona notabilia from which the principles by which we are governed are derived, to hold that this asset had not a situs in Quebec.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles Lanctot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, Weldon, Demers & Lynch-Staunton.\n[1] (1932) Q.R. 54 K.B. 351.\n[2] [1908] A.C. 508.\n[3] [1912] A.C. 212.\n[4] [1919] A.C. 679.\n[5] [1925] A.C. 371.\n[6] [1919] A.C. 679.\n[7] [1925] A.C. 371.\n[8] [1912] A.C. 212.\n6 [1919] A.C. 679.\n7 [1925] A.C. 371.\n[9] [1930] A.C. 144.\n[10] [1930] A.C. 144 at 150.\n[11] [1932] A.C. 238 at 242\n[12] [1932] A.C. 238 at 242-244.\n[13] [1930] A.C. 144.\n[14] [1891] A.C. 476.\n[15] [1924] 2 Ch. 101.\n[16] [1924] 2 Ch. 101, at 119, 120.\n[17] [1925] A.C. 371.\n[18] [1925] A.C. 371.\n[19] [1930] A.C. 144, at 151-2.\n18 [1925] A.C. 371.\n19 [1930] A.C. 144, at 151-2.\n18 [1925] A.C. 371.\n[20] [1923] S.C.R. 578, at 586.\n[21] [1924] 2 Ch. 101.\n[22] (1838) 4 M. & W. 171.\n20 [1923] S.C.R. 578, at 586.\n[23] (1838) 4 M. & W. 171.\n[24] [1930] A.C. 144, at 151.\n[25] [1925] A.C. 371.\n23 (1838) 4 M. & W. 171.\n[26] [1919] A.C. 679.\n25 [1925] A.C. 371.\n[27] (1905) 92 L.T. 87.\n28 [1930] A.C. 144, at 151.\n[28] [1930] A.C. 144, at 151.\n[29] [1930] A.C. 144.\n[30] (1867) L.R. 2 Ch.

The appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged. Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed, McGillivray J. dissenting. The questions of law upon which the latter based his dissent are: (1) That the trial judge failed to give to the jury a proper direction with respect to the law relating to circumstantial evidence; (2) that his ruling with respect to the questions permitted to be asked of the prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire was erroneous and that the examination was not under oath\u2014the alleged error was that, although the trial judge allowed the accused to ask each juror challenged for cause, if, from what he had heard or read, he had formed an opinion on the case to be tried, he refused to allow a further question as to the nature of that opinion\u2014; and (3) that the direction of the trial judge to the jury respecting the possibility of executive intervention was, as given, insufficient.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the first point, this Court is of the opinion that the accused had no substantial ground of complaint, taking the charge to the jury as a whole, although the trial judge could have given a more proper direction to the jury as to the circumstantial evidence. There is no single formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ; but as a rule he would be well advised to adopt the language, or its equivalent, of Baron Alderson, in the Hodge case (2 Lewin C.C. 227): the trial judge should instruct the jury that, in so far as they relied upon circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the guilt of the accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\nOn the second point, this Courts is of the opinion that the accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the question, which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is unnecessary to determine; for, assuming that he had, he had suffered no prejudice by the trial judge's refusal. As to the objection that the juror witnesses were not sworn, held that it was the duty of the accused, as the challenging party, to see that the witnesses he called to support the challenge were properly sworn.\nOn the third point, although the reference to the executive clemency was an unfortunate one, this Court is satisfied that no harm has been done to the accused, if the trial judge's instructions to the jury are taken as a whole.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing his appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by Ewing J. and a jury, for murder.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. and Neil Primrose for the appellant.\nJ. J. Frawley for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court follows:\nTHE COURT:\u2014The appellant was convicted of the murder of Walter James Parsille, near Manville, Alberta, and sentenced to be hanged. Upon appeal the conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (McGillivray J. dissenting).\nThe questions of law upon which McGillivray J. based his dissent, and to which we are confined in this appeal, are set out in the formal judgment of the court as follows:\n(1) That the learned trial judge failed to give to the jury a proper direction with respect to the law relating to circumstantial evidence.\n(2) That his ruling with respect to the questions permitted to be asked of the prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire was erroneous and that the examination was not under oath.\n(3) That the direction of the learned trial judge to the jury respecting the possibility of executive intervention was, as given, insufficient. (1) The respect in which the learned judge's charge is said to be insufficient as a proper direction to the jury is that he did not instruct them that, in so far as they relied upon circumstantial evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not only that the circumstances proved were all consistent with the guilt of the accused, but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. This is the rule laid down by Baron Alderson as far back as the Hodge case[1], and it has ever since been recognized as a proper direction to jurors.\nIt is of last importance, we do not doubt, where the evidence adduced by the Crown is solely or mainly of what is commonly described as circumstantial, that the jury should be brought to realize that they ought not to find a verdict against the accused unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable explanation of the facts established by the evidence. But there is no single exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron Alderson or its equivalent.\nOne most important element in the case advanced against the appellant was the evidence of one Ward. The accused, Ward deposed, admitted to him when they were in gaol together in Knoxville, Tennessee, that he (the accused) and his father, having decided to rob the deceased Parsille, decided also, in order to avoid a possible subsequent recognition of them by the deceased, that it would be necessary to kill him. This design, according to the statement of the accused as recounted by Ward, was carried out and the deceased was shot by the father in the presence of the son.\nThe learned trial judge did not explicity tell the jury that they ought not to convict the prisoner unless they believed the testimony of Ward, but, on the other hand, he did not explicitly tell them that it would be open to them to find a verdict against the accused if they disbelieved Ward. As to this there are, first of all, these three relevant sentences:\u2014\nIt may be that in the trial of a criminal charge there are facts or sets of facts which are very suggestive but which if standing alone would fall far short of being sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond. any reasonable doubt. But it may also be that there are facts or sets of facts in sufficient number and of sufficient cogency which combined may amount to proof beyond all reasonable doubt. Such facts or sets of facts if appearing in sufficient numbers and of sufficient force may prove beyond all reasonable doubt not only that the accused committed the offence but that on no other reasonable hypothesis could anyone else have committed it.\nIf these sentences contain a suggestion that the jury might find a verdict of guilt without regard to Ward's testimony, then they seem also to convey, pretty clearly, the caution that, if they should proceed upon the circumstantial evidence alone, they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion, consistent with the facts proved, was that the accused was guilty. But the final sentence of the learned judge's remarks on this subject is this:\nYou will weigh all the evidence in this case including all these statements alleged to have been made to Ward and if you believe them to have been made and if you believe them to be true you will say whether or not they satisfy you beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\nWe think that this sentence, when read with the learned judge's exposition of the facts and the evidence in the earlier part of his charge, would be calculated to convey to the jury the impression that their verdict ought to turn chiefly, if not entirely, upon their belief or disbelief of the testimony of Ward and of the truth of the statement of fact which, according to Ward's account, was made to him by the accused.\nWe are satisfied that the accused has no substantial ground of complaint under this head.\n(2) The error alleged in the judge's ruling as to the questions which might be put to prospective jurors on their examination on the voir dire was, that, although the judge allowed the accused to ask each juror challenged for cause, if, from what he had heard or read, he had formed an opinion on the case to be tried, he refused to allow a further question as to the nature of that opinion.\nThe accused had challenged several jurors for cause, and the challenges were tried. In the case of three jurors the triers found against the challenge and declared the jurors indifferent. In each such case the accused challenged peremptorily. When the full: complement of jurors had been sworn the accused had one peremptory challenge left, and he had a jury, every man of which the accused, through his counsel, had expressly declared to be unobjectionable. Notwithstanding this the accused now contends that he had a right to put to each of these jurors the question which the learned judge disallowed, and that, as his rights were denied him, he is entitled to a new trial.\nWe are fully conscious that in the administration of criminal justice nothing is more important than that the constitution of the jury should be free from all objection and that the accused should have the full advantage of every safeguard which the law has provided to enable him to secure this right, which is of the very essence of a fair trial. We, however, think that the accused had a fair trial. Whether the accused had a right to have the question, which the trial judge disallowed, put to the jurors, it is unnecessary to determine, for, assuming that he had, he has suffered no prejudice by the judge's refusal. By his own act in peremptorily challenging these jurors, he elected to pursue that remedy instead of having the question of their indifference as between himself and the King determined by way of challenge for cause. This was held in the case of Whelan v. The Queen[2]. In that case the accused desired to challenge for cause one S., one of the jurors called. The judge ruled that he must first exhaust his peremptory challenges. In deference to the judge's ruling the accused challenged S. peremptorily. Afterwards, having exhausted his twenty challenges, including S., he claimed the right to challenge peremptorily one H. on the ground that he had been compelled to challenge S. peremptorily and should not be obliged to count him as one of the twenty. It was held that the trial judge was wrong in ruling that the accused must exhaust his peremptory challenges before challenging for cause and that if S. had been sworn there must have been a venire de novo, but it was also held that by the peremptory challenge of S., which excluded him from the jury, the error in the judge's ruling was nullified. As to H. the objection could not be maintained because the accused had, in fact, twenty peremptory challenges. That judgment was given by a very strong court and, in our opinion, the point was rightly determined, and governs the objection now under consideration. In reference to the further objection that these juror witnesses were not sworn, it is sufficient to point out that it was the duty of the accused, as the challenging party, to see that the witnesses he called to support the challenge were properly sworn.\nAs to the third ground of objection, the passage in question is in these words:\u2014\nYou need not concern yourselves with the penalty that is attached to this or to any offence. It does not follow that because a man is convicted on a capital charge that he will necessarily be hanged. It is true that the Criminal Code of Canada makes it incumbent upon the Court to pronounce the sentence of death but the responsible officers of the Crown may in their wisdom if they see fit commute that sentence. In any case that responsibility is theirs and not yours or mine. The oath which you have taken calls upon you to decide this case upon the evidence which you have heard from this witness box and upon nothing else. And I need scarcely add you need have no moral fear about doing your duty whether that duty leads you to conviction or to acquittal.\nWe have no doubt that the reference to the executive clemency was an unfortunate one. There was not the least ground for supposing that a verdict against the accused founded on the evidence adduced and on a proper charge would be interfered with. Such a reference could not assist the jury in performing their duty to decide the issue of fact before them, and there is always some risk that a suggestion that the verdict is to be reviewed may result in some abatement of the deep sense of responsibility with which a jury ought to be brought to regard their duty in passing upon any criminal charge, and, preeminently, when the offence charged is murder, to which the law attaches the capital penalty. Such observations as those addressed to the jury by the counsel for the defence can always, if they seem likely to be harmful, be counteracted without resorting to suggestions which may mislead the jury into a misconstruction of their own duty.\nIn this case, however, we are satisfied that no harm was done. There is, first, the immediate context of the impeached observations; which in itself was perhaps sufficient to counteract the effect of those observations. But, however that may be, the learned judge's observations, as a whole, were admirably calculated to impress upon the jury a sense of the duty, with which they were charged, to examine for themselves, and to bring to the test of their own judgment, all the matters submitted to them; and the con text of the two sentences of which the accused complains must, we are satisfied, have made it quite clear to the jury that those sentences were not intended to qualify the instructions already given to them, or to modify the impressions they must have received from what had already been said.\nThe appeal will therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1838) 2 Lewin C.C. 227.\n[2] 28 U.C.Q.B. 108.\n"}

C.\u2014Subsection 6 of section 1013 Cr. C.\u201421-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14.\nThe appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of s. 415 Cr. C. Upon appeal, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court, the dissent of one judge being merely mentioned in the formal judgment. Under a recent amendment (s. 14 of c. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), subsection 6 was added to s. 1013 Cr. C. providing that, in case of a dissenting opinion, the formal judgment should specify the grounds in . law on which such dissent was based. The Crown contended that, owing to the failure of the appellate court so to specify the grounds of dissent, an appeal to this Court was not open to the appellant.\nHeld that this Court had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. The only section of the Criminal Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023, under which the fact that there has been a dissent on a question of law is the sole condition for the foundation of its jurisdiction: the circumstance that the grounds of dissent are not specified in the formal judgment of the appellate court does not avoid the fact of there having been a dissent, which is the only requirement contained in section 1023 Cr. C.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his appeal by a majority of the Court from his conviction by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, criminal side.\nThe appellant was convicted of the following offence: Being president and general manager of a company called Rayon Trimmings Limited, which company had been declared insolvent and was being wound up, he has, during the year preceding the winding up order of the company, committed the following indictable offence, to wit: \u201cActing in his capacity of president and general manager, with intent to defraud, he did destroy, alter, mutilate and\/or falsify the books, papers, writings, valuable securities and documents belonging to the Rayon Trimmings Limited, and\/or concur in the same being done.\u201d This is an offence against subsection (a) of section 415 of the Criminal Code. The accused had also been found guilty of an offence under section 417 of the Criminal Code, but his appeal was unanimously allowed on this last conviction by the appellate court. The Crown contended that the appeal to this Court should be dismissed, because the judgment of the appellate court was not rendered in accordance with section 1013 of the Criminal Code as amended. In 1931, 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 14, subsection (6) was added to 1013 of the Criminal Code reading as follows: \u201cWhenever an appeal under this section is dismissed by the Court of Appeal, and any judge of such Court expresses an opinion dissenting from the judgment of the Court, the formal judgment of the Court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based either in whole or in part.\u201d\nThe formal judgment of the appellate court did not specify the grounds in law on which the Honourable Judge Howard was dissenting: it merely stated that Howard J. was dissenting.\nOn the appeal to this Court, it was held that the Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to entertain the appellant\u2019s appeal. On the merits of the appeal this Court held that there was evidence on which it could well be found that the appellant was guilty.\nLucien Gendron K.C. and Moses Doctor for the appellant.\nG\u00e9rald Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment follows:\nThe Court:\u2014The appellant was convicted under subsection (a) of section 415 of the Criminal Code. Upon appeal, the conviction was confirmed by the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, but Mr. Justice Howard dissented. In the formal judgment of the Court, the dissent is merely referred to as follows:\nThis is the judgment of this Court, Mr. Justice Howard dissenting.\nUnder a recent amendment (sec. 14 of s. 28 of 21-22 Geo. V), the following subsection was added to section 1013 of the Criminal Code:\n(6) Whenever an appeal under this section is dismissed by the Court of Appeal and any judge of such court expresses an opinion dissenting from the judgment of the court, the formal judgment of the court shall specify any ground or grounds in law on which such dissent is based either in whole or in part.\nIn this case, the formal judgment does not specify the grounds on which the dissent of Mr. Justice Howard is based, and the Attorney-General, invoking former judgments of this Court (Davis v. The King)[1]; Gouin v. The King[2], and De Bortoliv. The King[3]), contends that, owing to the failure so to specify the grounds of dissent, an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was not open to the appellant.\nWe are of opinion that such contention cannot be up-held. The only section of the Code dealing with the jurisdiction de plano of the Supreme Court of Canada is section 1023. It gives to\nany person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013 (the right of appealing) against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\nThe fact that there has been dissent on a question of law is therefore the only requirement.\nIn the Davis case1 and in the others referred to by the Crown, upon the state of the law as it then was, no dissenting judgment could be legally pronounced, unless the court of appeal directed to the contrary, and unless the direction was plainly \u201cevidenced by the order of the Court\u201d (Gouin v. The King[4]); and this Court held that dissenting opinions expressed contrary to the prohibition of the statute should be treated as non-existent\u2014the consequence being that there was to be found, in the record, no dissent as a result of which the right of appeal could operate under section 1023 of the Code.\n[1] [1924] S.C.R. 522.\n[2] [1926] S.C.R. 539.\n[3] [1927] S.C.R. 454.\n1 [1924] S.C.R. 522.\n[4] [1926] S.C.R. 439, at 540.\n"}

It was held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for interest had not become res judicata by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Campbell v. Hogg, [1930] 3 D.L.R. 673 (on an appeal in former proceedings which began by petition filed by the present defendant in the proper Surrogate Court in Ontario for the passing of his accounts), as that judgment (as interpreted in the present judgment) did not dispose of the matter of interest now in question except to hold that in the proceedings then before the court there was no jurisdiction to charge interest on uninvested balances in the hands of such a trustee as was the defendant. (In this connection, s. 65 (1), (3), of the Surrogate Courts Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 94, considered).\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1].\nThe action was tried before Jeffrey J[2] who held that the plaintiff (administrator of the estate of the late Lady Howland) should recover from the defendant the sum of $17,520.40, as being interest, computed at the statutory rate, half yearly, with rests, on the sum of $7,027.34, this latter sum being the amount found by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[3] to be then remaining in the defendant\u2019s hands as trustee for the late Lady Howland (which finding of the Judicial Committee was made on an appeal in former proceedings which began by petition filed by the present defendant in the proper Surrogate Court in Ontario for the passing of his accounts).\nThe Court of Appeal[4] vacated and set aside the judgment of Jeffrey J., but (by a majority) ordered and adjudged that it be referred to the Master of the Court at Toronto to take an account of such sum as the Master might properly find the defendant chargeable with in respect of interest or compound interest on the moneys amounting to the said sum of $7,027.34, and that the plaintiff recover from the defendant the amount found due by the Master forthwith after the confirmation of his report.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The question for determination by this Court was whether or not the defendant\u2019s plea of res judicata (by reason of the said former proceedings and the said judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council therein) was a good answer to the claim for interest made by the plaintiff in the present action.\nR.V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nW.J. Elliott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014The facts and circumstances preceding the bringing of this action are set forth fully in the report of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario4. The learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Jeffrey, had given judgment in favour of the respondent for $17,520.40 as interest on various funds of the late Lady Elizabeth Mary Howland remaining during certain years in the hands of the appellant, who had formerly, during her lifetime, acted for her in connection with investments. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which Court4 vacated the judgment of the learned trial judge and ordered a reference to the Master of the Supreme Court of Ontario to take an account of such sum as the Master might properly find the appellant chargeable with in respect of interest or compound interest on the money, amounting to $7,027.34, mentioned in the pleadings; as having been found in the hands of the appellant by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Campbell v. Hogg[5]).\nFrom the judgment of the Court of Appeal the defendant appealed to this Court.\nThe appellant contended before us that, by the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, it was found that sums aggregating $7,027.34 remained in the hands of the appellant and a claim for interest on the respective sums aggregating that amount was res judicata.\nSection 65, subsection 1, of the Surrogate Courts Act, R.S.O., 1927, chapter 94, is as follows:\n65. (1) Where an executor, administrator, trustee, under a will of which he is an executor, or a guardian, has filed in the proper surrogate court an account of his dealings with the estate, and the judge has approved thereof, in whole or in part, if he is subsequently required to pass his accounts in the Supreme Court such approval, except so far as mistake or fraud is shown, shall be binding upon any person who was notified of the proceedings taken before the surrogate judge, or who was present or represented thereat, and upon every one claiming under any such person.\nSection 65, subsection 3, of the same Act is as follows:\n(3) The judge, on passing the accounts of an executor, administrator or such a trustee, shall have jurisdiction to enter into and make full enquiry and accounting of and concerning the whole property which the deceased was possessed of or entitled to, and the administration and disbursement thereof in as full and ample a manner as may be done in the Master\u2019s office under an administration order, and, for such purpose, may take evidence and decide all disputed matters arising in such accounting subject to appeal.\nThere is no doubt that a Master has in Ontario frequently charged interest on uninvested balances against an executor under an administration order. Inglis v. Beaty[6]; In re Honsberger[7].\nBut the appellant has not made clear to us how he, in the capacity in which he acted, comes within the wording of section 65, subsection 1, \u201ctrustee, under a will of which he is an executor,\u201d or of subsection 3, \u201csuch a trustee.\u201d\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in Campbell v. Hogg[8], supra, held, in our opinion, that the surrogate judge had no jurisdiction to charge interest on uninvested balances in the hands of such a trustee as was the appellant.\nThe following passages occur in the judgment of the Judicial Committee:\nAt page 683:\nBut having said so much, their Lordships, while expressing no opinion upon the extent of the jurisdiction or range of topics that may be included in s. 65 (3) of the Surrogate Courts Act, are clear that in the present proceedings no sums ought to be charged against Mr. Hogg beyond those which it was admitted or proved that he had received. Except upon admission he may not, for instance, in these proceedings be charged with interest on uninvested balances or with any sum in the nature of damages.\nAt page 692:\n* * * Interest on uninvested balances is not chargeable in these proceedings. Mr. Hogg will in the result remain accountable for the net amount of principal and that only.\n(3) The Dumas, Vaillancourt and Campbell mortgage moneys. These have already been referred to. As uninvested balances they are all three brought into charge in the account. No claim for interest upon them as such, is, as has been observed, competent in these proceedings.\nAnd at page 701:\nTheir Lordships have now dealt with all the points raised by the appellant which were not abandoned or disposed of during the hearing. They say now nothing of her charge that on the capital which, it is said, appears on his account to have been in his hands, Mr. Hogg is short on an average of $700 a year in his interest. This remains a mere allegation, not worked out by reference to the account. Even however if to any extent a prima facie case with reference to that interest or to any part of it could be made, no relief in these proceedings could on the evidence be given for the reason explained in an earlier part of this judgment.\nWe are of opinion that the above language, notably that on page 692, goes to the question of jurisdiction and that therefore the claim for interest is not res judicata.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.V. Sinclair.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Elliott, Hume, McKague & Anger.\n[1] [1932] O.R. 641; [1932] 4 D.L.R. 465.\n[2] His judgment is noted in (1932) 41 Ont. W.N. 102.\n[3] Campbell v.

Subsequently, one of the houses, hereinafter called the \u201ccorner house,\u201d being in an unfinished state, appellant, who held a mortgage, originally made to one R., on the property, started foreclosure proceedings and, under a writ of possession, went into possession of it and completed it, a covenant in his mortgage entitling him to complete it and to add the cost thereof to his mortgage debt. A question arose as to priority between his cost of completion and respondent\u2019s lien. Also a question arose as to priority between respondent\u2019s lien and a certain mortgage on the corner house lot, made and registered prior to commencement of the building, to one W., assigned to one A., and, after the trial herein, assigned to appellant. This mortgage, while held by A., was, on the making of the mortgage to R. above mentioned, postponed, under an agreement by A., to the mortgage to R., which mortgage to R. (assigned to appellant) was that on which appellant, as aforesaid, took proceedings and went into possession of, and completed, the corner house.\nHeld (1) On construction of respondent\u2019s contract, as a whole, it showed the intention of the parties thereto to treat it as one entire contract covering all the buildings.\n(2) Respondent\u2019s lien was chargeable against all the land, irrespective of the work and materials which went into each building. In applying the Act the court may and should have regard to the contract under which the work or materials claimed for were provided; and where the parties by their contract have treated several buildings upon contiguous lots belonging to the same owner as upon one property, the lien claimant is entitled to have the lien applied as a general lien upon all the land. However difficult it may be to find a satisfactory basis for this principle in the words of the Act itself (i.e., in s. 5, the controlling section, which creates the right of lien; if the lien were for supply of material only, the right to maintain it as a general lien upon all the buildings would exist under s. 32 (2)), the principle has been so long and so generally recognized that it must now be taken as settled law. (Ontario Lime Assn. v. Grimwood, 22 Ont. L.R. 17; Polson v. Thomson, 29 D.L.R. 395, at 401, and other cases, cited and discussed).\n(3) Respondent\u2019s lien (extending to the amount owing him for work and material on all the buildings) had priority over appellant\u2019s claim for cost of said completion. The intention of the Act, as disclosed by ss. 7 (3) and 13 (1), was clearly to limit the security of a registered mortgage, as against lien claims, to the actual value of the property as at the time the first lien arose, and to exclude from the operation of that security all payments and advances made thereunder by the mortgagee after such lien claims have been registered. And the payments and advances so excluded would include the cost of completion in question.\n(4) Respondent, though not having brought an action to enforce his own lien, could, to hold his lien in its priority, rely upon the statement of claim of another lien claimant whose claim was dismissed.\n(5) The said mortgage to W., assigned to A. and later to appellant, had priority over respondent\u2019s lien; such priority was not lost by the said agreement of postponement of it to the mortgage to R. (On this point, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was reversed; Crocket J. dissenting).\nExcept as above stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Ont., [1932] O.R. 617, was affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], in so far as it allowed the present respondent\u2019s claim for a lien under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 173, and held that such lien had priority over moneys expended by the present appellant (a mortgagee) in the completion of a certain building, and in so far as (by its formal judgment, as settled) it gave to the said lien priority over a certain mortgage, formerly held by one Albrechtsen, and acquired, since the commencement of the action, by the present appellant.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe judgment of this Court was first delivered on June 28, 1933, and it was directed that the appeal be dismissed with costs; but the reasons for judgment did not deal with one of the matters in issue (the question of priority between the respondent\u2019s lien and the said mortgage formerly held by Albrechtsen) and this matter was later brought up by way of a motion to vary the judgment, and judgment on this motion was delivered on December 22, 1933, granting the motion and varying the judgment so that in respect of the issue raised by the motion the appeal was allowed; the appellant to have half of his costs of appeal to this Court. (Crocket J. dissented on the question dealt with on the motion).\nThe present report gives in the following order: the reasons for judgment as first delivered, the statement of the motion, and the reasons for judgment (on the further issue) delivered on the motion.\nS.A. Hayden and Woods Walker for the appellant.\nR. Kellock and H.P. Edge for the respondent.\nIn the judgment first delivered, reasons were delivered by Smith J. and by Crocket J.; the Chief Justice and Rinfret and Lamont JJ. concurring with each.\nSMITH, J. (concurred in by Duff C.J. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ.)\u2014The respondent\u2019s lien is for a balance owing under a contract by respondent to do the brickwork and supply the bricks for five four\u2011family duplex houses. The appellant had advanced, on a first mortgage of the corner duplex numbered 2 and 4, the sum of $6,500, and also held a third mortgage on the whole five duplexes for $10,511.53, for which amounts it is admitted the appellant has priority over the lien of the respondent.\nThe owner ran short of funds before the buildings were completed, and further work was abandoned. Duplex 2 and 4 being, as winter approached, in such an incomplete state, including the lack of any heating plant, that it was in danger of being greatly damaged during winter if left in this uncompleted state, and being also incapable of producing revenue, the appellant completed the building at a cost of $12,500. Before this expenditure, the respondent\u2019s lien, which was subject to the mortgages to the amount mentioned, was practically worthless.\nThe judgment appealed from holds that the respondent\u2019s lien attaches to the value added to the building by appellant\u2019s expenditure in priority to the portion of appellant\u2019s mortgage represented by this expenditure, which was expressly authorized in such event by the terms of the mortgage. Respondent\u2019s priority over this part of the mortgage moneys extends not only to the amount owing to him for work done and material supplied for this duplex 2 and 4, but to the amount owing him for work done and material supplied on the other buildings as well. A more inequitable result, I think, it would be difficult to conceive. It is, however, a result brought about by express statutory enactment, coupled with the appellant\u2019s failure to be guided by the provisions of the statute.\nLong before commencing work for completion of the building, the appellant had brought an action for foreclosure of his mortgages, by which he could have obtained immediate possession. In this action the lienholders could have been made parties as subsequent encumbrancers, and on proper proof of danger of destruction of his security by delay, the court would have given him protection, perhaps by giving him immediate foreclosure or sale. He saw fit, however, to take the remedy into his own hands, disregarding the terms of the statute, with the result that his expenditure enures to the benefit of the respondent, instead of to himself. It is with regret that I find myself forced to the conclusion that the judgment giving the respondent the benefit of the appellant\u2019s expenditure of $12,500 is in accordance with the provisions of the statute. I can find no ground for differing from the reasoning of Mr. Justice Grant in the Court of Appeal and from that of my brother Crocket.\nI therefore agree that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET, J. (concurred in by Duff C.J. and Rinfret and Lamont JJ.)\u2014This appeal involves the question of the validity of a contractor\u2019s lien purporting to be registered by the respondent under the provisions of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, c. 173, R.S.O., 1927, for work and materials provided in the construction of a row of 5 four-family detached duplex houses in the city of Toronto, and also the question of its priority in respect of an expenditure of approximately $12,000 made by the appellant, to complete one of the houses, after going into possession of the same as mortgagee.\nThe work and materials claimed for were done and furnished by Hart under a contract entered into by him in September, 1929, with one Guild, a builder, whereby he agreed to do the brick work and supply the brick on and for the five houses at a price of \u201c$4,080 per building or a total of $20,400 for the complete contract,\u201d as a letter of September 15 confirming the contract stated it, exclusive of brick and labour for mantels and garages, which was left to be arranged by the architect.\nGuild\u2019s wife had a few weeks before purchased from one Watt and taken in her name the deed of the land on which it was proposed to erect the five houses. It was situated on the north side of Castle View avenue, and included 31 feet 9 inches of lot No. 3, and the whole of lots 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, running easterly to Spadina road, having a total frontage of 253 feet 9 inches on Castle View avenue, and a uniform depth of approximately 106 feet. For the purpose of the duplexes building scheme it seems that the land was subdivided into five new lots, the side-lines of which overlapped the side-lines of the original lots, and that the most easterly of the new lots, with which the appellant\u2019s mortgages are here particularly concerned, and upon which the duplex, 2-4, was built, comprised 7 feet 9 inches of the original lot No. 7 and the whole of lot No. 8, with a right of way over a driveway between it and the adjoining lot on the west.\nMrs. Guild, having paid part of the purchase price of the land in cash, gave Watt five separate mortgages for $3,612.50 each, presumably one on each of the five lots as subdivided for the building scheme. Four of these mortgages were transferred to one Arthur, and the fifth, covering the corner or most easterly lot, was assigned to one Albrechtsen. Building loans were arranged on mortgages on the four westerly houses, two with the Canada Life Assurance Company for $22,000 each, and two with Confederation Life Assurance Association for $18,000 each, Arthur waiving in favour of these his four $3,612.50 mortgages. On the corner lot Mrs. Guild gave a second mortgage to one Alberta Gibbons for $6,500, which was transferred subsequently to the appellant.\nIn October the Guilds procured the incorporation of City Duplexes Limited, which took over all these properties from Mrs. Guild and assumed all outstanding obligations thereon, Guild continuing, however, as before to manage the undertaking. Finding the moneys available under the mortgages already mentioned insufficient to enable it to meet the rapidly increasing claims, City Duplexes Limited, on February 25, 1930, when all five houses were in various stages of construction\u2014the four westerly more nearly completed than the most easterly building, 2-4,\u2014executed a mortgage covering the latter property as well as the four adjoining lots to one Florence Ready to secure a further loan of $10,000. The appellant shortly afterwards acquired this mortgage, Albrechtsen waiving in its favour his $3,612.50 mortgage on this lot and building.\nHart went to work immediately upon entering into his brick contract, which called for its completion on or before February 1, 1930, starting with the most westerly building and proceeding with the others in their order, west to east. There were some delays, occasioned by the weather, and others which it appears were chiefly caused by the difficulties which the Guilds and City Duplexes Limited were having in financing the undertaking, with the result that about the middle of May, although the four westerly houses were substantially completed, and Hart had finished the brickwork under his contract on the house 2-4, there remained a considerable amount of work to be done in the latter in order to complete it. Several liens had been registered against the whole property and at this juncture negotiations took place between the different mortgagees, lien claimants and other creditors with a view to securing the outstanding indebtedness to the various creditors. These negotiations proved abortive on account of Arthur, who held the second mortgages on the four westerly lots, refusing to enter into the arrangement which was proposed.\nArthur subsequently, on June 11, went into possession of these houses as mortgagee and the same day Hart registered his lien against the estate of Mr. and Mrs. Guild and of Watt, Albrechtsen, Arthur, City Duplexes Limited and Mortgage Discount Limited, in the entire parcel of land which Mrs. Guild had purchased from Watt and which the lien claim described as the easterly 31 feet 9 inches of lot No. 3 and lots Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. It claimed a balance due of $12,200 for work done on brick contract for City Duplexes Limited and R T. Guild on or before May 15, 1930.\nAt that time the $6,500 secured by the Gibbons mortgage had been fully advanced and approximately $8,500 of the $10,000 secured by the Ready mortgage, both of which were now held by the appellant. The latter started foreclosure proceedings, and about the same time, it appears, City Duplexes Limited went into bankruptcy. Negotiations were then entered into by some of the lien claimants with the appellant\u2019s solicitor, with a view to the completion of the corner building, 2-4. These negotiations also fell through, and on August 12, 1930, the appellant went into possession of this house under a writ of possession obtained in his foreclosure action. He proceeded to complete the building and expended approximately $12,000 for that purpose, notwithstanding the prior registration of Hart\u2019s and other liens. It is in respect only of this $12,000 expenditure and of Hart\u2019s lien that the question of priority arises.\nOn the trial of the respondent\u2019s and several other lien claims in a consolidated action before the Assistant Master of the Supreme Court, under the provisions of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, the appellant relied upon four main objections: first, that the respondent\u2019s lien was not registered within time; second, that in the course of the negotiations referred to he had waived his lien or estopped himself by his conduct in connection therewith from relying upon it as against the appellant; third, that the lien was not chargeable as a general lien against all or any of the buildings or lots without proof of the particular balances which were or may have been due the claimant in respect of each separate house; and, fourth, that, in any event, the lien was subject to the expenditure which the appellant had made for the completion of the house, 2-4, after he had gone into possession in exercise of his rights as assignee of the Ready mortgage.\nThe Master found against the first two objections, but disallowed the lien on the ground that the work and materials were not done and furnished under an entire contract, within the meaning of sec. 32, subsec. 2, of the Act, and were therefore not chargeable against all or any of the buildings without proof of the balances which were due in respect of each of the five buildings.\nThe respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal, which sustained the lien and held that it was entitled to priority over the moneys expended by the present appellant for the completion of the house, 2-4, as mortgagee in possession.\nThe same grounds which were taken before the Master and the Court of Appeal were argued before this Court.\nAs to the lien not being registered within time, the Master found that Hart performed work under his contract on the house, 14-16, on May 14, 1930, and on the house, 2-4, on May 17, within thirty days of the registration of his lien. This finding, involving as it did, a consideration of the good faith of the claimant, is a finding upon what is peculiarly a question of fact, which we think, in the circumstances, should be regarded as conclusive.\nThe second ground was disposed of during the argument, the Court stating its opinion that there was no evidence, either of a waiver of the lien on the part of the respondent, or of an estoppel against him in connection with the futile negotiations above referred to.\nThe third ground involves two questions: first, whether the contract under which Hart provided the work and materials was an entire contract for a gross price for the brick and brick work for all the five houses; and, second, if it were such a contract, whether the lien was maintainable for the general balance due thereunder upon all or any of the houses and lots without proof of the particular balances which were due in respect of the different buildings.\nWe think that the Court of Appeal rightly construed the contract between Guild and Hart, as evidenced by the letter of September 15, 1929, as a single contract for the brickwork and the supply of bricks upon and for all the five buildings at a total price of $20,400, exclusive of brick or labour for mantels and garages, which were to be dealt with as extras and arranged by the architect.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel, in support of his contention that the contract was severable in respect of the five houses, mainly relied upon the inclusion in the price sentence of the figures and words \u201c$4,080 per building\u201d and the following passage:\u2014\n* * * and the terms of payment will be as I receive the second draw on the Permanent Trust mortgages which are being placed on the different buildings as they are erected.\ntogether with the fact that the mortgages which were arranged for building loans with Canada Life Assurance Company and Confederation Life Assurance Association were separate mortgages on the four westerly buildings.\nIt will be observed that the figures and words \u201c$4,080 per building,\u201d in the price sentence are immediately followed by the words and figures \u201cor a total of $20,400 for the complete contract\u201d; also, that Hart\u2019s contract is expressly stated in the first sentence of the letter to be a contract \u201cto do the brick work and supply the bricks for 5 four-family duplexes,\u201d and that Hart also undertakes to have \u201call brick work completed on said contract\u201d on or before February 1, 1930. The letter clearly shews, in my opinion, that the intention of the parties was to treat the contract as one entire contract covering all five buildings.\nWas, then, Hart\u2019s lien for work and material provided under such a contract upon and for all five houses, a lien which was chargeable under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, against all or any of the buildings, irrespective of the work and materials which went into each?\nThere can be no doubt that if the lien were for the supply of material only, Hart would have the right under sec. 32, subsec. 2, of the present Act to have his lien maintained as a general lien upon all the buildings. This subsection, however, is distinctly limited to entire contracts for the supply of material only, and cannot in itself be relied upon to support a lien claimed under an entire contract for the performance of work as well as the supply of material. The respondent does not pretend to rely upon this subsection, but claims that sec. 5 of the Act\u2014the controlling section, which creates the right of lien\u2014itself contemplates a general or joint lien in such a case as well as a separate lien enforceable against the particular property in which the work or material claimed for have been incorporated in cases where the work is done or the materials are furnished under separate contracts with different owners.\nOmitting words that have no bearing on the question under consideration, this section reads as follows:\u2014\n5. Unless he signs an express agreement to the contrary * * * any person who performs any work or service upon or in respect of, or places or furnishes any materials to be used in the making, constructing, * * * of any erection, building, * * *, or the appurtenances to any of them for any owner, contractor, or sub-contractor, shall by virtue thereof have a lien for the price of such work, service or materials upon the estate or interest of the owner in the erection, building, * * *, and appurten- ances and the land occupied thereby or enjoyed therewith, or upon or in respect of which such work or service is performed, or upon which such materials are placed or furnished to be used.\nThere is no trouble in construing this section as applicable to the construction of a single building, or to any number of single buildings as separate undertakings, but when one endeavours to apply it to the construction of several separate buildings under a single contract and in such circumstances as we have in this case, I confess that I cannot find any very satisfactory basis for doing so in the language of the enactment itself.\nIt is only when one looks beyond the section to the contract between the parties that any support can be found for the proposition contended for. Yet there is no reference in the section to any other agreement than that mentioned in the first line, viz: the agreement by which the person to whom the lien is given may waive it. It is true that there can be no liability on the part of anyone for the price of work or materials without a contract, either express or implied, and that so far as the estate or interest of the owner is concerned, its liability to the lien depends, under clause (c) of the interpretation section of the Act, upon the work or materials being done or furnished at his request, though, once this liability attaches, it passes to all persons whose rights are subsequently acquired through him. It is also true that on the trial of a lien claim against the estate of the owner there must be proof of a request on the part of the owner sought to be charged. To this extent it is necessary for the Master or Judge trying the claim to look to the contract between the parties, but whether he is to look to it for the purpose of determining whether, if there be the necessary request to create the lien, the lien is to be applied as a severable or a general lien, is the problem that presents the real difficulty.\nNo one, I think, can seriously challenge the proposition that the form and effect of the lien must be found in the statute itself by which the lien is created or the proposition that the lien is enforceable only against such property, and only in such manner and under such limitations as the statute provides. The intention of the parties, as evidenced by the contract between them, clearly cannot change the intent of the Act and cannot, in my opinion, be considered for the purpose of ascertaining the form and effect of the lien unless the Act itself makes the form and effect of the lien depend upon the form and effect of the contract. In this view the crucial question is: Does the section give a lien, the character and scope of which is determinable according to the form of the contract under which the work or materials are provided? Whether it does or does not do so, there is an impressive line of United States cases, notably in New York and Massachusetts, in which under similar statutes courts have brought lien claims in circumstances similar to those obtaining in the case at bar within the terms of the statute creating the lien by reference to the form and terms of the contracts between the parties. The trend of judicial opinion in Canada for many years past has undoubtedly been to follow these United States decisions in this regard. It may be said, too, that in both countries the courts have shewn a growing tendency to turn away from the proposition that a statute creating such a right of lien must be strictly construed, whether the provisions in question relate to the creation of the lien or to its enforcement.\nAlthough it was the decision of a single judge (Middleton J.) on a chambers motion to vacate a lien, Ontario Lime Association v. Grimwood[2] appears to be the leading Canadian case on the question of the application of a general lien to several separate buildings belonging to the same owner for material furnished under an entire contract. That decision has not only been uniformly followed in the courts of Ontario, but the principle as there enunciated was embodied in the revision of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act thirteen years afterwards in the precise language used by that learned judge in his reasons for judgment, and is found in sec. 32, subsec. 2, of the present Act, already referred to. The case is quoted in the great majority of mechanics\u2019 lien cases which have since come before the courts of the other provinces. The decision was unanimously approved by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in Polson v. Thomson[3], in 1916, and has nowhere, as far as I can discover, been disapproved or questioned.\nThe principle, as it was put by Middleton J., was that where one owner enters into an entire contract for the supply of material to be used upon several buildings, the claimant can ask to have his lien follow the form of his contract and that it be for an entire sum upon all the buildings, and that if the owner desires to invoke the statute to the extent of having the lien upon any building confined to the value of the material going into that building the onus is upon him to shew the facts which must be peculiarly within his own knowledge. \u201cFrom the nature of the contract,\u201d His Lordship held, \u201cthe onus is shifted.\u201d Manifestly the decision proceeded from a consideration of the contract between the parties as well as of the language of the section itself.\nIn his reasons the learned judge referred to three United States cases, viz: Livingston v. Miller[4]; Wall v. Robinson[5]; and Lewis v. Saylors[6], in all of which the same principle was applied. Livingston v. Miller4 was a decision of the Supreme Court of New York, expressly holding that a mechanics\u2019 lien for materials furnished for the erection of several houses for a gross sum attached to all the buildings. In Wall v. Robinson5, several buildings were built on one parcel of land, consisting, as here, of several lots, upon which the claimant performed labour under an entire contract for an entire price. The Massachusetts court held that the case was \u201cwithin the purpose of the statute and the intention of the Legislature\u201d because \u201cthe parties by their contract have connected the several buildings and treated them as one estate.\u201d The reason stated by the Massachusetts court seems to be the only logical ground upon which a general lien upon several separate buildings can be harmonized with the language of sec. 5 of the Ontario Act, and I have no doubt that Middleton J., in maintaining the lien, as he did, in the Ontario Lime case[7] as a general lien upon four separate houses, treated them as one property for the same reason.\nThe only difference between the language of sec. 5 of the present Act, as I have quoted it, and the language of sec. 6 of the Act of 1910, which Middleton, J., was required to construe, together with sec. 8, subsec. 1, is that the words \u201cthe estate or interest of the owner in,\u201d did not appear in sec. 6. They were contained, however, in sec. 8, subsec. 1, of the former statute which read:\u2014\nThe lien shall attach upon the estate or interest of the owner in the property mentioned in section 6.\nso that sec. 6 and subsec. 1 of sec. 8 of the former Act were precisely identical in their effect with sec. 5 of the present Act.\nIt is true that the contract in Ontario Lime Association v. Grimwood7 was a contract for materials only and that the principle affirmed by the decision is consequently confined to entire contracts for materials. The basis as well as the effect of the decision, however, clearly was that the words of the controlling section of the statute are to be interpreted in the light of the contract between the parties and that where the parties have, by entering into an entire contract, treated several buildings and lots as one property for the purpose of such contract, the courts may treat them likewise. If this be a correct exposition of the law, then manifestly the entire contract principle must apply quite as fully to entire contracts for the performance of labour or for the performance of labour and the furnishing of material, as to entire contracts for the supply of material only. The suggestion of greater difficulty on the part of the material dealer in identifying his material with the different buildings than on the part of one who contracts to provide labour in proving the value of the labour performed upon each house, does not touch the root of the principle of the decision. In Polson v. Thomson[8], in which, as already mentioned, the Manitoba Court of Appeal In 1916 expressly approved the decision of Middleton, J., the lien was for work, as it was also in the Massachusetts case of Wall v. Robinson[9] above cited, in which the entire contract principle was acted upon as far back as 1874.\nThe late Mr. Justice Grant, who wrote the reasons for the judgment now on appeal, refers to a case of Morris v. Tharle[10], in which the former Chancery Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario sustained a lien which seems to have been registered against two separate buildings for materials supplied for both of them. The only question argued in that case was whether the plaintiff, who had supplied the contractor with a variety of materials on a number of separate orders, was entitled to claim as upon one general account and thus avail himself of the delivery of the material upon the last order within 30 days of the registration of his lien to bring his whole account within the lien. The evidence shewed that before any of the materials were ordered the contractor had promised the plaintiff that he would get from him all material of the kinds in which the plaintiff dealt which he should require for the erection of the two houses. The Divisional Court (Boyd, C., and Ferguson, J.), on appeal from a contrary decision of Meredith, J., held, notwithstanding neither the quantities nor the prices of the different materials were defined until the different orders were given, and though the contractor\u2019s promise was not legally binding, that all deliveries were referable to an entire transaction for the supply of materials for the buildings in question, applying to the case the principle of a running bill with a tradesman as expounded by Pollock, C.B., in In re Aykroyd[11]. Although the case cannot be said to have expressly decided that a general lien could be maintained upon two separate houses belonging to the same owner for material supplied for use in their construction, for the reason that this question was not considered, the fact that it was not mooted either by counsel or in the reasons of the two eminent judges who took part in the judgment, notwithstanding the lien under review was a general lien claiming a general balance on two separate houses, has much significance. Moreover, the case does decide that in applying the Act the courts should have regard to the contract between the parties, under which the materials claimed for are furnished, and to the dealings between them in reference thereto.\nGrant, J.A., also refers in his reasons to the judgment of the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan delivered by Lamont, J., in Whitlock v. Loney[12], which was approved in Fulton Hardware Co. v. Mitchell[13], and which considered the question as to whether the materials claimed for in the lien under review were delivered under separate and distinct agreements or as upon a continuous account\u2014practically the same question dealt with in Morris v. Tharle[14]\u2014and for the same purpose, viz: to enable the plaintiff, by virtue of a delivery of materials under the last agreement within the prescribed 30 days of the registration of the lien, to bring earlier deliveries and his whole account within the lien. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the general balance due upon the whole account and sustained the lien for the entire balance.\nThat the courts in applying the statute by which such liens are created may and should have regard to the contracts between the parties under which the work or materials claimed for are provided, must, I think, now be taken as settled law. However difficult it may be to find a satisfactory basis for it in the words of the statute itself, the principle of applying the lien created by the Act as a general lien upon several buildings and lots belonging to the same owner as upon one property where the parties have by their contract so treated them\u2014in cases at least where the lots are contiguous\u2014has been so long and so generally recognized that it cannot at this time well be reversed. The respondent\u2019s lien must therefore be sustained.\nThere remains the question of priority as between the lien and the appellant\u2019s claim in respect of the moneys expended by him in completing the house 2-4 after he went into possession of it as assignee of the Ready Mortgage.\nSec. 7, subsec. 3, of the Act provides that where land, upon or in respect of which any work is performed or materials are furnished to be used, is encumbered by a prior mortgage existing in fact before any lien arises, such mortgage shall have priority over all liens under the Act to the extent of the actual value of such land at the time the first lien arose, such value to be ascertained by the judge or officer having jurisdiction to try the action, while sec. 13, subsec. 1, provides that the lien shall have priority over all judgments, executions, assignments, etc., issued or made after such lien arises and over all payments or advances made on account of any conveyance or mortgage after notice in writing of such lien to the person making such payments or after registration of a claim for such lien.\nThe intention of the Act, as disclosed by these two sections, was clearly to limit the security of a registered mortgage as against lien claims to the actual value of the property as at the time the first lien arose, and to exclude from the operation of that security all payments and advances made thereunder by the mortgagee after such lien claims have been registered.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the moneys expended in completing the house were not payments or advances within the meaning of sec. 13, subsec. 1, not having been made on account of the principal amount stated in the mortgage. The section does not say on account of the principal sum but on account of any conveyance or mortgage, and has the same effect, it seems to me, as if it had used the word \u201cunder\u201d or the words \u201cupon the security of.\u201d Payments and advances on account of the principal amount stated in the mortgage would unmistakeably be barred from priority in respect of the lien. To interpret the section as barring payments and advances made on account of the principal amount for which the mortgage is expressed to be a security, but not as barring payments or advances made under a covenant giving the mortgagee the right in certain contingencies to undertake the completion of the house for his own protection and to add the cost of doing so to his mortgage debt, would give a result which could hardly be said to accord with reason.\nThe fact that the moneys were paid by the appellant for the completion of the house in order to protect his security, while undoubtedly entitling him under the mortgage covenant on which he relies to add them to his mortgage debt as a further charge upon the land, would not in any event avail to give him priority over the liens for such payments in the face of the provisions of sec. 7, subsec. 3. This section, as already pointed out, limits the security of a prior registered mortgage as regards all liens to the actual value of the land at the time the first lien arose. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario expressly and, we think, rightly so held in Inglis v. Queen\u2019s Park Plaza Co. Ltd.[15].\nI therefore agree with the opinion of the Appeal Court that the respondent\u2019s lien is entitled to priority over the appellant\u2019s claim for this expenditure.\nAs to the objection that the respondent, not having brought an action to enforce his own lien, could not rely upon the statement of claim of another lien claimant (one Dorsy), which was dismissed by the Master, to hold his own lien, we think that Grant, J.A., in his reasons satisfactorily disposes of this also.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSubsequently the appellant moved for an order that, in so far as it affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which by a paragraph in its formal judgment gave the respondent priority over the prior mortgage originally held by Albrechtsen, the judgment delivered by this Court be varied, and that the appellant as prior mortgagee, having since the commencement of the action acquired the prior mortgage held by Albrechtsen on No. 2-4 Castleview Avenue, be found to be prior to the claim of the respondent, and to this extent the appeal be allowed.\nThe paragraph in the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal, above referred to, read as follows:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER DECLARE that the said Defendant, The Honourable Frank Carrel, having acquired since the commencement of this action by way of assignment a mortgage held by the Defendant, Oluf Albrechtsen, on the said corner building known as No. 2-4 Castleview Avenue, shall be entitled as a prior mortgagee to priority to the claims of all persons entitled to liens to the extent of his said mortgage, save and except the liens of Enoch Crummy, James Fiddes and Albert J. Jackson, trading as Fiddes & Jackson, and Albert A. Hart, whose said liens shall have priority over this said mortgage.\nS.A. Hayden for the motion.\nR. Kellock contra.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by SMITH J.\u2014The appellant moves to vary the reasons for judgment of this Court delivered the 28th of June, 1933, in so far as they affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which, by paragraph 1 (6) thereof, gave to the respondent Hart priority over the prior mortgage originally held by one Albrechtsen, assigned to the appellant since the commencement of this action.\nThe respondent Hart\u2019s claim to a lien is in respect of his contract entered into by him on September 20, 1929, to do brick work and supply brick for five double duplex houses on the north side of Castleview Avenue, which were numbered from east to west as 2-4, 6-8, 10-12, 14-16 and 18-20.\nOne Millie Guild purchased the land from one Watt and gave the mortgage registered No. 24677 W.A., dated 29th October, 1929, to one Alberta Gibbons, for $6,500, covering the corner lot, numbered 2\u20114, only. This mortgage was assigned on the same day to the appellant, and on the same day Millie Guild made a mortgage on No. 2-4, registered No. 24681 W.A., to William W. Watt, which mortgage was assigned by Watt on the 5th November, 1929, to one Oluf Albrechtsen.\nAt the same time Millie Guild made four separate mortgages on the other four buildings to William W. Watt, her vendor, and these four mortgages were all assigned to one Arthur.\nA joint stock company called City Duplexes, Limited, was then formed, and the whole property, subject to these mortgages, was transferred by Millie Guild to the company; and on the 13th December, 1929, this company made a mortgage to Luiggi Agnaluzzi and others, which mortgage covered the whole property, and was for $3,055. On the 5th February, 1930, they made another mortgage on the whole property to one Florence Ready, for $10,000, and this mortgage was assigned on the same day to Discount Limited, and again, on the same day, to the appellant.\nThe Albrechtsen mortgage, subsequent to the original judgment herein, namely, on the 19th February, 1932, was assigned to the appellant.\nBuilding loans were obtained on the westerly four houses by two mortgages to the Canada Life Assurance Co. for $22,000 each, and two with the Confederation Life Assurance Co. for $18,000 each, to which mortgages Ernest Arthur postponed his four mortgages referred to, and Albrechtsen, by a similar agreement, dated the 25th day of February, 1930, postponed his mortgage to the $10,000 mortgage given to Florence Ready on that date.\nThere was a provision in the Ready mortgage by which the mortgagee was entitled to make advances beyond the $10,000 for completion of the building in case the mortgagor should fail to complete same; and under this provision the appellant, as assignee of the mortgage, completed the building, advancing for that purpose some $12,500.\nThe Assistant Master had held that the respondent Hart was not entitled to any lien, but this was reversed in the Court of Appeal, which also held that Hart\u2019s lien had priority over the $12,500 advanced for completion of the building subsequent to the filing of the first lien, which judgment has been upheld by the judgment of this Court referred to.\nThe Court of Appeal also held, as stated above, that Hart\u2019s lien had priority over the Albrechtsen mortgage assigned to the appellant.\nThe appeal to this Court included an appeal against this finding of the Court of Appeal, but was not dealt with in the judgment handed down on the 28th June last.\nThis Albrechtsen mortgage and the four mortgages given to Watt and assigned to Arthur were all made and registered prior to the commencement of the building, and the learned Assistant Master holds that they were such, and that Arthur was entitled to priority to all the lien holders for his four mortgages, to the amount of $765.63 for each of the four parcels covered by his mortgages; and that Albrechtsen\u2019s mortgage on No. 2-4 is a prior mortgage, entitled to priority to all lien holders save Enoch Crummy and Fiddes & Jackson Ltd., to the amount of $8,600. He gives no reason for giving priority to Crummy\u2019s and Fiddes & Jackson Ltd.\u2019s liens over the Albrechtsen mortgage. Having held that the respondent had no lien, he, of course, did not deal with the question of priority as between Hart and the Albrechtsen mortgage. His reasons for giving priority to Crummy and Fiddes & Jackson Limited deal entirely with the question of their priority over the appellant as to the $12,500 advanced for completion of the building. There can be no doubt that the Albrechtsen mortgage, like the Gibbons mortgage for $6,800 and the Ready Mortgage for $10,000, were all prior mortgages originally, and entitled to priority over all liens; and the only ground upon which it is urged that its priority over Hart was lost is because of the agreement made by Albrechtsen postponing it to the Ready mortgage.\nThe same objection was raised to the four mortgages on the other properties that were assigned to Arthur; and as to them the point is dealt with in the Court of Appeal in the reasons of Mr. Justice Grant, as follows:\u2014\n\u201c(2) The learned Assistant Master erred in law in finding that the four mortgages of the mortgagee Arthur were prior to the lien holders to the extent of the value of the lands at the time the first lien arose.\u201d\nI have carefully read and considered the argument advanced in support of this point in the appeal, but am unable to give effect to it. I think the law is quite clear, and too well established to justify any interference with it at this time. The mortgages held by Arthur were given back to Watt the vendor to secure part of the purchase price of the land; Watt postponed his mortgages to mortgages which were given to The Canada Life Assurance Company and The Confederation Life Assurance Company which companies advanced moneys to enable buildings to be erected, but the postponements were not given for any other purpose, nor could they have any effect such as is contended for by this appellant. As to all other parties the mortgages held by Arthur stood just as they had stood originally and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, their postponement was for the benefit of those only who were thereby made first mortgagees upon the respective properties. It would be unjust and inequitable to find otherwise unless there was evidence establishing it; and no Court would hold otherwise unless the statute made it perfectly clear that such was intended. Upon this point, therefore, the appeal should be disallowed.\nIt is argued that this reasoning does not apply to the Albrechtsen mortgage, because of the advances made under the Ready mortgage to complete the building. I am quite unable to agree with this contention. The question of how the matter would have stood as between Albrechtsen and the appellant as assignee of the Ready mortgage is not involved in the question of priority as between Albrechtsen and Hart. Albrechtsen had priority from the first over Hart\u2019s lien, and he never surrendered any priority to Hart.\nI can see no distinction between the effect of the agreement by Albrechtsen and the agreement by Arthur. In neither case did these agreements confer any priority on Hart, who was no party to them, and who had no lien at the time they were made. For these reasons, I am of opinion that the appeal upon this branch of the case should be allowed, and the motion for the amendment of the judgment granted.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting on the question now dealt with)\u2014This is a motion to vary the judgment of this Court, delivered on June 28th last, so as to reverse that portion of the formal judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, which declares that the lien of the respondent, Hart, shall have priority over a mortgage which the appellant, Carrel, acquired by assignment from one, Albrechtsen, after the trial and pending the appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal.\nAs between Carrel and Hart, the argument in the Appeal Court, as in this Court, was principally directed to two main questions: first, the validity of the Hart lien, and second, the priority as between the lien and payments made by Carrel to the amount of over $12,000, under the terms of a mortgage acquired by him, as assignee, from one, Florence Ready, and registered prior to the lien\u2014payments made by him after the registration of the lien for the completion of a building on the land described.\nIn its reasons for judgment, written by the late Mr. Justice Grant, there was no reference to the question of priority as between these payments and the Albrechtsen mortgage, but this point was argued by counsel on the settlement of the minutes of judgment before the Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Masten, and decided in the respondent\u2019s favour by the inclusion in the formal judgment of the declaration objected to.\nThere is no doubt that the Albrechtsen mortgage, which was for $3,612.50, and originally made in favour of one Watt, and subsequently assigned by Watt to Albrechtsen, was registered before Hart\u2019s lien, and also before the Ready mortgage, and that up to February 25, 1930, the Albrechtsen mortgage was an encumbrance on the land prior to both the lien and the Ready mortgage. On that date, however, Albrechtsen executed an instrument under seal, by which he waived the priority to which he was then undoubtedly entitled, in favour of the Ready mortgage. By that instrument, which is called an Agreement Postponing Mortgage, and was registered on March 3rd\u2014two days after the registration of the Ready mortgage\u2014Albrechtsen covenanted and agreed with Ready that the Ready mortgage \u201cshall be an encumbrance upon the said lands prior to\u201d his mortgage \u201cin the same manner and to the same effect as if it had been dated and registered prior to the said firstly mentioned mortgage,\u201d and, in order to effectuate the same, he purported to grant and release unto Ready, in fee simple, all the land described therein with habendum to Ready, her heirs and assigns, subject only to a reservation of his right, as mortgagee of the equity of redemption subsequent to the Ready mortgage. By this document, therefore, he distinctly waived the priority to which he had been previously entitled, in favour of the Ready mortgage, whether in the hands of Ready or Carrel, as her assignee, or of any subsequent purchaser.\nIt is not questioned that as between the parties this document divested Albrechtsen of the priority to which he was entitled previously over the Ready mortgage, but it is contended that it was an agreement intended only for the benefit of the parties and one which could not enure to the benefit of subsequent lien-holders.\nIn my view the document operated to give to Ready and her assigns the right to have all claims under her or their mortgage satisfied in full before the Albrechtsen mortgage should rank upon the estate; and, as the Ready mortgage acquired by Carrel contained a provision making all advances which might be made by the mortgagee for the completion of the building part of the indebtedness under that mortgage, and as such, chargeable upon the land, Carrel thereby obtained the right to charge the land as against Albrechtsen and his assigns, not only with the $10,000 principal sum stated in the mortgage, but with the $12,000 (odd) which he advanced thereunder for the completion of the building. When, therefore, Carrel acquired from Albrechtsen his mortgage after the trial and pending the appeal, he acquired no priority that he did not at that time already possess, that having been fully secured to him by the so-called postponement agreement of February 25, 1930, and the assignment to him of the Ready mortgage. The only estate which Albrechtsen then had to convey was an estate subsequent to the Ready mortgage. The Ontario Court of Appeal held, and this Court affirmed its decision distinctly in that regard, that, Hart\u2019s lien having been filed before the payment of the $12,000 (odd) house completion moneys, he was entitled to priority over these advances under s. 13, subs. 1, of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act.\nThis Ready mortgage was also an encumbrance upon the land prior, in point of registration, to the Hart lien, but only to the extent of moneys which had been advanced prior to registration and notice of the lien claim. Hart by registration of his lien undoubtedly became entitled to rank for his lien immediately after the moneys which had actually been advanced under the Ready mortgage and before the moneys which were advanced thereunder after the registration of the lien. Was Carrel, by subsequently acquiring the Albrechtsen mortgage, entitled to divest the lien-holder of his priority over the $12,000 (odd) advance made by him under the terms of the Ready mortgage after registration and notice of the lien, to the extent of the full amount due under the Albrechtsen mortgage, in the face of the fact that when he took over the assignment of the latter mortgage it stood upon the records as a mortgage subsequent to the Ready mortgage? In my opinion he is not, and Hart\u2019s lien should have priority, not only over all advances made under the prior registered Ready mortgage after registration of the lien, but over the Albrechtsen mortgage, whose priority had been completely waived, in favour of the Ready mortgage, and the assignment of which conveyed to Carrel nothing but the right to rank upon the land after the Ready mortgage which he already possessed.\nI think that the declaration in the formal judgment of the Appeal Court that the Hart lien should have priority over the Albrechtsen mortgage is right and that the motion should be refused with costs.\nAppeal allowed in respect of issue raised by the motion; otherwise appeal dismissed.

Co., lost their lives when they went down a disused mine shaft on M. Co.\u2019s property in an attempt to rescue fellow employees who were overcome by gas in attempting to rescue children who while playing had gone into the shaft and been overcome by gas. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board disallowed appellants\u2019 claims for compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, N.B., 1932 c. 36, and its decision was affirmed by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (6 M.P.R. 120).\nHeld: \u201cMine rescue work,\u201d included (by s. 2 (m)) under the term \u201cMining\u201d in the Act, should not be construed as applying only to the occurrence of a peril which places in jeopardy the lives of miners in a mine which is in actual operation. There is no warrant for limiting the meaning of the words so as to exclude rescue in a mine shaft in which actual operations have ceased or been suspended, if circumstances arise to create a peril there; or so as to apply only to the rescue of miners.\n\u201cEmployment\u201d in s. 7 of the Act is not to be restricted to the actual particular work the workman is engaged to do. An accident is one \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d within the meaning of s. 7, which arises out of and in the course of anything the workman does which is reasonably incidental to such work. Also, a workman may be impliedly authorized in an emergency to do something which does not fall within the scope of his ordinary duties under his contract of service (Culpeck v. Orient Steam Nav. Co., 15 B.W.C.C. 187, at 189, and other cases cited). This principle, in its application, is not limited to emergencies in which the employer\u2019s property is involved. It applies to any emergency in which the interests of the employer are in any manner involved. The scope of employment, as indicated in the contract of service, may be impliedly enlarged by the occurrence of an emergency, and without any intervention on the part of the employer, and, if the employment is thus enlarged, anything which the workman does in such an emergency is to be deemed quite as much a part of his employment as if it were comprehended in the contract of service itself.\nThe Act should not be narrowly construed against workmen, but should be given a large and liberal construction in their interest (Gibbs v. Great Western Ry. Co., 12 Q.B.D. 208, at 211, cited).\nIn the present case, the vital question was, not whether the descending into the mine shaft was a duty which the appellants\u2019 husbands\u2019 contracts of service as coal miners imposed upon them, but whether, in going to and participating in the work of rescue which the mine manager had undertaken at the shaft, they were doing something which they were, expressly or impliedly, authorized to do. This question demanded consideration of the entire evidence regarding the employing company\u2019s responsibility for the condition of the idle shaft and the presence in it of noxious gas as well as its responsibility for the protection of that shaft as a source of danger, the giving of the alarm, the mine manager\u2019s participation in the work of rescue, his bringing employees to the scene of peril, and especially his directions as to summoning other employees from the neighbouring shafts. The question as to the appellants\u2019 husbands going to and participating in the rescue in consequence of orders or directions expressly given by the mine manager was entirely one of fact, upon which the Board had not made, and this Court was (under said Act) precluded from making, a finding. As the Board had misconstrued provisions of the Act and (in consequence) had ignored evidence that should have been considered, the case should be sent back to it for reconsideration in the light of this Court\u2019s holdings as to the true construction of s. 7 of the Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[2], dismissing (by a majority) the present appellants\u2019 appeals from a decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of New Brunswick disallowing (by a majority) the appellants\u2019 claims for compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Statutes of New Brunswick, 1932, c. 36, which claims were made by reason of the deaths, on July 28, 1932, of the appellants\u2019 husbands, who were miners in the employ of the Miramichi Lumber Co. Ltd. at Minto, New Brunswick, and who met their deaths while attempting to rescue two fellow employees who had been overcome by gas after entering a disused mine shaft on the said company\u2019s property in an attempt to rescue some children who had, while playing, entered the mine shaft and been overcome by gas.\nThe material facts of the case (as found by the Board) and the questions in issue on the appeal are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported and are indicated in the above headnote.\nSpecial leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nThe appeal was allowed with costs in this Court and in the Appeal Division, and the case sent back to the Board for reconsideration in the light of what this Court held to be the true construction of s. 7 of the Act.\nW. H. Harrison, K.C., for the appellants.\nN. B. Tennant for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCrocket J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2 dismissing the appeal of the appellants from a decision of the New Brunswick Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, disallowing their claims for compensation under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of that province for the deaths of their husbands. There was a division of opinion both in the Board and in the Appeal Division. The majority decision of the Board was that of the Chairman, Mr. Sinclair, and Mr. Steeves (though the latter was not present at the examination of the witnesses), with Mr. Doucet, the third member, dissenting, while the majority decision in the Appeal Court was that of Grimmer and Baxter, JJ., with Hazen, C.J., dissenting.\nThe Act allows an appeal from a decision of the Board only on a question as to its jurisdiction or on a question of law.\nThat the decision of the Board was primarily grounded upon the Chairman\u2019s view of the legal effect of the material provisions of the statute under which the compensation was claimed is conclusively shewn by a perusal of the written reasons which the Chairman has given for the Board\u2019s decision. He first says that the evidence seems \u201cto be quite clear and uncontradicted,\u201d and summarizes it in the following exceedingly brief statement of facts:\nSome children were playing on the property of the Miramichi Lumber Company at Minto. Apparently four of them attempted to climb down the ladder of an abandoned mine and on reaching the bottom were overcome by gas.\nThe alarm was given sometime between 11.30 or 12.00 o\u2019clock a.m., when the miners of the working pits were at dinner. Immediately a number of miners went to their rescue. A Mr. Tooke and Mr. Bauer were the first two to go down the disused shaft to rescue the children. They were both overcome by gas, then a Mr. Betts and a Mr. Gallant went down to help. Mr. Gallant got to the bottom of the pit and was overcome by the gas and did not survive. Mr. Betts attempted to climb out of the pit, but before he got to the top, fell and was killed; there can be no doubt he was killed by the fall which was caused by his being overcome by the gas.\nHe immediately proceeds:\u2014\nTo bring these claims, it must be shown that the deaths of Betts and Gallant were occasioned by an accident which arose out of and during the course of their employment.\nUnder the definition of \u201cMining,\u201d Mine Rescue is to be included as Mining, and the question at once arises, are the circumstances as set forth by the evidence \u201cMine Rescue\u201d.\nIt seems to me that before this question can be answered in the affirmative, certain conditions must be shown to have existed:\n1. There must be a mine in actual operation.\n2. There must have occurred some accident or happening that placed the lives of the miners in the mine in jeopardy. If those conditions existed and miners who were not working at the place where the accident happened went to the rescue of the imperilled miners and lost their lives, then their dependents would be entitled to compensation under the terms of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nIn this case, however, these conditions did not exist, the pit or shaft where the accident happened had been abandoned for a number of years. The children who entered the abandoned pit had no right there, and the first man (men) who entered the shaft (no doubt referring to Bauer and Tooke) did so, not to rescue miners, but the children, and did so of their own volition prompted simply by their humane desire to try and save these lives. If they had lost their lives as the result of their humane efforts, I do not see how this could come under \u201cMine Rescue,\u201d nor how the industry of Mining could be called upon to assume the cost of compensating their dependents.\nThe fact that Betts and Gallant may have gone to the rescue of their fellow workmen who had gone to the rescue of the children does not, to my mind, strengthen the cases for their dependents, consequently, I am forced to the conclusion that the deaths of Mr. Betts and Mr. Gallant were not caused by an accident arising out of and during the course of their employment, nor can the occurrences in any way be classed as \u201cMine Rescue\u201d.\nThe question as to the emergency to which the misfortune was primarily due being an accident within the meaning of the Act was not considered by the Board, nor was it considered or even so much as raised by counsel before the Court of Appeal, though Mr. Tennant now raises it on this appeal. Upon this question we have no doubt that the deaths of the applicants\u2019 husbands must be considered as accidental within the meaning of the governing section of the Act.\nIt will be observed that, while the Chairman finds that Tooke and Bauer entered the shaft to rescue the children of their own volition, prompted simply by their humane desire to save these lives, he makes no such finding in the case of Betts and Gallant, but simply states that the fact that they may have gone to the rescue of their fellow-workmen, who had gone to the rescue of the children, did not strengthen the cases for their dependents, and that, consequently, he was forced to the conclusion stated.\nThere can be no doubt that the Chairman construed \u201cmine rescue\u201d as applying only to the occurrence of a peril which places in jeopardy the lives of miners in a mine which is in actual operation, and held that for that reason Betts and Gallant could not be considered as engaged in \u201cmine rescue work\u201d at the time of their deaths. The only other reason suggested for the finding that the deaths of the deceased men were not caused by accident arising out of and in the course of their employment is that Tooke and Bauer, who entered the shaft before them, did so of their own volition, prompted simply by their humane desire to rescue the children, and that the fact that Betts and Gallant went down to rescue them, even though they were fellow-workmen, makes no difference. This is plainly itself a pure question of law, quite as much so as the question of the legal effect of the words \u201cmine rescue\u201d.\nAs to the question of the Board\u2019s construction of the words \u201cmine rescue\u201d, it should first be stated that these words appear only in the interpretation section of the Act, 2 (m). This reads simply: \u201c\u2018Mining\u2019 includes mine rescue work.\u201d S 3 (1) specifies the industries to which Part I of the Act, including s. 7, the governing section which gives the right to compensation, applies. S. 3 (1) begins: \u201cThis part shall apply to employers and workmen in or about the industries of lumbering, mining,\u201d etc., etc., and ends with the words: \u201cand any employment incidental thereto or immediately connected therewith\u201d, i.e., incidental to or immediately connected with any one of the industries named. S. 2 (m) was not in the original Act.\nWhatever effect the specific inclusion of \u201cmine rescue work\u201d in s. 3(1) may have, we are of opinion that there is nothing to warrant the limitation which the Board has placed on these words. In the absence of any definition in the statute itself they must be given their popular and ordinary meaning in relation to the industry of mining, as all other words and expressions in the Act, not specifically defined, must be construed in the same sense, i.e., in the sense in which they would be generally understood in the lay, as distinguished from the purely professional mind. See Fenton v. Thorley[3]; and Trim Joint District School Board v. Kelly[4]. Whether viewed, however, in the popular and ordinary, or in a technical, sense\u2014if they could in any way be said to have any technical meaning\u2014 we cannot see how they can properly be taken to exclude rescue in a mine shaft, in which actual operations have ceased or been suspended, if circumstances arise to create a peril there, or to apply only to the rescue of miners.\nThe Board, however, has not only found that Betts and Gallant were not engaged in mine rescue work within the meaning of the Act when they lost their lives, but that their deaths were \u201cnot caused by an accident arising out of and during the course of their employment\u201d, and this is really the decisive question. Ordinarily such a finding is a mixed question of law and fact, involving not only a conclusion upon the legal effect of the words contained in the phrase as it appears in the material section of the statute, but a consideration of the evidence adduced in support of the claim in question. Where, however, it involves no question as to the facts upon which it is based the question is entirely one of law. See Sparey v. Bath Rural District Council[5].\nAs appears from what has already been stated, the only fact found by the Board which bears upon this question, apart from the fact of the shaft in which the fatalities occurred being an abandoned mine, is that Bauer and Tooke, the first men to enter the shaft, did so of their own volition, prompted simply by their humane desire to try and save these lives. Whether the statement that \u201cthe fact that Betts and Gallant may have gone to the rescue of their fellow workmen who had gone to the rescue of the children does not, to my mind, strengthen the cases for their dependents\u201d implies that Betts and Gallant were also prompted simply by their humane desire to try and save the lives of their fellow workmen, and that this consideration also formed part of the basis of the Board\u2019s finding, it is evident from what has already been said that the finding is primarily based on the Board\u2019s construction of the meaning of the words \u201ccaused by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d, as contained in s. 7 of the Act, and that the finding cannot be supported on appeal if the construction which the Board has placed upon those words is erroneous. This is the vital point with which we are now concerned.\nAs the meaning of any phrase in a statute cannot be truly ascertained without looking at it closely in the context in which it is used and in the light of all other provisions of the statute bearing upon it, it is well that s. 7 should be fully set forth. It is as follows:\u2014\nWhen personal injury or death is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment in any industry within the scope of this Part (Part I), compensation shall be paid to such workman or his dependents * * * unless such injury was, in the opinion of the Board, intentionally caused by such workman, or was wholly or principally due to intoxication or serious and wilful misconduct on the part of the workman, or to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which the workman was employed.\nThe only other provision in the statute, material to the question, besides s. 2(m) and those which I have above quoted from s. 3(1), is that of s. 2(v), which is that \u201c workman\u201d includes a person who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship, written or oral, express or implied\u201d.\nIt is to be borne in mind, therefore, in the first place, that s. 7 and s. 3(1) with the words \u201cmine rescue work\u201d incorporated in it are to be read together, so that the concluding words of s. 3(1) \u201cand any employment incidental thereto or immediately connected therewith\u201d are to be deemed as being embodied in s. 7. This, I think, points directly against any intention to narrowly restrict the word \u201cemployment\u201d, as used in s. 7, to the workman\u2019s ordinary work as designated in his contract of service.\nIt may well be that the word \u201cemployment\u201d in s. 7 might prima facie point to employment as fixed by the contract of service, but that it was not intended to restrict it to that alone would appear to be conclusively indicated by the language of the proviso \u201cunless such injury * * * was wholly or principally due * * * to a fortuitous event unconnected with the industry in which the workman was employed.\u201d The last quoted words themselves imply that there may be an injury arising out of and in the course of a workman\u2019s employment within the meaning of the first part of the section, which is, not wholly or principally due, but in part due, to a sudden emergency, which may be outside the scope of a workman\u2019s ordinary work but connected with the industry in which he is employed; otherwise why except from the provisions of the preceding clause a fortuitous event \u201cunconnected\u201d with that industry? It is clear beyond all question that, so far as concerns the fortuitous event to which the injury claimed for may be in part due, it is not the particular workman\u2019s particular work with which it must be connected, but \u201cthe industry in which the workman was employed\u201d.\nNo such provisions as these are contained in the Imperial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and yet it has been laid down by the courts again and again that the words \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d, as they appear in the governing section of that Act, embrace, not only an injury to a workman which arises out of and in the course of the particular work indicated by his contract of employment, but any injury which arises out of or in the course of anything the workman does which is reasonably incidental to such work.\nTo limit \u201cemployment\u201d to the actual, particular work the workman is engaged to do, in this case, would be to limit it to the actual work of mining coal. Baxter, J., in his very exhaustive opinion in fact says: \u201cThe work which all these men were employed to do was to mine coal\u201d, but he adds: \u201cThe orders, express or implied, of the employer must be in relation to that occupation or the things incident to it,\u201d thereby fully recognizing the principle that not only the usual work of the workman is to be regarded but anything he may do which is incidental thereto. That learned Judge also quoted the dictum of Lord Atkinson in St. Helen\u2019s Colliery Co. v. Hewitson (1)[6], regarding the test which the latter said he had been rash enough to suggest, viz:\nthat a workman is acting in the course of his employment when he is engaged \u201cin doing something he was employed to do,\u201d or what is, in other and, I think, better words, in effect the same thing\u2014namely, when he is doing something in discharge of a duty to his employer, directly or indirectly imposed upon him by his contract of service.\nWith all deference, I venture to think that the learned Judge of the Appeal Division laid too much stress upon this dictum, and attached to it a narrower meaning than Lord Atkinson himself intended. The very illustrations the latter gives in the next following paragraph seem to me to shew that when he spoke of \u201cduty\u201d he had no thought of restricting its application to something the workman was actually obliged to do by his contract of service. \u201cFor instance\u201d, he says, haymakers in a meadow on a very hot day are, I think, doing a thing in the course of their employment if they go for a short time to get some cool water to drink to enable them to continue the work they are bound to do, and without which they could not do that work, and workmen are doing something in the course of their employment when they cease working for the moment and sit down on their employer\u2019s premises to eat food to enable them to continue their labours.\nWorkmen stopping work for the moment and going to get some cool water to drink or sitting down on their employer\u2019s premises to eat food cannot surely be said to be doing something in discharge of a duty to their employer either directly or indirectly imposed upon them by their contract of service, if the word \u201cduty\u201d is to be read in its strict literal sense; yet Lord Atkinson himself gives these very instances as instances of cases which would fall within the terms of his test.\nThere are numerous cases under the Imperial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as well as under the Imperial Employers\u2019 Liability Act, which the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act replaced, which shew that such statutes should not be narrowly construed against workmen, but that on the contrary they should be given a large and liberal interpretation in their interest. In Gibbs v. Great Western Ry. Co.[7], a case under the Imperial Employers\u2019 Liability Act (1880), Brett, M.R., used these words:\nThis Act of Parliament having been passed for the benefit of workmen, I think it is the duty of the court not to construe it strictly as against workmen, but in furtherance of the benefit which it was intended by Parliament should be given to them, and therefore as largely as reason enables one to construe it in their favour and for the furtherance of the object of the Act.\nFew instances furnish any better illustration of this principle than those given by Lord Atkinson of his own suggested test of the meaning of the words \u201carising out of and in the course of their employment\u201d. Suggested tests are, no doubt, often most useful as aids in solving the question involved, but the truth is, as Lord Dunedin put it, in Trim Joint District School Board v. Kelly[8], already cited, and referring to his own remarks in Plumb v. Cobden Flour Mills Co.[9], in which latter Lord Atkinson as well as Viscount Haldane, L.C., and Lord Kinnear concurred, \u201cthe ultimate criterion must always be found in the words of the Act itself, and not in tests, explanations, or definitions given by judges, however eminent\u201d, or, as Viscount Haldane in the same case said: \u201cHaving regard to the conflict which exists between judicial opinions expressed in some of the decided cases, the only safe guide appears to me to be the language of the Act of Parliament itself.\u201d\nIt goes almost without saying that it would be quite impossible for any one to devise any test which would apply to all of the many and differing cases which are constantly arising under Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts.\nMr. Justice Baxter, however, quotes in part a dictum from the opinion of Lord Macmillan in Sparey v. Bath Rural District Council[10], which seems to me to define in the clearest possible way the real issue which the Compensation Board had to consider in the case at bar, namely:\u2014\nThe question is whether the workman when he was injured was in his capacity as an employee doing something referable to his employment or was in his capacity as a citizen doing something independent of his employment.\nThis helpful dictum, however, does not attempt to define the scope of the word \u201cemployment\u201d, but the sentence immediately preceding it, with equal clearness, sheds valuable light upon the question of employment also. In this he says:\u2014\nThe place where an accident occurs to a workman is not the determining element in deciding whether it occurred in the course of the employment, though it may be a very important element, for the course of employment is not a matter of physical locality but of legal relationship.\nThere is no suggestion in the whole dictum of either narrowing or enlarging the meaning of the words \u201ccourse of employment\u201d as they stand in the statute. As to this, he points out, it is a question purely of legal relationship, dependent on considerations of various and differing facts and circumstances. The locus of the accident may be one, but it alone is not necessarily conclusive one way or the other. What the learned Lord says as to place, would obviously similarly apply as to time or any other fact bearing on the question of the scope of the workman\u2019s employment, such, for example, in the case of an attempted rescue, whether the person sought to be rescued was a fellow workman or a stranger to the employment in which he was engaged. In this view and having regard to the special provisions of the New Brunswick Act already discussed, I cannot for my part appreciate upon what logical ground the word \u201cemployment\u201d, as used in this Act, can be said to be limited to the particular work described in his contract of service.\nThat a workman may be impliedly authorized in an emergency to do something which does not fall within the scope of his ordinary duties under his contract of service must now, I think, be taken to be a settled rule of law. As Scrutton, L.J., said in Culpeck v. Orient Steam Navigation Co.[11]:\nThere have been many cases where the servant of the employer has done something quite outside his ordinary duties, but has done that something in his master\u2019s interests, as, for instance, in the case of a fire, or of a thief stealing ship\u2019s stores. There have \u2018been many cases where the action of the servant has been justified by the general duty of protecting his master\u2019s interests in an emergency, although he has embarked on work which he had not been specifically engaged to do.\nSee particularly Rees v. Thomas[12]; London & Edinburgh Shipping Co. v. Brown[13]; and Poland v. Parr[14].\nBaxter, J., suggests that this principle applies only to emergencies in which the employer\u2019s property is involved. With every respect, I think that the principle is not so limited, and that it applies to any emergency in which the interests of the employer are in any manner involved. No consideration of property was involved either in Culpeck v. Orient Steam Navigation Co.[15] or in London & Edinburgh Shipping Co. v. Brown[16]. The latter case was the case of a stevedore, entirely of his own volition and on his own suggestion, leaving his work on the quay, where he was employed, and going into the hold of a vessel where his work did not require him to go, for the purpose of rescuing a workman, engaged with another crew of men employed by the same employer, who had been overcome by noxious gas in the bottom of the hold. As in the case at bar, Brown was himself overcome and lost his own life. Why should the rule be limited simply to emergencies in which only property interests are involved? Surely an emergency which involves the lives of a foreman and other employees as well as those of children in a mine shaft which is in the control of the employer is of as much importance to the employer as the emergency of a horse running away, as was the case in Rees v. Thomas[17], or of a supposed intention on the part of a boy to steal a few handfuls of sugar from a truck moving along a public highway, as was the case in Poland v. Parr[18]. It is true, as the learned Judge of the Appeal Division points out, that in Poland v. Parr17, Atkin, L.J., in the course of his judgment, does say: \u201cAny servant is as a general rule authorized to do acts which are for the protection of his master\u2019s property \u201c, but a perusal of this judgment shews that the quoted statement is given as a mere illustration of the principle he was expounding. The essence of the judgment is to be found in the words: \u201cA servant may be impliedly authorized in an emergency to do an act different in kind from the class of acts which he is expressly authorized or employed to do.\u201d\nThe clear result of the cases, in my opinion, is that the scope of a workman\u2019s employment, as indicated in his contract of service, whatever it is, may be impliedly enlarged by the occurrence of an emergency without any intervention on the part of the employer, and that, if the employment is thus enlarged, anything which the workman does in such an emergency is to be deemed quite as much a part of his employment as if it were comprehended in the contract of service itself.\nIt is, of course, beyond question that the employer may himself either expressly or impliedly enlarge the scope of the workman\u2019s employment under his contract of service without regard to any question of emergency. He could not, of course, as Baxter, J., suggests, by doing so enlarge the scope of the word \u201cemployment\u201d, as used in the Act., but unless the Act itself restricts its scope so as to exclude anything which may be done under such express or implied authority\u2014which, I have already pointed out, it does not\u2014no such question as that suggested by His Lordship can arise.\nThe vital question raised by the claims is not whether the act of Betts and Gallant in descending into the mine shaft was a duty which their contract of service as coal miners imposed upon them, as the Board manifestly assumed, but whether, in going to and participating in the work of rescue which the mine manager had undertaken at the shaft, they were doing something which they were either expressly or impliedly authorized to do.\nIt is apparent that the proper solution of this question demands consideration of the entire evidence regarding the company\u2019s responsibility for the condition of the idle shaft and the presence in it of the noxious gas as well as its responsibility for the protection of that shaft as a source of danger; the giving of the alarm, the participation of the mine manager in the work of rescue, his bringing Bauer and other employees to the scene of the peril, and especially his directions as to the summoning of other employees from the neighbouring shafts. It is equally apparent from its decision that the Board ignored all such evidence, though it states that the evidence seemed to be clear and uncontradicted, and, we think also, from an examination of the entire evidence as contained in the appeal book, that the case was one in which the Board might well have found that the deaths of the applicants\u2019 husbands were caused by accident arising out of and in the course of their employment within the contemplation of the Act.\nIn the view I take of the case, it is needless to discuss the cases of Jones v. Tarr[19], or Mullen v. Stewart[20], which were so strongly relied upon by the respondent\u2019s counsel, further than to say, that they, like the cases relied upon by the appellant\u2019s counsel regarding the rule as to the occurrence of an emergency extending the scope of a workman\u2019s employment, all lacked the important feature which the case at bar presents with respect to the employer himself intervening in the emergency and summoning his employees from the scene of their work to take part in the rescue work.\nI should have no hesitation in holding, in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, that if the mine manager was responsible for the summoning of the unfortunate men from the scene of their work to help in the work of rescue, which he was directing as the manager of the mining company, their deaths while participating in the work of rescue were caused by accident arising out of and in the course of their employment within the contemplation of the Act. The difficulty is that this particular question as to their going to and participating in the rescue in consequence of orders or directions expressly given by the mine manager is entirely a question of fact, upon which, in the absence of a finding by the Board, we are precluded, we think, on such an appeal as this from ourselves making any such finding, notwithstanding the Board\u2019s statement that the evidence is uncontradicted.\nAfter much anxious consideration of this aspect of the case, I have concluded that all we can do is to send the case back to the Board for reconsideration in the light of what we have here held to be the true construction of s. 7 of the statute.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this Court and in the Appeal Division.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and judgment in the terms indicated.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Weldon & McLean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Nigel B.

The impact rendered M. unconscious and injured W., an occupant, and damaged the car. M. testified that he was driving that night at 15 to 18 miles per hour. W. sued appellant and M. for damages. The trial judge, in charging the jury, said: \u201cThere is no suggestion, apparently, that he was going too fast, that is, that he was exceeding any speed limit; and there is no evidence as to just how fast he was going when he went down Bathurst St. So that I think, on the whole, you may take it safely for granted that there is no evidence that he was going too fast, either in exceeding the definite speed limit, or under the circumstances.\u201d The jury found that the accident was not caused by negligence of M., and the action was dismissed. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. Appellant appealed.\nHeld: The above facts in evidence constituted evidence that should have been considered by the jury as to whether or not M. was driving too fast under the circumstances (Tart v. Chitty, 102 L.J.K.B. 568; Baker v. Longhurst, 102 L.J.K.B. 573), and should have been directed to their attention; and the above quoted part of the charge amounted to a withdrawal of those facts from their consideration, and was a misdirection, involving a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the plaintiff\u2019s case was not properly submitted to the jury; therefore it was proper to order a new trial, notwithstanding that no objection was taken at the trial to the charge.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Ristow from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario granting a new trial to the plaintiffs upon their appeal from the judgment of Kerwin J. dismissing the action upon a jury\u2019s finding. The action was for damages for injury to the plaintiff Helen Wetstein caused by the collision of a motor car, in which she was riding, with a steel post, on September 4, 1932, in Toronto, Ontario. The motor car was being driven by the defendant McIntyre and was owned by the defendant. (appellant) Ristow. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported, The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nT.J. Agar, K.C., for the appellant.\nI. Levinter for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The action was brought on behalf of the infant respondent by her next friend for damages sustained by her while being driven in a motor car owned by the appellant and driven by one McIntyre.\nThe infant, seventeen years of age, was sitting in the front seat with the driver, and a Mr. Brown and Miss Kosky were in the rear seat. The party was returning from Swansea into the city of Toronto about 3.30 in the morning of the 4th of September, 1932, in a heavy rainstorm. They drove along Dundas street and turned to the right into Bathurst street, and McIntyre says that \u201csix or seven\u201d or \u201cfour or five\u201d doors south of Dundas street, or \u201cmidway between that block\u201d, he ran into the steel post of the Toronto Transportation Commission, which is about four inches inside of the curb, that is, to the right of the travelled part of the highway. He says that on that particular night it had been raining all night, and that it was one of the worst rainstorms during the year. Visibility was very poor at the time of the accident, the windows of the car were closed; the wiper worked sometimes, and sometimes you had to start it off with your hand. Visibility on the right hand side of the car was poor, and it was difficult to see the curb, and he says that he was driving that night at from fifteen to eighteen miles per hour. He further says that the impact was so severe that his chest broke off the steering wheel, and he was \u201cknocked out\u201d temporarily, so that he did not know what happened to the other occupants of the car until he went to the hospital. He further states that the radiator of the car was damaged and had to be replaced, and that the cross members of the chassis, which are heavy pieces of material, were bent. The infant respondent had some teeth knocked out, others loosened, and sustained cuts and scars about the face, limbs and body.\nThe questions put to the jury, with the answers, were:\n(1) Was the accident caused by the negligence of the defendant McIntyre? A. No.\n(2) If so\u2014that is, if you think it was caused by McIntyre\u2019s negligence\u2014wherein did such negligence consist? No answer.\n(3) Was the motor vehicle in McIntyre\u2019s possession without Ristow\u2019s consent? No answer.\nThe jury was directed that if they answered \u201cNo\u201d to the first question, they need not answer the others.\nOn the answer to the first question, judgment was entered, dismissing the action with costs.\nAn appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal, which ordered a new trial, and from that judgment the defendant Ristow brings this appeal.\nIt is argued upon behalf of the appellant that the finding of the jury in favour of the defendant and dismissal of the action upon that finding constitute a right which can only be interfered with on proper legal grounds. The grounds for a new trial set out in the Court of Appeal are that the accident\nmay have been caused by the defective condition of the car, the wiper or the steering gear not working properly, and a question as to the car\u2019s condition should have been submitted to the jury;\nand\na further question should also have been submitted to the jury as to whether McIntyre was using the car with the consent of Ristow. The latter question was submitted to the jury, but not answered, in view of the answer to the first question.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel contends that the failure to submit a question to the jury as to the condition of the car does not in law constitute a ground for a new trial, as no request was made to have such a question submitted, and no objection was made to the questions as submitted.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, further found that there had been a mistrial.\nLooking at the learned judge\u2019s charge to the jury, he said:\nThere is no suggestion, apparently, that he was going too fast, that is, that he was exceeding any speed limit; and there is no evidence as to just how fast he was going when he went down Bathurst street. So that I think, on the whole, you may take it safely for granted that there is no evidence that he was going too fast, either in exceeding the definite speed limit, or under the circumstances. This, to my mind, is a clear misdirection. The evidence quoted above surely constitutes evidence that should have been taken into consideration by the jury as to whether or not the driver was going too fast under the circumstances. The great force of the impact, as disclosed by the result, is cogent evidence as to the speed, and the speed at which a car should be driven depends upon the circumstances. Here, the driver had difficulty in seeing where he was going, by reason of the conditions, and he does not say that he reduced speed, or took any precautions in view of these prevailing conditions. He ran into this steel post, off the travelled highway, without having seen it at all, with the force indicated by the results. The learned judge\u2019s charge amounted to a withdrawal from the consideration of the jury of the most vital facts established by the evidence in favour of the plaintiff\u2019s case. If the jury had given an affirmative instead of a negative answer to the first question, and in answer to the second question had said that McIntyre was driving too fast under the conditions of invisibility that prevailed, could a Court of Appeal have set aside a judgment for the plaintiff on such answers? In other words, could it have been contended that there was no evidence upon which the jury could reasonably base such answers? It seems clear that such findings on this evidence could not have been disturbed.\nAs to the cogency of the evidence which the learned judge told the jury that they might disregard, some recent cases in England may be cited:\nIn Tart v. Chitty & Co.[1]: After lighting up time, a wagon pulled up in a street fourteen feet wide, nine inches from the curb, the rear light having gone out. It was raining, and a motor cyclist, whose light threw a beam fifteen yards, crashed into the back of the wagon, and sustained injury. The County Court Judge held that defendants\u2019 servants were negligent, but that defendants had not shown that the plaintiff was negligent. On appeal, held:\nThat there was no evidence upon which a judgment could be founded that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. Either he did not keep a proper lookout, or he was travelling at such a speed that he was unable to stop his motorcycle or to swerve so as to avoid the collision. Butterfield v. Forrester[2] and Page v. Richards and Draper[3] followed.\nIn Baker v. Longhurst & Sons Ltd.[4]: A person driving at night must drive at such a speed that he can pull up within his limits of vision; accordingly, on his colliding with anything, he is faced with the dilemma that either he was driving at an undue speed or he was not keeping an adequate lookout, unless there is some other factor causative of the collision. In this case a horse tip-cart proceeding on its near side of the road at night, but without a light, was run into from behind by a motor-cyclist. In an action brought by the plaintiff against the owner of the cart for damages, based on the negligence of the driver of the cart in being without a light, the plaintiff said that his speed was 15-20 miles per hour, and that he could stop easily within ten yards. The beam of his lamp showed thirty yards ahead. He said that he never actually saw that it was a cart. He saw a dark object loom up, and swerved to avoid it:\u2014Held, that the plaintiff, when proving the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servant, had established his own contributory negligence and, there being no contest of fact, judgment must be for the defendants.\nIn the present case the learned judge, instead of, in effect, withdrawing from the consideration of the jury evidence of the most vital kind on the question of the driver\u2019s negligence, should have directed their attention to the evidence bearing on that question; that is, to the evidence that the driver ran off the travelled highway and into the post without seeing it at all; that he was driving that night under the conditions described at 15 to 18 miles per hour and does not say that he reduced speed when unable to see clearly, and that he struck the post with the force and results mentioned.\nThere was a complete failure to direct the attention of the jury to this evidence on which a finding of negligence on the part of the driver might have been properly based, and in addition there was an express direction that the jury might disregard the most vital part of it. This was misdirection involving a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the plaintiff\u2019s case was not properly submitted to the jury. A new trial was therefore properly ordered, notwithstanding the fact that no objection was taken to the charge.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Agar & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Luxenberg & Levinter.\n[1] (1931) 102 L.J.K.B. 568.\n[2] (1809) 11 East. 60.\n[3] (1920) (unreported).\n[4] (1932) 102 L.J.K.B. 573-C.A.\n"}

Act, 1867, s. 108, and third schedule.\nHeld, that Goderich Harbour, located at the mouth of the river Maitland, in Ontario, was (applying the test stated in Atty. Gen. for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co., [1919] A.C. 999, at 1004, and upon the evidence), at the time of Confederation, a \u201cpublic harbour\u201d within the meaning of the 3rd schedule to the B.N.A. Act. (Duff C.J. refrained from deciding whether, in view of a certain lease, the harbour was, at Confederation, part of the \u201cpublic works\u201d or \u201cpublic property\u201d of the province, within s. 108 of the Act; consideration of this question being unnecessary in view of the ground of decision, of the appeal).\nBut held that, on the evidence, it was not established that Ship Island (the land in question) was, at the time of Confederation, a part of the harbour, or a \u201criver improvement\u201d within said schedule; and therefore it could not be said that the island became the property of Canada under s. 108 of the Act.\nCertain questions discussed, as to what forms part of a \u201cpublic harbour\u201d (and as to circumstances to be considered), and as to what would come under the designation of \u201criver improvement,\u201d and authorities referred to. (Per Duff C.J.: The several descriptions in the schedule are not to be narrowly construed or applied\u2014citing Att. Gen. of Ontario v. Mercer, 8 App. Cas. 767, at 778. Where there is a \u201criver improvement\u201d in the form of a definite physical structure consisting of a principal part and auxiliary or subsidiary works, the whole would pass and with it a title, at least, to so much of the site and of the subsoil as might be regarded as reasonably necessary to give the Dominion free scope for the complete discharge of the responsibilities it was expected to assume touching such works.).\nAnd held further, that a certain patent of lease made in 1862, under which the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada claimed title by reason of a conveyance to it in 1927 of the lessee\u2019s rights, did not, on the description in the lease, include Ship Island.\nThe judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Maclean J.\u2014[1933] Ex. C.R. 44), that the title to the island was vested in the Crown in right of the Province of Ontario, subject to its lease (made in 1929) to respondent Forrest, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General of Canada, as representing the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada, from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the title to Ship Island, situated in the river Maitland, near its mouth, and in what is known as the Harbour of Goderich, in Ontario, was, prior to the taking thereof by the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada on October 4, 1929, under the Expropriation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 64), vested, not in the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada, but in the Crown in right of the Province of Ontario, subject to a lease dated August 16, 1929, in favour of the defendant Forrest.\nThe facts and circumstances of the case, and issues in question, are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nGlyn Osier, K.C., and D. Guthrie for the appellant.\nA. G. Slaght, K.C., and W. G. Pugsley, K.C., for the respondent Forrest.\nJoseph Sedgwick, K.C., for the respondent Attorney-General of Ontario.\nDuff C.J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of my brother Rinfret, but I think it advisable to make some observations upon one or two points raised by the appeal.\nThe first of these concerns the effect of the lease of 1862 from the Crown to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Co. An intelligent discussion, however brief, can only proceed with the pertinent provisions of the lease before us. I, therefore, quote them:\n* * * provide sufficient accommodation in the Inner Harbour of Goderich aforesaid for the largest vessels navigating Lake Huron and shall establish and maintain during the period of this demise a facile and safe entrance or channel into the Inner Harbour aforesaid for such vessels as aforesaid and whether by the erection and maintenance of piers or otherwise with a depth in such channel sufficient for the safe entrance of the vessels aforesaid, and also shall and do at their like risk, cost, charges and expense from time to time and at all times during the term hereby granted well and sufficiently repair, uphold, maintain and keep the said wharves and piers, channel and Inner Basin in good, substantial and sufficient repair and fit proper and accessible for the safe landing of passengers and for the discharge of vessels and steamers and the landing and warehousing of goods and passengers therefrom. AND upon this further condition that the Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Company and their Successors shall when and so often from time to time as they may contemplate any alterations, improvements or additions at the said Harbour or at the Wharves or Piers connected therewith or constituting part of the same, submit the same and the plans, diagrams and specifications thereof respectively to the Commissioner of Public Works and the Commissioner of Crown Lands and shall not commence or proceed with the said alterations, improvements or additions or prosecute, carry out or complete the same or any part thereof without the approval of the Commissioner of Public Works and the Commissioner of Crown Lands respectively. AND FURTHER that the Commissioner of Public Works and the Commissioner of Crown Lands or either of them and their Engineers, Architects and other Officers and Servants may from time to time during such periods of alterations, improvements or additions and at all times whatsoever have free access to at and from the said Harbour, Wharves or Piers connected therewith or constituting part of the same and to examine and view the state and condition of repair and of the navigation of the same as the case may be and that all such alterations, improvements and additions shall be executed to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Public Works. AND upon this further condition that the said Company and their Successors shall and do permit and suffer foot passengers and other persons to use the said wharves or piers for the purpose of air and exercise or upon other lawful and reasonable occasion at any time or times without charge and also shall and do permit and suffer passengers to land at the said wharf or pier from any boat, ship or vessel with their personal baggage or luggage without charge. AND also upon condition that the said Company and their Successors shall demand and receive reasonable wharfage dues only for or in respect of goods and merchandise landed at or shipped from the said intended wharves or piers, and shall upon no account exact unreasonable or exorbitant dues for the same and that the same dues shall be in accordance with any Statute of Our Province of Canada passed in reference to the said Harbour and now of full force and effect, or hereafter to be passed and that in default of any such Statute as hereinbefore mentioned then that such dues only shall be received and collected by the said Company and their Successors as have been, in a Table thereof submitted to and approved by Our Governor General in Council. AND upon this further and express condition that in default of all or any of the conditions, provisoes, limitations and restrictions these Our Letters Patent and the demise lease and the term hereby granted and everything herein contained shall be and We do hereby declare the same to be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever and that the land and premises hereby demised and leased and every part and parcel thereof shall revert to and become vested in Us, Our Heirs and Successors in like manner as if these Our Letters Patent had never been granted, or the lands and premises hereby demised, anything herein contained to the contrary thereof notwithstanding.\nOn behalf of the Attorney-General for Ontario, it is argued that the harbour in question, in view of this lease, cannot fall within the description \u201cpublic harbour\u201d or, as it was put by counsel, it is a \u201cprivate harbour\u201d.\nIt is very clearly not a \u201cprivate harbour\u201d in the ordinary sense of these words. The public rights of navigation are not in any manner affected by the lease. On the contrary, the purpose of the lease is plainly to improve the capacity of the harbour for the purposes of navigation and commerce and to provide facilities for the exercise of the public rights in respect thereto. Power is reserved, it is true, to exact reasonable tolls under the supervision of the Crown in respect of the landing of goods but the seisin of the bed of the harbour and the shore remain in the Crown subject to the term of years granted.\nGoderich Harbour was, on the 1st of July, 1867, a harbour to which the public had the right to resort and did resort for commercial purposes, and it would appear, therefore, that it satisfied the criteria laid down in Attorney-General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co.[2].\nBut another condition must be present before s. 108 can take effect. That section applies only to public harbours which on that date were part of the \u201cpublic works\u201d or \u201cpublic property\u201d of the province. Whether on that date Goderich harbour as a whole was, and whether the particular parts of it (alleged to be so) in question were, in view of the lease to the Railway Company, part of the \u201cpublic property\u201d or \u201cpublic works\u201d of the province in the sense of s. 108, it is not necessary to consider; and I desire to reserve that point in the most complete sense until it arises for determination.\nThe next topic concerns the particular locality in respect of which the dispute arises. First of all, I wish to reserve the question whether, if it had been established as a fact that prior to and up to the 1st of July, 1867, fishermen had been permitted to use Ship Island for the purpose of wintering their boats there (that is to say, boats used for fishing in Lake Huron), that would not have been some evidence of the fact that this piece of Crown property had been recognized as part of the \u201cpublic harbour\u201d. Then, much attention was given in argument to the icebreaker which had, at one time, been placed across the branch of the river between Ship Island and the main land. As to the purpose of this icebreaker, we are not left in doubt. It is explained in the following paragraph given in the report of the Commissioner of Public Works for the year 1861:\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the principle adopted in the construction of this harbour is to convert the extensive flat at the mouth of the river, some 20 acres in extent, into an inner basin, to have a depth of 14 feet water; the entrance to it being between two piers, with which considerable progress has been made. The width between the piers at the narrowest part is 170 feet. Vessels wintering in this harbour ran considerable risk in spring, from the ice carried down on the breaking up of the winter, by which a steamer was, in 1859, carried out and lost. To obviate this, the company have had an ice-breaker, of considerable extent, constructed across one of the branches of the river, which effectually answers its purpose.\nAn ice-breaker constructed for such a purpose might, according to the circumstances, be regarded as a part of the harbour works, that is to say, a part of the harbour, but, whether or not a part of the harbour, it would most assuredly fall within the description of \u201criver improvement\u201d as employed in the third schedule. I do not doubt, moreover, that, if there was a cribwork on Ship Island which was an integral part of the ice-breaker, or if merely intended to give the ice-breaker additional resistance against the impact of flood or ice, such cribwork would form part of the \u201criver improvement\u201d. I must not be understood as attempting to expound the scope of the phrase \u201criver improvement\u201d, but such a work as that under consideration devised for the protection of the harbour works and the shipping in the harbour from the force of the waters and the ice of the river is, in the strictest sense, a work for the improvement and protection of navigation and, in my view, plainly a \u201criver improvement\u201d within the meaning of the B.N.A. Act, if the other condition be satisfied, viz., that the work is part of the \u201cpublic property\u201d or a \u201cpublic work\u201d of the province. This brings me to one or two general observations which I desire to add respecting the construction and effect of s. 108 and of the third schedule. One observation of the first importance I make in the form of an adaptation of Lord Selborne\u2019s words in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Mercer[3],\nThe general subject * * * is of a high political nature; it is the attribution of royal territorial rights for purposes of * * * government.\nIt follows, I should think, that the several descriptions in the schedule are not to be narrowly construed or applied.\nIt is still more important to notice that the judgment of Lord Herschell in the Fisheries case[4] dealt only in a very restricted way with what would be comprised in a public harbour transferred by force of the statute. Their Lordships declined to define, or even to describe, \u201cpublic harbours\u201d and, indeed, their Lordships confined their opinion to one particular question, viz., the decision in Holman v. Green[5], in which this court had held that a foreshore bordering on a public harbour, if it was the property of the Crown, passed de jure. Their Lordships indicated circumstances in which, in their opinion, a foreshore would pass; if it had been used for anchoring ships or landing goods: but these conditions are only mentioned by way of example, and it is most important to note that they are strictly confined to the matter of the foreshore.\n\u201cForeshore\u201d was treated as employed in the strict technical sense. Mr. Blake, speaking for the Province of Ontario, on that ground declined to discuss the validity of Holman v. Green5, which was left to Mr. Longley who represented Nova Scotia. The reason which led their Lordships to limit themselves so strictly to dealing with the subject of public harbours is, no doubt, to be found in the argument. Mr. Blake pointed out the almost insuperable difficulty of discussing the subject usefully in view of the absence of any information as to the nature of the harbours in Canada at the date of Confederation; and their Lordships naturally confined themselves to the concrete question presented by the decision in Holman v. Green[6]. Indeed, in the formal answer expressed in the Order in Council, their Lordships limited themselves even more strictly. The answer is in these terms:\n* * * whatever is properly comprised in the term \u201cpublic harbours\u201d became the property of the Dominion of Canada; and that the answer to the question, what is properly so comprised, must depend, to some extent, upon the circumstances of each particular harbour.\nAttorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[7] was concerned with the title to a very limited part of the foreshore of Burrard Inlet. In that case, evidence was adduced to show that the part of the Inlet adjacent to the part of the foreshore in controversy was in use for harbour purposes in the strictest sense, and the foreshore also, at and prior to the date of the admission of British Columbia into the Union. The finding of fact in that case was based upon that evidence.\nAttorney-General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co.[8] elucidates the matter somewhat further. It was held there that a harbour, in order to fall within the class \u201cpublic harbour\u201d in the relevant sense, must be one to which ships had the right to resort for harbour purposes and did so resort at the pertinent date; but the decision says nothing whatever which can assist you in determining what are and what are not the constituent parts of what is admittedly a \u201cpublic harbour\u201d, for the purpose of precisely ascertaining the subjects that passed under that designation.\nOne consideration that ought not to be lost sight of is that an important reason for vesting in the Dominion public harbours and river improvements was that the Dominion, charged with exclusive jurisdiction regarding trade and commerce, navigation and shipping, lighthouses, buoys, the regulation of sea coast and inland fisheries was, no doubt, expected to assume the burden of maintaining navigation works, harbour works and river improvements such as, at all events, we are concerned with here.\nNo case has, prior to this, so far as I know, arisen respecting harbour works, works for facilitating the use of the harbour, for protecting the harbour and so on. I am inclined to think it would be difficult to find an adequate ground for contending that such works did not pass under the statute. Indeed, so much appears to have been conceded in the Fisheries case[9] by the provinces.\nAs to river improvements, to adapt the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Fisheries case9, there would appear to be \u201cno doubt that whatever is properly comprised in this term became vested in the Dominion of Canada\u201d. I cannot doubt that, where you have a \u201criver improvement\u201d in the form of a definite physical structure consisting of a principal part and auxiliary or subsidiary works, the whole would pass and with it a title, at least, to so much of the site and of the subsoil as might be regarded as reasonably necessary to give the Dominion free scope for the complete discharge of the responsibilities it was expected to assume touching such works. I reserve in the fullest degree the question whether the title to the subsoil ad centrum would pass.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith, Cannon, Crocket and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The question to be determined in this appeal is whether His Majesty the King in right of the Dominion of Canada (who is the Appellant) is entitled to a small island about one acre in extent, known as Ship Island, in the harbour of Goderich, either in fee simple, or as assignee of the tenant for the remainder of a term of ninety-nine years created by a lease dated the 2nd day of June, 1862.\nThe Attorney-General of Ontario claims that Ship Island never vested in the Dominion. The respondent Forrest claims as lessee of the Crown in right of the province of Ontario, and also by prescription and possession as against the rights of the tenant under the lease of June, 1862.\nThe Appellant was proceeding to remove Ship Island for the purpose of improving Goderich Harbour, when His contractor was restrained by an interim ex parte order of the Supreme Court of Ontario, at the instance of the respondent Forrest. The Appellant thereupon commenced this action, claiming a declaration of his rights, or, in the alternative, the usual declaration of vesting under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64. The learned President of the Exchequer Court delivered judgment on the 22nd December, 1932[10], holding that the title to the island was vested in the Crown in right of the province of Ontario, subject to the lease to the respondent Forrest, and that the province and Forrest are accordingly entitled to compensation for the taking thereof.\nHis Majesty the King in right of the Dominion of Canada appeals from this judgment.\nGoderich Harbour is located at the mouth of the river Maitland which flows into Lake Huron. At the period of time material to this case, the river wound its way to the lake through a series of islands, one of which was Ship Island. As observed by the trial judge, it may be assumed that the other islands \u201cwere of alluvial origin\u201d; but Ship Island was of a different character. The evidence shows that it was high and dry land for at least a century. It stands at from two to five feet, on its easterly side, to from five to twelve feet, on the westerly side, above the level of the present high water mark in the harbour. It is covered with old trees (elm, basswood, black cherry, etc.), some of them as much as two feet or twenty inches in diameter. From the geological nature of the island, it may be asserted that it was not covered by water at any time within seventy-five or one hundred years back.\nAs land or public property situate within the territory known as Upper Canada before Confederation, there is no question that, under sections 109 and 117 of the B.N.A. Act, Ship Island, subsequent to the coming into force of the Act, remained part of the demesne lands of the Crown belonging to the province of Ontario, and that province retained it as its public property \u201csubject to any trusts existing in respect thereof and to any interest other than that of the province in the same\u201d.\nIt was therefore incumbent upon the Appellant to show that the island had ceased to form part of the public property of the province and had become vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada; and, unless it be established that it passed out of the domain of the province, either through the operation of some statutory enactment, or by the effect of a deed conveying the title in whole or in part, it must be decided that Ship Island is still vested in the province of Ontario, and the judgment a quo must be confirmed.\nThe Appellant claimed title both ways:\n(a) As a tenant through and under a patent of lease dated the second day of June, 1862, from the Crown to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, all rights thereunder having been conveyed to the Appellant by a quit claim deed dated January 19, 1927;\n(b) As owner of the fee by reason of the provisions of section 108 of the B.N.A. Act, the Appellant contending that Ship Island formed part of a public harbour on July 1, 1867; or, in the alternative, that it was on that date a river and lake improvement within the meaning of that section and the schedule thereto.\nThe action was tried and is submitted to us only on the question of title, and the judgment is therefore limited to that issue. It will be convenient to examine each of the Appellant\u2019s contentions in the order in which they are stated.\nThe property leased to the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company, in 1862, is described in the patent of lease:\nall those parcels of land covered with water situate in the townships of Goderich and Colborne in the County of Huron in our said Province of Canada, being the water lots in front of the town of Goderich in Lake Huron and extending half a mile to the south and north of the River Maitland together with the water lots in the said River extending from Lake Huron up the said river one mile and seven-eighths of a mile to opposite the northeast corner of the said Town of Goderich that is to say: (N.B. The patent then proceeds to define the water lots by metes and bounds).\nAs will be noticed, the lease from the Crown is a lease of \u201cwater lots\u201d. They are \u201cwater lots\u201d in Lake Huron, or \u201cwater lots\u201d in the river Maitland, but only \u201cwater lots\u201d. They are expressly designated as \u201cparcels of land covered with water\u201d. The Crown lease contains a complete and minute definition of the metes and bounds, which we do not deem it necessary to set out here in full, but in which, with regard to the locus in quo, the lots are referred to as being\nalong the water\u2019s edge of the River Maitland along the Goderich side thereof to Lake Huron.\nWe find it impossible to bring Ship Island within the description of the leased property, and we agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that, upon the terms of the patent, Ship Island was not included in the grant. It may be mentioned that on June 14, 1859, and on February 17, 1865, agreements were made between the Canada Company and the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company whereby the former sold and conveyed to the latter all its rights and interest under patents or grants previously issued by the Crown to it; but with regard to Ship Island these agreements did not carry the Buffalo Railway Company any further than the lease from the Crown of 1862. It follows, therefore, that the Appellant took no right to or interest in Ship Island under the conveyance by the quit claim deed of January 19, 1927, from the Buffalo & Lake Huron Railway Company.\nWe have now to consider whether the island became vested in the Dominion by force of section 108 of the British North America Act.\nUnder that section,\nThe Public Works and Property of each Province, enumerated in the Third Schedule to this Act, shall be the Property of Canada.\nThe Third Schedule is entitled \u201cProvincial Public Works and Property to be the Property of Canada\u201d; and, among the works and property enumerated therein, are:\n2. Public Harbours.\n5. Rivers and Lake Improvements.\nIt is contended by the Appellant that, in 1867, Ship Island came under either of these two subheads. We will deal first with No. 2: Public Harbours.\nThis raises two questions: Whether in 1867 Goderich Harbour was a public harbour within the meaning of the Third Schedule; and, that being answered in the affirmative, whether Ship Island formed part of the harbour.\nIt would be difficult to say that, in 1867, Goderich harbour was not a \u201cpublic harbour\u201d. In the Fisheries case (Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorneys-General for Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia[11]), the Judicial Committee declined to attempt an exhaustive definition of the term. The view that it meant only \u201csuch a harbour and such portions of it as had been the creation of public money\u201d was rejected by this Court (Holman v. Green)[12], and by the Privy Council (Attorney-General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting and Supply Co.)[13]. In the latter case, it was explained that \u201cpublic harbour means not merely a place suited by its physical characteristics for use as a harbour\u201d (an \u201cindentation of the coast to which the public have right of access, and which by nature is so sheltered as to admit of a ship lying there\u201d)\u2014\u201dbut a place to which on the relevant date the public had access as a harbour, and which they had actually used for that purpose (p. 1004).\nApplying this test, and upon the evidence as to the state of affairs at the relevant date, i.e., at the date at which the B.N.A. Act became applicable, it must be agreed that Goderich Harbour was a public harbour. Even although the work of erection of the harbour and of the subsequent improvements thereof may not have been actually carried out by the province or through the expenditure of public money, the work done by the Canada Company or by the Buffalo Railway Company was part of the consideration\u2014 in fact, the main consideration\u2014for the leases or grants from the Crown to these companies. To establish this it is sufficient to quote the following passage from the patent of lease to the Buffalo Railway Company of June 2, 1862:\nAND WE DO hereby declare it to be Our Royal will and pleasure and these Our Royal Letters Patent are granted upon and subject to the express conditions hereinafter mentioned that is to say, Upon condition that the said Company and their Successors shall and do at their own risk, costs, charges and expense within the space of five years from the date hereof provide sufficient accommodation in the Inner Harbour of Goderich aforesaid for the largest vessels navigating Lake Huron and shall establish and maintain during the period of this demise a facile and safe entrance or channel into the Inner Harbour aforesaid for such vessels as aforesaid and whether by the erection and maintenance of piers or otherwise with a depth in such channel sufficient for the safe entrance of the vessels aforesaid, and also shall and do at their like risk, cost, charges and expense from time to time and at all times during the term hereby granted well and sufficiently repair, uphold, maintain and keep the said wharves and piers, channel and Inner Basin in good, substantial and sufficient repair and fit proper and accessible for the safe landing of passengers and for the discharge of vessels and steamers and the landing and warehousing of goods and passengers therefrom.\nIt may further be added that, under the terms of the lease, all plans or diagrams of improvements had to be submitted to the Commissioner of Crown Lands and the Commissioner of Public Works and they were to be executed to their satisfaction. The companies were to permit and suffer passengers to land at the wharves or piers from any boat, ship or vessel with their personal baggage or luggage without charge and could demand and receive reasonable wharfage dues only for and in respect of goods and merchandise landed at or shipped from the said wharves or piers, the dues being either controlled by statute or submitted to and approved by the Governor General in Council.\nWithout going into details, it appears by official plans and by departmental reports that a good portion of those works and improvements had been actually carried out and that, at the time of Confederation, Goderich Harbour was not only capable of being used, but that it was actually in use as a harbour in the commercial sense. It may accordingly be held as falling, at the pertinent date, within the \u201cclass of harbour meant by the expression public harbour\u201d.\nIn the view we take of the case, it is not necessary to discuss the nature of the province\u2019s proprietary rights in the harbour. It is sufficient to say that the Crown, in right of the province, held at least a reversionary interest.\nGiven a public harbour at Goderich, in 1867, there remains to find out what territory fell within it and, further, whether Ship Island, if within the ambit of the harbour, formed a part of it. (Attorney-General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co.)[14]. This must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case and, in accordance with the rulings of the Judicial Committee in the Fisheries case (Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario, etc.)[15], and in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific Railway)[16], that question must be tried as a question of fact.\nWe agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that, on the evidence, \u201cit is open to serious doubt if Ship Island was, in 1867, situated within the bounds of what was known and used as Goderich Harbour\u201d; and, at all events, we see no reason to dissent from his conclusion that the island was not a part of the harbour.\nIn the Fisheries case15, the Privy Council expressed the opinion that even the foreshore, between the high and low water-mark, on the margin of a harbour, although Crown property, did not necessarily form part of the harbour, and that there must be a further inquiry as to whether it has \u201cactually been used for harbour purposes, such as anchoring ships or landing goods Of course, their Lordships\u2019 observations may be read as laying down only illustrations of what the test must be (Duff, now C.J., in Attorney-General for Canada v. Ritchie Contracting & Supply Co.)[17]; but there is, in this case, no evidence that the island, at the date of Confederation, had become \u201cone of the constituents of the harbour or, in fact, was in use or had ever been in use for any \u201charbour purposes\u201d, except in respect to one particular: certain cribwork allegedly erected on the island and which may be looked at from the viewpoint either of a harbour work or of a river improvement. For that reason, that particular point will be dealt with together with the last contention in support of the claim of the Dominion, to wit: that Ship Island became vested in the Dominion as falling under item 5 of the Third Schedule of section 108: \u201cRivers and Lake Improvements\u201d.\nThe facts are these:\nVessels wintering in Goderich Harbour ran considerable risk in the spring on account of the ice carried down the river Maitland, on the breaking up of the winter. To obviate this, at some period prior to the year 1861, an icebreaker was constructed across one of the branches of the river. This work is mentioned in the report of the Commissioner of Public Works of the 14th February, 1862, and again in the report of John Page, Chief Engineer of the Department of Public Works, dated the 20th January, 1870, where it is referred to as follows:\nIn order to prevent the wharves, warehouses, etc., from being damaged during spring freshets, as well as for the protection of such vessels as might winter in the harbour, an ice-breaker, 1,100 feet long, and from 9 to 10 feet high over low water, has been constructed.\nThis commences at a point on the south shore, 2,300 feet inside of the basin, and extends outwards in a direction nearly parallel with the entrance piers. It appears to be strongly built and secured; nevertheless, a heavy freshet in the spring of 1868, carried away about 200 feet of it, and made a large breach through the gravel bank in its rear.\nTwo departmental plans were filed, respectively dated July, 1861, and 5th November, 1870. They show the icebreaker.\nOn the plan of 1861, it is traced across the river channel, in the direction of Ship Island, but it does not reach the island. It is, however, followed up by another tracing indicated as \u201ccribwork\u201d, and running through the width of the island.\nOn the plan of 1870, the ice-breaker and the cribwork again appear, although not quite in the same relative position to one another. At the extreme end of the ice-breaker, on the island side, a legend on the plan indicates that 200 feet of the work were carried away in the spring of 1868 (as mentioned in Page\u2019s report above referred to) and states that this was repaired.\nNeither the report of the Commissioner of Public Works, in 1861, nor that of Chief Engineer Page, in 1870, makes any reference to the cribwork on the island. Outside of the tracings on the plans, there is not the slightest evidence even alluding to it. None of the old residents, who were heard as witnesses, were able to give any information about it. It cannot be said with certainty that it was ever constructed. It may have been only part of the \u201cproposed works\u201d. If ever constructed, it is impossible to say whether by the lessees of the Crown as part of their obligations or by the occupiers, if any, of the island for their own self purposes. Whatever evidence there is is inconclusive and is susceptible of being interpreted in one sense or the other. We are not satisfied that the presence of the cribwork on the island in 1867 has been established in such a way as to enable us to deal with it as a then existing public work or as a work which was then the property of the province and which could be classed either as harbour work or as a river improvement within the Third Schedule.\nMoreover, the cribwork alone, not the island itself, would come under the designation of \u201criver improvement\u201d. The island was put there by Nature. Under no stretch of imagination can it be styled a man-made improvement. It was authoritatively decided in the Fisheries case[18] that the transfer by s. 108 to the Dominion of \u201crivers and lake improvements\u201d operates, on its true construction, in regard to the improvements only, that is to say: in regard only to the \u201cartificial works\u201d themselves. It is quite evident that, in this case, the transfer of the cribwork qua improvement would not carry the transfer of the entire island. We doubt if it would mean any more than an easement on Ship Island in favour of the Dominion. And that leads to a further difficulty, because the record is absolutely lacking in the information required to fix the locus of the easement. In the earlier days, Ship Island is proven to have had an area of four acres. This had dwindled down to nine-tenths of an acre in 1929. The balance has been \u201cdredged away\u201d. For all we know, the cribwork may have been placed, if at all, on that part of the island which was \u201cdredged away\u201d. It is certain that the cribwork and the ice-breaker have long since disappeared. To replace them, a breakwater was built, at a much later date, across the whole of the river Maitland and at some distance north of Ship Island.\nThe existence\u2014even if it should be conceded\u2014of the cribwork in 1867 would suggest at most the transfer of an easement on Ship Island to the Dominion of Canada by force of s. 108 and its schedule. With the meagre data at our disposal, it is not easy to see how the locus of the easement could be defined, nor can we perceive what useful purpose would be served by inserting in the judgment a declaration that the easement was vested in the Appellant, in view of the Appellant\u2019s avowed intention to destroy the island.\nSo far as that question may affect the amount of compensation, it may be taken care of when that and other matters reserved by the judgment of the Exchequer Court will be later considered by that court.\nFor the moment, the Appellant has failed to convince us that the conclusion reached by the learned President was wrong, and the appeal from his judgment ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

But it is primarily for the trial judge to decide whether such a course ought to be followed, under the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that decision.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the jury\u2019s verdict of conviction of the present appellant on his trial (before Gibsone J. and a jury) on a charge of conspiracy to commit arson. The material facts for the purposes of the present appeal, and the questions in issue in the appeal, are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Rinfret J., now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nLucien Gendron K.C., Oscar Gagnon and William Paradis for the appellant.\nValmore Bienvenue, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This case is the consequence of a fire which partly destroyed a furniture factory at Daveluyville, in the province of Quebec, during the night of the 29th of December, 1931.\nIn May, 1932, one Donat P\u00e9pin, who was night watchman at the factory, was convicted of having wilfully set the fire.\nIn June of the same year, the appellant was charged with conspiracy to commit the crime with P\u00e9pin, or with other persons unknown. He was found guilty by the jury. He appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, and the conviction was confirmed by a majority of the judges of that Court, Howard J. dissenting with regard to the admissibility in evidence of certain telegrams and of the testimony of one Bergeron. The points of dissent alone must be considered and determined on the present appeal.\nFirst, as to the telegrams.\u2014\nIn attempting to place before the jury the facts tending to establish the existence of the conspiracy, it was part of the Crown\u2019s case to prove that P\u00e9pin had been hired as night watchman at Daveluyville, at the suggestion and through the endeavours of Paradis, in furtherance of the plot to burn the factory. On December 21, 1931, Paradis was proven to have written to the Victoriaville Furniture Co., owners of the factory, a letter reading as follows:\u2014\nParadis & Pellerin Limit\u00e9e,\nSuccesseurs de J. W. Paradis & Jean A. Pellerin,\nJ. W. Paradis, Courtier en Assurances,\nVictoriaville, Qu\u00e9. ce 21 d\u00e9cembre 1931.\nVictoriaville Furniture Ltd.,\nVictoriaville, P.Q.\nMessieurs:\u2014Attention M. Georges Cantin.\nJ\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les polices d\u2019assurance et je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il serait mieux pour vous d\u2019avoir un gardien de nuit et un de jour, parce que les compagnies d\u2019assurances croient qu\u2019un homme ne peut pas garder pendant 24 heures, parce que lorsqu\u2019il a gard\u00e9 pendant 12 heures, c\u2019est tout ce qu\u2019il peut faire.\nAlors veuillez donc, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet, vous entendre avec M. Donat P\u00e9pin, le gar\u00e7on de Jules, pour qu\u2019il puisse garder la nuit.\nJ\u2019ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. P\u00e9pin qui est all\u00e9 recevoir un char de bois actuellement, mais il doit revenir mercredi soir, et il serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 commencer jeudi. En attendant je notifie les compagnies d\u2019assurance que vous avez un gardien de jour et un de nuit.\nBien \u00e0 vous,\n(Sign\u00e9) J. W. Paradis.\nIn that letter as will have been noted, Paradis stated he had already spoken to P\u00e9pin about the suggested engagement.\nThe next day, December 22, the following telegrams were alleged to have passed between P\u00e9pin and Paradis:\u2014\nDaaquam, Qu\u00e9. 22 d\u00e9cembre 1931.\nJ. W. Paradis,\nVeuillez me faire remplacer par Maurice Lachance, rue St-Jean-Baptiste, d\u2019ici quelques jours; je serai pas Victoriaville avant vendredi, tel qu\u2019entendu tous les deux.\nDonat P\u00e9pin.\nVictoriaville, le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1931.\nMonsieur Donat P\u00e9pin,\nDaaquam, Co. Montmagny.\nSur quel train arriverez-vous vendredi?\nJ. W. Paradis.\nDaaquam, 22 d\u00e9c. 1931.\nJ. W. Paradis,\nJe calcule arriver vendredi par train de nuit.\nDonat P\u00e9pin. There was ample evidence for the jury to find that the telegrams had been actually exchanged between the parties. But the appellant sought to discount their evidentiary value on the ground\u2014to quote the learned dissenting judge\u2014that\nThe language of the telegrams conveys no hint of any concealed, sinister purpose; one has to read into them what is not there to give them any such import. And that is all the writing connected with the accused that there is of record. No one professes to have been present when the alleged plot was formed between Paradis and P\u00e9pin or to have overheard it or even to have seen them together in conference before the fire.\nWe think the objection is untenable. Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may be established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence. Ordinarily the evidence must proceed by steps. The actual agreement must be gathered from \u201cseveral isolated doings\u201d, (Kenny\u2014\u201cOutlines of Criminal Law\u201d, p. 294) having possibly little or no value taken by themselves, but the bearing of which one upon the other must be interpreted; and their cumulative effect, properly estimated in the light of all surrounding circumstances, may raise a presumption of concerted purpose entitling the jury to find the existence of the unlawful agreement.\nIn that view, the telegrams exchanged between P\u00e9pin and Paradis were undoubtedly receivable. Indeed, when connected with the other facts of the case, they might well be regarded as part of the agreement itself. At least, they formed important links in the chain of detached acts of the parties obviously tending towards the common design and from which the conspiracy might be inferred.\nWe have no doubt that, in the premises, the telegrams were rightly admitted in evidence by the learned trial judge.\nThe other question raised by the dissenting judgment refers to the legality of portions of Bergeron\u2019s testimony with regard to certain conversations he declared he had with the appellant on the 22nd of December, 1931, and later with P\u00e9pin before and after the fire.\nProof of the conversation with the appellant should not have been permitted\u2014so it is contended\u2014\u201cbecause of its obvious irrelevance\u201d.\nBergeron testified that, on the 22nd of December\u2014and therefore barely six days before the happening of the fire\u2014 the appellant, who was then his employer, called him to his office and offered him five hundred dollars to burn the factory. He stated furthermore that he asked him to drive with him to Daveluyville. On their way, to quote the words of the witness himself,\nDans l\u2019automobile, il m\u2019a propos\u00e9 de mettre le feu \u00e0 la manufacture, m\u00eame de me faire nommer gardien \u00e0 la manufacture; qu\u2019il pouvait me faire nommer quand il voudrait; que c\u2019\u00e9tait facile pour lui; qu\u2019il n\u2019avait que la peine de donner une lettre etc.\nAfter they had reached Daveluyville, Paradis showed him around the factory and, during the course of this visit, pointed to him a likely convenient place to set the fire (\u201cIci, ce serait une tr\u00e8s bonne place, c\u2019est bien sec \u201c). He added:\nLe bon temps pour faire br\u00fbler \u00e7a, c\u2019est le jour de No\u00ebl au soir, pendant la messe de minuit; tout le monde serait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9glise, il y aurait personne pour remarquer le gars qui mettrait le feu.\nAnd, as he was positively indicating his unwillingness to act, Bergeron relates that Paradis then said:\nJ\u2019aurais bien Donat P\u00e9pin pour faire la job . . . (mais) il n\u2019est pas ici; il est rendu au diable au vert. J\u2019ai re\u00e7u un t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme \u00e0 matin, il ne pourra pas \u00eatre ici avant le Jour de No\u00ebl apr\u00e8s-midi . . . Il ne sera pas l\u00e0; puis, finalement, on pourra pas le faire br\u00fbler le jour de No\u00ebl.\nThereupon, seeing that Bergeron persisted in his refusal, Paradis is stated to have said:\nPense plus \u00e0 \u00e7a. Parles-en pas m\u00eame \u00e0 ta femme \u00e7\u00e0, je ne voudrais pas que personne sache \u00e7\u00e0.\nWe are unable to agree that the above evidence ought not to have been received. So far as it contained admissions directly from the mouth of the accused of a nature to elucidate the true meaning and the character of his relations with P\u00e9pin, the evidence was clearly relevant. If, as suggested by counsel for the appellant, it tended to show, on the part of the accused, a previous attempt to commit a similar offence, still in our opinion the trial judge was right in allowing it to be made in the present case. Indeed, in our view, it was more than evidence of a similar offence; it proved an effort by Paradis to pursue the very object of the conspiracy.\nTreating the matter merely from the viewpoint of a similar offence, the rule is that acts of the accused, though not forming part of the incriminated transaction, are relevant, if they bear\nupon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental. (Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[1]; and see Baker v. The King[2].\nIt was competent to the Crown to adduce evidence with the object of showing that the appellant had in mind the setting of the fire to the Daveluyville factory. Bergeron\u2019s deposition afforded proof on Paradis\u2019 part of a recent attempt to induce Bergeron to commit the offence coinciding with the first steps in the conspiracy with which Paradis was charged. To these initial steps in the alleged unlawful agreement, the defence was trying to assign an innocent purpose. The impugned evidence was relevant as tending to establish criminal intent and guilty design; in fact, it was evidence of the intention to do the very thing for which he was indicted.\nThe other portions of Bergeron\u2019s testimony to which exception was taken have reference to statements of P\u00e9pin related by Bergeron and alleged to have been made a few days before the fire, on the 26th of December, 1931, as well as after the fire, in January and February, 1932.\nIn the dissenting judgment, the objection to the admissibility of those statements is put upon exactly the same ground as the objection in respect of the telegrams already discussed. It is said that neither the telegrams, nor the testimony of Bergeron with regard to the conversations with P\u00e9pin, should have been admitted \u201cinasmuch as the Crown failed to make by other means prima facie proof of the existence of the alleged conspiracy.\u201d\nWe have already indicated that, upon the ground thus stated, the opinion of the learned dissenting judge cannot be upheld; for, in our view, and quite independently of the declarations said to have been made by P\u00e9pin, there was evidence in the record establishing prima facie that the appellant was engaged in the unlawful conspiracy. Nor would it be error for a trial judge to permit proof of acts of alleged conspiracy to be given in evidence before the agreement to conspire has been established, if the latter is in fact proved during the course of the trial. The King v. Hutchinson[3].\nNo further point need be discussed, for that disposes of all the questions of law raised in the dissenting judgment which alone is the foundation of the jurisdiction of this Court in the matter. Perhaps we may add that P\u00e9pin\u2019s statements to Bergeron were not received as proof against Paradis. The trial judge so ruled and the jury was so told. But the indictment mentioned P\u00e9pin\u2019s name as one of the conspirators and, in this way, it was sought to establish P\u00e9pin\u2019s connection by evidence tending to show the actual consummation of the crime by him. We will deal later on more fully with the statements of the 26th of December, 1931. As for those of January and February, 1932, they do not incriminate Paradis and in no way do they refer to him. In fact, if anything, that part of the evidence rather leads away from him; at most, it was unnecessary. More particularly in view of the express warning in the presiding judge\u2019s address, later to be referred to, we are unable to conclude that any harm was done in the special circumstances.\nBefore us, however, counsel for the appellant strongly urged that a particular statement of P\u00e9pin referring to the accused was of such a character that the whole trial was thereby vitiated.\nAlthough we entertain serious doubt as to whether the point is covered by the dissenting judgment,\u2014and our present view would be that it is not\u2014since we have heard counsel for and against it, we may express the opinion that a full consideration of the able argument presented to us would not warrant, on this point, our interference with the judgment of the majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nThe statement incriminating Paradis was made on the 26th of December by P\u00e9pin to Bergeron, under the following circumstances:\nIn conformity with the telegrams exchanged on the 22nd of December and with the interview between P\u00e9pin and Paradis, as stated in the latter\u2019s letter of December 21 already referred to, P\u00e9pin had come to Victoriaville; and, on the 26th of December, he was preparing to leave for Daveluyville to take charge of his job as night watchman. That morning, so Bergeron testifies, he met P\u00e9pin on the street. P\u00e9pin was in Paradis\u2019 automobile, a Hudson car, on his way to the garage, where he was to take Paradis\u2019 truck for the purpose of driving to Daveluyville. The truck had been out of commission for some time; it required to be looked after; it needed chains and a new battery. P\u00e9pin asked Bergeron to help him in this work of preparation. After they were through, and just as P\u00e9pin was leaving, he volunteered the statement that he was starting out for a \u201cdamned job\u201d. Bergeron said to him he would be better not to undertake it, to which P\u00e9pin is alleged to have made the unexpected reply: \u201cOh, well! I am a bachelor and the Paradis have lots of influence\u201d (\u201cLes Paradis ont de l\u2019influence en masse\u201d).\nObjection was taken immediately. A long discussion ensued at the conclusion of which the trial judge ruled that the reference to Paradis should be struck from the deposition. Notwithstanding the learned judge\u2019s ruling, the appellant strongly contends that the reference was so prejudicial to the accused that the jury should have been discharged and the prisoner tried before a fresh jury.\nThere may be extreme cases where the suggested procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question whether such a course ought to be followed is primarily for the trial judge to decide upon the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that decision. In this instance, at all events, there are clearly no adequate grounds for holding that the learned judge ought to have acted otherwise than he did.\nBergeron\u2019s testimony as to the preparations made by P\u00e9pin, when leaving for Daveluyvile, in Paradis\u2019 car, was admissible both as tending to show Paradis\u2019 connection with the scheme and as being evidence of acts done by P\u00e9pin within the scope of the objects of the conspiracy with which Paradis was identified. (Baker v. The King)[4]. It was therefore contended by the Crown that P\u00e9pin\u2019s remarks, made at the time of doing such acts in pursuance of the common design, should not be regarded as mere admissions uttered by him but as \u201ccontemporaneous comments\u201d so related to the incidents reported by Bergeron and so intimately connected with them as to form part of the acts themselves, the evidence of which was properly receivable. (See Russell on Crimes, 8th ed., vol. I, p. 189, and the authorities therein collected.) But it is not necessary to decide that point in this case, in view of the ruling made by the learned trial judge. We refer to it only to indicate that the mere mention of the appellant\u2019s name at the place complained of in Bergeron\u2019s testimony did not, in the circumstances, carry the serious consequences represented to us. In the premises, the evidence objected to was ruled out and all mention of Paradis\u2019 name by P\u00e9pin was ordered struck from the record. We find, moreover, that in his address to the jury the presiding judge gave them a special direction on this point. He reminded them of his decision that P\u00e9pin\u2019s statements mentioning the name of Paradis were inadmissible, that any such statements were made without right, and he warned them that the evidence in that respect should be regarded as excluded (\u201cDes paroles que P\u00e9pin aurait dites, que Paradis \u00e9tait m\u00eal\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, \u00e7a, j\u2019ai dit que \u00e7a ne pouvait pas faire preuve contre Paradis\u201d).\nWe are satisfied that the appellant has no substantial ground of complaint in the premises.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William Paradis.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Valmore Bienvenue.\n[1] [1894] A.C. 57.\n[2] [1926] S.C.R. 92, at 103.\n[3] (1904) 8 Can.

The respondent Lindal, who was injured in an accident while being driven by the respondent Beattie in his motor car, sued him for damages. The respondent Beattie was insured under a \"combination policy\" issued by the two appellant companies, under which he was insured by one company with respect to legal liability for bodily injuries or death and by the other with respect to damage to his car. The respondent Beattie had given notice of the accident to the appellant companies, which made a full investigation and, after unsuccessful efforts to reach a settlement with the respondent Lindal, undertook the defence of the action against the respondent Beattie, which action was maintained for $1,636.05 and $353.40 costs. After a return of nulla bona, the respondent Lindal brought an action against the appellant companies under section 180 of The Alberta Insurance Act, 1926, c. 31. The respondent Beattie also brought action against the appellant companies, claiming to be indemnified from the Lindal judgment and also for the damage suffered to his automobile. In both actions the appellant companies alleged that the respondent Beattie was intoxicated and contended therefore that, under statutory condition No. 5 of the Alberta Insurance Act, they were relieved from liability. The trial judge, Ives J., before whom both actions were tried together, found that the respondent Beattie was intoxicated and he dismissed both actions; but that judgment was reversed by a majority of the Appellate Division.\nHeld, Crocket J. dissenting, that this appeal should be allowed and the respondents' actions dismissed.\nStatutory condition 5 of schedule d. of the Alberta Insurance Act, 1926, c. 31, provides that the insurer under an automobile insurance policy shall not be liable under the policy \"while the automobile * * * is being driven by * * * an intoxicated person.\" Held, that this condition, as to intoxication, does not apply to the insured himself.\nHeld, also that the fact, that respondent Beattie's act occurred while he was \"manifestly\" intoxicated when driving his automobile at the time of the accident, as found by the trial judge, constituted a violation of section 285 (4) of the Criminal Code sufficient to prevent him from recovering, on ground of public policy. Crocket J. dissenting.\nHeld also, Crocket J. dissenting, that section 179 of the Insurance Act of Alberta has no application to contracts for indemnity in respect of losses occasioned by violating some provisions of a Dominion statute, (in this case, respondent Beattie violated section 285 (4) of the Criminal Code providing penalties for driving an automobile when intoxicated). The Alberta legislation does not directly validate a contract of indemnity which would otherwise be invalid because the insurer has proposed to insure against an act or the consequences of an act that would be a criminal offence under the Criminal Code, or under the criminal law of the Dominion prevailing throughout Canada as distinguished from the penal laws of the province.\nHeld, also, that the appellant companies, by undertaking the defence of the action brought by the respondent Lindal against the respondent Beattie were not estopped from denying liability on the policies although they had full knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the accident. The real foundation of the appellants' defence was not, that the policy was not in full force and effect, but that they never contemplated indemnifying the respondent Beattie for liability arising through his own criminal act. Crocket J. expressing no opinion.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J., and maintaining the respondent's actions with costs.\nThe material facts of the cases and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThomas N. Phelan K.C. for the appellants.\nN. D. Maclean K.C. for the respondent Lindal.\nS. Bruce Smith for the respondent Beattie.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court, Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nLAMONT J.\u2014About 3 a.m. on the 10th day of March, 1932, in the city of Edmonton, the respondent, Lena Lindal, was a passenger in an automobile owned and driven by the respondent, John Beattie, when the automobile came into collision with a street railway standard. As a result of the collision Miss Lindal was very seriously injured and the car badly damaged. Miss Lindal brought an action for damages against Beattie for the injuries she had suffered, alleging that her injuries were caused by his negligence. She recovered a judgment against him for $1,636.05, and costs which were taxed at $353.40. Execution was issued against Beattie but it was returned by the sheriff unsatisfied.\nAt the time the accident took place Beattie carried automobile insurance in the form of a combination policy with the Home Insurance Company, New York, and the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, Baltimore. By this policy the latter company agreed to indemnify him against all loss or damage which he should become legally liable to pay for bodily injuries caused to any person by the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile, up to the amount mentioned in the policy. The Home Insurance Company agreed to indemnify him against collision damage to his automobile.\nWhen her execution was returned by the sheriff unsatisfied, Miss Lindal commenced an action, under section 180 of the Alberta Insurance Act, against the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, to recover the sum of $2,005.20, the amount of her judgment, interest and costs. At the same time Beattie brought an action against both insurance companies in which he claimed from the Home Insurance Company the sum of $525 for collision damages to his car, and from the Fidelity & Guaranty Company the sum necessary to relieve and indemnify him against his liability to Lena Lindal. The companies set up that they were not liable because Beattie had committed a breach of statutory condition 5 of the policy, which reads as follows:\u2014\nRisks not covered: 5. The insurer shall not be liable under this policy while the automobile, with the knowledge, consent or connivance of the insured, is being driven by a person under the age limit fixed by law, or, in any event, under the age of 16 years, or by an intoxicated person.\nBy section 254 of the Insurance Act of 1926, this statutory condition, along with others, is deemed to be a part of every contract of insurance in force in Alberta.\nThese two actions were tried together before Mr. Justice Ives who, on the evidence, held that at the time of the accident Beattie was driving his car while in an intoxicated condition, and, not only was he intoxicated, but, by reason of the quantity of alcohol which he had consumed, he was unable to drive a motor car with safety. These findings, in the light of the learned judge's reasons, clearly involve, as we think, the conclusion that the accident was due to Beattie's intoxication. On the above findings the trial judge held that the accident was not a risk insured against, and he dismissed both actions. From his judgment an appeal was taken to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which reversed the judgment (Clarke and McGillivray JJ. dissenting)[2]. The majority of the court held that both plaintiffs were entitled to recover. From the judgment of the Appellate Division the companies now appeal to this court.\nThat respondent Beattie was in an intoxicated condition when driving his automobile at the time of the accident the trial judge found on conflicting evidence. The view of the judge as to the relative weight to be ascribed to the testimony of different witnesses ought not to be disturbed on appeal in the absence of the gravest reasons. In this case the reasons advanced on behalf of the appellants have not satisfied us that the finding ought to be set aside.\nThe appellants contend that Beattie's driving his automobile while intoxicated relieves them from liability for two reasons: (1) that, under statutory condition 5, such risk was not covered by the policy, and(2) if covered, the claim for indemnity is unenforceable as being contrary to public policy.\nThe exclusion from liability, under statutory condition 5, is only \"while the automobile, with the knowledge, consent or connivance of the insured, is being driven by * * * an intoxicated person.\" This is not apt language to describe an act done by the insured himself. It is, however, just the language one would expect to be used if the intention was to exclude liability where the automobile was being driven by a third person with the permission of the insured. Apart from the inaptness of the language there is, we think, another difficulty. To exclude liability, the automobile, when driven by an intoxicated person, must be driven with the knowledge of the insured. If statutory condition 5 is construed so as to include the insured himself, we should have this remarkable result: that, if the insured were so intoxicated as not to know what he was doing, the condition would not apply owing to the insured's want of knowledge; while, if he were but slightly intoxicated, he would know that he was driving and the condition would be applicable. In our opinion condition 5 is not to be construed as applicable to the insured.\nThe appellants' second contention is that they are exempt from liability because the peril insured against was brought into operation by a wrongful act of the insured, which constituted a violation of the criminal law, and that, under these circumstances, it would be contrary to public policy for the court to assist the respondent in securing indemnity for an illegal act.\nSection 285(4) of the Criminal Code reads as follows:\nEveryone who while intoxicated * * * drives any motor vehicle or automobile * * * shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon summary conviction for the first offence to a term of imprisonment not exceeding thirty days and not less than seven days, for a second offence to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months and not less than one month, and for each subsequent offence to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year and not less than three months.\nThe respondents do not dispute that if the liability arose from a wrongful act of the insured, intentionally or wilfully done, the insured is not entitled to be indemnified against its consequences. They do, however, contend that it is only an intentional wrongful act on the part of the insured that will bar his right to indemnity. Mere negligence, however gross, no matter to what criminal consequences it may expose the insured, is, they contend, not sufficient, for one of the objects of insurance is to protect the insured against the consequences of negligence. For that reason it is said the doctrine of public policy has no application where the liability arises not from the wilful act of the insured but from his negligence.\nDoes the fact that Beattie's act constituted a violation of the Criminal Code prevent him from recovering on grounds of public policy?\nThere are two cases in which the question has been answered in the negative: Tinline v. White Insurance As- sociation[3], and James v. British Insurance Company[4]. On the other hand the question is answered in the affirmative in O'Hearn v. York Insurance Company[5], which was a case of an insured who while driving his car on the public highway in an intoxicated condition and at an excessive rate of speed, struck and injured a man who died as the result of his injuries. The insured was convicted of an offence under section 285 of the Criminal Code, and the judge at the trial of the action, which he brought against the insurance company for indemnity, found that he had been guilty of the offence. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, in that case, held that the insured should not be indemnified against the consequences of his own criminal act. Reference was there made to the case of Lundy v. Lundy[6], where this court held that no devisee can take under the will of a testator whose death has been caused by the criminal and felonious act of the devisee himself, and, that in applying this rule, no distinction can be made between a death caused by murder and one caused by manslaughter. Chief Justice Strong, in giving judgment, said as follows:\u2014\nThe principle upon which the devisee is held incapable of taking under the will of the person he kills is, that no one can take advantage of his own wrong. Then surely an act for which a man is convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment was a wrongful, illegal and formerly * * * a felonious act.\nThe principle which, in our opinion, is applicable to the present case is that stated by Kennedy J. in Burrows v. Rhodes[7], as follows:\u2014\nIt has, I think, long been settled law that if an act is manifestly unlawful, or the doer of it knows it to be unlawful, as constituting either a civil wrong or a criminal offence, he cannot maintain an action for contribution or for indemnity against the liability which results to him therefrom. An express promise of indemnity to him for the commission of such an act is void.\nIn the recent case of Haseldine v. Hoskins[8], Scrutten L.J. says as follows:\u2014\nIt will be noticed that Kennedy J., used two phrases \"manifestly unlawful,\" or \"the doer of it knows it to be unlawful.\" These two phrases must mean two different things, because if the first phrase means that the act is manifestly to the man who does it unlawful, there was no need to use the second phrase, \"or the doer of it knows it to be unlawful.\" I. think that the learned judge is clearly meaning such an act, that there can be no doubt that it is unlawful.\nIt is, therefore, sufficient to bring in the doctrine of public policy that Beattie should have been \"manifestly\" intoxicated while driving his automobile at the time of the accident. On this point the judgment of the learned trial judge leaves no doubt.\nThe learned judge described Beattie's action as follows:\u2014\nAdmittedly the street conditions were most dangerous\u2014that is his own evidence\u2014slippery, old winter ice, snowing and sleeting heavily, with only the view that under such conditions the operation of his windshield wiper afforded him. Yet he was going at the rate of thirty miles per hour when there was no need for such speed. He insisted on passing a car going in the same direction which had not obeyed his horn signal to turn out, as he admits, although he had only that block to travel before himself leaving that street. Such conduct constitutes such a degree of reckless carelessness that it may be inferred the actor was not in a normal condition.\nIt was, however, contended on the part of the respondents that, whatever may have been the rule as to public policy in former times, public policy in Alberta permits an insurer to agree to indemnify the insured against loss or damage for which he may become liable by reason of driving his automobile while intoxicated. By section 179 of the Insurance Act of Alberta, 1926, it is provided:\u2014\nIt shall be lawful for an insurer to contract to indemnify an insured against financial loss occasioned by reason of liability to a third person, whether or not the loss has been caused by the insured through negligence or while violating the provisions of any municipal by-law or any Act of this legislature.\nPrior to the passing of this section the legislature of Alberta had, by section 22 (2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1911-12, enacted, with certain prescribed penalties, the following:\u2014\n22 (2). No intoxicated person shall drive or operate a motor vehicle in any place.\nThis provision, with a slightly altered phraseology, has continued on the statute book ever since and it is now found as section 59 of the Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, chapter 31 of 1924.\nFrom 1921 the material part of section 285 (4) of the Criminal Code has been in force, and, it is not questioned that it is valid legislation of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe respondents contend that the effect of this legislation is to make inapplicable, in Alberta, the doctrine of public policy in circumstances such as we are here con- cerned with. It is, therefore, necessary to consider what effect must be given to these sections of provincial Acts, especially in view of the legislation of section 285 (4) of the Criminal Code.\nWe think the contention of the respondents ought to be rejected for this reason: first of all, it does not appear to be open to doubt that the phrase \"Act of this legislature\" in section 179 of the Insurance Act imports legislation which is legally operative. No doubt, in enacting section 22 (2) of 1911-12, and in prescribing penalties in respect of the violation of it, the Alberta legislature was creating an offence which, in view of the decisions of the Privy Council in Rex v. Nat. Bell Liquors[9], and Naden v. The King[10], is properly described as a criminal offence: provided, of course, that the legislation was operative.\nIn 1921, however, as already stated, the Dominion Parliament passed legislation adding a section to the Criminal Code in terms almost identical with those of the provincial enactment (section 22 (2)) and making it a criminal offence, in the strictest sense, to drive an automobile while in a state of intoxication. The effect of this legislation by Parliament was to supersede existing provincial legislation, which was legislation in the same field; and thereafter, as long, at all events, as the Dominion legislation should remain in force, the provincial legislation would necessarily be inoperative. The Dominion legislation has remained in force until the present day. There was not, therefore, at the time of the accident, or at the date of the policy, an Act of the provincial legislature in force, within the meaning of section 179 of the Insurance Act, prohibiting the driving of a motor vehicle while in a state of intoxication.\nThis point was not taken in argument, and that is regrettable, because on all questions touching the validity of provincial legislation it is the practice of this court to invite the Attorney-General of the province to present such considerations as he thinks right upon the matter under consideration. It is not necessary, however, that the judgment should be put upon this ground, and, therefore, we do not think it proper to delay judgment for the purpose of hearing the Attorney-General. In our view the effect of section 179 of the Alberta Insurance Act is this: Contracts by an insurer to indemnify an insured against financial loss occasioned by reason of liability to a third person, shall be recognized by the law as binding, notwithstanding the fact: 1st, \"that the loss has been occasioned by the insured while violating the provisions of any municipal by-law or an Act of the legislature\" of Alberta. That is to say, a contract for indemnity is not illegal on the ground of public policy because the right of indemnity extends to losses so occasioned or arising under such circumstances. To that extent the rule which strikes contracts with invalidity on grounds of public policy is modified, but to no greater extent. The statute has no application to contracts for indemnity in respect of losses occasioned by violating the provisions of the Criminal Code. Nothing of the kind is expressed and nothing of the kind can be implied.\nIt follows that the Alberta legislation does not directly validate a contract of indemnity which would otherwise be invalid because the insurer has professed to insure against an act or the consequences of an act that would be a criminal offence under the Criminal Code or under the criminal law of the Dominion prevailing throughout Canada as distinguished from the penal laws of the provinces.\nIt might be argued, however, that the Alberta legislation is evidence establishing the conclusion\u2014upon which the courts ought to act\u2014that a contract of indemnity against a crime, or the consequences of it, where the crime consists simply in driving an automobile while in a state of intoxication, is not a contract opposed to public policy. To that there appears to us to be two answers: The first is, that by the legislation of 1921, already mentioned, such conduct had become a criminal offence under the Criminal Code. This legislation was a part of the criminal law of the Dominion on the very subject with which the Alberta Legislature was dealing in passing section 179 of the Insurance Act of 1926. Notwithstanding this fact, the section is carefully restricted, in so far as it specifically refers to legislation, to \"the provisions of * * * any Act of this Legislature.\" In view of this, it would not, we think, be an admissible inference that the Legislature contemplated the modification of the doctrine of public policy in the wide sense contended for. The second reason is this: the rule as formulated by Mr. Justice Kennedy in the passage already quoted above from his judgment in Burrows v. Rhodes[11], although it may be said that, in its origin, it merely exemplified the power of the court to refuse to enforce contracts on the ground that they infringed some dictate of public policy, is a long settled rule. And we do not think it is now competent to the courts to refuse to give effect to it in the absence of direct legislative sanction or, at all events, of such legislation as should demonstrate the intention of the Legislature that such contracts should no longer be regarded as exceptions to the general principle of freedom of contract.\nTwo other points require to be noticed. The first is that the appellants do not, in their pleadings, allege that Beattie's act was illegal as being contrary to public policy, and it is contended, therefore, that they are precluded from relying on Beattie's intoxication. The rule upon this point, as stated by Lord Moulton in N.W. Salt Co. v. Electrolytic Alkali Co.[12], is:\u2014\nIf the contract and its setting be fully before the Court it must pronounce on the legality of the transaction. But it may not do so if the contract be not ex facie illegal, and it has before it only a part of the setting, which it is not entitled to take, as against the plaintiffs, as fairly representing the whole setting.\nIn this case the act which constituted the illegality was Beattie's driving his automobile when he was intoxicated. That he was driving his automobile at the time of the accident he admits. That he was then intoxicated was expressly set up in the pleadings and the court was entitled to assume that it had before it in evidence all the relevant surrounding circumstances relating to his intoxication. If on that point Beattie, when before the trial court, did not put in all his relevant evidence, the responsibility must be laid at his door. We think, therefore, that Beattie's admission and the proof made at the trial, irrespective of the argument before the Appellate Division, where the question was raised, were sufficient to justify the court in passing upon Beattie's act as being illegal on the ground of public policy.\nThe other point is that by undertaking the defence of the action brought by Lindal against Beattie, with full knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the accident, they are estopped from denying liability on the policy.\nThis argument was strongly pressed upon us but, however effective it might be in some cases, we do not think it can prevail against the defence that Beattie's act constituted a crime and that to permit the recovery of indemnity in this case would be to give effect to an illegality. If the defence here had been that the appellants were denying liability on the ground that the policy was not binding on them because Beattie had made a material misrepresentation or had failed to fulfil some condition precedent to liability, it might be argued that, having undertaken Beattie's defence in the action brought against him by Lena Lindal for damages for personal injuries, they could not, afterwards, be held to deny their liability under the policy. That, however, is not this case. The real foundation of the defence in this case is not, that the policy was not in full force and effect, but that it never contemplated indemnifying Beattie for liability arising through his own criminal act.\nThe appellants here were insisting that they were entitled under the policy to conduct Beattie's defence. Suppose that Beattie had said to them that he would agree to their conducting his defence, but only on condition that they would not raise against him, when he would sue for indemnity, any defence based upon his intoxication or his criminal act; and suppose further that the appellants had given him an undertaking in writing to that effect; of what avail would that have been to Beattie? Even in the absence of an allegation that Beattie's act was illegal or criminal, once such illegality or criminality were brought to the attention of the court, it would be the duty of the judge, even of his own motion, to refuse, on grounds of public policy, to enforce indemnity and he should dismiss the action. If an express undertaking would not be enforceable, we are of opinion that conduct, whether by way of estoppel, waiver or election, cannot preclude the appellants from denying liability.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment below set aside, and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout. CROCKET J. (dissenting).\u2014I regret that I have to differ from my brethren in their conclusion that s. 179 of the Alberta Insurance Act does not contemplate a loss caused by the insured while violating that provision of the Alberta Motor Vehicles Act, which prohibits the driving of a motor vehicle by a person who is intoxicated, because at the time of the passage of the former statute the Criminal Code contained a provision declaring that every one who while intoxicated drives any motor vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon summary conviction to a term of imprisonment.\nIt is no doubt true, as held in my brother Lamont's judgment, that the incorporation in the Criminal Code of this provision renders the prohibition of the Alberta statute inoperative, so far at least as concerns a prosecution for the imposition of the penalty fixed by the Alberta statute for that offence against the provincial Act; but I do not think that this fact can fairly be said to read that portion of s. 59, which enacts the prohibition against the driving of a motor vehicle by an intoxicated person, entirely out of the provincial Motor Vehicles Act as if it had been expressly repealed or never been enacted. Notwithstanding that it may be inoperative so far as prosecutions for the imposition of the penalties prescribed by the penalties section of the Alberta statute are concerned, it still remains in that statute as an unrepealed enactment, and one which is not now held to be void. It is, therefore, one, which I think the legislature must be held to have had in contemplation with all other prohibitions of the Motor Vehicles Act, when it passed its Insurance Act in 1926. Section 179 of this Act deals entirely with the validity of motor insurance contracts for the indemnification of a motor vehicle owner against loss occasioned by reason of his liability to a third person\u2014a liability which can only be created by negligence or some other wrongful act on the part of the owner or on the part of one for whose acts he is responsible. It expressly declares that it shall be lawful for an insurer to contract to indemnify the owner against such loss, notwithstanding that it has been caused by him through negligence or while he was violating any of the provisions of any municipal by-law or any of the provisions of any Act of the legislature. It in no manner concerns or contem- plates the subject of prosecutions for criminal negligence or of prosecutions for violation of any of the provisions of either the provincial Motor Vehicles Act or of the Criminal Code, and refers to the violation of \"the provisions of any municipal by-law or any Act of this legislature,\" solely for the purpose of indicating the wrongful and illegal acts in respect of which an insurance company may lawfully contract to indemnify a motor vehicle owner. The fact that the Dominion Parliament had provided in the Criminal Code that every one who drives a motor vehicle while intoxicated, and thus does something which the Alberta Motor Vehicles Act prohibits, shall be guilty of an offence under the Code and liable to a gaol sentence, cannot, it seems to me, fairly be taken to exclude the act of the owner in driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated from the purview of s. 170 of the provincial Insurance Act, any more than the fact of gross or criminal negligence rendering the driver of a motor vehicle liable to prosecution and conviction for manslaughter, if such negligence on his part causes the death of another, can be taken to exclude gross or criminal negligence from the purview of that section. The thing done remains from the point of view of the intention of the provincial legislature just as much a thing which falls within the prohibitory provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act as it did before.\nI find it impossible to believe that s. 179 of the provincial Insurance Act did not contemplate any and all degrees of negligence, whether that negligence should constitute an offence under the Criminal Code or not, and that it did not also contemplate all prohibitory provisions of provincial statutes, irrespective of whether the violation of any of those provisions would constitute an offence against the Criminal Code. The clear purpose of the enactment, in my view, was to make it lawful for an insurance company to contract to indemnify an owner of a motor vehicle against liability to third persons by reason of all or any such acts of negligence and all or any such wrongful and illegal acts as those described in the prohibitory provisions of the Alberta Motor Vehicles Act or in any other Act of the Alberta legislature or in any by-law of any municipality within the province, quite irrespective of whether the violation of any such prohibitory provisions constituted an offence under the Criminal Code or not. To give the language any other meaning, it seems to me, is tantamount to reading into the section a proviso that it shall not apply to any of those acts of negligence or prohibited acts if they were acts which were then or might subsequently be prohibited by the Criminal Code as well, and, with all deference, I cannot think that the mere fact that the section makes no mention of the Criminal Code has the same effect as if the Legislature had incorporated such an express proviso in the enactment.\nTo give the section such a construction would render of little value these insurance policies and all other similar policies, by which insurance companies specially agree to indemnify motor vehicle owners against losses caused by their own negligence or illegal acts, and for which they receive from the insured a special premium, and I have no doubt that this was the particular consideration which led the Alberta Legislature to enact the legislation in question,\nI construe the section as comprehending not only all degrees of negligence but all acts which the legislature has itself expressly prohibited and declared to be illegal or which any municipality within the province by by-law has prohibited, and hold, therefore, that the Legislature of Alberta has in effect declared that it shall be lawful in that province for an insurer to contract to indemnify a motor vehicle owner against liability to third persons, notwithstanding such liability may be the result of his driving the vehicle while intoxicated.\nIf I am right in this view it follows as a consequence that no Court can properly declare to be unlawful within the province of Alberta on grounds of public policy, these insurance contracts which the legislature has itself declared shall be lawful. The Legislature has settled, so far as the province of Alberta is concerned, any question of public policy which may be involved in the passage of the enactment referred to.\nI only wish to add that I entirely agree with the observations of Harvey, C.J., regarding the finding which the learned trial judge made as to Beattie being intoxicated, viz: that he did not direct his mind to the consideration of whether Beattie was liable criminally, and that on the evidence before him no judge or jury would have felt justified in convicting him of a crime. The trial judge's finding is based on what he believed to be the weight of evidence, and disregards the fact that the doctor whom the police called to examine Beattie and who examined him less than an hour after the accident, swore that he was sober.\nThe passage quoted in the majority opinion of this Court from the trial judge's reasons as apparently the principal ground of the finding of intoxication, while it no doubt discloses strong evidence of negligence on the part of Beattie, is by no means conclusive as to the fact of his having been intoxicated.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\n[1] [1933] 1 W.W.R. 334.\n[2] [1933] 1 W.W.R. 334.\n[3] [1921] 3 K.B. 327.\n[4] [1927] 2 K.B. 311.\n[5] 51 O.L.R. 130.\n[6] (1895) 24 Can.

Sask., 1930, c. 199, ss. 42 to 48.\nThe effect of section 126, of the Bankruptcy Act, H.S.C 1927, c. 11, is that in Saskatchewan the rights of a landlord on the bankruptcy of a tenant are governed by sections 42 to 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.S., 1930, c. 199.\nUnder the circumstances of this case the appellant, as landlord, was not entitled on the distribution of the property of his tenant, bankrupt, to a prior claim for money equal to three months\u2019 rent at the rate prescribed in the lease under the provisions of the above provincial Act. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2], Taylor J., and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe trial judge awarded the appellant the sum of $5,250 for three months\u2019 rent out of the assets of the Regina Trading Company, Limited, bankrupt, in the hands of the respondent as trustee, in priority to the claims of all other creditors.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nE. K. Williams K.C. for the appellant.\nF. L. Bastedo K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014As the appellant has abandoned its claim for damages the only question left for determination in this appeal is whether the appellant, as landlord, is entitled to enforce against the respondents a claim for money equal to three months\u2019 rent at the rate prescribed in the lease under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act of Saskatchewan, being chapter 199, R.S.S. 1930.\nThe relevant facts are as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant is the owner of a four-storey store building in the city of Regina. On the 22nd day of December, 1927, it leased its building and premises (except a small portion not material here) to the Regina Trading Company, Limited, for five years and two months, at a rental of $25,000 for the first year, and increasing each year. By a subsequent agreement the rent for the year commencing December 1st, 1931, was fixed at $21,000. On April 10th, 1931, the Regina Trading Company made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of its creditors and the respondent was appointed trustee in bankruptcy. The respondent (hereinafter called the trustee) took possession and proceeded to dispose of the assets. As the Regina Trading Company had known that an assignment for the benefit of its creditors was imminent and had decided to assign to the said trustee, the trustee, prior to April 10th, had been seeking to find a purchaser. It found a Mr. Cohen who was willing to buy both stock and fixtures at a price and on terms acceptable to the trustee. The Trading Company then assigned, the trustee was duly appointed and the goods sold to Cohen who took possession, under the trustee, on April 14th, and commenced, on the 16th, to conduct a sale of the bankrupt stock on the premises.\nAt the time the stock and fixtures were sold to Cohen he was informed by the trustee that he might occupy the appellant\u2019s premises free of rent until April 30th, 1931, as the rent to that date had been paid in advance. In addition there was a further verbal agreement between them to the effect that if the trustee was obliged to retain possession of the premises for the months of May, June and July, Cohen would take over the premises and pay the rent for that period.\nOn learning that Cohen was about to conduct a sale of bankrupt stock on its premises, the appellant, by letter, notified the trustee that it objected to this being done and stated that it would hold the trustee liable for any loss which it might sustain as a result of Cohen\u2019s occupation. To this the trustee, on April 17th, replied, and its letter in part reads as follows:\u2014\nWith regard to the present occupation of the premises, we think you will readily understand that unless the purchaser of the stock could dispose of at least a considerable portion of it in the premises it would be impossible for us, as trustees, to get rid of the stock at all, so that from a practical standpoint if a reasonable offer could be expected for the assets the disposition of a considerable portion of them in the building itself was requisite.\nOn April 22nd the trustee gave the appellant the following notice:\u2014\nWe beg to give you statutory notice of our intention to vacate the premises on 31st July, 1931.\nOn April 24th the appellant\u2019s solicitor wrote the trustee saying:\u2014\nWe have plans under way now for the converting the Trading Company building, so that we can get it in shape to rent in sufficient time to protect ourselves against loss. Under these circumstances, we shall require possession the first of next month.\nAs the Canadian Credit Men\u2019s Trust Association has disposed of the stock some time ago, we take the position that you are no longer entitled to remain in possession, and having disclaimed the lease you are not entitled to sublet to Cohen or any any other person. The real intention of the Act is to give the landlord a chance to make such changes as might be necessary and get new tenants, so that the landlord might as far as possible protect himself from loss by reason of the tenant having gone into liquidation. We wish to notify you, therefore, that if the premises are not vacated and made available for the workmen to start in on the first of next month, we shall hold you liable.\nOn April 28th the trustee notified Cohen that he must vacate the premises not later than midnight April 30th, and, on the following day, he wrote the appellant saying:\u2014\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th April containing notice to quit the Regina Trading Company premises as of the end of this month, we beg to confirm the fact, of which we believe you are already aware, that pursuant thereto we are having possession of the premises delivered up at that time.\nThe under-tenants have been notified according and we are not responsible for any over-holding on their part.\nTo put the matter in another way and to assure you of our intention as above, we hereby disclaim the lease.\nOn April 28th, after Cohen had received notice to vacate the premises on April 30th, he wrote to the appellant\u2019s solicitor that it would inconvenience him somewhat to vacate the premises on April 30th and he made an offer to pay $150 for the use of the premises for an additional two days (that is May 1st, and 2nd) in which to carry on business, and the right, until May 9th, to enter and remove his fixtures. This offer was accepted in writing and the money paid over. The appellant then demanded from the trustee the sum of $5,250, being three months\u2019 rent for the building at the rate due under the lease and agreement. This being refused the appellant brought this action.\nAt the trial judgment was given in favour of the appellant for the amount sued for. On appeal that judgment was set aside (Haultain C.J. dissenting) and the action dismissed with costs. Against that dismissal this appeal is brought.\nSection 126 of the Bankruptcy Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 11) provides that when a receiving order or an assignment is made against or by any lessee, under that Act the same consequences shall ensue as to the rights and priorities of his landlord as would have ensued under the laws of the province in which the demised premises are situated, if the lessee, at the time of such receiving order or assignment, had been a person entitled to make, and had made, a voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors pursuant to the laws of the province. It is, therefore, to the Landlord and Tenant Act, as enacted by the Saskatchewan legislature, that we must look for the rights and priorities of a landlord in that province. The provisions of the Act applicable in case of the bankruptcy of a tenant are sections 42 to 48 inclusive. The scheme of these provisions is to afford the landlord whose tenant has become bankrupt some protection in respect of unpaid rent and, at the same time, secure to the other creditors an equitable distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s property. This the legislature provides for by enacting that when a receiving order or an assignment is made by or against a lessee under the Bankruptcy Act and there is at the date of the order or assignment rent in arrear, and the lessee has goods and chattels on which the landlord has distrained, or is entitled to distrain, the landlord\u2019s right to realize his rent by distress ceases and the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to take possession of all the lessee\u2019s property, but, in the distribution of that property, the trustee shall pay to the landlord, in priority to all other debts, an amount not exceeding the value of the distrainable assets and not exceeding three months\u2019 rent accrued due prior to the date of the receiving order or assignment and the costs of the distress, if any (s. 42). If there is, at the date of the order or assignment, more than three months\u2019 rent due, the landlord may prove as a creditor for the excess (s. 43). Section 44 and section 45 (1) and (2), read as follows:\u2014\n44. The landlord shall not be entitled to prove as a creditor for rent for any portion of the unexpired term of the lease, but the trustee shall pay to the landlord for the period during which he actually occupies the leased premises from and after the date of the receiving order or assignment, a rental calculated on the basis of said lease.\n45. (l) The trustee shall be entitled to continue in occupation of the leased premises for so long as he shall require the premises for the purposes of the trust estate.\n(2) The trustee may surrender possession at any time, but the landlord shall be entitled to receive three months\u2019 notice in writing of the trustee\u2019s intention to surrender possession or three months\u2019 rent in lieu thereof, such three months to end with the last day of a calendar month. After the trustee surrenders possession, such of the landlord\u2019s rights as are based upon the actual occupation by the trustee shall cease.\nSection 46 deals with the right of the trustee to retain the leased premises for the unexpired part of the term and his right, upon the observance of certain conditions, to assign the lease.\nSection 47, in part, reads:\u2014\n47. The trustee shall have the further right, at any time before giving notice of intention to surrender possession, to disclaim any such lease, and his entry into possession of the leased premises and their occupation by him while required for the purposes of the trust estate shall not be deemed to be evidence of an intention on his part to elect to retain the premises nor affect his right to disclaim or to surrender possession pursuant to the provisions of this and the preceding sections.\nIn the case before us the rent was paid in advance until April 30th, sections 42 and 43 have, therefore, no application. The appellant, while relying chiefly on section 45 (2), makes the following contentions:\u2014\n1. That when the bankrupt stock was sold to Cohen the premises were no longer required for the purposes of the trust estate and the trustee had, therefore, no right to continue in possession or to give the possession to Cohen.\n2. That when the trustee surrendered possession of the premises on April 30th, the appellant was entitled to three months\u2019 notice of its intention to surrender, or three months\u2019 rent in lieu thereof, and, as the notice was not given, the appellant was entitled to three months\u2019 rent.\n3. That, in any event, the trustee was liable on the covenant in the lease to pay the rent by reason of the privity of estate between the trustee and the landlord and the case of the North-west Theatre Company v. MacKinnon,[3] was cited in support thereof.\nIn our opinion these contentions cannot be maintained. As to the first it may well be that if, upon the sale of the goods of the bankrupt, there is no agreement express or implied that the purchaser, as part of the bargain, is to be entitled to sell a portion of the goods of the bankrupt on the premises, the trustee would have no authority to put the purchaser in possession. With that question we are not concerned here. Where, however, the trustee in order to induce an offer of a higher price for the goods does agree that the purchaser shall be allowed a limited time to sell the stock or a portion thereof on the bankrupt tenant\u2019s premises, such agreement, we think, may reasonably be considered as being for the benefit of the trust estate. Under section 45 (1), therefore, the trustee was entitled to continue in possession and permit the purchaser to sell the bankrupt stock for the time agreed upon.\nThe second and third contentions must fail because the facts necessary to support them are wanting. Under section 45 (2) the landlord is to have three months\u2019 notice of surrender of possession, or three months\u2019 rent in lieu thereof. The object of this provision is to give the landlord, on the bankruptcy of his tenant, three months to secure another tenant without loss of rent. If the notice is given the trustee remains in occupation and pays rent. If the notice is not given, three months\u2019 rent is paid out of the bankrupt\u2019s estate in lieu thereof. Liability for this rent, however, is predicated on the fact that the notice has not been given.\nNow the fact is that on April 22nd, 1931, the trustee did give notice of its intention to vacate on July 31st, but the appellant refused to permit the trustee to remain in possession, and demanded that possession be given up on April 30th. The trustee acquiesced and surrendered possession on that day. This surrender of possession, therefore, resulted from a notice by the landlord to vacate and a compliance therewith by the trustee, and was followed by the landlord not only itself taking possession of the premises but of re-leasing them to Cohen. It is true that the trustee did not give three months\u2019 notice of an intention to surrender possession on April 30th. That was impossible when it obtained possession only on April 14th. In our opinion the provision for the payment of three months\u2019 rent in lieu of a notice of intention to surrender, provided for by section 45 (2), has no application when possession is surrendered pursuant to a notice to quit on the part of the landlord, or by reason of an agreement between the parties.\nThe privity of estate which, it is argued, arose between the trustee and the landlord on the acceptance by the trustee of the assignment and rendered the trustee liable for the rent for the unexpired portion of the lease, can have no effect, even assuming the privity to exist, where the trustee disclaims the lease as provided by the statute or the landlord, expressly or by some unequivocal act, accepts a surrender thereof. It is established law that delivery of possession by the tenant to the landlord and the landlord\u2019s acceptance of possession, effects a surrender of the lease by operation of law. Here we think that the demand for possession by the landlord, and his putting Cohen in possession for two days for a monetary consideration, after the trustee had not only agreed to vacate but had actually vacated, is a sufficiently unequivocal act to constitute an acceptance of the surrender of the lease. Phen\u00e9 v. Popplewell and Another (1), Oastler v. Henderson (2).\nIt might further be pointed out that by its letter of April 24th the appellant acknowledges that the trustee had disclaimed the lease. The formal disclaimer appears in the trustee\u2019s letter of April 29th, but, evidently, the appellant had received notice thereof by April 24th.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Barr, Stewart & Cumming.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacKenzie, Thom, Bastedo & Jackson.\n[1] [1933] 1 W.W.R. 492.\n[2] [1932] 2 W.W.R. 692.\n[3] (1915) 52 Can.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: October 4; 1933: December 22.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Crocket JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nStatute\u2014Interpretation\u2014Mining\u2014Forfeiture of leases\u2014Sections 110 and 114 of the Placer\u2014mining Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 169\u2014Whether irreconcilable.\nSections 110 and 114 of the Placer-mining Act, R.S.B.C, 1924, c. 169, are not irreconcilable and there is no conflict between them. Each one of these sections has its respective application according to the circumstances of each case. Section 110 imparts a statutory declaration of forfeiture in certain well defined cases of breach therein specified; while section 114 covers all other cases of non-performance or nonobservance. In cases of forfeiture specifically mentioned in section 110, the lease is ipso facto void: the necessity of a declaration by the Gold Commissioner approved by the Minister of Mines is excluded, as absolute forfeiture operates automatically.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming on an equal division the judgment of the Supreme Court, D. A. Macdonald J.[1] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nH. A. Beckwith for the appellant.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014This action was tried upon a special case stated by the parties.\nThe main point involved is whether the respondent, who holds by assignment a placer lease in the mining division of Atlin Lake, has forfeited its rights under the lease, so that the ground became open to re-location by the appellants. The trial judge in the Supreme Court held that there was no forfeiture[2]. In the Court of Appeal, his decision stood affirmed on an equal division of the judges.\nThe lease was made on the 30th day of September, 1922, by the Gold Commissioner for the Atlin Lake Mining Division as lessor. It provided that the lessee should pay a yearly rent in advance to the Mining Recorder; that he would\nobserve, make, and keep all and singular the provisions, payments, conditions, and stipulations of the said Placer-mining Act and amending Acts, and other the laws for the time being in force in the province in relation to mining.\nIt was granted upon the express condition that the lessee would work and mine for the precious metals upon the premises demised and would expend two hundred and fifty dollars at least in each and every year during the continuance of the term, and further would\nsatisfy the Mining Recorder that such development-work has been done by the affidavit of the lessee or his agent setting out a detailed statement of the work done, and shall obtain from the said Mining Recorder a certificate of such work having been done, and shall record the same before the expiration of each and every year of the term hereby demised.\nThe respondent did not pay any rent, did not expend the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, or any sum, in the development-work, and consequently did not satisfy the Mining Recorder that the development-work had been done, as required by the lease, did not obtain from the Mining Recorder any certificate of work and did not have any recorded.\nAs a result, on the 1st of October, 1930, the Gold Commissioner issued a certificate that the lessee was in default; and thereupon the Mining Recorder cancelled the record of the lease and noted the cancellation on the copy of the said lease on file. After the cancellation, the lessee made several attempts to pay the rent; but the Mining Recorder, the Gold Commissioner and the Minister of Mines in turn refused to accept it, on the ground that it had not been paid in time. The Minister of Mines has not formally declared the lease forfeited or approved any forfeiture thereof; but he has, at all times adopted the attitude that, by reason of the lessee's default, the lease automatically became forfeited and void, and the Minister had no power to act in the matter. The question for the opinion of the court is whether the lease has been forfeited under the circumstances.\nThe decision turns upon the interpretation of subsection 5 of section 110 of the Placer-mining Act (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 169), which reads as follows:\n(5) If the development-work required by this section is not done in any year, or if the lessee fails to obtain or record the certificate required in any year, or if the annual rental payable under the lease or any part thereof remains unpaid after the day on which it becomes payable, the lease shall be deemed forfeited and the demised premises shall be deemed vacant and abandoned without any re-entry, declaration or forfeiture, or other act on the part of the lessor, Gold Commissioner, or otherwise, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding. Upon receipt of a certificate from the Gold Commissioner that the lessee is in default in respect of the doing or recording of development-work in respect of the lease, or that the annual rental in respect of the lease is in default, the Mining Recorder, in whose office a copy of the lease is filed shall cancel the record of the lease and note the cancellation on the copy of the lease on file.\nIt is clear that the parties intended the lease to be entered into under the authority of that section. The material provisions of the section are reproduced verbatim in the lease of which they are made an express condition.\nIt is to be noted that, by force of the statute, in the event of certain specified defaults, \" the lease shall be deemed forfeited,\" \" the demised premises shall be deemed vacant and abandoned,\" \" without any re-entry,\" without \" any declaration of forfeiture,\" without any \" other act on the part of the lessor *** or otherwise,\" \" any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\nIn our view, the enactment so worded provides for an absolute forfeiture operating automatically. Immediately upon the happening of any of the specified breaches, the lease is ipso facto void, without any necessity for a declaration or for any further act to be done by anybody. The words used by the legislature show, we think, the clear intention to exclude the rule laid down in Davenport v. The Queen[3].\nThe lessee is not left without means of relief or of reinstatement, but the manner in which relief may be granted or reinstatement may be obtained is specifically dealt with in other sections of the statute. It is not apparent that power is given to grant it otherwise. Suffice it to say that, in the premises, the lessee has not brought himself within the conditions essentially required to obtain reinstatement and we are not dealing with an application for relief.\nIn this case, we may go further and we may say that there were, on behalf of the lessor, unequivocal acts evincing his intention to avoid the lease (Roberts v. Davey)[4]. The Gold Commissioner (who was actually the lessor) issued his certificate that the lessee was in default. The Mining Recorder thereupon cancelled the record and noted the cancellation on the copy of the lease on file. The Mining Recorder promptly returned to the lessee the money remitted for rental, as not having been paid on time. From then on, the lessee was explicitly notified of the stand taken by the lessor. Later, the money for rental was tendered to the Minister of Mines, who received it subject to the acceptance of the Gold Commissioner. The Gold Commissioner ruled that the same was not paid in time and that the lease had, by reason of the lessee's delay, lapsed and become void. The tendered money was thereupon returned to the lessee. It is conceded that the Minister\nhas at all times adopted the attitude that, by reason of plaintiff's default, the said lease automatically became forfeited and void and that the Minister had no power to act in the matter.\nShould it be held that the respondent's default did not absolutely determine the lease, and only made it voidable at the election of the landlord, yet we would think that by the acts just enumerated the landlord has unequivocally indicated his intention and he has exercised his option.\nIt remains to consider the effect of subsection 1 of section 114 of the Placer-mining Act reading as follows:\n114. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), on the non-performance or non-observance of any convenant or condition in any lease, the lease shall be declared forfeited by the Gold Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Minister of Mines, unless good cause is shown to the contrary. After any such declaration of forfeiture, the mining ground shall be open for location by any free miner. No lease shall be declared forfeited, except in accordance with this section.\nIt was argued that this is a case to which this subsection applies and, if so, that the Minister of Mines has not given his approval.\nWe are unable to accede to the argument. Subsection 1 of section 114 provides generally for all cases of\nNon-performance or non-observance of any covenant or condition in any lease.\nIt enacts that, in all such cases, there must be a declaration of forfeiture, \"subject to the approval of the Minister of Mines.\" Only after such declaration, shall the mining ground \"be open for location by any free miner.\"\nSubsection 5 of section 110 is restricted to forfeitures arising out of the particular breaches of covenant therein specified. It deals explicitly with the question of declaration and it says that, in the cases specifically mentioned, no declaration of forfeiture shall be required. It operates therefore as an exception. And it must be so or else-if subsection 1 of section 114 was held to be an absolute rule applying in every case-subsection 5 of section 110 would never come into operation. We do not find any conflict between the two sections. Section 110 imparts a statutory declaration of forfeiture in certain well defined cases of breach. Section 114 covers all other cases of non-performance or non-observance. In the latter cases, there must be \"a declaration by the Gold Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Minister of Mines.\" And the enactment says that wherever a declaration of forfeiture is required, that declaration must be \"in accordance with this section.\" But, in the particular cases provided for by subsection 5 of section 110, the necessity for a declaration is excluded. It says there is to be a forfeiture without declaration.\nIt may be further pointed out that, in the terms of the statute, the provisions of section 110 apply only to \"leases issued on or after the first day of July, 1920, pursuant to\" the Placer-mining Act. (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 169.)\nOur conclusion is that the appeal ought to be allowed and that the question must be answered in the affirmative. Accordingly judgment shall be entered for the defendants dismissing the plaintiff's action, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. A.

The action was brought by the respondent, the daughter of the assured and named beneficiary, against the insurer, the appellant company, on a policy of insurance commonly called an accident policy. On the 11th day of December, 1931, the assured fell from a platform, was seriously injured, his leg being broken, and was removed to hospital; later on, a condition of uraemia ensued which resulted in his death on the 23rd of December, 1931. At the time of the accident, the assured was 70 years of age. The application for the insurance was made six years before and his age was stated then to be 54. One of the \"miscellaneous provisions\" (No. 5) at the end of the policy provided: \"The insurance under this policy shall not cover any person under the age of 18 years or over the age of 65 years.\" The trial judge dismissed the action, which judgment was reversed by a majority judgment of the Appellate Division, which awarded to the respondent the sum of $7,675, interests and moists.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division ([1933] 1 W.W.R. 282), that the appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action, dismissed; miscellaneous provision No. 5 of the policy is, under the circumstances of the case, a bar to the claim of the respondent.\nPer Duff C.J. and Lamont, Smith and Hughes JJ.\u2014The assured had made a material misrepresentation as to his age in the application for insurance as found by the trial judge, which finding was not disturbed by the Appellate Court, but, under the circumstances of this case, this material misrepresentation made by the assured was not available to the appellant company as a defence to the action\u2014Statutory provision 2 printed in the policy and section 267 and statutory condition 2, schedule E of the Alberta Insurance Act, 1926. The misrepresentation by the (assured was not a warranty and was not promissory.\nUnder the circumstances of this case and the documents and letters fyled at the trial, there was no election by the appellant company to treat the insurance policy as valid\u2014Scarf v. Jardine, 7 App. Cas. 345); and therefore the appellant did not waive by election miscellaneous provision 5 of the policy.\nAs to the ground raised by the respondent that miscellaneous provision 5 came within section 8 of the Accident and Sickness Policy Act, Alberta, 1923, c. 48, and therefore \"shall be printed in conspicuous type * * * and in red ink,\" held that miscellaneous provision 5 is a clause limiting and defining the risk rather than a variation of the statutory conditions.\nThe enactment of section 4 of the Accident and Sickness Policy Act, Alberta, 1923, does not preclude the parties to an insurance contract from exercising the right they otherwise would have possessed to define or limit the risk in the manner set out in miscellaneous provision 5; in other words, this section 4 does not curtail the contracting powers of the parties in such a way as to prevent them from defining or limiting the risk, \"the event insured against,\" by providing that it shall not include events happening, after a fixed date or after the insured shall have reached a certain age.\nHowever, the cause of death must be held to have been within the wording of the policy; but even if it was not so, the loss would probably be covered by the wide wording of section 4 of the 1923 Act already referred to.\nCANNON J., concurring in the conclusion that the respondent's action should be dismissed, was of the opinion that the assured, being 70 years old when the accident happened, was outside the scope of the contract on which the action was based.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action on an accident policy. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nV. Evan Gray K.C. and F. A. Brewin for the appellant.\nRobert S. McKay for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Lamont, Smith and Hughes JJ. was delivered by\nHUGHES J.\u2014This action was brought by the named beneficiary against the insurer on a policy of insurance commonly called an accident policy. The assured was Arthur C. Casey, the father of the beneficiary.\nOn the 11th day of December, 1931, the assured fell from a platform. He was seriously injured and was removed to hospital where he died on the 23rd day of December, 1931. At the time of the accident the assured was seventy years of age.\nSome of the material provisions of the policy are as follows:\nThe Continental Casualty Company\nGeneral office: Chicago, Illinois. Head office for Canada, Toronto.\nHereinafter called the Company\nIn consideration of the agreements and statements contained in the application herefor and the payment of an annual premium of $25 as therein provided, does on this 13th day of June, A.D. 1925, hereby insure Mr. Arthur C. Casey (hereinafter called the insured), in class.\u2026select of the Company, as a manager, Alazhar Temple, office and travelling duties only, in the principal sum of seventy-five hundred dollars with weekly indemnity of twenty-five dollars, and promises to pay to him or his beneficiary Amy B. Casey his daughter the respective indemnities hereinafter provided.\nThe insurance given by this policy is against loss of life, limb, limbs, sight or time resulting from personal bodily injury (suicide or self-destruction while either sane tor insane not included), which is effected solely and independently of all other causes by the happening of a purely accidental event, all in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided.\nSpecific Indemnity\nPart I.\nIf injury such as before described shall at once after the occurrence of the accidental event wholly and continuously disable the insured from performing each and every duty pertaining to his occupation, and if during the period of such total and continuous disability any one of the following losses shall result to the insured necessarily and solely from the injury, the Company will pay the indemnity hereinafter provided, and in addition will pay said weekly indemnity for the period of the preceding disability; or, if any one of said losses shall result to the insured necessarily and solely from such injury within one hundred and eighty days from the occurrence of the accidental event causing the injury, then the Company will pay the indemnity hereinafter provided irrespective of disability preceding the loss.\nA. For loss of life said principal sum\nAnd in addition all premium previously paid on this policy\nMiscellaneous provisions\nNo. 1. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions. No assignment of this policy or of any claim arising thereunder and no waiver or change of any of its provisions, definitions or limits shall be valid unless approved in writing by an executive officer of the Company and such approval endorsed hereon.\n5. The insurance under this policy shall not cover any person under the age of eighteen years or over the age of sixty-five years. Any premium paid to the Company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request.\n8. The insurance given by this policy does not cover, nor will indemnity be paid for, any loss resulting from injury received(1) while engaged in aeronautics in any form;(2) while in military or naval service in time of war; or(3) while not within the civilized limits of the globe unless it be while travelling by regular lines of passenger conveyance.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ives who dismissed the action on the following grounds, firstly, that uraemia caused the death and that it resulted from a combination of the accident with certain pre-existing active diseases of the body; secondly, that the assured had made a material misrepresentation in the application that he was fifty-four years of age when he was in fact sixty-four years of age and, lastly, that the insurance contract ceased to cover the risk after the insured reached the age of sixty-five years.\nFrom this judgment, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[3], which reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge by a majority judgment. Chief Justice Harvey considered that the death was covered by the terms of the policy; that, if the assured had made a material misrepresentation, the defendant had elected after knowledge of the falsity and after the death to treat the insurance as valid until the assured was sixty-five years of age and that it was bound by its election and, lastly, that miscellaneous provision 5 was a condition and void because it was not printed in red ink as required by the statute in that behalf. Mr. Justice Clarke, Mr. Justice Mitchell and Mr. Justice Lunney concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nMr. Justice McGillivray was of opinion that the death was covered by the terms of the policy, that the assured had made a material misrepresentation as to his age, that the defendant had elected after knowledge of the falsity and after the death to treat the insurance as valid until the assured was sixty-five years of age and that it was bound by its election; but he dissented from the remaining members of the Court on the effect of miscellaneous provision 5, which he considered a provision defining and limiting the risk. He was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe result of the majority judgment was that the appeal was allowed with costs and the plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant for $7,675 with interest and costs.\nFrom this judgment the defendant appeals to this Court.\nIt was contended before us by the appellant,\n1. That the assured had made a material misrepresentation in the application and that there was no election by the appelant.\n2. That miscellaneous provision 5 was a provision defining and limiting the risk and not a condition.\n3. That the loss of life of the date Arthur C. Casey was not effected solely or independently of all other causes by the happening of a purely accidental event.\nAll of these contentions were denied by the respondent.\n1. The learned trial judge found that the late Arthur C. Casey has made a material misrepresentation as to his age in the application for insurance. This finding was not disturbed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and no valid reason is disclosed to disturb it here.\nAs to election, the rule was stated in the House of Lords by Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[4] in the following words:\u2014\nThe principle, I take it, running through all the cases as to what is an election is this, that where a party in his own mind has thought that he would choose one of two remedies, even though he has written it down on a memorandum or has indicated it in some other way, that alone will not bind him; but so soon as he has not only determined to follow one of his remedies but has communicated it to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made that choice, he has completed his election and can, go no further; and whether he intended it or not, if he has done an unequivocal act\u2014I mean an act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way\u2014the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the persons concerned is an election.\nOn February 9th, 1932, the appellant prepared a draft for $151.23, payment of which was stated on its face to be conditional upon surrender of the policy and execution by the respondent of a receipt worded in part as follows:\nIn full compromise, payment, satisfaction, discharge and release of any and all claims * * * under policy or certificate 2719.\nSecond\u2014In consideration of the surrender by me of said policy.\nThird\u2014As full consideration for the unearned premium or money heretofore paid on said policy or certificate.\nThe above draft was sent to the solicitor of the respondent in a letter dated February 9th, 1932, from Chas. E. Hanslip, who styled himself chief adjuster, which letter read in part as follows:\nWe would also refer you to section 5 of part XI, miscellaneous provisions of the policy, which reads as follows:\nInsurance under this policy shall not cover any person under the age of 18 years or over the age of 65 years. Any premium paid to the company for any period not covered by this policy will be returned upon request * * * The indemnity payable, therefore, if covered by the policy, would only be for the loss of time intervening between the date of injury and date of death * * *\nWe also find that the deceased was born on May 25th in the year 1861, so that he was 70 years, 6 months and 17 days of age when he became disabled on December 11th last. The policy is dated June 13th, 1925, and if you will refer to statement no. 2 of has signed application, copy of which is endorsed on the policy and made a part thereof, you will observe the age was stated to be 54 years. The deceased, however, had already passed his 64th birthday when he made application for our policy in June of 1925, and as he attained the age limit of 65 on May 25th in the year 1926, the policy therefore has been null and void since that date, as provided by section 5 of the miscellaneous provisions referred to herein.\nYou will therefore understand in view of the foregoing that the claim is not covered, the policy having been null and void since May 25th of 1926, and as the premiums paid since that time amount to $151.23, we are pleased to enclose out draft for this sum, made payable to the order of Amy B. Casey, the beneficiary of the Deceased, to which the policy should be attached when being deposited in the bank for collection.\nThe remaining correspondence is with the general manager of the appellant.\nOn the 29th day of February, 1932, the appellant wrote the solicitor of the respondent a letter reading in part as follows:\nI take it that we are agreed that the deceased had attained the age of 70 years and 6 months at the time he sustained injuries on December 11th, 1931, and that our policy contains an age limit of 65 years. The age limit in the policy is a limitation, and is not a variation of or an addition to the statutory conditions. The Act does not require us to print, in red ink, exclusions or limitations which may be part of the policy.\n* * *\nConsidering that the immediate cause of death was uraemia, and that he was afflicted with an enlarged prostate, myocarditis and arteriosclerosis, the loss of life was not caused \"solely and independently of all other causes\" by the happening of a purely accidental event, as provided by the policy.\n* * *\nAt the time the application for this policy was signed, he was in his 65th year. The statement, in his application, as to age was material to the acceptance of the risk by the company, and if his true age had been stated, the policy would not have been issued.\nAfter considering all of the circumstances, I am sure that you will agree with me that the limit of our liability is a refund of the premium paid on the policy, which has already been forwarded.\nTo this letter the solicitor of the respondent on the 2nd day of May, 1932, wrote a reply stating fully his views in support of the respondent's claim. The letter concluded with the following request that the appellant should further consider the matter:\nI am sure that after further consideration of the matter you will agree with me that the company is liable to pay the beneficiary the full indemnities under the policy and I would be glad if you would give the matter your early consideration. If however you decide that you are not prepared to make settlement I would ask you to advise me as soon as possible and in that case it will be necessary to have the matter decided by the courts. In order to save time I would appreciate it if you would let me have the names of your solicitors here in Calgary who would accept service of the statement of claim on your behalf.\nThe solicitor of the respondent again wrote on the 23rd day of May, 1932, and submitted further authorities to the appellant.\nOn May 31st, 1932, the appellant wrote to the solicitor of the respondent a reply reading in part as follows:\nWe have your letter of May 2nd, 1932, which we have carefully considered, although we believe you have gone rather far afield in your consideration of points of law which may arise in the litigation of it.\nIf we believed in the merits of this claim, you would not need to quote authorities at such length to persuade us to pay it, but believing, as we do, that there never was a binding contract because of misrepresentations contained in the application and that the cause of death was not an accident, within the meaning of our contract, we cannot be persuaded by your citations of legal decisions, in other cases, that the claim ought to be paid.\n* * *\nHowever interested you may have become in the pursuit of the technical features of this contract, and the decisions which seem to you to relate to them, you will appreciate that this company never undertook to pay and cannot be expected to pay a claim for principal sum under an accident policy on the life of a man seventy years of age who died from uraemia and myocarditis.\nThe draft sent by the appellant was retained by the solicitor of the respondent but not cashed. The offer of this draft by the appellant can scarcely be termed an unequivocal act within the rule as stated by Lord Blackburn in Scarf v. Jardine[5], as its payment was conditional upon its acceptance by the respondent as a compromise as well as a payment of all claims. The letter, moreover, in which it was enclosed and upon which the respondent relies strongly to shew election, was from one, Chas. E. Hanslip, who styled himself chief adjuster. There was no evidence that Chas. E. Hanslip had any authority to make an election for the appellant. In British Empire Underwriters v. Wampler[6], Duff J., now Chief Justice of Canada, said,\nThere is not, I think, any satisfactory evidence of authority reposed in the adjuster to enter into a contract to pay and it appears to me to be more than doubtful whether the facts relied upon establish a contract even assuming such authority.\nAnd in the same case, page 598, Anglin J. afterwards Chief Justice of Canada said,\nIn the absence of express authority enabling an employee such as Marsh was to commit the company to a liability not covered by its policy, I cannot conceive that it is within the scope of his powers to do so-.\nAtlas Assurance Co. v. Brownell[7]. Commercial Union v. Margeson 29[8]. As late as May 2nd, 1932, the solicitor of the respondent, as appears above, urged further consideration of the claim to full indemnities and on May 23rd, 1932, submitted further authorities in support. It cannot be said, in the words of Lord Blackburn, that the appellant led the respondent to believe that it had made its choice to consider the policy valid and subsisting until the 25th day of May, 1926. The correspondence as a whole does not assist the respondent when read with the draft, or without the draft, the substantial effect being that the appellant was offering the draft both as a compromise and a payment with a reservation of its contention that the appellant was not liable on the policy at all and the solicitor of the respondent was endeavouring to secure more fav- ourable consideration. It is worthy of note in this connection that the last pleading of the respondent was delivered on the 21st day of July, 1932, but that election was not mentioned in the pleadings until it was incorporated by amendment at the opening at the trial on the 3rd day of November, 1932.\nElection has been discussed here at some length, because the respondent contended that by this means the appellant had also waived miscellaneous provision 5 of the policy.\nThe material misrepresentation made by the insured, however, is not available to the appellant as a defence to the action.\nStatutory provision 2 printed in the policy reads as follows:\n2. All statements made by the Insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties. No such statement shall be used in defence to a claim under this policy unless it is contained in the copy of the application for this policy which is endorsed hereon or attached hereto.\nSection 267 of The Alberta Insurance Act, 1926, which was in force at the time of the last renewal and at the time of the death of the late Arthur C. Casey reads as follows:\n267. The conditions set forth in schedule E to this Act shall be deemed, subject to the provisions of sections 268 to 272, to be part of every contract of accident and sickness insurance in force in Alberta, and shall be printed on every policy hereafter issued under the heading \"Statutory Conditions.\"\nStatutory condition 2, schedule E, reads as follows:\n2. All statements made by the insured upon the application for this policy shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties, and no such statement shall be used in defence of a claim under this policy unless it is contained in the written application for the policy and unless a copy of the application, or such part thereof as is material to the contract, is indorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued.\nThe appellant contended before us that a copy of such part of the application as was material to the contract was indorsed upon or attached to the policy within the wording of the statute. But the indorsement on the policy omitted the particulars of the kind of insurance applied for and the amount thereof, and further the indorsement contained at least one material alteration and addition made without authority by the appellant. The words \"office and travelling duties only\" were added after the words \"Manager, Alazhar Temple\" which latter words had constituted the statement of the applicant to question 4\u2014Occupation and duties. The words \"No Exceptions\" were inserted by the appellant without authority as the statement of the assured to questions 10 and 14, respectively, of the application in response to which the applicant had not made any statement at all. It is not necessary to consider the unauthorized additions to 10 and 14 because the omission by the appellant from the indorsement on the policy purporting to be a copy of the application or such part as was material to the contract of the particulars of the kind of insurance applied for and the amount thereof was an omission of material parts of the application; and, further, the addition of the words \"office and travelling duties only\" was an unauthorized material alteration. It is worthy of note that the appellant considered the latter words false and material when it delivered its statement of defence on the 13th day of July, 1932, paragraphs 22 and 23 of which were as follows:\n22. Some of the said statements were false and materially affected the acceptance of the risk and the hazard assumed by the Defendant.\n23. The statement that his occupation was manager of Alazhar Temple, and that his duties consisted of office and travelling duties only was false, as he had other and more hazardous duties to perform, one of which he was performing at the time of the accident.\nThe appellant, however, urged that, in any event, the misrepresentation as to age formed a basis of the contract of insurance and bound the respondent when suing to enforce the contract and referred us to the following authorities.\nSt. Regis Pastry Shop and Baumgartner v. Continental Casualty Co.[9]. In this case there was not a written application at all.\nNewsholme Brothers v. Road Transport and General Insurance Company Limited[10]. In this case the proposal form contained the following clause\nWe hereby warrant that the answers stated above are true, that we have withheld no information which might influence the acceptance of this proposal and that the warranty hereby given shall be deemed to be promissory and shall be the basis of the contract between us and the company.\nSome of the answers were untrue in material respects and the plaintiff failed. In the case before us, however, the mis- representation was not a warranty and was not promissory. Dorst v. Trans Canada Insurance Company[11]. In this case, there was not a written application and the false statement of the insured was promissory in nature. The exact wording of it was as follows: \"The automobile is and will be usually kept in a Public or Private-Both-Garage.\" In truth, the automobile was not kept in a garage. It was usually kept in an open driveway and that is where it was on the night it was stolen and burned.\n2. Miscellaneous provision 5.\nThe respondent urged that miscellaneous provision 5 came within section 8 of The Accident and Sickness Policy Act, Statutes of Alberta, 1923, chapter 48, which read as follows:\n8. (1). If an insurer desires to vary, omit or add to the statutory conditions or any of them except as provided in sections 6 and 7 there shall be printed in conspicuous type not less in size than ten point, and in red ink, immediately after such conditions, the proposed variations or additions or a reference to the omissions, with these introductory words: \"This policy is issued on the above statutory conditions with the following variations, omissions and additions which are, by virtue of The Accident and Sickness Policy Act, in force so far only as they may be held to be just and reasonable to be exacted by the insurer\n(2). No variation, omission or addition except as provided in sections 6 and 7 shall be binding upon the insured unless the foregoing provisions of this section have been complied with, and any variation, omission or addition shall be so binding only in so far as it is held by the Court before which a question relating thereto is tried, to be just and reasonable.\nNone of the statutory conditions deal with such a subject as that covered by miscellaneous provision 5. In Curtis's and Harvey (Canada) Limited, in Liquidation and North British and Mercantile Insurance Company Limited[12] Lord Dunedin said, page 312:\nTheir Lordships think that it is the policy of the statute to make a hard-and-fast rule that every fire policy shall have attached to it these statutory conditions, and that they cannot be varied so as to be binding on the insured, unless the variations are authenticated in the prescribed manner. The result will be that, if not varied, they remain in full force, but any other stipulation and covenant which may define or limit the risk and also receive effect in so far as it does not contradict the statutory conditions which are paramount. Applying this view to the question in hand, the insurers are warranted free from explosions of' every sort except such explosion as is provided for by statutory condition 11. Now statutory condition 11, as already stated, only deals with an explosion originating a fire, and does not deal with the case of an explosion incidental to a fire. It follows that the present case is mot touched by statutory condition 11, and the warranty free from explosion can have effect.\nSee, also, The London Assurance Corporation v. The Great Northern Transit Company[13], Ross v. Scottish Union and National Insurance Company[14], and The W. Malcolm Mackay Company v. The British America Assurance Company[15].\nI am of opinion that miscellaneous provision 5, like miscellaneous provision 8, is a clause limiting and defining the risk rather than a variation of the statutory conditions.\nThe respondent contended, however, that miscellaneous provision 5 was invalid by virtue of section 4 of The Accident and Sickness Policy Act, statutes of Alberta, 1923, chapter 48, which read as follows:\n4. In every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, 'condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nThis statute was repealed in 1926 and section 4 re-enacted as section 266 of The Alberta Insurance Act, statutes of Alberta, 1926, chapter 31. The latter section was repealed by The Alberta Insurance Act, 1926, Amendment Act, 1929, chapter 62, section 10, and a new section 266 substituted as follows:\n266. Every policy shall contain the names and address of the insurer, the name and address and occupation or business of the insured, the name of the person to whom the insurance money is payable, the premium for the insurance, the indemnity for which the insurer may become liable, the event on the happening of which such liability is to accrue, and the term of the insurance.\nAt the time of the last renewal and at the death of the insured, The Interpretation Act, R.S. of Alberta, 1922, chapter 1, was in force. Section 13 (b) of that Act provided as follows:\n13. Whenever any enactment is repealed or regulation revoked (hereinafter called the old enactment or regulation), such repeal or revocation shall not, subject to section 14 hereof\u2014\n(b) Affect any act done, or right or liability accruing or accrued or incurred under the old enactment or regulation. The respondent contended that the event insured against included \"any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency,\" as provided in section 4 of the 1923 Act, that section 4 restricted the right of the insurer to define or limit the risk beyond the words \"the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy,\" that the accident to the late Arthur C. Casey did not arise from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy, that miscellaneous provision 5 was an exclusion not permitted by section 4, and that the subsequent repeal of section 4 did not affect the rights and liabilities of the parties accruing or accrued or incurred respectively under it at the time the policy was written and thereafter as long as it remained in force.\nMain v. Stark[16]; Reynolds v. The Attorney-General for Nova Scotia[17]; Green v. Blackburn[18], and Abell v. The Corporation of the Township of York[19].\nIt is important, then, to determine whether the insurance was provided by a continuing contract to which the 1923 Act applied or by a new contract each year.\nThe policy insured Arthur C. Casey\nin consideration of the agreements and statements contained in the application and the payment of an annual premium of $25 as therein provided.\nOne agreement in the application was as follows:\nI agree to pay an annual premium of $25 for said policy as follows: Annually.\nThe first renewal receipt dated April 26th, 1926, was worded in part as follows:\nReceived of A. C. Casey $25 * * * being the yearly premium to continue Policy No. C.D. 2719 in force to June 1st, 1927, subject to the provisions and conditions stated in the policy.\nOn June 20th, 1931, the Alberta managers of the appellant wrote the late Arthur C. Casey in part as follows:\nWe acknowledge receipt of your cheque in the amount of $25 being an annual premium on Commercial policy of the above name and number. We are enclosing herewith Renewal Certificate No. R. 268721 shewing your contract in good standing until the thirteenth of June, 1932.\nThe appellant urged before us that the insurer had a right to refuse to accept the premium for any renewal and that each renewal, including the renewal of June, 1931, constituted a new contract and that accordingly the statute law applicable to the case was as it existed at the time of the last renewal, namely in June, 1931. It is true that each party had a statutory right to cancel the policy at any time, but neither party did in fact cancel it, and it is by no means clear that the insurer had a right to refuse to accept premium, properly tendered, for any renewal of the policy on the facts of this case. Joyce on Insurance, volume 2, page 1122. I am of opinion that each renewal did not constitute a new contract, but was a continuation of the original contract. Howard v. Lancashire Insurance Company[20], Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Co. v. Agricultural Savings and Loan Co.[21], Royal Exchange Assurance Co. v. Hope[22].\nIt is now necessary to consider whether section 4 of the 1923 Act did really preclude the parties to the contract from exercising the right they otherwise would have possessed to define or limit the risk in the manner set out in miscellaneous provision 5. Section 4 deals with the scope of the risk\u2014\"the event insured against\"\u2014in this sense that it extends the coverage to bodily injuries of every kind occasioned or happening in the manner indicated notwithstanding any term of the policy; and it goes on to provide that from this wide field there may be excluded accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard specially described. The primary subject matter of the section is the kind or nature of the bodily injuries in respect of which the insured is covered, and the coverage is declared to include bodily injuries of every description subject to the proviso mentioned. It is quite clear that the enactment of this section dealing with this subject matter does not curtail the contracting powers of the parties in such a way as to prevent them from defining or limiting the risk\u2014 \"the event insured against\"\u2014by providing that it shall not include events happening after a fixed date or after the insured shall have reached a certain age.\n3. Cause of Death.\nAs mentioned above, the learned trial judge found that uraemia, which caused the death of the late Arthur C. Casey, resulted from a combination of the accident with certain pre-existing active and not latent diseases of the body, that therefore, the death of the insured was not from accident within the meaning of the policy and that the case was distinguishable from Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York v. Mitchell[23].\nThis finding of the learned trial judge was not affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. Chief Justice Harvey stated in his reasons for judgment:\nAssuming that upon the construction placed by the learned trial judge upon the relevant clause of the policy, this case could be distinguished from the authoritative decision, as regards which there is room for argument, yet, in my opinion, there was a wrong construction of the clause.\nMr. Justice McGillivray said:\nMy Lord, the Chief Justice, has set out the facts with admirable succinctness. I have nothing to add to his statement. I agree that the accident was the cause of the death,\nand he later proceeded to deal with Miscellaneous Provision 5.\nIt was admitted by the appellant that the late Arthur C. Casey had fallen (from a scaffold) a distance of about five feet to a cement floor and that he had sustained a compound fracture of the leg. The evidence of Dr. Follett was that the general condition of the man prior to the accident had been very good. In December, 1928, he had consulted Dr. Follett, who appeared to have been his regular physician, for myocarditis\u2014a weakness of the muscles of the heart\u2014 and he had had a consultation again in September, 1931. For this condition he had been taking Tr. Digitalis once in a while for three or four years. The condition of the heart was serious but it did not incapacitate the patient from doing his work. The physician had not been consulted in respect of any other ailments and did not know that the patient had an enlarged prostate until after the accident. The patient then told Dr. Follett that he had an enlarged prostate for about two years but there is no evidence in the record that he had been unable to void before the accident. He was, however, thereafter unable to void and a catheter was tied in. For the first three or four days he seemed to do very well, but in six or seven days infection spread locally, gradually went thorugh the system and, forty-eight hours before death, the patient became unconscious. Dr. Follett said that the patient had never suffered from uraemia to his knowledge prior to the accident and that he would think that the infection of the kidneys came from the wound. There was also well-marked arteriosclerosis, which injuriously affects the functioning of kidneys, but the physician would not say that before the accident arteriosclerosis had injuriously affected the functioning of the kidneys of the patient, although such was possible. Dr. Follett lastly would not admit that myocarditis had anything to do with uraemia but agreed that arteriosclerosis was a possible cause of it.\nThe appellant called as its medical witness, Dr. Willis Merritt, who, apparently, had not seen the late Arthur C. Casey and who gave his evidence after hearing the evidence of Dr. Follett. Dr. Merritt was of opinion that arteriosclerosis degenerates kidneys so that they cannot excrete enough waste product and causes uraemia, and that, when the prostate is enlarged so that the patient is unable to void, a back pressure on the kidneys results and thus assists in bringing on uraemia. In his opinion death was the result of the accident, the condition of arteriosclerosis and the condition of the enlarged prostate. He agreed that the poison from the wound would set up a diseased condition of the kidneys.\nIt is clear from the foregoing that up to the time of the accident the late Arthur C. Casey had been able to carry on his duties as Manager of Alazhar Temple, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that, if the accident had not happened, he would not have been able to continue so to do indefinitely. There is no direct evidence that he had been unable to void before the accident, that myocarditis had anything to do with lessening the functioning of his kidneys or that the arteriosclerosis had in fact up to that time lessened their functioning. There is, on the contrary, evidence that infection first appeared at the end of five or six days at the site of the wound and gradually spread locally.\nThe learned trial judge, however, in his reasons for judgment said:\u2014\nDr. Follett was the attending physician of the insured for some years before he died. In his evidence he tells us that in December, 1928, he examined his patient and found him suffering from myocarditis and arteriosclerosis.\nThe cause of death was uraemia and the doctor states that the uraemia resulted from a combination of the accident and arteriosclerosis; that the accident alone, or the arteriosclerosis alone should not have caused death at that time.\nThe learned trial judge was clearly in error. The following is the relevant evidence of Dr. Follett, who alone had any actual knowledge of the condition of the late Arthur C Casey before the accident.\nQ. You also said there was no kidney trouble and you said \"Not to your knowledge\" and your knowledge I believe was of September, 1931?\u2014\nA. No, from December, 1928, the first time I saw Mr. Casey as a patient.\nQ. I am speaking of the last occasion?\u2014A. From September, 1931, I think I have examined his urine on a couple of occasions. I don't know whether each time or one, I could not say.\nQ. Then along until the accident?\u2014\nA. No, first hand knowledge.\nQ. Had you previously catheterized him?\u2014A. Never. I did not know he had am enlarged prostate until he got into the hospital and told me.\nQ. There is no doubt in your mind that this arteriosclerosis lessened the function of the kidney, no doubt about that?\u2014A. That is correct.\nThe Court: Let me get that, you say that before the accident the function of the kidneys by reason of the condition must have been lessoned?\u2014A. No, I would not want to say that. I have no direct knowledge, I never had anything to do with the man except for his heart on some occasions, and I examined his urine once I remember distinctly and it seemed all right so far as the ordinary test was concerned.\nIn Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York v. Mitchell[24], Lord Dunedin, delivering the judgment of their Lordships said, page 596,\nBut their Lordships agree with the result reached in the exceedingly care-foil and able judgment of Middleton J., confirmed unanimously by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal. His view is most tersely expressed in a single sentence; \"This diseased condition is not an independent and outside cause, but it is a consequence and effect of the accident.\nMr. Justice Middleton had also said in his judgment[25],\nThe tuberculosis of the system was harmless until, as the direct result of the accident, it was given an opportunity to become active.\nIn the case before us, it is not shown that the myocarditis, arteriosclerosis or enlarged prostate were, before the accident, active in injuriously affecting the functioning of the kidneys. I am therefore of opinion that the cause of death was within the wording of the policy. But even if this is not so, much may be said for the view that the loss is covered by the wide wording of section 4 of the 1923 Act, which has already been discussed at length.\nThe respondent also urged that the assured was misled by the agent who solicited the insurance into believing that the policy would be good if the assured lived to be one hundred years old, and that the appellant through its agent thereby waived miscellaneous provision 5. Wing v. Harvey[26]. This contention cannot prevail in view of miscellaneous provision 1 of the policy and in view of statutory condition 20 of the 1923 Act or statutory condition 20 of Schedule E of the 1926 Act. See also Biggar v. Rock Life Assurance Company[27].\nMiscellaneous provision 5 of the policy is, as above stated, a bar to the claim of the respondent. The result, therefore, is that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed. Under all the circumstances, it is not a case for costs.\nCANNON J.\u2014I concur in the conclusions of my brother Hughes that the action should be dismissed. The plaintiff brings forth a contract which expressly limits the insurer's risk in such a manner that, on attaining the age of 65 years, the insured automatically ceased to be covered. His capacity to be \"insured\" under the policy ceased because the risk as assumed by the company, no longer existed. He reached 65 years of age without accident causing him bodily harm and, therefore, the risk, as assumed by the company, never became a liability. It is common ground that when the accident happened, Casey was 70 years old; therefore, outside the scope of the contract on which the action is based.\nI would allow the appeal without costs.\nAppeal allowed, no costs.\n[1] [1933] 1 W.W.R. 280.\n[2] [1932] 3 W.W.R. 551.\n[3] [1933] 1 W.W.R. 282.\n[4] (1882) 7 App. Cas. 345, at 360 and 361\n[5] (1882) 7 App. Cas. 345.\n[6] (1921) 62 Can.

Act, ss. 91 (26), 92 (12) (14).\nPlaintiff, aged 20, and defendant, aged 17, went through a form of marriage in Ontario on December 2, 1930. To obtain the marriage licence, defendant swore (falsely, as known to both parties) that she was 18 years of age. No parent\u2019s consent, as required by s. 17 of the Marriage Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 181, was obtained. Carnal intercourse had previously taken place between the parties. The marriage was not consummated nor did the parties since the ceremony cohabit or live together as man and wife. Plaintiff sued for a declaration that the marriage ceremony was null and void.\nHeld: The action should be dismissed, as the Supreme Court of Ontario had no jurisdiction to grant the decree sued for.\nS. 17 (requiring in certain cases parental consent as a condition precedent to a valid marriage) and s. 34 (providing that a form of marriage gone through without the required consent should be void; and giving the Supreme Court of Ontario power to entertain an action and declare the marriage void, but limited with regard to circumstances or conditions, such limitation excluding jurisdiction in the present case) of the Marriage Act (as it stood in 1930 and when the judgment at trial was pronounced) were intra vires of the Ontario legislature (Crocket J. dissenting as to the jurisdictional enactment in s. 34).\nThe construction and effect of ss. 17 and 34 discussed.\nIn the exercise of its jurisdiction in relation to \u201cthe solemnization of marriage in the province\u201d (B.N.A. Act, s. 92 (12)), a provincial legislature may require parental consent to the marriage of a minor as a condition precedent to a valid marriage.\nThe Dominion statute, The Divorce Act (Ontario), 1930 (c. 14) (the construction and effect of it discussed) did not affect the Ontario legislation in question, nor do the facts in the present case afford any ground for annulment of marriage under the Dominion statute.\nThe obtaining of the marriage licence by defendant\u2019s false affidavit as to age did not afford plaintiff a ground for annulment of the marriage (Plummer v. Plummer, [1917] P. 163, cited by Lamont J.).\nPer Duff C.J.: The province\u2019s authority as to \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d is plenary (Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick, [1892] A.C. 437, at 442) and extends (inter alia) to attaching the consequence of invalidity absolutely or conditionally. It is not necessary to decide whether the requirements of s. 34, controlling its courts in exercising the jurisdiction thereby conferred, had the effect of qualifying any rule of substantive law as to the invalidity of marriages which might be established by ss. 17 (1) and 34. The province has power to prescribe rules governing its courts in exercising the jurisdiction conferred upon them by s. 34 (for giving effect by remedial process to rules of substantive law relating to \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d) because that power (1) prima facie affects matters failing within \u201csolemnization of marriage\u201d or \u201cadministration of justice\u201d (in B.N.A. Act, s. 92 (12) (14)), and (2) could not be brought under any jurisdiction appertaining to the Dominion Parliament under any of the enumerated heads of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act; as regards process designed to give effect to substantive rules of law competently enacted by a province in execution of its exclusive authority under s. 92 (12) (solemnization of marriage), the Dominion could not intervene in any way with a view to sanctioning or controlling any jurisdiction or procedure established for that purpose by a province (and therefore the power must be vested in the province\u2014Att. Gen. for Ontario v. Att. Gen. for Canada, [1912] A.C. 571, at 581).\nPer Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.: The provincial legislature had power to provide that the stipulated consent must be had under certain circumstances but should not be necessary under certain other circumstances. But irrespective of the question of the validity of the marriage under (and on construction of) ss. 17 and 34 (2), the plaintiff could not succeed in his action; the Ontario court had no inherent jurisdiction to entertain it\u2014its jurisdiction rested entirely upon the provisions of the Act, and s. 34 (2) excluded jurisdiction under the circumstances of this case.\nPer Lamont J.: The provincial legislature had full power, under s. 92 (14) (administration of justice in the province) of the B.N.A. Act, to enact s. 34; to give jurisdiction to the court in some cases and conditions and withhold it in others; and without s. 34 the court had no jurisdiction to declare null and void the going through of a form of marriage.\nPer Crocket J.: The limitations in s. 34 upon the court\u2019s jurisdiction to declare a marriage void for want of consent, in effect prescribed conditions to (the jurisdiction depending on matters which did not pertain in any way to \u201csolemnization of marriage,\u201d but went beyond that subject and invaded the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament in relation to all other matters pertaining to the larger subject of \u201cmarriage and divorce\u201d (B.N.A. Act, s. 91 (26)). and therefore the jurisdictional enactment in s. 34 (which, however, was severable from the substantive enactment therein) was ultra vires. But, apart from s. 34 (purporting to give jurisdiction only under conditions which did not exist in the present case) there was no enactment authorizing the court to pronounce the decree asked for; (the jurisdiction conferred by the Dominion Act, 1930, c. 14, did not cover any jurisdiction to grant a decree of annulment for any cause which the provincial legislature has validly declared as a cause of annulment in exercise of its exclusive legislative authority upon the subject of Solemnization of Marriage); nor (with some doubt\u2014reference to Board v. Board [1919] A.C. 956; also to the reasons in Vamvakidis v. Kirkoff, 64 Ont. L.R. 585) has the Supreme Court of Ontario inherent jurisdiction to do so.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal, Ont., [1932] O.R. 601, affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (reversing the judgment of Logie J., pronounced on March 17, 1932[2]) dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action, which was for a decree declaring the ceremony of marriage performed between the plaintiff (then aged 20 years) and the defendant Mrs. Kerr (then aged 17 years) on December 2, 1930, at Hamilton, Ontario, null and void. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Lamont J. now reported. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nO.M. Walsh and F.J.L. Evans for the appellant.\nJoseph Sedgwick, K.C. for the respondent Attorney-General for Ontario.\nW.P. McClemont for the respondent Mrs. Kerr.\nDUFF C.J.\u2014I concur with the view of the Appellate Division that s. 17 (1) of the Marriage Act is intra vires of the Provincial Legislature. I have no doubt that, in exercise of its jurisdiction in relation to the subject reserved to the provinces by s. 92 (12), \u201cSolemnization of Marriage,\u201d the legislature of a province may lawfully prescribe the consent of the parents or guardian to the marriage of a minor as an essential element in the ceremony of marriage itself. Nor have I any doubt that by s. 17 (1) the consents required are prescribed as elements in the ceremony. These requirements apply to all marriages celebrated in Ontario, and to no marriages but those celebrated in Ontario, whether the parties to the marriage be domiciled in Ontario or elsewhere. The legislature is, I think, dealing with the solemnities of marriage and not with the capacity of the parties. It is not suggested that, according to the practice prevailing in the different provinces of Canada at the time of Confederation, the giving of such consents pursuant to the requirements of the law, would not properly have been regarded as belonging to such solemnities. The province, therefore, has power to require such consents as a condition of the validity of the solemnization of marriages within the province. But, it should be observed that the jurisdiction of the province is not limited to that. The authority with regard to the subject \u201cSolemnization of Marriage\u201d is plenary. Lord Watson, in Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[3], said:\nIn so far as regards those matters which, by s. 92, are specially reserved for provincial legislation, the legislation of each province continues to be free from the control of the Dominion, and as supreme as it was before the passing of the Act.\nThe authority of the provinces, therefore, extends not only to prescribing such formalities as properly fall within the matters designated by \u201cSolemnization of Marriage\u201d; they have the power to enforce the rules laid down by penalty, by attaching the consequence of invalidity, and by attaching such consequences absolutely or conditionally. It is within the power of a province to say that a given requirement shall be absolute in marriages of one class of people, while it may be dispensed with in other marriages. This, of course, is always subject to the observation that a province cannot, under the form of dealing with the \u201csolemnization of marriage,\u201d enact legislation which, in substance, relates to some part of the subject of \u201cmarriage\u201d which is not reserved to the provinces as a subject of legislative jurisdiction.\nI must not be understood as expressing the view that it would not be competent to the Dominion, in exercise of its authority in relation to the subject of \u201cmarriage,\u201d in matters which do not fall within the subject of \u201csolemnization of marriage,\u201d to deprive minors domiciled in Canada of the capacity to marry without the consent of their parents. No such question arises here, and it is quite unnecessary to pass an opinion upon it. The authority of the Dominion to impose upon intending spouses an incapacity which is made conditional on the absence of certain nominated consents is not in question.\nOne principle it is essential to bear in mind, in construing the British North America Act, is that a matter which, for one purpose and from one point of view, may fall within a subject reserved to the Dominion, may, for another purpose and from another point of view, fall within a subject reserved to the provinces; and that, when such is the case, legislation regarding such matters, from the proper provincial point of view, and for the proper provincial purpose, will take effect in the absence of legislation in the same field by the Dominion.\nNor is it necessary to consider whether or not the requirements of s. 34, which, admittedly, control the courts of Ontario in exercising the jurisdiction thereby conferred, have the effect of qualifying any rule of substantive law in respect to the invalidity of marriages which may be established by s. 17 (1) and s. 34. The point might be of considerable practical importance, but it does not arise on this appeal. The province unquestionably has authority (whether in relation to the Administration of Justice (s. 92 (14)), or in relation to Solemnization of Marriage (s. 92 (12)), it is needless to determine) to prescribe rules governing the courts of the province in exercising the jurisdiction conferred upon these courts by s. 34. That power is vested in the province, first, because prima facie it affects matters falling within the subject \u201cSolemnization of Marriage,\u201d or the subject \u201cAdministration of Justice\u201d; and second, because the authority to prescribe rules governing the courts of Ontario, in exercising the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the legislature of Ontario, for giving effect by remedial process to rules of substantive law relating to \u201cSolemnization of Marriage,\u201d a subject within the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislature, could not be brought under any jurisdiction appertaining to the Dominion Parliament under any of the enumerated heads of s. 91. For our present purpose, we may assume that some jurisdiction is vested in the Dominion in respect of remedial process touching matters within \u201cMarriage,\u201d and not within either \u201cDivorce\u201d or \u201cSolemnization of Marriage.\u201d But, as regards process designed to give effect to substantive rules of law competently enacted by a province, in execution of the exclusive authority belonging to it in virtue of s. 92 (12), the Dominion would be powerless to intervene in any way with a view to sanctioning or controlling any jurisdiction or procedure established for that purpose by a province. If there is no such authority vested in the Dominion, it follows that it must be vested in the province. \u201cNow, there can be no doubt,\u201d said Lord Loreburn in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney\u2011General for Canada[4],\nthat under this organic instrument the powers distributed between the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other hand cover the whole area of self-government within the whole area of Canada. It would be subversive of the entire scheme and policy of the Act to assume that any point of internal self-government was withheld from Canada.\nThis alone is fatal to the appeal.\nNor do I think the Dominion statute of 1930 (20 & 21 Geo. V., c. 14) affects any matter in controversy. Minors above the age of consent (14 in males, and 12 in females) were undoubtedly capable of contracting marriages under the law of England as it existed on the 15th of July, 1870. As I have already pointed out, the provisions of the legislation before us do not affect this matter of capacity\u2014a matter which is not touched by them. They deal exclusively with matters which are properly treated as comprised within the solemnities of marriage. If the effect of the Dominion Act is to make available the procedure of the probate and divorce court in England for the purpose of obtaining a declaration of invalidity on the ground that, under the provisions of s. 17 (1) and s. 34, a marriage is void for want of observing the formalities therein prescribed (formalities comprised within the subject \u201cSolemnization of Marriage\u201d), then, as already indicated, to that extent, the Dominion statute is ultra vires. The Dominion, to repeat, has no power to prescribe such a procedure for such a purpose, either explicitly or referentially.\nBut I am by no means satisfied that such is the effect of the Act of 1930. The phrase \u201cannulment of marriage\u201d may not unreasonably be read as restricted to proceedings impeaching a marriage on grounds other than some defect in \u201csolemnization\u201d within the meaning of s. 92 which would vitiate ab initio the ceremony itself by force of the law of the province alone. In view of the then existing state of Ontario law, the qualfication \u201cin so far as it can be made to apply in the province of Ontario,\u201d may, perhaps, be paraphrased \u201cin so far as it can properly be made to apply to that province by the Dominion legislation\u201d and this consideration may afford, as Riddell J.A. thinks, a good ground for so construing the words \u201cannulment of marriage.\u201d\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The facts and secs. 17 and 34 of the Ontario Marriage Act, R.S.O. 1927, ch. 181, are set out in the reasons of my brother Lamont.\nThe appellant, in his statement of claim, pleads the provisions of The Divorce Act (Ontario), 1930, being Statutes of Canada, 20-21 Geo. V., ch. 14, and amendments thereto, and the provisions of the Ontario Marriage Act; and claims by virtue of these Acts, a decree declaring the ceremony of marriage celebrated between the parties null and void.\nThe Divorce Act referred to does not deal in any way with the solemnization of marriage, which is a matter entirely within provincial jurisdiction. It is applicable to divorce and to the annulment of marriages where there has been valid solemnization. A marriage validly solemnized may, under the English law, be void or voidable on grounds other than those giving a right to divorce. The facts established in this case would not, under the English law, constitute a ground for annulment of a validly solemnized marriage, for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nThe question of whether or not there was a validly solemnized marriage in this case depends entirely upon the provisions of the Ontario Marriage Act. If, under the terms of that Act, there was a valid solemnization of marriage, the appellant\u2019s action necessarily fails. That question turns upon the construction to be given to the provisions of sec. 17 when read in conjunction with subsec. 2 of sec. 34, which reads as follows:\n(2) The Court shall not declare a marriage void where carnal inter course has taken place between the parties before the ceremony. If this subsection is to be construed as dealing with jurisdiction without any other signification, and sec. 17 is to be regarded as alone dealing with the question of validity and as making the marriage void under the circumstances of this case, then we have the peculiar situation of an enactment making a marriage void and at the same time forbidding the court so to declare in an action between the parties. It is difficult to understand what object would be served by such prohibition.\nOn the other hand, if sec. 17 and this subsec. 2 are to be read together, it may be that the proper construction is that subsec. 2 makes an exception to the provision of sec. 17 requiring consent and making consent a condition, in which event the marriage would be valid, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 17. If such is the proper construction, there can be no doubt that such a provision is intra vires because the legislature clearly has jurisdiction to provide that the stipulated consent must be had under certain circumstances but shall not be necessary under certain other circumstances.\nIt is pointed out, however, that it is not necessary in this particular action to pass upon the question of the validity of the marriage, because the appellant cannot succeed unless the marriage was void, and the court, by the statute, is expressly prohibited, in this kind of an action, from making any such declaration.\nThere seems to be no doubt that the court has no inherent jurisdiction to entertain an action of this kind between the parties to the marriage ceremony, and that the jurisdiction rests entirely upon the provisions of the statute. That being so, subsec. 2 excludes jurisdiction under the circumstances of this case.\nI am therefore refraining from expressing an opinion as to the proper construction to be placed upon the provisions of sec. 17 and subsec. 2 of sec. 34. I concur in the view that in any event the court had no jurisdiction to declare the marriage void, as prayed in the statement of claim, and that the appeal should be dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. LAMONT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5] reversing a judgment of Mr. Justice Logie[6] in favour of the appellant, in an action for a declaration that the form of marriage solemnized between the appellant and the respondent, Frances Margaret Kerr (n\u00e9e Smith), was null and void.\nThe facts of the case are not in dispute. The parties first met in April, 1930, and sexual intercourse took place between them on some four occasions. In September, 1930, Frances Margaret Smith found herself to be pregnant and she and some of her friends urged the appellant to marry her. He objected, claiming that he was not the cause of her condition. Yielding, however, to their importunities, the appellant, on December 2nd, 1930, went through a form of marriage with her at Hamilton, Ontario, where they both resided. To obtain the marriage licence Frances Margaret Smith made an affidavit that she was eighteen years of age, although she was then only seventeen. When the affidavit was made both the appellant and Miss Smith knew that the statement therein contained as to her age was false, and knew also that it was made for the purpose of procuring the marriage licence. The ceremony was performed without the knowledge of the parents or family of either of the parties. No consent to the marriage was obtained from the mother of Frances Margaret Smith as required by section 17 of the Marriage Act (R.S.O., 1927, ch. 181). The marriage was never consummated and the parties, since the ceremony, have not cohabited or lived together as man and wife.\nOn these facts the trial judge gave judgment for the appellant, declaring the marriage ceremony between the parties to be null and void upon the ground that the consent of the girl\u2019s mother to the marriage (her father being dead) had not been obtained, and that section 34 of the Act was ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nFrom that judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal by the respondent, Frances Margaret Kerr, and by the Attorney-General for Ontario, who had been added as a party to the action. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of the trial judge, holding that section 34 was within the competence of the provincial legislature. The appellant now appeals to this Court and asks that the judgment of the trial judge be restored.\nThe appeal turns upon the construction to be placed upon sections 17 and 34 of the Marriage Act. The relevant parts of these sections are:\u2014\n17. (1) Save in cases provided for by subsections 3 and 4 of this section and by section 18, where either of the parties to an intended marriage, not a widower or a widow, is under the age of eighteen years, the consent in writing of the father if living, or, if he is dead, or living apart from the mother and child, and is not maintaining or contributing to the support of such child, the consent in writing of the mother if living, or of a guardian if any has been duly appointed, shall be obtained from the father, mother or guardian before the licence is issued * * * and such consent shall be deemed to be a condition precedent to a valid marriage, unless the marriage has been consummated or the parties have after the ceremony cohabited and lived together as man and wife.\n34. (1) Where a form of marriage is gone through between persons either of whom is under the age of eighteen years without the consent of the father, mother or guardian of such person, when such consent is required by the provisions of this Act, * * * such form of marriage shall be void and the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction and power to entertain an action by the person who was at the time of the ceremony under the age of eighteen years, to declare and adjudge that a valid marriage was not effected or entered into, and shall so declare and adjudge if it is made to appear that the marriage has not been consummated and that such persons have not, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife, and that the action is brought before the person bringing it has attained the age of nineteen years.\n(2) The Court shall not declare a marriage void where carnal intercourse has taken place between the parties before the ceremony.\nThe contention of the appellant is:\u2014\n1. That section 7 (1) is competent provincial legislation in so far as it requires the consent of the parents or guardians of a contracting party\u2014not a widower or a widow\u2014to an intended marriage before the issue of the licence if the party is under the age of eighteen years, and also in so far as it enacts that such consent shall be a condition precedent to a valid marriage.\n2. That section 34 is ultra vires of the provincial legislature, as it is legislation on the subject of marriage and divorce which, by section 91 (26) of the British North America Act, 1867, is exclusively assigned to the Dominion Parliament.\n3. That, as the consent required by section 17 (1) was not obtained, and as section 34 is ultra vires, the marriage should be held null and void by virtue of The Divorce Act (Ontario), 1930, enacted by the Dominion Parliament.\nBy the British North America Act, 1867, the power to make laws respecting marriage and its solemnization was distributed between the Dominion Parliament and the provincial legislatures. To the Dominion was assigned the exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the subject of Marriage and Divorce (section 91 (26)); while to the provinces was given the exclusive legislative jurisdiction over the solemnization of marriage in the provinces (section 92 (12)). The solemnization of marriage might readily have been included within the general description of \u201cMarriage and Divorce,\u201d but it seemed wise to the framers of our constitutional Act to carve out of the field which marriage and divorce would otherwise have covered, a small but distinct and essential part designated \u201cThe Solemnization of Marriage in the Province\u201d and give the provincial legislatures the exclusive right to make laws in respect thereof. Each legislative body is supreme within its own sphere and the question we have to determine is, does the impeached legislation (s. 34) fall within any one of the subjects exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures?\nSince the decision of the Privy Council in In re Reference Concerning Marriage[7], it has been settled law that the exclusive power of the provincial legislatures to make laws relating to the solemnization of marriage in the province operates by way of exception to the powers conferred upon the Dominion Parliament as regards marriage, by section 91 (26), and enables the provincial legislatures to enact conditions as to the solemnization which may affect the validity of the contract.\nSolemnization of marriage within the meaning of section 92 includes not only the essential ceremony by which the marriage is effected, but also parental consent where such consent is required by law. In Sottomayor v. DeBarros[8] Cotton, L.J., says:\u2014\nIt only remains to consider the case of Simonin v. Mallac[9]. The objection to the validity of the marriage in that case, which was solemnized in England, was the want of consent of parents required by the law of France, but not under the circumstances by that of this country. In our opinion, this consent must be considered a part of the ceremony of marriage, and not a matter affecting the personal capacity of the parties to contract marriage.\nThe provincial legislature is, therefore, competent by apt legislation to make the preliminaries, leading up to the marriage ceremony, conditions precedent to the solemnization of the marriage. From this it follows, in my opinion, that the legislature is also competent to declare that in the event of these conditions precedent not being complied with no valid marriage has taken place.\nSection 17, however, does not make consent a condition precedent to a valid marriage in every case where a contracting party is under the age of eighteen years. The legislation does not apply to cases coming within subsections and 4 of this section, nor where the contracting party is a widow or widower, nor does it apply where the marriage has been consummated, or the parties have, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife.\nThen are subsections 1 and 2 of section 34 competent provincial legislation?\nIt will be observed that subsection 1 deals, not with marriage, but with a \u201cform of marriage,\u201d which indeed is all that the performing of the ceremony can be where no valid marriage takes place.\nSection 34 (1) declares that if the consent, required by section 17, has not been obtained \u201csuch form of marriage shall be void.\u201d\nThe object of these two sections is, I think, clear. By them the legislature was endeavouring:\n1. To provide that a failure to furnish the consent to an intended marriage, required by section 17 in case of a contracting party thereto under the age of eighteen years who has gone through a form of marriage, would in certain cases have the effect of preventing a valid marriage from taking place, and\n2. To bestow on the Supreme Court of Ontario jurisdiction to entertain an action and to declare and adjudge that the going through of such a form of marriage, under the circumstances, would not constitute a valid marriage. This jurisdiction was bestowed on the court only in those cases in which the conditions prescribed by the statute had been complied with. That is to say where:\n1. The action is brought by a contracting party who at the time of the ceremony was under the age of eighteen years, and who brought the action before he or she reached the age of nineteen years.\n2. It is made to appear that the marriage had not been consummated and that such persons have not, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife.\nThe onus of establishing each of these requisites is on the person bringing the action and if the onus is not discharged the court has no jurisdiction to declare that a valid marriage has not taken place.\nApart, therefore, from enacting that the furnishing of the consent should be a condition precedent to a valid marriage and that when a form of marriage had been gone through without such consent being obtained such form should be null and void\u2014which it is not disputed is within the competence of the legislature\u2014the whole enactment in these two sections concerns the bestowal of jurisdiction on the Supreme Court of Ontario to try an action and make a declaration that there has been no valid marriage in certain cases and under certain conditions, and the withholding of such jurisdiction in others, particularly subsection 2 where the Act expressly states that the court should not declare a marriage void where carnal intercourse has taken place between the parties before the ceremony. Is it within the competence of the legislature to give jurisdiction to the court in some cases and withhold or deny it in others?\nIn the case of a marriage void by the law of the place where it was celebrated, on account of lack of essential formalities, a declaration that it is invalid has been described as \u201cmerely a judicial ascertainment of facts.\u201d It ascertains but does not change the status of the parties. If that is so, and I think it is, it is difficult to see why the legislature should not be competent to invest the courts with jurisdiction to ascertain a fact. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ontario is statutory. Without this enactment the court would have no jurisdiction to declare null and void the going through of a form of marriage. In my opinion the bestowing upon the court jurisdiction to entertain an action to make a finding of fact thereon and to make a declaration in accordance with that fact, is clearly within the competence of the legislature under section 92 (14) which, subject to section 101 of the Act, assigns to the legislature the exclusive power to make laws respecting the \u201cAdministration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\u201d This includes the power to define the jurisdiction of the courts as well as the jurisdiction of the judges who constitute the same. (In re County Courts of British Columbia[10]). It also includes the power to enlarge, alter or diminish such jurisdiction. (Regina v. Levinger[11]).\nIf we examine sections 91 and 92 it will be seen, speaking generally, that the power to legislate in respect of practice and procedure (adjective law) has been exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures except so far as relates to divorce and criminal law, subject, of course, to s. 101 of the Act; that in matters relating to the subjects over which exclusive legislative jurisdiction has been, by section 91, assigned to the Dominion Parliament, whenever it was intended that Parliament should also legislate as to the practice and procedure to be adopted, an express statement to that effect is found in section 91. In this case I have no doubt that the provincial legislature had full power, under section 92 (14), to enact the impeached legislation.\nIt was also contended that the marriage should be annulled on the ground that the marriage licence was obtained by the false affidavit of the respondent, Frances Margaret Kerr, as to her age. A similar contention was made in Plummer v. Plummer[12]. In that action, although the notice or declaration required by the Acts contained statements false to the knowledge of both parties, it was held that a marriage by licence was not to be invalidated by reason of a false statement in the notice. The same principle, in my opinion, applies here.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed. CROCKET J.\u2014I regret that I cannot agree with my brethren upon the question of the constitutionality of the provisoes of sec. 34 of the Ontario Marriage Act as it stood in that statute at the time of the commencement and trial of this action.\nThe impugned section deals with two distinct subjects. The first part concerns the requirement of the consent of a parent or guardian to the marriage of a person under the age of 18 years and unqualifiedly enacts that a form of marriage gone through by such a person without such consent shall be void. The remainder of the section deals entirely with the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to pronounce a decree of annulment in the case of such a marriage. It purports to empower the court to entertain an action for annulment only by the person who was at the time of the marriage ceremony under the age of 18 years, and then to adjudge that a valid marriage was not effected or entered into only \u201cif it is made to appear that the marriage has not been consummated and that such persons have not, after the ceremony, cohabited and lived together as man and wife, and that the action is brought before the person bringing it has attained the age of nineteen years.\u201d It then, by subsec. 2, expressly prohibits the court from declaring a marriage void where carnal intercourse has taken place between the parties before the ceremony.\nThe consent of a parent or guardian of the person under the age of 18 years, concerning, as it intrinsically does, the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage (See Sottomayor v. De Barros[13], unmistakably falls under sec. 92 (12) of the British North America Act, and is a subject respecting which the legislature by that section is given exclusive capacity to legislate, by way of exception to the exclusive legislative authority which sec. 91 (26) vests in the Parliament of Canada in relation to all other matters pertaining to the larger subject of Marriage and Divorce.\nThe report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the Canadian Marriage Reference of 1912[14] distinctly laid down the principle that sec. 92 (12) enables the provincial legislature \u201cto enact conditions as to solemnization which may affect the validity of the contract\u201d of marriage. I have no doubt that in accordance with the principle of this decision, this exclusive legislative authority in the provincial legislature comprises not only the power to declare void a marriage for want of the required consent of a parent or guardian in the case of a marriage solemnized between persons, one of whom is under the age of 18 years, but the power to confer upon the Supreme Court jurisdiction to pronounce a decree of nullity for want of such consent in such case, or for any other reason which in reality pertains to the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage.\nI find it impossible, however, to assent to the view that the conditions prescribed by the provisoes in sec. 34 as conditions, not as to the validity or invalidity of the marriage ceremony, but as conditions to the right of the court to pronounce a decree of nullity in the case of such a marriage, are conditions which do pertain in any way to the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage. The manifest intent, and the real pith and substance of these provisoes, is to prevent the Supreme Court from declaring void any marriage ceremony for want of the required consent of a parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years, except at the instance of the party to the marriage ceremony who was under the prescribed age at the time of the performance of that ceremony; and, even where an action for annulment is brought by such party, to prohibit the court from granting such a decree if, after the ceremony, there has been consummation and cohabitation as husband and wife between the parties; or if the plaintiff has failed to bring his or her action for such annulment before attaining the age of 19 years; or, further, if the parties to the marriage have had carnal intercourse before the performance of the ceremony. The provisoes prescribe conditions which, whether they do or do not themselves strictly affect the validity of the marriage contract, make a judicial declaration or judgment of annulment impossible in such a case. They are an absolute bar to such a decree, and in reality dispense with the requirement of a parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s consent to the solemnization of the marriage ceremony, which the statute has previously enacted as a condition of validity, making, as they do, the neglect or laches of the party under age to bring his or her action for annulment before attaining the age of 19 years, or carnal intercourse between the parties, either before or after the marriage ceremony, conclusive, so far as the court is concerned, of a valid marriage relationship quite irrespective of the required consent of parent or guardian or of the solemnization of the marriage ceremony at all. None of these conditions pertain to any of the requisite preliminaries or formalities of the marriage ceremony. They treat of matters which are wholly extraneous thereto, i.e., the conduct of the parties before and after the ceremony. Consummation and cohabitation as husband and wife are, no doubt, the natural consequences of a marriage ceremony, but obviously, whether consummation or subsequent cohabitation take place or not, could not conceivably affect the right of any person, possessing the requisite governmental authority for the purpose, to solemnize or perform the ceremony, or even the right or capacity of the parties themselves to have it solemnized; neither could the neglect or laches of either party to bring an action for annulment before attaining the age of 19 years. In my opinion, they go entirely beyond the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage and consequently invade the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament in relation to all other matters pertaining to the larger subject of Marriage and Divorce.\nThat \u201cSolemnization of Marriage in the Province\u201d does not comprehend the whole subject of marriage, as used in sec. 91 (26), and connotes only a limited division of the larger field of the whole relationship of marriage, is self-evident. The report of the Judicial Committee on the Marriage Reference case of 1912[15], already referred to, as well as the argument of counsel who combatted the legislative power of the Parliament of Canada to enact the proposed Marriage Bill, then under review, clearly demonstrates that there is a broad distinction between marriage and the solemnization of marriage, and that there are many conditions which may affect the validity of the contract of marriage which do not touch the subject of the solemnization of marriage. All that that case decided was that the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament does not, on the true construction of secs. 91 and 92, cover the whole field of validity, and that the provincial legislatures had the exclusive capacity to determine by whom the marriage ceremony might be performed and to make the officiation of the proper person a condition of the validity of the marriage\u2014a condition which, unlike any of those now in question, manifestly and inherently concerns the solemnization of the ceremony of marriage. The plain implication of the decision is that all matters respecting Marriage and Divorce, which do not strictly concern the subject matter of the Solemnization of Marriage, lie exclusively within the legislative capacity of the Dominion Parliament, whether they be dealt with as grounds or conditions of annulment or as discretionary or absolute bars to the granting by any court of decrees of annulment.\nIt seems to me that if it is now to be held that the provincial legislatures can validly impose any such restrictions as are here in question upon the right of the Supreme or any other provincial court to grant decrees of annulment for want of the requisite consent of a parent or guardian to the solemnization of a marriage ceremony, they may quite as logically impose any other imaginable restrictions, not only as conditions to the granting of such decrees, but as conditions to the validity of a marriage, and thus exhaust and effectively control the whole field of validity. If they can prescribe the fact of no previous carnal intercourse having taken place between the parties to the solemnization of a marriage ceremony, either as a condition of the validity of the marriage or as a condition of the power of the court to grant a decree of annulment, why may they not likewise, for instance, prescribe the condition that the parties be not related by consanguinity or that there is no impotence upon the part of either as further conditions of validity or of the jurisdiction of the court to pronounce a decree of annulment in such a case?\nIn the Province of New Brunswick, the legislature, long before confederation, constituted a Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes which, by virtue of sec. 129 of the British North America Act, still exists, for the determination of all matters and questions touching and concerning marriage and contracts of marriage, and divorce, as well from the bond of matrimony as divorce and separation from bed and board, and alimony. The statute establishing this court prescribes as the only causes for divorce from the bond of matrimony and of dissolving and annulling marriage frigidity or impotence, adultery and consanguinity within the prohibited degrees. Whether consanguinity and impotence are regarded as grounds of divorce from the bond of matrimony or as grounds of annulment, I venture to think that neither is a matter which concerns Solemnization of Marriage within the contemplation of sec. 92 (12) of the British North America Act, and that, since that Act came into operation, only the Parliament of Canada could validly legislate with respect to them, either as grounds of divorce or as grounds of annulment. The provincial legislatures may enact conditions as to solemnization which may affect validity, but such conditions must not go beyond those matters which in reality pertain either to the act or ceremony of solemnization itself or to the preliminary steps leading thereto. They cannot, by annexing to a condition which does thus concern the solemnization of marriage, such as the consent of a parent or guardian of one under age, further conditions, which do not themselves pertain to solemnization, but have to do with the capacity of the parties and their conduct as well after as before the performance of the marriage ceremony, as conditions either of validity of the ceremony or of the rights of the parties to obtain judicial declarations of annulment, trench upon that field which the British North America Act has exclusively reserved for the Parliament of Canada, viz: Marriage and Divorce, except the Solemnization of Marriage. Such further conditions, as I have indicated, either concern or they do not concern the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage. If they are to be regarded as concerning that subject matter, the words \u201cmarriage and\u201d in enumeration 26 of the classes of subjects with respect to which sec. 91 of the British North America Act provides that the Parliament of Canada may exclusively make laws, would, in my opinion, be rendered meaningless and of no effect, and the provincial legislatures enabled to occupy the entire field of validity of marriage, for, as I have already endeavoured to point out, there would be no condition which they could not enact as a prerequisite of the valid solemnization of a marriage, whether such condition con- cerned the capacity of the parties or not. \u201cSolemnization of marriage in the province,\u201d as enumerated in sec. 92 (12), would not operate \u201cby way of exception\u201d to the powers conferred on the Parliament of Canada by sec. 91 (26) to make laws in relation to \u201cmarriage and divorce,\u201d as held by the Judicial Committee on the Reference of 1912[16], but by way of a complete abrogation of those powers, in so far as \u201cmarriage\u201d is concerned.\nFor these reasons I think the enactment that a marriage ceremony solemnized between persons, one of whom is under the age of 18 years, without the consent of a parent or guardian of such person, shall be void, is valid as touching a matter which directly pertains to the solemnization of the marriage ceremony, and that it is severable from the rest of the section, which deals with another distinct subject, viz: the conditions upon which the Supreme Court may exercise its jurisdiction to pronounce decrees of annulment; and that the rest of that section is ultra vires of the provincial legislature. The use of the conjunction \u201cand\u201d and of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d before the words \u201cperson who was at the time of the ceremony under the age of eighteen years\u201d does not, I think, render the substantive enactment disseverable from the jurisdictional enactment, any more than if the two were contained in separate sections. There is certainly nothing in the jurisdictional clauses which limits or in any way alters the effect of the substantive enactment, while subsec. 2 absolutely prohibits the court from declaring \u201ca marriage void\u201d where carnal knowledge has taken place between the parties before the ceremony. The whole of the jurisdictional enactment could be deleted from the section without affecting the substantive enactment in any manner.\nThe question remains as to whether, apart from the provisions of sec. 34, the Supreme Court of Ontario possessed the jurisdiction to declare such a marriage void for want of the consent of a parent or guardian of the party who was at the time of the ceremony under the prescribed age. The section itself purports to give the court jurisdiction only under the conditions stated, which do not exist in the present case, notwithstanding that it has previously and unqualifiedly enacted that every and any form of marriage gone through between persons, one of whom is under the age of 18 years, without the required consent, shall be void.\nIf I am right in the view that the unqualified nullification enactment for want of the consent of a parent or guardian of the party to the marriage who was under the age of 18 years is valid and severable from the rest of the section, and the rest of the section ultra vires, it follows that it is or was at the time of the commencement and trial of the action enacted as substantive law in the Province of Ontario that the solemnization of such a marriage ceremony without the required consent was absolutely void. But where, apart from the enactments of sec. 34, does the Supreme Court of Ontario derive its authority to pronounce a decree of annulment?\nIt is argued that The Divorce Act (Ontario), enacted by the Dominion Parliament in 1930, conferred the necessary jurisdiction. This Act reads as follows:\u2014\n1. The law of England as to the dissolution of marriage and as to the annulment of marriage, as that law existed on the fifteenth day of July, 1870, in so far as it can be made to apply in the province of Ontario, and in so far as it has not been repealed, as to the province, by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or by this Act, and as altered, varied, modified or affected, as to the province, by any such Act, shall be in force in the province of Ontario.\n2. The Supreme Court of Ontario shall have jurisdiction for all purposes of this Act.\nBy the law of England a marriage was not on the date mentioned void for want of consent of a parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years nor has it since been so enacted. In any event the law of Ontario, in so far as it was validly enacted in relation to the solemnization of marriage, would not be affected thereby. In relation to any conditions affecting the validity of marriage or the annulment of marriage other than conditions as to solemnization the law of England, in my opinion, would apply, by virtue of the Dominion Act. The conferring of jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of Ontario by sec. 2 of the Dominion Act \u201cfor all purposes of this Act\u201d does not therefore, I think, cover any jurisdiction to grant a decree of annul- ment for any cause which the provincial legislature has validly declared as a cause of annulment in exercise of its exclusive legislative authority upon the subject matter of the solemnization of marriage.\nIt is contended also that the Supreme Court, apart from the provisions of sec. 4 of the provincial Marriage Act, possessed inherent jurisdiction as His Majesty\u2019s Supreme Court of Judicature for the Province, without any express authorization, to apply and give judicial effect to any substantive law competently enacted by the provincial legislature, such as the enactment now in question, unqualifiedly declaring void any marriage ceremony gone through by a person under the age of 18 years without the consent of a parent or guardian of such person. I confess that I have felt considerable doubt upon this question in view of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Board v. Board[17], an Alberta case involving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of that Province, in which the substantive law enacted by the English Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, had been introduced, to give effect to that law in the absence of any specific statutory authority to try matrimonial causes. After anxious consideration of the reasons for that decision, as stated by Viscount Haldane, and of the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Vamvakidis v. Kirkoff[18], in which the history of the several courts, established in Upper Canada and in the Province of Ontario, which were finally \u201cconsolidated\u201d as the Supreme Court of Ontario in 1881, and their jurisdiction, were exhaustively considered in the light of the reasons for the decision in Board v. Board[19], I have reached the conclusion, though not without some difficulty, that it cannot be presumed in the case of the Supreme Court of Ontario, that it possessed inherent authority to entertain a suit for the declaration of nullity of marriage, and that no statutory authority existed whereby the learned trial judge could validly adjudge, as he did, that a valid marriage was not effected between the parties in this case. For this reason, though of opinion that the provisoes of sec. 34 of the Ontario Marriage Act, as they stood in 1930, were ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh & Evans.\nSolicitors for the respondent Mrs. Kerr: McClemont & McClemont.\nSolicitor for the respondent The Attorney-General for Ontario: E.

C.R. 13, holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent for a certain \u201cimprovement in acoustic devices\u201d (of the type commonly known as loud speakers) was valid and had been infringed by defendant, was affirmed; the court holding against the defendant\u2019s contentions that there was lack of subject matter, that there was anticipation, no infringement, and (a ground not urged in the Exchequer Court) that the two claims of the specification which plaintiffs relied on were insufficient and failed to meet the requirements of s. 14 (c) of the Patent Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 150) because they did not distinguish between what was already old and what the applicant for patent \u201cregarded as new\u201d in the invention claimed.\nTo decide an objection grounded upon anticipation, one must look at the description in the specification, so as to ascertain what the invention really is. The claims may add light to it, but they are not meant for that purpose, and their object is mainly to define the extent of the monopoly to which protection is granted. The description in the present patent clearly showed that the invention consisted in a certain combination, not a mere aggregation or a juxtaposition of known contrivances, but a group of co-acting parts achieving a combined result, which satisfies the definition of a combination for the purposes of the patent law. In such case, it matters not whether some or all of the elements were old and already known in the art as separate entities; the only point (on the question of anticipation) is whether the actual combination was new.\nThe claims relied on by plaintiffs (and attacked as aforesaid) must be read with reference to the entire specification; and it was sufficient if it appeared from the claims so read what the applicant regarded as his invention; and, so read, the claims left no doubt of the exact nature of the invention claimed as new; and there existed no difficulty in ascertaining and defining what were the exact parts of the new combination and what the monopoly covered. Where the combination itself is the only thing regarded and described as the invention, the fact that the claiming clause does not distinguish old from new is not a ground for objection (British United Shoe Machinery Co. Ltd. v. A. Fussell & Sons Ltd., 25 R.P.C. 631, and other cases cited; Patent Act, s. 14, considered). It is only if the applicant desires to claim invention for a subordinate element per se that it is necessary for him to claim the element separately.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that, as between the parties to the action, claims 4 and 9 of the letters patent of the plaintiffs No. 287,240, dated February 12, 1929, for new and useful improvements in acoustic devices, were valid and had been infringed by the defendant. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nE. G. Gowling and D. K. MacTavish for the appellant.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C., R. S. Smart, K.C., and M. B. Gordon for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The respondents are the owners of Canadian Letters Patent No. 287240 granting them the exclusive right and privilege of making, constructing, using and vending to others a certain \u201cimprovement in acoustic devices They brought this action for the infringement of their rights by the appellants.\nIn the Exchequer Court of Canada1, the respondents succeeded and were held entitled to the relief claimed by them, together with their costs of the action. The appellants now appeal and renew before this Court three of the objections which were unsuccessful in the trial court, to wit: Invalidity of Letters Patent on two grounds \u2014absence of subject-matter, and anticipation; and denial that there was infringement on their part. A new ground not urged before the Exchequer Court is that the claims of the specification relied on by the respondents are insufficient and fail to meet the requirements of section 14 (c) of the Patent Act, because they do not distinguish between what was already old and what the patentee \u201cregards as new\u201d in the invention therein claimed by him.\nWe will examine each of the appellants\u2019 several objections in the order in which they have been presented to us. Before we do so, however, it will be convenient to say a word of the device which forms the subject of the patent in suit.\nThe \u201cacoustic device\u201d covered by the patent is of the type familiarly known as a loud speaker. Its function is to reproduce sound, including musical notes and the human voice. It is known that sound, as heard by the human ear, consists of the vibration of the air. Sound waves are sequences of alternate compressions and expansions of the air in immediate contact with the ear. The object of the sound reproducer is therefore to catch the vibrations caused by the instruments or voices, translate them into electrical or mechanical impulses and transmit them back into sound waves at the other end of the receiver, or, in the case of loud speakers, bring them to the human ear in amplified form. For that purpose, both electrical and mechanical devices have been adopted. Here, we are concerned with an electrical device.\nThe respondent\u2019s device is described in the patent as follows:\nIn accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a piston diaphragm is provided to radiate into a sound chamber having a plug secured therein which decreases the area of a portion of the sound passage therethrough. The diaphragm and plug are so shaped and arranged that converging sound passages are formed thereby extending from the centre of the diaphragm and from its peripheral portion to a common sound passage. The cross sectional areas of the converging sound passages preferably increase as the common sound passage is approached and these areas are such, moreover, that the air displayed by the diaphragm flows from each of the converging sound passages into the common sound passage with substantially the same velocity. The meeting point of the converging sound passages is effectually the throat of the horn since the volume of the sound passage beyond this point is not appreciably affected by the displacement of the diaphragm. Extending from this throat portion to the mouth of the horn, it is preferable to have the cross-sectional area of the sound passage such that the area of the wave front of the transmitted sound progressively increases exponentially with respect to the distance travelled.\nThis description is immediately followed in the patent by the statement that\nThe invention may be readily understood by referring to the accompanying drawing in conjunction with the following detailed description.\nThe drawing is a sectional view of a loud speaking receiver employing the feature of the present invention. An electromagnet having a hollow annular core 10, a winding 11, and annular pole pieces 12 and 13 provides a magnetic field in which the coil 14 is positioned. The top portion 15 of the magnetic core 10 is detachable to permit the assembling of the winding 11 on the core structure and is secured to the lower portion of the core by the screws 16. The diaphragm to which the coil 14 is attached comprises a stiff, dish-shaped, piston portion 17, a flexible corrugated portion 18 and a flat portion 19 which is clamped between the housing structure 20 and the upper portion 15 of the core structure. The diaphragm is separated from the portion 15 of the magnetic structure and the housing 20 by the clamping rings 21 and is held in a clamped position by screws (not shown) which pass through the flanged portion of the housing 20, washers 21 and the flat portion 19 of the diaphragm and which are threaded into the upper portion 15 of the magnetic structure. The light rigid coil 14 is connected to the stiff, piston portion 17 of the diaphragm, which is also made of light material, by means of a strip 30 of stiffened fabric material such as oiled silk coated with bakelite or shellac, or a strip of thin, lightweight metal. When assembled the coil 14 is positioned approximately equidistantly from the pole pieces 12 and 13. The ends of the conductor of which the coil 14 is wound may be brought out in any suitable manner to the screws 31 and 32 which are electrically, connected to the terminals 33 and 34 respectively. The housing structure 20 is connected to a suitable sound projector such as the exponentially tapered horn 26.\nThe metallic plug 23 in the form of a spherical meter is secured to the housing 20 by the projecting lugs 24 and the screws 25, thus forming converging sound passages which extend from the centre of the diaphragm and from its peripheral portion to a common annular sound passage, formed between the plug 23 and the housing 20. There are preferably three projecting lugs on the plug equally spaced about its periphery, although a greater or lesser number of lugs may be used if desired. The radius of the plug 23 is slightly smaller than that of the adjacent surface of the dish-shaped portion 17 of the diaphragm and the housing structure is likewise suitably shaped so that the cross-sectional areas of the sound passages formed between these surfaces progressively increase from the centre of the diaphragm and from its peripheral portion toward the common sound passage. The cross sectional areas of these sound passages, moreover, are such that the air displaced from each of the converging passages flows into the common sound passage at substantially the same velocity. The meeting point between the converging sound passages and the common sound passage is effectively the throat portion of the sound projector since the volume of the sound passage beyond this point is not affected appreciably by the displacement of the diaphragm. We have in the above the material part of the \u201cdetailed description\u201d.\nEvery sound, as shown by the record, has two basic elements: pitch, which is due to the number or frequency of the vibrations per second in the air; loudness or intensity, which is due to the amplitude of the vibrations. But, of course, each sound has a different tone quality which is determined by the presence of what are called \u201covertones\u201d or \u201charmonics\u201d. The fundamental waves produce the pure notes. The overtones are the number of additional sound waves superimposed on the fundamental wave and which give the characteristic note of a given instrument, or the characteristic sound of the human voice. The frequency range, including fundamentals and overtones, is said to be from 25 for the lowest note to 20,000 vibrations per second for the highest note; but the useful range of pitch audibility is stated to extend from about 50 to about 9,000 per second.\nThe problem faced by the inventor, with the development of the talking moving picture, was the design of an instrument capable of reproducing sound covering the high range of pitch audibility so as to transmit to the human ear the exact characteristic of each instrument, or of each individual voice, and with sufficient loudness or intensity that it could be heard in all parts of the largest auditoriums. Such are the difficulties which the patent in suit claims to have solved satisfactorily.\nThe invention, so it was stated, was\nto receive or transmit sound with high and substantially uniform efficiency over a wide frequency range * * * to improve the transmission characteristics of loud speaking receivers at the upper portion of the sound frequency range * * * By inserting the plug into the sound chamber the frequency response characteristic of the loud speaker (was) improved to such an extent that the point of low radiation is moved up to a frequency of about 14,000 cycles per second and the efficiency of the loud speaker is practically uniform up to a frequency above 5,000 cycles.\nThis leads us to a consideration of the appellants\u2019 objections, first, that the patent lacks subject matter or, which is the same thing, that there was no invention in the respondents\u2019 device; and, second, that the device was anticipated in the prior art.\nWhether there is invention in a new thing (art, process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter) is a question of fact \u201cfor the judgment of whatever tribunal has the duty of deciding\u201d. (Ref. Lord Moulton\u2019s dictum quoted by Terrell on Patents, 7th ed., p. 71). The evidence shows that, generally speaking, at the time of the invention, there were at least two main difficulties to overcome: a large range of frequencies could not be reproduced at all and, within their limited range, the several apparatus were unequal in their reproduction of the intensity of sound. The receivers on the market were entirely deficient in the higher frequencies, under which most of the important overtones lay, and there was lack of naturalness in the sound produced, so that the individual characteristics of the voice or of the instrument could not be satisfactorily identified, all the components of the sound failing to pass in their proper intensity. Moreover, the sound output in certain frequencies often became unduly enhanced, with resulting abnormal loudness or distortion of the sound commonly known in the art as \u201cblasting\u201d. As a consequence, the fidelity of the reproduction was imperfect and inadequate.\nBearing in mind the enormous extension of the moving picture business, it is easy to understand how important it was to increase the capacity of the apparatus in translating the range frequency and the amplitude of the sound waves and to improve the tone quality so as to make the reproduction satisfactory from the viewpoint of the practical purposes for which it was intended. We would gather from the evidence that many a skilled craftsman was at work endeavouring to overcome the difficulties and some hundreds of patents were taken out with regard to all sorts of diaphragms, driving mechanisms and sound boxes with the object of solving the problem.\nWente, the inventor of the respondents\u2019 device, produced an ingenious article, of which the utility is conceded, and which brought a markedly superior result. It increased the frequency range capable of reproduction; its transmission was louder and more even; it improved the accuracy of the tone quality and did away with distortion or \u201cblasting\u201d. It met with ready adoption and quickly went into wide commercial use.\nWe agree with the learned President that there is no lack of subject-matter in the patent in suit. We also agree with him with regard to the objection founded on the prior art. It is not possible to base anticipation on the evidence adduced by the appellants.\nIn order to decide an objection grounded upon anticipation, one must look at the description in the specification, so as to ascertain what the invention really is. The claims may add light to it, but they are not meant for that purpose, and their object is mainly to define the extent of the monopoly to which protection is granted. It may be that a patentee has discovered and described & new thing for which he made no claim, in which case he will have no \u201cexclusive property and privilege\u201d, but obviously his patent may not be displaced upon the ground of prior knowledge or use by others.\nThe description in this patent is set out in an earlier part of the judgment. It clearly shows that the invention consists in a combination. It is a combination of four elements: a diaphragm, a sound chamber, a plug and means for driving or actuating the diaphragm. The diaphragm is described as comprising \u201ca stiff, dish-shaped, piston portion, a flexible corrugated portion and a flat portion which is clamped between the housing structure and the upper portion of the core structure\u201d. The sound chamber has the plug secured therein so as to decrease the cross-sectional areas of the sound passages therethrough. The plug is so shaped as to conform with the concavity of the dish-shaped diaphragm, the radius of the plug being slightly smaller and so arranged as to form with the diaphragm converging sound passages extending from the centre of the diaphragm and from its peripheral portion to a common sound passage, which is effectually the throat of the horn. (N.B. It is common ground that the horn, although an obvious adjunct of the apparatus and although referred to in the specification, is not an element of the patented combination). The driving or actuating means, throughout the \u201cdetailed description\u201d, are referred to as a coil and they are shown as such on the drawing. The specification states that \u201cthe light rigid coil\u201d is attached or connected to the stiff piston portion of the diaphragm and that, when assembled, it is positioned approximately at equal distance from the pole pieces of the electromagnet.\nThe invention lies in the particular combination so described: the combination of a diaphragm of a particular defined form actuated from the periphery of its rigid portion by a defined type of driving mechanism (the dynamic type) and used with a special type of sound chamber having in it a plug of a particular description. This is not, as was urged by counsel for the appellants, a mere aggregation or a juxtaposition of known contrivances. We have here a group of co-acting parts achieving a combined result or, as was said in British United Shoe Machinery Company Ltd. v. A. Fussell & Sons Ltd.[2], \u201ca collocation of intercommunicating parts so as to arrive at (what may be called) a simple and not a complex result\u201d. That satisfies the definition of a combination for the purposes of the patent law.\nHaving read the specification as describing a combination, it matters not whether, as contended by counsel for the appellants, the plug or the diaphragm or the coil driver or the sound chamber are old and were already known in the art as separate entities. On this branch of the case, viz.: anticipation, the only point is whether the actual combination is new. In the light of the evidence given at the trial, it appears that the particular diaphragm, the particular air chamber with the plug were never before used together in the way described; and it may be stated with certainty that not a single patent was referred to which anticipated the combination of elements constituting Wente\u2019s invention. It is idle to repeat that anticipation is not established by what the learned President so justly qualified the \u201cimaginary assemblage\u201d of separate elements gathered from glosses selected here and there in several and distinct anterior specifications. None of the prior patents relied on conveyed the same knowledge or gave information equal, in practical utility, to that given by the respondents\u2019 patent. The result is that the objection based on anticipation was rightly dismissed by the Exchequer Court.\nThe designer of the appellants\u2019 device, in the course of his testimony, made some reference to a demonstration in Dr. Lee de Forest\u2019s studio, in New York City, in February or March, 1926. On that occasion, he was shown an apparatus in the nature of a dynamic cone speaker and, as he thought, reproducing sounds in a very satisfactory way. In the same testimony a mere mention is made of another apparatus, the Panetrope R.C.A. 104, a performance of which was witnessed by him in a large auditorium in Salt Lake City in the year 1925. These were introduced in the evidence apparently to show that, at the time of Wente\u2019s invention, there were other types of loud speakers on the market suitable for talking moving picture equipment. The evidence was addressed neither to the issue of subject-matter, nor to that of anticipation. It may be that it might have been developed. As it stands in the record, it is entirely inconclusive. It gives no information whatever on the structure or on the operation of the apparatus and it is quite impossible to ask the court to make a finding on that kind of evidence.\nWe have so far reached the conclusion that the patent in suit, read as a patent for a combination, has subject-matter and utility and that it had not been anticipated. Before proceeding to consider the issue of infringement, it will be more convenient to examine the new point urged in this court by the appellants to the effect that the claims are insufficient and that the specification does not fulfill the requirements of section 14 of the Patent Act (c. 150 of R.S.C. 1927).\nAt the outset of the trial in the Exchequer Court, counsel for the respondents declared that they would rely only on claims 4 and 9 of the patent. Counsel for the appellants accepted this situation, so that the trial proceeded on the basis of the respondents\u2019 declaration, and it was limited to the question of the merits or demerits of the two claims in question. No evidence, no argument was addressed to the other claims; and the validity of the patent as a whole, upon the ground of insufficiency of the claims, was not put in issue. We think, therefore, the discussion must be restricted to claims 4 and 9. Here is the full wording of the two claims in dispute:\nClaim 4:\nAn acoustic device comprising a piston diaphragm having a flexible peripheral portion and a substantially dish-shaped central portion, means for driving said diaphragm at the periphery of its central portion, a horn, a sound chamber between said diaphragm and said horn, a plug in said sound chamber for decreasing the cross-sectional area of a portion of the sound passage therethrough. Claim 9:\nAn acoustic device comprising a diaphragm having a dish-shaped portion and a flexible portion, a coil attached to said dish-shaped portion for driving said diaphragm, and means juxtaposed to one face of said diaphragm for directing sound waves from the centre of the diaphragm outwardly and from the outer edge of said diaphragm inwardly to an annular passage, the face of said means conforming substantially to the face of the diaphragm juxtaposed thereto.\nThe objection made by the appellants is that these claims do not distinguish what is new from what was known or used before. There is no doubt it was at one time the rule in Great Britain that the claiming clause must clearly distinguish that which was old from that which was new; although it may yet be a question whether the rule applied to patents other than process patents or patents for improvements of a known article and whether it was ever meant to apply to a patent covering a combination as such. The old rule, however, has been considerably modified and the new doctrine found expression, amongst others, in Halsbury, \u201cLaws of England\u201d, vis. Patents & Inventions, sec. 340, at p. 162. In that section, we find the following:\nIt may be expedient or even necessary to mention in the claiming clause of the specification something which, though not the invention itself nor per se proper subject-matter of letters patent, helps to explain the Invention. If the claiming clause is drafted so as to claim this thing per se, the patent is clearly bad, for it claims something which is not the invention. * * * (But) upon the authorities it is now established that if the claiming clause does in fact claim the invention and does not claim anything that is old per se, the patent is not avoided because in the claiming clause that which is old is not distinguished from that which is new.\nIt will be sufficient for our purpose in that connection to refer to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in England, in the case of British United Shoe Machinery Company Ld. v. A. Fussell & Sons Ld.[3]. In that case, the inventor had applied for a new combination described in the specification and which claimed the whole combination as new. The objection was made that the claiming clause did not distinguish the old from the new. The earlier cases were considered and distinguished, and Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[4] was followed. Moulton L.J. said that it was not a good objection to a claim for a combination that the patentee had not distinguished old from new; that, apart from the duty of a patentee to delimit his invention, there is now no such duty on his part. He referred to a passage in Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co.[5]. The passage is illuminative on the point we are now discussing:\nThe first is an objection said to be founded upon the case of Foxwell v. Bostock[6], decided by the late Lord Westbury when Lord Chancellor. It is said to have been determined in that case that where there is a patent for a combination there must be a discovery, or explanation of the novelty, and the specification must show what is the novelty, and what the merit of the invention. I cannot think that, as applied to a patent for a combination, this is, or was meant to be, the effect of the decision in Foxwell v. Bostock6. If there is a patent for a combination, the combination itself is, ex necessitate, the novelty; and the combination is also the merit, if it be a merit, which remains to be proved by evidence. So also with regard to the discrimination between what is new and what is old. If it is clear that the claim is for a combination, and nothing but a combination, there is no infringement unless the whole combination is used, and it is in that way immaterial whether any or which of the parts are new. If, indeed, it were left open on the specification to the patentee to claim, not merely the combination of all the parts as a whole, but also certain subordinate or subsidiary parts of the combination, on the ground that such subordinate and subsidiary parts are new and material, as it was held a patentee might do in Lister v. Leather[7], then it might be necessary to see that the patentee had carefully distinguished those subordinate or subsidiary parts, and had not left it in dubio what claim to parts, in addition to the claim for combination, he meant to assert. The second objection to the first claim in the present case was founded on the doctrine of Lister v. Leather7. In the present case, however, no question of this kind appears to me to arise. The patentees claim, as I have said, for a combination under their first claim, calling it \u201cthe construction and arrangements of the parts of mechanism herein distinguished generally\u201d.\nAnd, after having made the quotation, Lord Fletcher Moulton adds[8]:\nTherefore what Lord Cairns said was,\u2014If what you have claimed, and the monopoly which you have obtained, is for a combination, that combination is the novelty, and you have no obligation beyond accurately defining it. In my opinion that is the law as it now stands.\nLord Justice Buckley expressed the same view, and his judgment was that where a patentee claims what is substantially a new combination, he need not discriminate and identify that part of his combination which is new. He said[9]:\nThe combination is the novelty, and to sufficiently describe the combination is sufficient to describe the novelty; but if the combination is not new, which is the case first put by Lord Selborne in Moore v. Bennett[10], so that there cannot be a valid patent for a combination, then even though the patentee misdescribes it as a new combination, which by hypothesis it is not, the novelty must be in the subordinate integer. Foxwell v. Bostock[11] then applies. To describe it as a new combination is, in such a case, to misdescribe it. The invention in such a case is the improvement upon a particular part of an old combination, and the part must be identified by the patentee.\nWe do not think that section 14 of the Patent Act prescribes any different rule. The section requires that:\nThe specification shall\n(a) correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor;\n(b) set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making or compounding, a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter;\n(c) end with a claim or claims stating distinctly the things or combinations which the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege.\nWhat is required, therefore, under our law, is that the applicant should give a full and correct description of the invention and its operation or use. If the invention is a new process, he should set forth clearly the various steps in the process; if a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, the specification should explain the method of constructing, leaking or compounding the same. Then, in every patent, the claim or claims must state distinctly what the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property and privilege. If the invention be a new thing, or the improvement of a thing, he must so state; but where the invention consists merely in the new combination of old elements or devices, such combination is sufficiently described if the elements or devices of which it is composed are all named and their mode of operation given and the new and useful result to be accomplished pointed out (Compare: Bates v. Coe[12]). It is only if the applicant desires to claim invention for a subordinate element per se that it is necessary for him to claim the element separately, if he wishes to secure in it an exclusive property and privilege.\nIn the present case, we have already indicated the reasons why we thought the patent ought to be construed as a patent for a combination, and nothing mere. We are dealing with a meritorious invention; and the respondents are entitled to have their claims interpreted \u201cby a mind willing to understand, not by a mind desirous of misunderstanding\u201d (Lister v. Norton[13]). Claims 4 and 9 must be read with reference to the entire specification; and it is sufficient if it appears from the claims so read what the patentee regards as his invention. See Fletcher Moulton on Patents, 1913 ed., p. 87; Terrell on Patents, 7th ed., p. 121. Here, the combination itself is the only thing which Wente regarded as his invention. He correctly and fully described it in the description part of the specification. He indicated the method of constructing and making the new combination in the detailed description and in the accompanying drawing which forms an essential part of the patent; and, upon a fair construction of claims 4 and 9 construed with reference to the entire specification, there can be no doubt, in our view, of the exact nature of the invention which he claimed as new; and there exists no difficulty in ascertaining and defining what are the exact parts of his Dew combination and what his monopoly covers. It should be added that, had we come to the conclusion that the specification and drawing contain more or less than was necessary for obtaining the end for which they purported to be made, there was not the slightest suggestion that such omission or addition had been wilfully made for the purpose of misleading (Patent Act, s. 31).\nThe attack made by the appellants upon the patent of the respondents having failed, the only remaining point is that of infringement; and, in regard to it, we find no difficulty in following the finding made by the Exchequer Court. The appellants\u2019 device is substantially the same as the respondents\u2019 device. The diaphragm in one is dished in the opposite direction to the way it is dished in the other; but obviously the appellants cannot escape infringement upon such a flimsy pretence. There is a hole in the middle of the plug designed for the appellants\u2019 apparatus; but this slight difference is more apparent than real. In effect, as the evidence shows, the difference has no bearing on the nature of the device or in the method of its operation. The trial judge found, and the evidence establishes, we think, that the response curves of the defendants\u2019 device, taken according to standard practice, indicate that the sound intensity for the different frequencies are practically the same with the hole free, or with the hole plugged. The hole does not seem to have any practical effect in so far as results are concerned.\nAll the characteristics of Wente\u2019s patent are incorporated in the appellants\u2019 device and we are unable to agree with the appellants that the central aperture in the plug saves them from infringement of Wente\u2019s invention. The scientific fact is that both plugs (aperture or no aperture) were put there substantially for the same function and their performance is practically identical. We have therefore two devices based upon the same principles, composed of the same elements, and producing no results materially different. In those circumstances, we must come to the conclusion that one is a mere imitation of the other and that therefore the respondents\u2019 patent has been infringed (Collette v. Lasnier (1)).\nFor the above reasons, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1933] Ex.
