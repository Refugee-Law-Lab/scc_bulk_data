Martin (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1925: November 13; 1926: February 2.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nServitude\u2014Right-of-way\u2014Subdivision plan\u2014\u201cLane\u201d\u2014\u201cDestination du p\u00e8re de famille\u201d\u2014Registration\u2014Arts. 17 (12) 551, 2116a, 2175 C.C.\nIn 1908, the appellants prepared a subdivision plant of lot 82, situated in the village of Thetford Mines, which plan was deposited, in accordance with article 2175 C.C., in the office of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, with a book of reference, both certified by the appellants. This plan showed, inter alia, two rows of building lots of a uniform width of 50 feet by 90 feet in depth, and between each row there was a narrow strip of land measuring, by the plan, 20 feet in width by a depth of 900 feet. The book of reference described this strip of land, which bore subdivision number 52-82, as a lane. Subsequently the appellant sold lots abutting on the lane, without in express terms having granted a right-of-way over the lane to the purchasers. The respondent, having purchased subdivisions nos. 86, 87 and 88 of lot 82, claimed the right of passage over this strip of land, and the appellants, who intervened in this case on the demand of the defendant to whom they had sold a portion of the lane, denied the existence of any servitude in favour of the respondent.\nHeld that a servitude \u201cpar destination du p\u00e8re de famille\u201d over the strip of land had been created, and that the plan and book of reference were a sufficient specification in writing of the nature, the extent and the situation of the servitude, as required by art. 551 C.C.\nHeld also that the provisions of article 2116a C.C. with respect to the registration of real, discontinuous and unapparent servitudes constituted by title, do not apply to a servitude created by \u201cdestination du p\u00e8re de famille,\u201d such servitude not being a contractual servitude.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 39 K.B. 374) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nA. Perrault K.C. and J. E. Perrault K.C. for the appellants. A. Lemieux K.C. and S. Deschamps K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014Deux questions se pr\u00e9sentent en cette cause:\u2014\nI. Le droit de passage r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, comme affectant le lot n\u00b0 82-52 du plan de subdivision du lot n\u00b0 82 (Thetford Mines, auparavant Kingsville) d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par les propri\u00e9taires de ce terrain en 1908, a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement constitu\u00e9 comme servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille conform\u00e9ment aux exigences \u00e0 l\u2019article 551 C.C.?\nCet article se lit comme suit:\u2014\n551.\u2014En fait de servitude, la destination du p\u00e8re de famille vaut titre, mais seulement lorsqu\u2019elle est par \u00e9crit, et que la nature, l\u2019\u00e9tendue et la situation en sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es.\nCe plan de subdivision a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du Commissaire des Terres de la Couronne avec le livre de renvoi au d\u00e9sir de l\u2019article 2175 C.C. Le Commissaire, apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir approuv\u00e9, en a transmis copies au r\u00e9gistrateur, et ces copies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au bureau d\u2019enregistrement de la division o\u00f9 se trouvent les terrains affect\u00e9s par la subdivision.\nLe plan montre, entre autres choses, deux rang\u00e9es de lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir d\u2019une largeur uniforme de 50 pieds et de 90 pieds de profondeur, et entre chaque rang\u00e9e il y a une lisi\u00e8re \u00e9troite mesurant 20 pieds sur une longueur de 900 pieds. Cette lisi\u00e8re est d\u00e9crite au livre de renvoi comme \u201cruelle\u201d, et porte le num\u00e9ro 82-52. Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es par le juge-en-chef de la cour d\u2019appel et par le juge Dorion, nous croyons que l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er une servitude de passage sur cette ruelle au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des propri\u00e9taires et occupants des lots riverains est suffisamment manifest\u00e9e. Nous croyons aussi que le plan et les \u00e9nonciations du livre de renvoi \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration par les propri\u00e9taires que la lisi\u00e8re ou ruelle servirait de passage pour l\u2019avantage des lots et que, dans leurs transactions avec les acheteurs de lots, ils se baseraient sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de choses constat\u00e9 au plan et au livre de renvoi.\nLe point en contestation est de savoir si dans ces circonstances la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la servitude sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es au d\u00e9sir de l\u2019art. 551 C.C. Nous croyons que s\u2019il y a un \u00e9crit, m\u00eame mal r\u00e9dig\u00e9, dont une cour de justice puisse tirer la conclusion, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation juridique, que l\u2019intention a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir une servitude de passage au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019un autre terrain, il y a alors la sp\u00e9cification que l\u2019article exige. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il para\u00eet hors de doute que l\u2019article 551 C.C. peut \u00eatre ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, et comme cette interpr\u00e9tation, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la cour d\u2019appel, est conforme \u00e0 la justice et satisfait aux besoins de la pratique en mati\u00e8re de subdivision de lots, nous croyons devoir l\u2019adopter comme se conformant suivant toute vraisemblance \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de la loi.\nDu reste, ce n\u2019est pas parce que la sp\u00e9cification de la servitude serait faite dans un plan que ce plan ne pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l\u2019\u00e9crit dont parle l\u2019article 551 C.C.\nAux termes du paragraphe 12 de l\u2019art. 17 C.C.,\nles termes \u201c\u00e9critures,\u201d \u201cecrits\u201d et autres ayant la m\u00eame signification, comprennent ce qui est imprim\u00e9, peint, grav\u00e9, lithographi\u00e9, ou autrement trac\u00e9 ou copi\u00e9.\nEt l\u2019original du plan de subdivision en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par tous les propri\u00e9taires des terrains subdivis\u00e9s.\n2. La seconde question, telle que les appelants la posent, est celle-ci: Y a-t-il eu \u201cd\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement\u201d au sens de l\u2019article 2116a du code civil? Nous croyons cependant que la v\u00e9ritable question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, est de savoir si cet article s\u2019applique \u00e0 la servitude de passage que r\u00e9clame l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui est une servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Sur ce point, nous sommes d\u2019avis que cette servitude n\u2019est pas une des servitudes vis\u00e9es par l\u2019article 2116a C.C. Cet article dit:\u2014\n\u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019enregistrement, nulle servitude r\u00e9elle, contractuelle, discontinue et non apparente n\u2019a d\u2019effet vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers acqu\u00e9reurs et cr\u00e9anciers subs\u00e9quents dont les droits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s.\nL\u2019amendement de 1916 (6 Geo. V., c 34), qui a ajout\u00e9 au code le nouvel article 2116b C.C., et qui ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 cette cause o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit d\u2019une servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e avant le 1er janvier 1917, a consid\u00e9rablement \u00e9largi cette disposition en l\u2019appliquant \u00e0 toutes les servitudes r\u00e9elles et contractuelles. Il n\u2019y a au code civil aucune autre disposition exigeant l\u2019enregistrement des servitudes\u2014car l\u2019article 2116a C.C., malgr\u00e9 sa forme n\u00e9gative, n\u2019est pas une exception d\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019on puisse conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale requ\u00e9rant l\u2019enregistrement des servitudes\u2014et dans le cas de l\u2019article 2116a C.C. comme de l\u2019article 21166 C.C., il ne s\u2019agit que des servitudes contractuelles, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire cr\u00e9\u00e9es par un contrat, ce que le texte anglais de ces articles traduit par les mots \u201cconstituted by title\u201d. La servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille n\u2019est pas une servitude contractuelle. Elle r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un fait, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de l\u2019arrangement effectu\u00e9 par le propri\u00e9taire de deux fonds ou de deux parties d\u2019un m\u00eame fonds, par lequel il destine l\u2019un des fonds ou une partie distincte d\u2019un m\u00eame fonds au service de l\u2019autre. On ne peut concevoir qu\u2019elle soit cr\u00e9\u00e9e par un contrat, car au moment o\u00f9 la destination intervient il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul propri\u00e9taire du tout, et c\u2019est par lui que l\u2019arrangement ou la disposition des fonds est fait. Et on ne peut dire non plus que la servitude ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201cconstituted by title\u201d, bien que la destination vaille titre quand elle satisfait aux exigences de l\u2019article 551 C.C., car \u201cvaloir titre\u201d n\u2019est pas \u201c\u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9 par un titre\u201d, ce qui, le texte fran\u00e7ais des articles 2116a et 2116b C.C. le d\u00e9montre, s\u2019entend d\u2019une servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par un contrat. Il nous para\u00eet donc clair que l\u2019article 2116a C.C. que les appelants invoquent ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la servitude dont il s\u2019agit en cette cause. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en discuter autrement la port\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Perrault, Lavergne & Girouard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S. Deschamps.\n[1] [1925] Q.R. 39 K.B. 374.\n"

Eddy Company Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1925: November 11, 12; 1926: February 2.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWatercourses\u2014Driving timber\u2014\u201cDamages resulting\u201d\u2014Reparation\u2014Riparian rights\u2014Ownership of logs\u2014Culling\u2014Final delivery\u2014Meaning of art. 7302a R.S.Q.\u2014Arts. 7298 and 7349 (2) R.S.Q.\u2014(Q) 4 Geo. V, c. 56.\nThe appellant company was owner of a lot comprising land on both sides of the Quyon river, in the county of Pontiac, and of the water power, water rights and hydraulic privileges connected therewith. It built thereon a flour and grain mill and a concrete dam for the purposes of developing and using the water power. The Quyon river is neither navigable nor floatable except for single pieces of timber and loose logs. The respondent company made, as buyer, a contract with B. & A. as sellers, \u201cfor the purchase and sale of spruce pulpwood and pine logs to be taken out by the sellers and delivered to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company, Limited, on the Ottawa river at the mouth of the Quyon river for the buyers * * *.\u201d B. & A. were at liberty to cut the logs and pulpwood wherever they chose and they were to pay all claims for Crown timber dues. The \u201cdrive\u201d was made under the exclusive direction and control of B. & A. The price was made payable partly when the wood should have been cut and skidded, partly when hauled and delivered on the Quyon river and the balance \u201cwhen the contract shall have been completely fulfilled.\u201d Under the memorandum of agreement, the logs and pulpwood were to be measured, culled and checked in the bush and before they were hauled for floating down the Quyon river, and they were then to be axe marked and hammer stamped with the timber mark of the respondent company. On or about May 20, 1923, pulpwood and logs cut by B. & A., while being floated down the river, reached the mill of the appellant company, which was situated at a point above the place of delivery to the respondent company, and piled with great force and pressure against and upon the dam and works of the mill, which they injured and in part destroyed. The appellant company, alleging carelessness and negligence on the part of those handling and driving on behalf of the respondent company, sued the latter for $3,140; and the main defence was a denial of ownership and possession of the logs and pulpwood and of responsibility for the drive.\nHeld that the respondent company was not liable, as it was not the owner of the logs and pulpwood when the damages to the dam and works of the appellant company occurred, since title to these logs and pulpwood would only pass to the respondent company upon \u201cfinal delivery\u201d being made on the Ottawa river.\nHeld, also, that art. 7302a R.S.Q., as enacted in 1914 (4 Geo. V, c. 56) does not apply to a person who, although not the owner, has some interest in logs floated down rivers and streams and it merely embodies an interpretation recently given by judicial authority to art. 7298 R.S.Q. as it then stood. Art. 7302a does not extend the responsibility for floating and transmitting timber down rivers and streams beyond that imposed by art. 7349 (2), under which the obligation to make compensation does not rest on persons who neither own the logs, nor control, as mandators or otherwise, the floating operations.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nH. Aylen K.C. and J. A. Aylen for the appellant.\nT. P. Foran K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The respective rights and obligations of riparian owners and of persons engaged in the floating or transmission of logs and timber down rivers and streams in the province of Quebec have already formed the subject of a series of cases; and, so long as the law contained both in the codes and the statutes remains as it is, they are well settled by jurisprudence. McBean v. Carlisle[1]; Pierce v. McConville[2]; Laurin v. The Charlemagne and Lake Ouareau Lumber Co.[3]; Atkinson v. Couture[4]; Bazinet v. Gadoury[5]; V\u00e9zina v. The Drummond Lumber Co.[6]; McKelvie v. Miller referred to in Ward v. Township of Grenville[7]; King v. Ouellet[8]; Green v. Blackburn[9]; Therrien v. Edwards[10]; Pepin v. Villeneuve[11]; Richardson v. Paradis[12]; Tanguay v. Price[13]; Ward v. Township of Grenville7; Gale v. Bureau[14]; Club de chasse de Ste. Anne v. Rivi\u00e8re Ouelle Pulp & Lumber Co:[15]; Fraser v. Dumont[16]. The right of lumbermen or others floating or \u201cdriving\u201d timber is not a paramount right but an easement, which must be exercised with such care, skill and diligence as may be necessary to prevent injury to or interference with the concurrent rights of riparian proprietors and public corporations entitled to bridge or otherwise make use of the rivers, streams and watercourses, and the effect of the decisions is that persons who avail themselves of the privilege thereby conferred are obliged to make compensation for all damages resulting from its exercise, except in regard to such as cannot be avoided by reasonable care and skill and those to which the riparian proprietor himself may have contributed, or which have been occasioned by his own fault.\nNavigable or floatable rivers (whether they be dependencies of the Crown domain or subject of private property), and the rights of user of these rivers for the purposes of navigation or the carriage of timber have already been defined by the Supreme Court of Canada (Tanguay v. Canadian Electric Light Company[17] and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Maclaren v. Attorney General for the province of Quebec[18]. In the present case, the Quyon Milling Company Limited was in possession as owner of a certain lot comprising land on both sides of the Quyon river, in the village of Quyon, in the county of Pontiac, and of the water power, water rights and hydraulic privileges connected therewith. It built thereon a flour and grain mill and a concrete dam for the purposes of developing and using the water power.\nIt says in its declaration that this Quyon river is neither navigable nor floatable, except for single pieces of timber and loose logs (\u201c\u00e0 buches perdues\u201d).\nOn or about May 20, 1923, so it is alleged, pulpwood, logs, timber and wood goods said to belong to the E. B. Eddy Company Limited, while being floated down this river, reached the mill of the Quyon Company and piled with great force and pressure against and upon the dam and works, which they injured and in part destroyed.\nThe Quyon Company said that this was due to the carelessness and negligence of those handling and driving these logs and pulpwood on behalf of the Eddy Company, and therefore prayed that the latter be adjudged and condemned to pay $3,140 with interest and costs.\nThe Eddy Company, while asserting that the damage done was due to the inherent weakness of the dam and works and their incapacity to resist the natural pressure of water suddenly increased in the river at that time of the year, mainly rested its defence upon a denial of ownership and possession of the logs and pulpwood in question and pleaded that the floating or driving thereof was in no sense made or carried on under its control.\nTo this, the Quyon company answered that even if the logs were being driven by independent contractors, who were to deliver them to the Eddy Company on the Ottawa river, at or below the mouth of the Quyon river, the damages could not be recovered from the contractors, who were of weak financial standing, and the Eddy Company could not by its contracts exclude or relieve itself from liability for these damages.\nThe trial judge found that, on the 20th May, 1923, the logs, etc., were not the property of the Eddy Company, that they were not under its control, but that the floating and \u201cdrive\u201d was being operated by Messrs. Bolam & Richard, acting not as mandatories of the Eddy Company but on their own account.\nHaving reached such conclusions, he felt it unnecessary further to examine the cause of the collapse of the Quyon works or the nature and extent of the damages and he dismissed the action. Upon appeal, his judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nOur attention was drawn to a statute enacted on the 19th February, 1914, being 4 Geo. V, c. 56, which, by section 3, added article 7302a to the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909. This amendment relates to the responsibility of those bringing logs down rivers and streams, and provides that\nNo person can exercise the rights and privileges conferred by this subsection without being liable for the damages caused by his operations on rivers, streams, creeks, lakes or ponds, or on the banks or shores of the same.\nThe \u201csubsection\u201d there referred to is s.s. II of par. 2 of section VIII of the first chapter of Title XII of the Revised Statutes, 1909. It deals with the\nright of floating and transmitting timber, etc., down rivers, streams and creeks, and of executing works for that purpose.\nIt begins by art. 7298, which reads as follows:\n7298. Subject to the provisions of this subsection, any person, firm or company may, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in this province.\nIt was argued at Bar that art. 7302a so added to the \u201csubsection\u201d was meant to apply to any person having any interest whatever in the logs and was therefore sufficient to fasten responsibility upon the Eddy Company in this case, even if it was not the owner of the logs, because eventually these logs were to be delivered to it and it was proven to have advanced money against the price of the logs, under the terms of its contract with Bolam & Richard.\nWe do not think however that this was the intent of the amendment.\u2014It was enacted shortly after the judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada in Dumont v. Fraser (18th February, 1913)[19], and of the Court of King\u2019s Bench in the case of Pepin v. Villeneuve (18th June, 1913)[20]. In the course of these judgments, both courts pointed to the apparent inconsistency between R.S.Q. 7298, as it then stood, and R.S.Q. 7349 (2): 7298. Subject to the provisions of this subsection, any person, firm or company may, during the spring, summer and autumn freshets, float and transmit timber, rafts and craft down all rivers, lakes, ponds, streams and creeks in this province.\n7349 (2). It shall be lawful, nevertheless, to make use of any river or watercourse, Jake, pond, ditch, drain or stream, in which or to the maintenance of which one or more persons are interested or bound, and the banks thereof, for the conveyance of all kinds of lumber, and for the passage of all boats, ferries and canoes, subject to the charge of repairing, as soon as possible, all damages resulting from the exercise of such right, and all fences, drains or ditches damaged.\nAfter having gone most completely into the history of this legislation, both courts held that\nthe privilege of transmitting timber down watercourses in the province of Quebec given by article 7298 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, was not granted in derogation of the obligation imposed upon those making use of watercourses for such purposes to make reparation for damages resulting therefrom by article 7349 (2) of the Revised Statutes of Quebec.\nAdmittedly however this interpretation was not free from difficulty; and it is only natural to assume that in enacting article 7302a, the legislature had in view nothing more than to do away with the seeming discrepancy between the two earlier articles and thus to indicate that it was in complete agreement with the views already expressed by the court of final resort in the province and the court of final appeal in the country. This, in our opinion, is the true import of s. 3 of c. 56 of 1914 (Que.). This statute introduced nothing new. It only declares legislatively what had been by judicial authority pronounced to exist in fact. It does not extend the responsibility of those floating and transmitting timber down rivers and streams beyond that to which art. 7349 (2) already subjected them; and it was never suggested until now that, under art. 7349 (2), the obligation to make compensation could rest on persons having neither ownership of the logs, nor the control, as mandators or otherwise, of the floating operations.\nThat being so, we think the trial judge and the court of appeal were right in their view that this question of ownership or control had first to be decided, and if, as they held, the logs were not the property of the Eddy Company nor under its control on the 20th May, 1923, it follows that the action of the Quyon Company was rightly dismissed.\nThese are, therefore, the questions presently to be examined. The answer to them must depend upon the particular contract and the special circumstances of the case (Joyal v. Beaucage[21]).\nThe memorandum of agreement, dated the 10th February, 1923\nbetween The E. B. Eddy Company, Limited, of Hull, Quebec, as buyers and Wm. Bolam and Albert Richard, of Campbell\u2019s Bay, Quebec, as sellers (provides), for the purchase and sale of spruce pulpwood and pine logs to be taken out by the sellers and delivered to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company, Limited, on the Ottawa River at the mouth of the Quyon River for the buyers, and also for the purchase and sale of spruce and balsam pulpwood, delivered f.o.b. cars on the Pontiac line; also for white pine logs to be taken out by the sellers and delivered to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company on the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Allumette Island for the buyers.\nThen follow specifications as to the approximate quantities of the \u201criver wood,\u201d the \u201crail wood\u201d and the \u201cwhite pine\u201d forming the subject of the agreement, the proportions of qualities, the diameters and the lengths. We are concerned only with the \u201criver wood\u201d and therefore leave out anything relating to the \u201crail wood.\u201d\nThe contract goes on:\nAll the above pulpwood and logs to be sound and cut from live or green trees, free from rot or doze, straight and cut square at the ends, and the knots trimmed flush with the body of the wood; the said pulpwood and pine logs to be measured, culled and checked by the culler of the buyers, such measurements\u2019 to be final and binding on both parties.\nThe sellers agree to supply boom timber and chains to contain all said river pulpwood and pine logs, and to boom out and deliver same to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company on the Ottawa River at the mouth of the Quyon River, or elsewhere on the Ottawa River for part of the pine logs at as early a date as possible during the spring of 1923.\n* * * * *\nThe sellers further agree to indemnify the buyers against any and all claims for Crown timber dues, and tolls for use of improvements on streams on which any of said pulpwood and pine logs are floated into the Ottawa river.\nThey also agree to axe mark each log of river wood and pine on both ends and on opposite sides about a foot from each end with the letter \u201cN\u201d a sufficient depth in the wood to insure a good plain mark, and also to hammer stamp each log at least four times on each end with a stamping hammer \u201cE\u201d supplied by the buyers.\nThe price, which the buyers agree to pay \u201cat their office in Hull, Quebec,\u201d is then fixed at varying \u201crates\u201d for the spruce and balsam \u201cfor river shipment,\u201d and for the white pine. It is made payable partly when the wood shall have been cut and skidded; partly when hauled and delivered on the Quyon river, and the balance \u201cwhen the contract shall have been completely fulfilled.\u201d\nAll above payments to be made on receipt of cullers\u2019 certificate that the wood has been delivered as per contract.\nIt is also understood that any money advanced on said spruce and balsam pulpwood and white pine logs taken out under this contract and not delivered in the spring of 1923, as per contract, shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum dating from January 1, 1923, until final delivery is made of such spruce and balsam pulpwood and white pine logs.\nIt will at once be seen that this is not a contract to cut standing trees or to float and deliver logs already owned by the Eddy Company or taken out of \u201climits\u201d belonging to it. Bolam & Richard could cut the logs and pulpwood wherever they chose. Their obligation was to manufacture logs and pulpwood and to deliver them for the buyers to a company indicated and at a place fixed in the contract.\nThey are to pay all claims for Crown Timber dues.\nFor the purpose of floating down the Quyon river and of delivery to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company, they agree \u201cto supply boom timber and chains,\u201d \u201cto boom out\u201d the logs and pulpwood and to pay the\ntolls for use of improvements on streams on which any of said pulpwood and pine logs are floated into the Ottawa river.\nIt is proven that the Eddy Company did not hire any of the men on the \u201cdrive,\u201d nor pay any of them, nor \u201cget any accounts from any of them\u201d and that it \u201chad no authority over the way they drove\u201d the logs and pulpwood.\nIncidentally, therefore, it is apparent, both by the terms of the agreement and from the evidence, that the holding of the trial judge that the \u201cdrive\u201d was made under the exclusive direction and control of Bolam & Richard cannot in fact be questioned\u2014subject to the consideration of the further point whether Bolam & Richard were then acting merely as the mandataries of the Eddy Company which, it is argued, had measured, culled and accepted the logs and pulpwood in the bush, before the \u201cdrive\u201d began.\nThe contract does say that a certain payment is to be made when the logs and pulpwood have been \u201ccut and skidded\u201d and that, for the purpose of such payment, certificates are to be issued by the culler after he has \u201cmeasured, culled and checked\u201d the wood. As the contract reads, however, the like operation would be equally required for the payment stipulated to be made when the logs have been \u201chauled and delivered on the Quyon river\u201d and also for the final payment \u201cwhen the contract shall have been completely fulfilled.\u201d So that, under the terms of the agreement, the measurements before the \u201cdrive\u201d are only provisional and gone into for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of money which is to be \u201cadvanced,\u201d and which \u201cshall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum, dating from January 1, 1923,\u201d as a loan against the price that will be due \u201cwhen the contract is completely fulfilled\u201d and \u201cfinal delivery is made of such spruce and balsam pulpwood and white pine logs.\u201d\nThe measurements and culling in the bush and on the Quyon river were necessary to carry out the contract with respect to these advances and for the purpose of determining their quantum. It is evident that these measurements are declared \u201cto be final and binding on both parties\u201d for that purpose only and in the sense that the decision of the culler was not open to discussion by the parties, for it cannot be understood to mean that the measurements in the bush will conclusively determine and appropriate the subject matter of the contract, since the provision that the culler\u2019s measurements \u201cshall be final and binding on both parties\u201d applied alike to measurements in the bush, on the Quyon river and on delivery at the mouth of that river.\nIn practice, Mr. Seymour Fisher, manager of the Woods-land division of the Eddy Company, explains how the operations were carried out:\nWitness: The bark mark and hammer mark were placed on the logs for identification purposes, so we could distinguish our logs from those of other people, and also to see that we got delivery at our mill of the amount of logs placed in the river.\nQ. When the logs would have reached the Ottawa river, according to the contract which I read as follows: \u201cto be taken out by the sellers and delivered to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company on the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Allumette Island for the buyers\u201d\u2014 when the logs would have been delivered there in the Ottawa river how would you know you got all the logs contracted for or for which an account was sent to you?\nA. Well, you would know just by having your culler travel the river and see that a good drive had been made and no logs left along the bank of the river, and then you would get a second check by checking up the logs when they came to Ottawa.\nQ. And how would you check them at Ottawa? A. Only by the hammer and bark marks.\nQ. And how check them along the Quyon?\nA. Only by the hammer marks or bark mark\u2014any log that did not contain those marks we could not consider as our logs.\nQ. Supposing you had hammered and bark-marked 10,000 logs in the bush and on the bank of the river in the winter time and you found 5,000 at the mouth of the Quyon or in the hands of the \u201cUpper Ottawa Improvement Company,\u201d what payment would you make?\nA. We would pay only for the logs that were delivered.\nQ. Delivered where?\nA. At the mouth of the Quyon on the \u2018Ottawa River.\nQ. And before making that payment what would you do with regard to the Quyon?\nA. We would have the man who measured the pulpwood and saw logs travel the banks of the river and ascertain whether it was all driven or not.\nQ. And if you found several hundred logs still on the banks of the Quyon river what would you do?\nA. We would only pay for the logs delivered at the mouth of the river, at the Ottawa.\nThe terms of the agreement therefore and the manner in which it was being carried out bring this case within the line of decisions where, provision being made for several successive measurements during the progress of the contract, it was held that title to the goods did not pass until the final measurement has been made, such as Th\u00e9berge v. Lavoie[22], where the holding was:\nConfirming judgment of the Superior Court which had dismissed appellant\u2019s petition in revendication, that the making of the first payment of $3.50 per thousand feet made pursuant to calculation of the estimated lumber contents of the logs and stamping thereof with the buyer\u2019s mark by his culler, could not be considered a payment of the price of the logs and an acceptance of delivery thereof such as to pass the ownership of them to the buyer; the object of the operation of culling and stamping being, in view of the contract, to determine the amount of advances to which the seller was entitled before sawing and that consequently the insolvent still remained proprietor of the logs which had not yet been sawn.\nSee also Loiselle v. Boivin[23]; Villeneuve v. Kent[24]; Curtis v. Miller[25].\nHowever, the logs and pulpwood were not only measured, culled and checked in the bush and before they were hauled for the floating on the Quyon river, they were also, as provided for by the memorandum of agreement, axe marked and hammer stamped with the timber mark of the Eddy Company; and it is urged that this, at least, was a setting apart sufficient to vest in that company the ownership of the logs and pulpwood.\nIn the words of Demolombe (vol. 24, no. 478),\nLa solution depend des circonstances et des caract\u00e8res plus ou moins ext\u00e9rieurs et probants de la marque.\nThe Timber Marking Act (c. 72, R.S.C., 1906), enacts that a\nperson who registers such timber mark shall thereafter have the exclusive right to use the same to designate the timber got out by him and floated or rafted\nby him and that no other person shall mark any timber with any mark so registered, but it does not go the length of saying that the mere marking or stamping of logs or timber is in itself evidence of ownership. In each of the cases above referred to: Th\u00e9berge v. La voie[26]; Loisclle v. Boivin[27]; Villeneuve v. Kent[28], and Curtis v. Millier[29], the lumber had been so marked or stamped and the Court of King\u2019s Bench refused to accept that as sufficient to pass the title in the lumber to the purchaser.\nStamping and marking are no doubt an important, but not a determining factor. Here, it was merely an incident in the carrying tout of the agreement and it is made clear by the evidence that the marks \u201cwere placed on the logs for identification purposes,\u201d so that they would be followed through the drive and \u201cdistinguished from those of other people\u201d\u2014to earmark the logs and pulpwood against the price of which the loan had been advanced.\nThe real point in the agreement between Bolam & Richard and the Eddy Company is that the logs and pulpwood respectively bought and sold are not logs and pulpwood \u201ccut\u201d and skidded\u201d in the bush, not logs and pulpwood \u201chauled and delivered on the Quyon river,\u201d but logs and pulpwood \u201cdelivered to the Upper Ottawa Improvement Company, Limited, on the Ottawa river at the mouth of the Quyon river.\u201d Those words, contained in the initial paragraph of the memorandum of agreement, are descriptive of the subject-matter of the sale. Until delivery had been so made on the Ottawa river, the subject-matter had not been ascertained, for it was only the logs and pulpwood which reached such delivery point that the Eddy Company bought. It was only as to such logs and pulpwood that \u201cthe contract (was) completely fulfilled\u201d and that the company agreed to pay the price fixed, provided they were so \u201cdelivered in the spring of 1923.\u201d As for logs in the bush or along the Quyon river there exists no agreement to buy them, nor to pay for them. \u201cAny money (advanced\u201d in respect of them stands as a loan which shall bear \u201cinterest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum dating from \u201cJanuary 1, 1923,\u201d and which must be reimbursed by Bolam & Richard after the \u201cspring of 1923,\u201d being the time stipulated for \u201cfinal delivery.\u201d\nIt was only when this \u201cfinal delivery\u201d was made on the Ottawa river that the title in the logs and pulpwood passed to the Eddy Company. That company was not therefore the owner, when these logs and pulpwood are alleged to have demolished the dam and works of the Quyon company on the 20th May, 1923.\nA case in point is Logan v. LeMesurier[30] decided by the Privy Council30:\nMessrs. H. L. & Co., of Montreal, entered into a written contract with Messrs. L. & Co., for the sale of a quantity of red pine timber, then lying above the rapids, Ottawa river, stated to consist of 1,391 pieces, measuring 50,000 feet, more or less, to be deliverable at a certain boom at Quebec, on or before the 15th of June, then next, and to be paid for by the purchasers\u2019 promissory notes of ninety days from that date, at the rate of 9\u00bdd. per foot, measured off; if the quantity turned out more than above stated, the surplus was to be paid for by the purchasers at 9\u00bdd. per foot, on delivery; and if it fell short, the difference was to be refunded by the sellers. The price of the 50,000 feet at the agreed rate, was paid by Messrs. L. & Co. according to the terms of the contract. The timber was not delivered on the day prescribed in the contract of sale, and when it arrived at Quebec, and before it was measured and delivered, the raft was broken up by a storm, whereby the greater part of the timber was dispersed and lost. Messrs. L. & Co., after the storm, collected such of the timber as could be saved, paid salvage for it, and applied the timber saved to their own use. In an action brought by Messrs. L. & Co. against Messrs. H. L. & Co., to recover the amount paid on their promissory notes, and for a breach of the contract, and for the difference between the contract price of 9\u00bdd. per foot and 10\u00bdd. per foot, the market price when the timber was to have been delivered;\nIt was\nheld by the Judicial Committee, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Lower Canada,\nI. That the action was maintainable.\nII. That, by the terms of the contract, until the measurement and delivery of the timber was made, the sale was not complete; and that the transfer of the property was postponed until the measurement at the delivery; and that the risk remained with the sellers.\nIII. That the taking possession of a part of the timber by Messrs. L. & Co., after the day mentioned for the delivery thereof, in the contract, and not at the place, could not be considered as an acceptance of the whole; nor could it be considered as an admission, that the property in the timber passed to them before the storm which broke up the raft.\nThe Court of Appeals of Lower Canada had held (p. 125)\nthat the stipulation of admeasurement and of delivery at a particular place, rendered the sale conditional and incomplete until the occurrence of those events, and that in the meantime the risk periculum rei venditae is not to be borne by the purchasers, etc.\nThere the circumstances were more favourable to the vendor Company\u2019s contention than they are here to that of the Quyon Company. The timber was\nfully specified by the description and the place where it lay,\nthe price was \u201cfixed in reference to an assumed measurement,\u201d the price was paid immediately, but\nwith a reserved right for the one party to recover part of that price, and for the other party to receive more, in case that assumption should prove to have been incorrect,\nyet the transfer of property was held to be \u201cpostponed until the measurement at the delivery.\u201d\nIn the present case, at the time the contract was entered into, no determined or ascertained timber was in existence to form the subject-matter of the contract; the logs and pulpwood bought and sold were stated to be those that would be delivered on the Ottawa River to the Ottawa Improvement Company, and any logs and pulpwood which did not reach such delivery point were not part of the subject-matter of the contract; no price was fixed, only the rates were agreed upon; no price was paid, but money was only advanced. It seems clear that a fortiori, under the present agreement, the intention of the parties was that the E. B. Eddy Company should, become the owner only at the point of delivery on the Ottawa river and,, as a consequence, only of such logs and pulpwood as would eventually reach that point.\nIn this view, this case must be distinguished from King v. Dupuis[31], and Dallaire v. Gauthier[32]. In the former case, the agreement amounted to an absolute sale of the mill output for the season. It was not a question of goods sold by weight or measure but a \u201clump\u201d sale of effects, certain, fixed and well defined. The logs had been culled and stamped and, upon the receipt of the return of the cullers, they had been paid for. Yet this stamping of the logs was looked upon as a presumption only until \u201cthe contrary be proved.\u201d The title was held to have passed because\nthe presumption was supplemented by oral evidence that a transfer of property was really intended.\nand because\nthe proof of the sale (appeared) upon the face of the written agreement.\nIt was\ntherein stipulated that all logs paid for by the purchasers shall be their property and shall be received and stamped with their name.\nDallaire v. Gauthier[33], in the Superior Court at Chicoutimi, was a similar case. It was found there that, by culling and stamping the wood, the parties had intended respectively to deliver and to accept it.\nAfter all, as Lord Brougham said in Logan v. LeMesurier[34] (p. 132):\nThe question must always be: what was the intention of the parties in this respect; and that is, of course, to be collected from the terms of the contract.\nIn the present case, we think the contract shows that the parties did not intend the ownership to pass until the logs and pulpwood had reached the Ottawa river.\nIf the ownership had not passed, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether, had the Eddy Company been the owner, it would have been relieved from liability because the damage was done while the logs were being transmitted by another person under contract with it. In Dickie v. Campbell[35], it was held that any one intending to carry on the transmission of logs down rivers in Nova Scotia, under the authority of R.S.N.S. (1900) c. 95, s. 17, could not, on account of the provisions of that statute, get rid of his liability for all damages caused thereby\nby simply having the operations put into execution by a contractor.\nWhether this would also hold good in Quebec and under Quebec law and statutes may be considered as an open question, notwithstanding the judgment of the Court of Review in Le Club de Chasse et de P\u00eache de Ouiatchouan v. La Compagnie de Pulpe de Ouiatchouan (1), in view of the different expressions of opinion in Dumont v. Fraser (2). In the present case, the sellers were entitled to float logs and pulpwood in their own right and to keep to themselves the privilege of driving them.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with c\u2019osts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aylen & Aylen.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.

(1920), c. 34, s. 6, enacting ss.s. 1 and 10 of s. 11.\nThe Royal Bank of Canada, having recovered judgment against B\u00e9langer for $14,036 caused it to be registered and with it a notice describing real estate of the debtor. Twenty months afterwards the debtor made an assignment under the Bankruptcy Act and the appellants were appointed trustees. The bank filed its claim with the trustees for the amount of the judgment, asserting a privilege in the nature of a judicial hypothec under the terms of art. 2121 C.C. which enacts that \u201cthe judgments and judicial acts of the civil courts confer hypothecs when they are registered * * *.\u201d Subsequently the trustees, acting under s. 53 of the Bankruptcy Act, disallowed the bank\u2019s claim in so far as it set up a privilege or hypothec upon the immovables, saving however the costs of registration, on the ground that the assignment took precedence of the bank\u2019s claim under subs. 10 of s. 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. That subsection provides that, from and after registration, a receiving order or authorized assignment in bankruptcy \u201cshall have precedence of all certificates of judgment, judgments \u201coperating as hypothecs * * *.\u201d\nHeld, Rinfret J. dissenting, that the disallowance of the bank\u2019s claim by the trustees was valid. When the Dominion Parliament enacted in terms, by subs. 10 of s. 11, that an order or assignment in bankruptcy should have precedence of all certificates of judgment and judgments operating as hypothecs, that priority attached for all purposes, including distribution as well as realization of the assets.\nHeld, also, Binfret J. dissenting, that the words \u201ccertificates of judgment,\u201d \u201cjudgments operating as hypothecs\u201d contained in subs. 10 of s. 11 include judgments and judicial acts of the civil courts which confer hypothecs under art. 2121 C.C.\nHeld, also, Rinfret J. dissenting, that subss. 1 and 10 of s. 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, belong and have strict relation to the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency and are within the powers of the Dominion Parliament.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the bank respondent\u2019s claim against the trustees.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nThe judgment appealed from was reversed[1].\nSt. Laurent K.C. for the appellants.\nLanctot K.C. and Thomson for the bank respondent.\nLanctot K.C. and Geoffrion K.C. for the Attorney General for Quebec.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault and Newcombe JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Royal Bank of Canada, one of the respondents, recovered judgments against P. E. Emile B\u00e9langer on 25th March, 1922, for $14,036.44, and caused the judgment to be registered in the registration division of Quebec, on 6th April, 1922, also, at the same time, causing to be registered a notice describing real estate of the debtor, as required by art. 2121 of the Civil Code, and later, on 11th April, 1922, a further notice, describing additional lands. The article reads as follows:\n2121. The judgments and judicial acts of the civil courts confer hypothecs when they are registered, from the date only of the registration of a notice specifying and describing the immovables of the debtor upon which the creditor intends to exercise his hypothec.\nAfterwards, on 24th December, 1923, the debtor made an authorized assignment for the benefit of his creditors under the Bankruptcy Act of the Dominion, c. 36 of 1919, and the appellants were, on 15th January, 1924, appointed trustees under this instrument; the assignment and appointment were registered as required by the Bankruptcy Act, ss. 8 and 9 of s. 11, the former as amended by s. 14 (2) of c. 31 of 1923. The bank filed its claim with the trustees for the amount of the judgment, asserting a privilege in the nature of a judicial hypothec against the real estate of the debtor described in the registered notices. Subsequently, on 8th May, 1924, the trustees, pursuant to their powers under s. 53 of the Bankruptcy Act, disallowed the bank\u2019s claim, in so far as it set up a privilege or hypothec upon the immovables in virtue of the judgment, saving however the costs of registration. The ground of the disallowance was that under s. 11, suites. 1 and 10, the assignment had precedence of the bank\u2019s claim. The bank appealed to the Superior Court at Quebec, alleging that the trustees had misinterpreted the relevant provisions of s. 11, or that, if their interpretation were correct, these provisions were incompetent to the Parliament of Canada; and, pursuant to the statutory requirements, the bank gave notice of its appeal, and of the constitutional question involved, to the Attorney General for Canada, and likewise to the Attorney General of Quebec. The latter filed an intervention in the case, supporting the contention of the bank in so far as it denied the validity of the legislation. The appeal was heard in the Superior Court before the learned Chief Justice, who reversed the decision of the trustees and restored the claim. He held that upon the true interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act the bank was not disentitled to recognition as a privileged creditor, and that therefore the question of legislative power did not arise, but that, if the enactment were intended to avoid the privilege or priority of the bank as a registered judgment creditor under the provisions of the Civil Code, the intention would fail to operate for lack of enacting authority. The trustees appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and that court unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act which were considered by the courts below, and must be reviewed upon this appeal, are those already mentioned; they are contained in s. 11, subss. 1 and 10, as enacted by s. 6 of c. 34 of 1920, and s. 10 of c. 17 of 1921. These two subsections, the former in its amended form, are here set out as follows:\n11. (1) Every receiving order and every authorized assignment made in pursuance of this Act shall take precedence over,\u2014(a) all attachments of debts by way of garnishment, unless the debt involved has been actually paid over to the garnishing creditor or his agent; and\n(b) all other attachments, executions or other process against property, except such thereof as have been completely executed by payment to the execution or other creditor; and! except also the rights of secured creditor under section six of this Act; but shall be subject to a lien for one only bill of costs, including sheriff\u2019s fees, which shall be payable to the garnishing, attaching or execution creditor who has first attached by way of garnishment or lodged with the sheriff an attachment execution or other process against property.\n(10) From and after such registration or filing or tender thereof (referring to the requirements for registration and filing contained in the preceding subsections 8 and 9) within the proper office to the registrar or other proper officer, such order or assignment shall have precedence of all certificates of judgment, judgments operating as hypothecs, executions and attachments against land (except such thereof as have been completely executed by payment) within such office or within the district, county or territory which is served by such office, but subject to a lien for the costs of registration and sheriff\u2019s fees, of such judgment, execution or attaching creditors as have registered or filed within such proper office their judgments, executions or attachments.\nIt should be observed that by subs. 16, added to s. 11 by c. 34 of 1920, it was enacted that the provisions of subsections 1 and 10, above quoted, should not apply to any judgment or certificate of judgment registered against real or immovable property in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick prior to the coming into force of the Bankruptcy Act, and which became, under the laws of the province wherein it was registered, a lien or hypothec upon such real or immovable property. And, subsequently, by c. 31, s. 5, of 1925, this subsection was repealed and re-enacted to include the province of Quebec. The provisions of subs. 16 distinctly shew that in 1925 Parliament considered that subss. 11 (1) and (10) had previously applied to judgments or certificates of judgment registered against immovable property in the province of Quebec, but they have no application in this case, because it was, as I have shewn, after the coming into force of the Bankruptcy Act that the judgment was recovered and registered\nI have come to a conclusion differing from that of the courts below upon both branches of the case.\nFirst, as to the interpretation, it will be perceived that subs. 10 of s. 11 provides explicitly that, from and after registration, a receiving order or authorized assignment in bankruptcy shall have precedence of all certificates of judgment, judgments operating as hypothecs, executions and attachments against land, except those which have been completely executed by payment. The learned chief Justice considers that this is a mere rule of procedure for the execution and application of the Bankruptcy Act, and does not affect the civil rights of hypothecary creditors, except so far as to provide that registration of the receiving order or assignment shall suspend the creditors\u2019 execution upon the immovables of the bankrupt, and that it endows the receiving order or assignment only with a priority,\nune pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces modes d\u2019ex\u00e9cutior, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits des cr\u00e9anciers, lesquels droits, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre exerc\u00e9s par eux, le seront par le syndic.\nHe says, moreover, as to the statutory expressions, \u201ccertificates of judgment,\u201d and, \u201cjudgments operating as hypothecs,\u201d that they are not known in the province of Quebec. To the like effect is the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec, speaking for the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nI confess, with great respect for the learned judges below, that I am unable to follow the interpretation or the reasoning by which they qualify and expound the meaning and effect of subs. 10 in its application to the province of Quebec. I find nothing, either in this subsection or in any other part of the Bankruptcy Act, to justify the opinion that, when Parliament enacted in terms that the order or assignment in bankruptcy should have precedence of all certificates of judgment and judgments operating as hypothecs, the priority should not apply for all purposes, including distribution as well as realization of the assets. If it had: been intended, as the learned judges seem to suggest, that, although the trustee in bankruptcy was to realize upon the immovables against which a judgment is registered, the proceeds when realized should nevertheless be subject to the charge which the creditor had obtained by registration of his judgment before the making of the receiving order or of the assignment, it is difficult to see what different or additional security is afforded to the creditor with regard to his costs, which are, by the subsection, expressly declared to enjoy a lien, that is a preference\u2014the same sort of preference I suppose as, upon the interpretation propounded by the learned judges, the creditor would have in respect to the whole amount secured by his judgment. It is not easy to express the meaning of the statute in words which make it more clear than those of the text; and, when s. 51, providing for the priority of claims, is read along with s. 11, the intention becomes manifest; I do not doubt that Parliament meant to create equality in the distribution as between ordinary creditors and judgment creditors, except as to the costs, which were to retain their priority.\nMoreover, it seems impossible to exclude from the description, \u201ccertificates of judgment,\u201d \u201cjudgments operating as hypothecs,\u201d the judgments and judicial acts of the civil courts which confer hypothecs under art. 2121 of the Civil Code. These judgments may, under the provisions of the article, be registered, and the registration is effected not otherwise than by producing to the registrar, accompanied by the statutory notice identifying the lands, an exemplification or certified copy of the judgment, which is the document in respect of which the requisite entries are made by the registrar; it is from the registration that the hypothecs result, and I should think therefore that these judgments and judicial acts, when registered, are not inappropriately described as \u201ccertificates of judgment\u201d or \u201cjudgments operating as hypothecs.\u201d Subsection 10 clearly was enacted for the whole of the Dominion, including the province of Quebec. The word \u201chypothec\u201d is apt to refer to the real right described in the code under that name (arts. 2016 et seq. C.C.). A judgment operates as a \u201chypothec\u201d in the province of Quebec when it is registered upon immovable property belonging to the debtor (arte. 2034, 2121 C.C.), and the \u201chypothec\u201d thereby acquired is the \u201cjudicial hypothec\u201d which, in the language of the code, \u201cresults from the judgments.\u201d (Arts. 2020, 2034 C.C.). Secondly, upon the question of legislative authority, it was contended that Parliament, in the execution of its powers of bankruptcy and insolvency, cannot alter the status quo as between debtor and creditor, in relation to privilege or priority, existing at the time when the act of bankruptcy is committed; that all rights then subsisting must be recognized, and that Parliament can provide only for the realization and distribution of the estate, subject to such creditors\u2019 charges, preferences and priorities as exist under the provincial laws at the time when the condition of the debtor\u2019s affairs make the Dominion procedure applicable. But this narrow definition of the enumerated powers of Parliament rejects the doctrine of the common or unoccupied field, where place must be found for the powers which are described as ancillary or incidental, or those possessing a double aspect, and is at variance with the course of legislative practice which has prevailed since the Union, and with the ruling cases.\nThe Insolvent Acts, c. 16 of 1869, and its successor, c. 16 of 1875, contained provisions for invalidating fraudulent preferences and conveyances, and they provided, moreover, that no lien or privilege, upon either the personal or real estate of the insolvent, should be created for the amount of any judgment debt by the issue or delivery to the sheriff of any execution, or by levying upon or seizing the effects or estate of the insolvent under any such writ, if before payment to the plaintiff of the moneys actually levied the estate of the debtor should have been assigned to an interim assignee or placed in compulsory liquidation under the Act, saving however the judgment creditor\u2019s lien or privilege for his costs. The Insolvent Act of 1875 and its amending Acts were repealed by c. 1 of 1880, and, two years later, an Act was passed respecting insolvent banks, insurance companies, loan companies, building societies and trading corporations, c. 23 of 1882. This Act was consolidated in the Revised Statutes, 1886, c. 129, as the Winding-Up Act, and, by s. 66, it was provided, not only that there should be no lien or privilege created for the amount of any judgment debt by the issue or delivery to the sheriff of any execution, or by levying upon or seizing under such writ the effects or estate of the company, but also that no lien, claim or privilege should be created upon the real or personal property of the company by the filing or registering of any memorial or minute of judgment, if, before payment over to the plaintiff of the moneys actually levied, paid or received under such writ, memorial or minute, the winding-up of the business of the company had commenced, saving in like manner the plaintiff\u2019s lien or privilege for costs. Sec. 66 remains in force as s. 84 of the Winding-Up Act, Revised Statutes, 1906, c. 144. The authority of Parliament to enact these provisions has certainly never been successfully attacked, and so far as I am aware has not been questioned, and when, at the argument, the attention of counsel was directed to the winding-up legislation they were not able to point to any decision in which the legislative power had been denied or doubted.\nIt was pointed out in Citizens and Queen Insurance Companies v. Parsons[2], that some of the classes of subjects assigned to the provincial legislatures unavoidably run into and are embraced by some of the enumerated classes of subjects in s. 91, and that, while it is not intended that the powers exclusively assigned to the legislatures shall be absorbed by the Parliament, nevertheless, with regard to certain classes of subjects, it is the duty of the courts to ascertain, and to define, in the particular cases before them, the limits of the respective powers belonging to Parliament and to the legislatures. Later, in Hodge v. The Queen[3], we are told that the principle which the Parsons Case (1) illustrates is that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within s. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within s. 91. Another exposition of the competing powers of legislation as between the Dominion and the provinces is very concisely expressed by Lord Dunedin in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney General for Canada[4], as follows:\nThe construction of the provisions of the British North America Act has been frequently before their Lordships. It does not seem necessary to recapitulate the decisions. But a comparison of two cases decided in the year 1894, viz., Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[5], and Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[6], seems to establish these two propositions: First, that there can be a domain in which provincial and Dominion legislation may overlap, in which case neither legislation will be ultra vires, if the field is clear; and secondly, that if the field is not clear, and in such a domain the two legislations meet, then the Dominion legislation must prevail:\nThat the enumerations of s. 91 describe exclusive Dominion powers has been frequently affirmed and is not denied. It was pointed out long ago by Lord Selborne, when he delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[7], that the words \":bankruptcy and insolvency,\" as mentioned in the 21st enumeration of s. 91,\ndescribe in their known legal sense provisions made by law for the administration of the estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent according to the rules and definitions prescribed by law, including of course the conditions in which that law is to be brought into operation, the manner in which it is to be brought into operation, and the effect of its operation.\nAnd, in Cushing v. Dupuy[8], Sir Montague Smith, delivering the judgment of the Committee, said:\nIt would be impossible to advance a step in the construction of a scheme for the administration of insolvent estates without interfering with and modifying some of the ordinary rights of property, and other civil rights, nor without providing same mode of special procedure for the vesting, realization and distribution of the estate, and the settlement of the liabilities of the insolvent.\nThen came the judgment of Lord Herschell in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada (the Assignments and Preferences Case (1), where the question was as to the validity of s. 9 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1887, c. 124, entitled \"An Act respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons.\" This section reads as follows:\nAn assignment for the general benefit of creditors under this Act shall take precedence of all judgments and of all executions not completely executed by payment, subject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs, where there is but one execution in the sheriff's hands, or to the lien, if any, of the creditor for his costs, who has the first execution in the sheriff's hands.\nIt was contended on 'behalf of the Attorney General for Canada that this enactment was incompetent to the legislature of Ontario as affecting the exclusive Dominion power of bankruptcy and insolvency. At that time the former Dominion Insolvent Acts had been repealed, and the Dominion field of bankruptcy and insolvency was, except as to the companies to which the Winding-Up Act applied, unoccupied. It will be perceived that the declared intention of the legislature was to displace the precedence which had belonged to judgment or execution creditors, except to costs, and to give priority to assignments for the general benefit of creditors. In the present case, the contention is, conversely, that Parliament cannot give effect to a similar provision with regard to the operation of a receiving order or compulsory assignment in bankruptcy as against a creditor who, under the provincial law, is first in the race for execution. It is apparent I think that the observations of Lord Herschell, at pp. 200-1[9], effectively dispose of this contention. His Lordship said:\nIt is not necessary in their Lordships' opinion, nor would it be expedient to attempt to define what is covered by the words \"bankruptcy \" and \" insolvency \" in s. 91 of the British North America Act. But it will be seen that it is a feature common to all the systems of bankruptcy and insolvency to which reference has been made, that the enactments are designed to secure that in the case of an insolvent person his assets shall be rateably distributed amongst his creditors whether he is willing that they shall be so distributed or not. Although provision may be made for a voluntary assignment as an alternative, it is only as an alternative. In reply to a question put by their Lordships the learned counsel for the respondent were unable to point to any scheme of bankruptcy or insolvency legislation which did not involve some power of compulsion by process of law .to secure to the creditors the distribution amongst them of the insolvent debtor's estate.\nIn their Lordships' opinion these considerations must be borne in mind when interpreting the words \"bankruptcy\" and \" insolvency \" in the British North America Act. It appears to their Lordships that such provisions as are found in the enactment in question, relating as they do to assignments purely voluntary, do not infringe on the exclusive legislative power conferred upon the Dominion Parliament. They would observe that a system of bankruptcy legislation may frequently require various ancillary provisions for the purpose of preventing the scheme of the Act from being defeated. It may be necessary for this purpose to deal with the effect of executions and other matters which would otherwise be within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature. I Their Lordships do not doubt that it would be open to the Dominion Parliament to deal with such matters as part of a bankruptcy law, and the provincial legislature would doubtless be then precluded from interfering with this legislation inasmuch as such interference would affect the bankruptcy law of the Dominion Parliament. But it does not follow that such subjects, as might properly be treated, as ancillary to such a law and therefore within the powers of the Dominion Parliament, are excluded from the legislative authority of the provincial legislature when there is no bankruptcy or insolvency legislation of the Dominion Parliament in existence.\nThis decision clearly recognizes the necessity, or at least the propriety, of including in general bankruptcy legislation such provisions as those of s. 11 (1) and (10) of the Bankruptcy Act; and, following the view expressed by their Lordships, I hold that these enactments belong or have strict relation to the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency, and are therefore, as provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, within the paramount authority of Parliament.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, and the disallowance should be restored.\nRinfret J.

E. B\u00e9langer, que les syndics ont rejet\u00e9e en s\u2019appuyant sur ce paragraphe de la loi.\nSur le sens de ces expressions et la question de savoir si, dans cette province, elles correspondent \u00e0 une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 quelconque, je ne saurais rien ajouter \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit les deux jugements qui sont port\u00e9s en appel devant cette cour. On objecte que leur interpr\u00e9tation ne tient aucun compte des mots \u201cassujettis \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge pour les frais d\u2019enregistrement\u201d. La r\u00e9ponse me para\u00eet \u00eatre que: s\u2019il n\u2019y a dans la province ni \u201ccertificats de jugement,\u201d ni \u201cjugement op\u00e9rant comme hypoth\u00e8ques,\u201d la phrase accessoire qui les suit et les qualifie (\u201cassujettis \u00e0 un privil\u00e8ge pour les frais d\u2019enregistrement\u201d) ne peut non plus s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 quoi que ce soit dans la province et il n\u2019y aurait donc pas lieu de s\u2019en occuper, lorsqu\u2019on discute un litige de cette province.\nSans doute, cette interpr\u00e9tation est stricte, mais on ne saurait l\u2019\u00eatre trop, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019accepter une pr\u00e9tention qui aurait pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre une garantie hypoth\u00e9caire reconnue par le droit civil et dont les origines remontent \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterets (1539) et \u00e0 l\u2019Ordonnance de Moulins (1566).\nLes notes des juges de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et de la Cour du Banc du Roi me dispensent de tracer l\u2019historique de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Elle est, dans son essence, identiquement semblable \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale et \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle. Elle n\u2019a rien de la proc\u00e9dure, mais est uniquement mati\u00e8re de droit civil.\nComme tout instrument hypoth\u00e9caire, elle se divise en deux parties: l\u2019obligation et la garantie. L\u2019obligation personnelle (convention, loi ou jugement de condamnation) est de nature diff\u00e9rente dans chaque genre d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que; mais la garantie elle-m\u00eame, qu\u2019elle soit conventionnelle, l\u00e9gale ou judiciaire, est r\u00e9gie exactement par les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles de droit (arts. 2016 \u00e0 2081 C.C.) et produit les m\u00eames effets. En sorte que, dans le cas actuel, si B\u00e9langer avait, avant sa cession autoris\u00e9e, c\u00e9d\u00e9 sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire de la Banque Royale, cette derni\u00e8re aurait continu\u00e9 d\u2019avoir sa r\u00e9clamation hypoth\u00e9caire contre le tiers-d\u00e9tenteur, tout en conservant son jugement contre B\u00e9langer.\nC\u2019est donc avec raison, dans mon humble opinion, que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont envisag\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance de la Banque Royale sous son double aspect: dont l\u2019un, en tant que jugement ex\u00e9cutoire, est du ressort de la proc\u00e9dure; mais dont l\u2019autre, en tant que garantie hypoth\u00e9caire, constitue un droit acquis, auquel on h\u00e9site \u00e0 supposer que le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ait voulu attenter.\nIl me semble que toute l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la loi de faillite repousse cette supposition. Par la d\u00e9finition de la loi elle-m\u00eame, la Banque Royale est un \u201ccr\u00e9ancier garanti\u201d (2gg). Or, il serait oiseux de d\u00e9montrer que cette loi op\u00e8re en dehors des cr\u00e9anciers garantis. (Exemples: arts. 6-8b-13 (16)-42 (10) et (16). Cette particularit\u00e9 avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 frapp\u00e9 cette cour dans la cause de Riordon Co. v. Danforth Co.[10] et M. le juge Mignault y disait:\nThe general scheme of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be that secured creditors are considered as creditors of the insolvent debtor, for all purposes such as proving claims, voting at meetings of creditors and receiving dividends, only after deducting the value of their security. They may keep their security and remain entirely outside the bankruptcy proceedings. Under section 46 they may surrender their security and prove their debt for the whole, or realize it and prove for the balance, if any, of their debt; they have the further option of valuing their security which the trustee may redeem at its valuation or require it to be offered for sale, and the secured creditors rank only for the balance. Where they have done none of these things they are excluded from all share in any dividend. The case of the landlord is a special one and is dealt with in section 52.\nL\u2019article 51 en est une preuve \u00e9clatante puisque, en donnant Tordre de priorit\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations, il ne parle pas du tout des cr\u00e9anciers garantis.\nLes modifications que la loi a subies depuis n\u2019en ont pas chang\u00e9 l\u2019aspect sous ce rapport.\nIl est d\u2019ailleurs logique qu\u2019il en soit ainsi. L\u2019hypoth\u00e8que est un d\u00e9membrement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. On peut consid\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en dehors du domaine du failli jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant de la dette hypoth\u00e9caire; et la cession des biens appartenant au failli ne concerne v\u00e9ritablement que \u201cl\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9\u201d ou valeur exc\u00e9dant le montant de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que.\nDans une loi qui, de cette fa\u00e7on, fait exception constante du cr\u00e9ancier garanti, i.e. du cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire, on est justifiable de d\u00e9cider que le paragraphe 10, article 11, n\u2019a pas pour but de l\u2019affecter, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on ne soit contraint \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision contraire par un texte positif ou une d\u00e9duction in\u00e9luctable.\nOr, si l\u2019on examine le texte dont il s\u2019agit \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, l\u2019on constate ce qui suit:\nLa Banque Royale a un jugement contre B\u00e9langer et elle a en m\u00eame temps une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire.\nLe paragraphe dit que, \u00e0 la suite de son enregistrement, l\u2019ordonnance de s\u00e9questre a priorit\u00e9 sur les \u201c certificats de jugement\u201d ou \u201cjugement op\u00e9rant comme hypoth\u00e8ques\u201d. Assumons que ces expressions puissent s\u2019adapter \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure dans le Qu\u00e9bec. Il est certain, en tout cas, qu\u2019un \u201ccertificat de jugement\u201d n\u2019est pas une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Il est \u00e9galement certain qu\u2019un \u201cjugement op\u00e9rant comme hypoth\u00e8que\u201d n\u2019est pas une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire.\nUn cr\u00e9ancier obtient d\u2019abord un jugement. Cela n\u2019op\u00e8re pas comme hypoth\u00e8que. Cela ne conf\u00e8re au cr\u00e9ancier aucun droit hypoth\u00e9caire, mais, si l\u2019on veut, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape dans la proc\u00e9dure requise pour acqu\u00e9rir une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire (art. 2034 C.C.).\nAyant son jugement, et ne d\u00e9sirant pas l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter, mais voulant s\u2019en servir pour obtenir une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire, le cr\u00e9ancier s\u2019en fait remettre une copie certifi\u00e9e par l\u2019officier autoris\u00e9. (N.B. C\u2019est ce qui se rapproche le plus du certificat de jugement). Ce serait l\u00e0 la seconde \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure.\nLe cr\u00e9ancier d\u00e9pose ensuite la copie certifi\u00e9e de son jugement entre les mains du r\u00e9gistrateur avec \u201cun avis sp\u00e9cifiant et d\u00e9signant les immeubles du d\u00e9biteur sur lesquels le cr\u00e9ancier entend faire valoir son hypoth\u00e8que\u201d (arts. 2034, 2026, 2121 C.C.). C\u2019est la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape.\nLe r\u00e9gistrateur fait alors dans le registre la transcription de la copie certifi\u00e9e du jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, l\u2019inscription \u201cau moyen d\u2019un bordereau ou sommaire\u201d du jugement (arts. 2131, 2132, 2136, 2139 C.C.). C\u2019est la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tape. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019alors que le cr\u00e9ancier acquiert son hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Elle n\u2019est pas un mode d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, elle cr\u00e9e sur l\u2019immeuble sp\u00e9cialement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 un droit r\u00e9el en tout point semblable \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle. Dans un sens, elle cesse d\u2019\u00eatre un jugement. Elle est devenue une hypoth\u00e8que avec une existence distincte; bien que le jugement subsiste ind\u00e9pendamment d\u2019elle comme mode d\u2019ex\u00e9cution.\nOn con\u00e7oit donc que le paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 11 veuille dire que la cession de biens a priorit\u00e9 sur tout jugement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que, d\u00e8s l\u2019enregistrement de la cession de biens, le cr\u00e9ancier ne pourra plus se servir de son jugement pour commencer la proc\u00e9dure n\u00e9cessaire pour acqu\u00e9rir une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. L\u2019enregistrement de la cession de biens emp\u00eache le jugement d\u2019\u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Il arr\u00eate le cr\u00e9ancier dans la marche de sa proc\u00e9dure vers l\u2019acquisition de cette hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Et comme il se peut que cet arr\u00eat ou cette suspension ne se produise qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me ou la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, l\u2019article pr\u00e9voit que le cr\u00e9ancier, en voie d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir son hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire mais arr\u00eat\u00e9 en chemin avant d\u2019avoir franchi la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tape, aura un privil\u00e8ge pour lui assurer les frais qu\u2019il aura faits jusque-l\u00e0 pour les fins de l\u2019enregistrement de son jugement.\nCette clause relative aux frais peut \u00e9galement pr\u00e9voir le cas d\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier qui ferait enregistrer son jugement avant d\u2019avoir connu l\u2019existence de l\u2019ordonnance de s\u00e9questre ou de la cession autoris\u00e9e; comme, par exemple, entre le \u201cd\u00e9p\u00f4t\u201d de cette ordonnance ou de cette cession au bureau du district ou \u201cl\u2019offre de ces actes\u201d au registraire et l\u2019enregistrement lui-m\u00eame de l\u2019ordonnance ou de la cession. Cet enregistrement est sans doute un avis suffisant pour en enformer le cr\u00e9ancier porteur de jugement; mais il n\u2019en est pas ainsi du d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou de l\u2019offre de l\u2019ordonnance de sequestre ou de la cession au registraire. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 10, ce simple d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou cette offre seule arr\u00eate imm\u00e9diatement l\u2019effet futur de tout jugement ou de toute ex\u00e9cution et saisie-arr\u00eat bien que le public et les cr\u00e9anciers porteurs de jugement n\u2019ont aucun moyen d\u2019en \u00eatre inform\u00e9s avant l\u2019enregistrement proprement dit de l\u2019ordonnance ou de la cession de biens, et que, durant cet intervalle, ils ont pu encourir de bonne foi des frais d\u2019enregistrement inutiles.\nMais, toujours en assumant que les expressions s\u2019adaptent \u00e0 la loi du Qu\u00e9bec, ce paragraphe ne donne priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 la cession de biens que sur un jugement ou une copie certifi\u00e9e de jugement. Il ne dit pas et veut pas dire priorit\u00e9 sur une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire.\nLe d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019un jugement ne pourra plus s\u2019en servir soit pour faire saisir et vendre les biens de son d\u00e9biteur, soit pour obtenir une hypoth\u00e8que sur ces biens; et les proc\u00e9dures d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9es pour arriver \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces fins sont arr\u00eat\u00e9es par l\u2019enregistrement de la cession de biens.\nAinsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, le paragraphe 10 a l\u2019avantage de s\u2019harmoniser avec tous les autres paragraphes de l\u2019article 11. Noscitur a sociis. Il arr\u00eate, suspend ou pr\u00e9vient une proc\u00e9dure en marche ou un mode d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est d\u2019ailleurs confirm\u00e9e par l\u2019article 51 de la loi, qui, au deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a, d\u00e9finit les frais \u201cr\u00e9gis par les dispositions de l\u2019article 11, paragraphe 10\u201d, comme \u00e9tant \u201cles frais du cr\u00e9ancier ex\u00e9cutant\u201d. (Loi de faillite, art. 51 (1), 2e alin\u00e9a).\nEn passant\u2014comme le fait tr\u00e8s justement observer sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux,\u2014ce paragraphe \u201cne fait que donner \u2018une priorit\u00e9, une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence\u2019\". Il n\u2019annule pas; il ne fait rien dispara\u00eetre. Il pourrait tout au plus vouloir dire, s\u2019il s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire, que les droits du cr\u00e9ancier de cette derni\u00e8re, au lieu d\u2019\u00eatre exerc\u00e9s par lui-m\u00eame, le seront par le syndic. Mais m\u00eame cette interpr\u00e9tation restreinte serait incompatible avec les privil\u00e8ges reconnus au cr\u00e9ancier garanti par les articles 6 et 8b de la loi.\nMais il faut surtout insister sur le fait que le paragraphe 10 ne parle que de jugements, et nullement d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Il ne sugg\u00e8re en aucune fa\u00e7on l\u2019intention d\u2019an\u00e9antir une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire et de d\u00e9pouiller un citoyen d\u2019un droit compl\u00e9t\u00e9 et acquis.\nEn adoptant le point de vue des jugements des deux cours de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et celui que je viens d\u2019exposer, on \u00e9vite une cons\u00e9quence qui conduirait \u00e0 cet \u00e9trange r\u00e9sultat: la loi prot\u00e9gerait les hypoth\u00e8ques conventionnelles, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consenties au gr\u00e9 du failli; et elle r\u00e9pudierait les hypoth\u00e8ques judiciaires, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire celles qui sont acquises sous le contr\u00f4le des officiers de la loi.\nElle ferait pis encore. Elle rayerait compl\u00e8tement du code civil le chapitre de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire, car il ne semble pas y avoir de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9:\nIf the interpretation of the trustees is correct, then the whole economy of our civil law regarding judicial hypothecs is upset. If such a hypothec is only valid when the debtor is solvent, its usefulness is gone, and the protection it affords the creditor is illusory. If the debtor is solvent and remains solvent, a judicial or any other hypothec is of little or no value, as all creditors will be paid in full. It is precisely when a debtor is not solvent and there is not enough to pay all his creditors that the privilege which the law accords to the holder of a judicial or any kind of hypothec is of real value, and it is (precisely in this case that the Bankruptcy Act suppresses it, if the trustees are right in their interpretation of such act.\nTout en se bornant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider la cause sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019ils ont donn\u00e9e au paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 11 de la Loi de faillite, les juges de la province de Qu\u00e9bec ont indiqu\u00e9 que si la loi e\u00fbt empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les droits des cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires, elle serait, dans leur opinion, inconstitutionnelle. Sir Fran\u00e7ois Lemieux dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le fonctionnement de la loi de faillite d'enlever aux cr\u00e9anciers hypoth\u00e9caires leur droit d'hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire; et le juge Lafontaine ajoute:\nToucher, en effet, \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire, c'est toucher \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que conventionnelle comme l'hypoth\u00e8que l\u00e9gale, et, par cons\u00e9quent, a une mati\u00e8re appartenant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et aux droits civils; et l'annulation des hypoth\u00e8ques judiciaires, pas plus que des hypoth\u00e8ques conventionnelles, n'a rien de commun avec le fonctionnement d'une loi de faillite.\nLes caract\u00e9ristiques essentielles d'une loi de faillite sont l'institution des proc\u00e9dures pour faire reconnaitre l'insolvabilit\u00e9, l'adoption des mesures conservatoires pour pr\u00e9server les biens du failli, l'organisation d'un syst\u00e8me (machinery) pour l'administration de ces biens, la punition de l'insolvable pour les actes qu'il a commis au pr\u00e9judice de ses cr\u00e9anciers ou \u00e0 l'encontre de l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9, et la lib\u00e9ration du failli (Duncan, Law and Practice of Bankruptcy in Canada, p. 30). J'adopterai la d\u00e9finition qu'en donne le juge de premi\u00e8re instance:\nLe but de la loi de faillite, c'est de liquider, par l'entremise d'officiers sp\u00e9ciaux nommes par le tribunal ou par la loi, les biens de 'Insolvable; de distribuer les deniers provenant de la liquidation aux cr\u00e9anciers suivant leurs droits respectifs et leurs privil\u00e8ges; de permettre au failli d'obtenir un concordat et une d\u00e9charge, s'il est dans les conditions voulues par la loi.\nEn examinant \" l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative exclusive du parlement du Canada \" tir\u00e9e du paragraphe 21 de l'article 91 de L\u2019Acte de l'Am\u00e9rique britannique du Nord, il n'est pas utile \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de cette cause de poser des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et il suffit de se borner \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de la question qui est soulev\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sent litige. C'est le conseil que donnait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sir Montague Smith dans Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[11]:\nIn performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for those whom it is thrown to decide each case which arises as best they can without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nNous avons ici une situation bien d\u00e9finie: la faillite de Belanger, qui est du ressort de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et l'hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire de la Banque Royale, qui, en vertu du paragraphe 13 de l'article 92 de la constitution, tombe dans la cat\u00e9gorie de sujets sur lesquels les l\u00e9gislatures provinciales ont un pouvoir exclusif.\nL'on ne saurait dire que l'annulation des hypoth\u00e8ques judiciaires acquises avant l'existence de l'insolvabilit\u00e9 (comme dans le cas actuel) ait une relation essentielle, ou soit une consequence necessaire de \" la banqueroute et la faillite \" (art. 91, par. 21). Elle n'est pas, suivant les decisions qui ont d.fini les pouvoirs respectifs des l\u00e9gislatures McWale et provinciales, \" strictly related to the subject de la banqueroute et la faillite, ni \" truly substantive legislation on the subject or properly ancillary thereto \". La doctrine du pouvoir accessoire ou auxiliaire (ancillary) telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie dans Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion[12]:\nWhere such legislation is necessarily incidental to the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the enumerative heads of clause 91,\ntelle qu'on la retrouve \u00e0 sati\u00e9t\u00e9 dans City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[13], et telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9veloppement dans les d\u00e9cisions plus r\u00e9centes du Conseil Prive, \u00e9carte le pouvoir d'annuler une hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec sous pr\u00e9texte qu'il serait auxiliaire du droit de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la banqueroute et la faillite en vertu du paragraphe 21 de l'article 91. Il n'est pas du tout n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'exercice du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en rnati\u00e8re de banqueroute et de faillite de d\u00e9truire la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence et le droit acquis qui r\u00e9sultent de l'hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire. Ce pouvoir n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec les provisions made by law for the administration of the estates of persons who may become bankrupt or insolvent, according to the rules and definitions prescribed by law, including of course the conditions in which that law is to be brought into operation the manner in which it is to be brought into operation, and the effect of its operation, dont il est question dans L'Union Saint-Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[14].\nIl est clair qu'une l\u00e9gislation relative \u00e0 \"la banqueroute et la faillite\" devra d'une certaine fa\u00e7on empi\u00e9ter sur certains \" droits civils dans la province \" et, en particulier, devra pourvoir a un mode de proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9cial\nfor the vesting, realizing and distribution of the estate and the settlement of the liabilities of the insolvent.\nCushing v. Dupuy[15]. Toute la proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de banqueroute tombe n\u00e9cessairement dans le domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et l'on ne saurait concevoir une loi de faillite qui ne substituerait pas sa proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale aux proc\u00e9dures provinciale C\u2019est pourquoi il est logique que, d\u00e8s l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre ou la cession de biens, les proc\u00e9dures en marche soient imm\u00e9diatement suspendues. L\u2019\u00e9tat de faillite cr\u00e9e une situation nouvelle. D\u00e8s que cette situation est officielle ou judiciairement reconnue, tout doit \u00eatre arr\u00eat\u00e9e et rester dans le statu quo. Les droits qui ne sont pas encore acquis sont perdus, parce que les n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s de la faillite emp\u00eachent de continuer la proc\u00e9dure requise pour les acqu\u00e9rir. Ainsi les saisies-arr\u00eats et les ex\u00e9cutions qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u201ccompl\u00e8tement satisfaites par paiement\u201d (art. 11, par. 10) sont assujetties et subordonn\u00e9es \u00e0 la faillite; il n\u2019est plus permis de les continuer.\nEn plus, il est des privil\u00e8ges et des droits qui naissent de l\u2019\u00e9tat de faillite; comme, par exemple, de la suspension du louage de services ou de l\u2019interruption de bail d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La faillite entra\u00eene une modification des droits respectifs du locateur et du locataire; et l\u2019on con\u00e7oit qu\u2019il convienne que le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en adoptant une l\u00e9gislation concernant la faillite, r\u00e8gle, en m\u00eame temps, entre le locateur et le locataire, les nouvelles relations qui sont le r\u00e9sultat de la faillite elle-m\u00eame.\nL\u2019on comprend \u00e9galement que le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral inclue dans sa l\u00e9gislation les dispositions voulues pour \u00e9carter et mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les transactions qui ont eu lieu dans un certain d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la d\u00e9claration judiciaire de faillite. Cela para\u00eet raisonnable, vu la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 qui existait durant cette p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la banqueroute, et cela fait donc logiquement partie de toute l\u00e9gislation relative \u00e0 cette banqueroute.\nMais il n\u2019en est pas ainsi des droits et des privil\u00e8ges compl\u00e8tement acquis en vertu des lois provinciales, ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la faillite et \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle il n\u2019existe aucune pr\u00e9somption d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons, et en tout respect, je trouve, comme les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, que la destruction de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que judiciaire ne fait pas partie du pouvoir direct de l\u00e9gislation sur la banqueroute et la faillite, ni du pouvoir accessoire ou auxiliaire.\nL\u2019historique des Actes d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 ou de faillite qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la loi de 1919 (actuellement en vigueur) ne va pas \u00e0 rencontre des propositions que je viens de soumettre. Les actes de 1869 et de 1875 pourvoyaient \u00e0 l\u2019invalidation des transactions frauduleuses, emp\u00eachaient un jugement de cr\u00e9er une charge ou un lien sur les biens de l\u2019insolvable, par suite de la remise d\u2019un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution au sh\u00e9rif ou par suite d\u2019une saisie-ex\u00e9cution effectu\u00e9e, et enlevaient toute efficacit\u00e9 \u00e0 tout ce qui avait besoin d\u2019\u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la cession de biens ou la liquidation forc\u00e9e. C\u2019est l\u00e0, comme j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de le faire remarquer plus haut, l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur des questions qui sont du ressort propre de la banqueroute ou de la faillite; r\u00e9gler des transactions faites au moment o\u00f9 i\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e exister ou refuser de permettre \u00e0 des cr\u00e9anciers de parfaire des droits par la continuation de leurs proc\u00e9dures apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une faillite a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e. Il y a loin entre emp\u00eacher d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des droits apr\u00e8s que la banqueroute est prononc\u00e9e et d\u00e9truire des droits acquis longtemps auparavant, comme on voudrait le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nL\u2019Acte de 1882 et l\u2019Acte des liquidations (Winding-Up Act) c. 129 des statuts revis\u00e9s de 1886 ne sont pas all\u00e9s au del\u00e0.\nLes syndics ont fait grand \u00e9tat de l\u2019article 66 de cette loi qui est devenu l\u2019article 84 du chapitre 144 des statuts revis\u00e9s de 1906 et qui se lit comme suit:\n84. Aucune charge ou privil\u00e8ge n\u2019est cr\u00e9e ni sur les biens meubles ni sur les immeubles de la compagnie, pour le montant d\u2019un jugement, ou pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats de ce montant, par l\u2019\u00e9mission ou la d\u00e9livrance au sh\u00e9rif d\u2019un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, ni par la saisie ou vente en vertu de ce bref des biens ou effets de la compagnie.\n2. Aucun droit ni privil\u00e8ge n\u2019est non plus cr\u00e9\u00e9 sur ses biens, meubles ou immeubles, ni sur aucune de ses dettes actives, \u00e9chue ou devenue exigible, par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t ou l\u2019enregistrement d\u2019un sommaire ou d\u2019une minute de jugement, ni par la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref d\u2019arr\u00eat simple ou d\u2019arr\u00eat en mains tierces, ou autre ordre, si, dans ces cas, la liquidation de la compagnie s\u2019ouvre avant la remise au demandeur des deniers recouvr\u00e9s, pay\u00e9s ou per\u00e7us en vertu du dit bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, sommaire, minute, bref d\u2019arr\u00eat simple au d\u2019arr\u00eat en mains tierces, ou autre ordre; mais le pr\u00e9sent article ne touche point au droit ou privil\u00e8ge que le demandeur a pour ses frais d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi de la province o\u00f9 le bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, le bref d\u2019arr\u00eat simple ou d\u2019arr\u00eat en mains tierces ou autre ordre a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\nJe ne puis y voir quoi que ce soit qui ressemble \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019on \u00e9met maintenant en vertu du paragraphe\n10 de l\u2019article 11 de la Loi de faillite.

Act, 1867, ss. 93 (1), 93 (2)\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. (1906), c. 139, s. 42a.\nThe Quebec Legislature in 1903 (3 Edw. VII, c. 16) passed \u201can Act to amend the law concerning education, with respect to persons professing the Jewish religion.\u201d Section 1 provides that \u201cin all the municipalities of the province, * * * persons professing the Jewish religion shall, for school purposes, be treated in the same manner as Protestants, and for the said purposes shall be subject to the same obligations and shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as the latter.\u201d Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 deal with school revenues and taxation and, speaking generally, provide that such taxation payable by persons professing the Jewish religion and revenue for school purposes derived from them, or from their properties, shall go to the support of the Protestant schools, where they exist. Section 6, so far as is material, reads as follows: \u201c* * * children of persons professing the Jewish faith shall have the same right to be educated in the public schools of the province as Protestant children, and shall be treated in the same manner as Protestants for all school purposes.\u201d\nHeld that, inasmuch as c. 19 of 1925 (Q), providing for the right of appeal presently exercised, is within the literal terms of s. 42a of the supreme Court Act, jurisdiction to entertain this appeal should not be declined; but semble that, Parliament in enacting s. 42a did not contemplate enabling a provincial legislature to single out a particular reference and to make the opinion already pronounced upon it by the provincial court appealable to this court.\nHeld, also, that provincial legislation repugnant to subs. 2 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act, equally with legislation in conflict with subs. 1, is \u201cabsolutely void and inoperative\u201d and is not appealable under subs. 3 to the Governor in Council;\nHeld, further, that in the Public Education Act of 1861 the term \u201cProtestants\u201d is not synonymous with non-Catholics in that it excludes non-Christians; and of Christians it includes only such as accept what are generally regarded as the principles and doctrines of the Reformation of the sixteenth century;\nHeld, also, that, at Confederation, the entire population of the province of Quebec was, for purposes of legislation upon educational matters, divided into two great religious denominations\u2014the one Roman Catholic and the other Protestant\u2014and non-Catholics and non-Protestants were ignored; that all the schools of the cities of Montreal and Quebec, although denominational (Roman Catholic and Protestant respectively), were \u201ccommon schools,\u201d any one of which every child in each of those cities was entitled to attend; that \u201cdissentient schools\u201d of a religious minority existed only in \u201crural\u201d municipalities and that the privilege of excluding therefrom adherents of another religious faith (then enjoyed by the Roman Catholic minority in Ontario in regard to their separate schools), was extended by s. 93 (2) of the B.N.A. Act to such \u201cdissentient schools\u201d in Quebec. In \u201crural\u201d municipalities Jewish children could attend as of right only the common denominational schools of the religious majority.\nHeld, also, that although, ex facie, s. 1 of the Act of 1903 (c. 16) standing alone would confer upon adherents of the Jewish religion all rights regarding educational matters possessed by Protestants, including the establishment of separate schools controlled by Jewish commissioners or trustees, its intent, when taken with the context, is that whatever rights its confers should be enjoyed in connection with the Protestant schools; and that, while legislation infringing the right of Protestants to exclusive control of their schools would be ultra vires the Act of 1903 (c. 16) merely declares the right of Jewish children to education as Protestants, making consequent equitable provisions as to taxation and revenue;\nHeld, further, that, except in so far as it would confer the right of attendance at dissentient schools upon persons of a religious faith different from that of the dissentient minority, the Act of 1903 is ultra vires;\nHeld, further, that, legislation providing for the appointment of Jews to the Protestant Committee of Public Instruction would be competent and that legislation providing for the establishment of separate schools for persons who are neither Roman Catholics nor Protestants, if so framed as not to affect prejudicially any right or privilege with regard to education enjoyed by either Roman Catholics or Protestants at Confederation, might be validly enacted.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, to which were referred, for hearing and consideration, a series of questions relating to the educational system in the island of Montreal. The Quebec legislature, in 1903 (3 Edw. VII, c. 16) passed an \u201cAct to amend the law concerning education with respect to persons professing the Jewish religion.\u201d The immediate occasion for that legislation, as indicated in its recital, was the refusal of the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal to recognize the right claimed by persons professing the Jewish religion to have their children received and educated at the schools under the control of the School Corporations established by law, to which Jewish parents had theretofore sent their children almost exclusively. The recitals continued\u2014and the validity of such pretension (of the Protestant School Board) has been judicially established. By order in council of the 3rd of February, 1925, a series of questions relating to the educational system in the Island of Montreal were referred to the Court of King\u2019s Bench for hearing and consideration. The conclusions of the various questions submitted at which the Court of King\u2019s Bench arrived are summarized as follows:\nQuestion 1: Is the statute of Quebec of 1903, 3 Edw. VII, c. 16, ultra vires?\nAnswer (unanimous): Yes.\nQuestion 2: Under the said statute: (a) Can persons of Jewish religion be appointed to the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal? (b) Is the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of Montreal obliged to appoint Jewish teachers in their schools should they be attended by children professing the Jewish religion?\nAnswer (unanimous): (a) Yes. (b) No.\nQuestion 3: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation providing that persons professing the Jewish religion be appointed: (a) To the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal; or (b) To the Protestant Committee of Public Instruction; or (c) As advisory members of these bodies?\nAnswer (unanimous): (a) No; (b) No; (c) No.\nQuestion 4: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation obliging the Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal to appoint teachers professing the Jewish religion in their schools should they be attended by children professing that religion?\nAnswer (unanimous): No.\nQuestion 5: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation providing for the appointment of persons professing the Jewish religion on the proposed Metropolitan Financial Commission, outlined in the project submitted by Messrs. Hirsch and Cohen?\nAnswer (unanimous): No.\nQuestion 6: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation to establish separate schools for persons who are neither Catholic nor Protestants?\nAnswer (Judges Greenshields, Rivard and Letourneau): No. (Judges Flynn and Tellier): Yes.\nQuestion 7: Assuming the Act of 1903 to be unconstitutional, have the Protestants the right, under the present state of the Quebec law, to allow children professing the Jewish religion to attend the schools: (a) As a matter of grace? (b) As of right? (c) Can the province force the Protestants to accept children professing the Jewish religion under such conditions?\nAnswer: (a) (unanimous) Yes. (b) Judges Greenshields, Rivard and Letourneau: Yes (save the distinctions and reserves indicated in the notes of Judges Rivard and Letourneau). Judges Flynn and Tellier: No. (c) Judges Flynn, Tellier & Rivard: No. Judges Greenshields & Letourneau: Yes.\nThe Quebec statute, c. 19 of 1925, declared that the opinion or view of the Court of King\u2019s Bench shall be deemed to be a final judgment delivered by the highest court of final resort of the province of Quebec, and that an appeal shall lie therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada in conformity with section 42a of the Supreme Court Act. The validity of the impugned statute was challenged before this court on the main ground that its provisions either prejudicially affect some right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which (some) class of persons (had) by law in the province at the Union (B.N.A. Act, s. 93 (1)), or derogate from \u201cpowers, privileges and duties\u201d then by law conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the separate schools and school trustees of the Queen\u2019s Roman Catholic subjects, which are, by provision 2 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act, extended to the dissentient schools of the Queen\u2019s Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec.\nNesbitt K.C. and St. Laurent K.C. for the appellants.\nLaurendeau K.C., Campbell K.C. and Creelman K.C. for the Protestant Board of School Commissioners.\nA. Perrault K.C. for the Catholic Board of School Commissioners.\nL. Fitch K.C. for the respondent Schubert.\nLanctot K.C. and Geoffrion K.C. for the Attorney General of Quebec.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014By order in council of the 3rd of February, 1925, the Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Quebec, under art. 579 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1909, referred to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side), for hearing and consideration, a series of\nquestions relating to the educational system in the Island of Montreal.\nThe Quebec statute, c. 19 of 1925, assented to on the 3rd of April, declares that the opinion or view of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side), expressed upon these questions on the 11th of March, 1925,\nshall be deemed to be a final judgment delivered by the highest court of final resort of the province of Quebec,\nand that\nan appeal shall lie therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada in conformity with section 42a of the Supreme Court Act.\nSection 42a of the Supreme Court Act, enacted in 1922, (1213 Geo. V, c. 48), reads as follows:\n42a. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from an opinion pronounced by the highest court of final resort in any province on any matter referred to it for hearing and consideration by the Lieutenant-Governor of such province whenever it has been by the statutes of the said province declared that such opinion is to be deemed a judgment of the said highest court of final resort, and that an appeal shall lie therefrom as from a judgment in an action.\nThis provision seems to contemplate the enactment of provincial legislation applicable generally to references made to the highest court of final resort in the province by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Such statutes have been enacted by six of the other provinces. Cameron, Supreme Court Practice, 3rd edition, p. 179. It would seem improbable that Parliament contemplated enabling a provincial legislature to single out a particular reference and to make the opinion pronounced upon it by the provincial court appealable to this court\u2014still less that a specific judgment already rendered and not appealable when given should, as in this instance, become the subject of such legislation. The Quebec statute of 1925, would, however, appear -to be within the letter of s. 42a and it does not seem sufficiently clear that it lies without its intendment to warrant our declining jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal.\nThe reference now before us chiefly concerns the validity and interpretation of the Quebec statute of 1903, c. 16, entituled \u201cAn Act to amend the law concerning education with respect to persons professing the Jewish religion.\u201d The present appeal is brought from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench by two of the Jewish members of a special commission of education appointed by the Provincial Government, who had been represented before that court. The respondents are the Protestant and Catholic Boards of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal, the third Jewish member of the special commission, and the Attorney General of Quebec, all of whom had likewise taken part in the hearing of the reference.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously held the statute of 1903, c. 16, to be ultra vires. But differences of opinion developed in the individual views of the several members of the court upon some of the other questions propounded by the order in council.\nThe validity of the impugned statute is challenged on the ground that its provisions either\nprejudicially affect some right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which (some) class of persons (had) by law in the province at the Union (B.N.A. Act, s. 93 (1)), or derogate from \u201cpowers, privileges and duties\u201d then\nby law conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the separate schools and school trustees of the Queen\u2019s Roman Catholic subjects,\nwhich are, by provision 2 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act,\nextended to the dissentient schools of the Queen\u2019s Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec.\nLegislation of the Quebec legislature repugnant to either of these provisions of the B.N.A. Act is\nto the extent of such repugnancy .* * * absolutely void and inoperative. (Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, (Imp.), c. 63, s. 2.)\nThe remedy of persons aggrieved by such legislation is to \u201cinvoke the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of the country.\u201d The right of appeal to the Governor General in Council given by provision 3 of s. 93 of the British North America Act does not apply to such a case. Brophy v. Attorney General of Manitoba[1]. In this decision of the ultimate appellate tribunal it is also pointed out (pp. 222-3) that the \u201cabsolute\u201d power of provincial legislatures in relation to subjects specified in s. 92 of the British North America Act, and not falling within those set forth in s. 91, does not extend to the matter of education\nwhich is specially dealt with and has its own code \u2026 in the British North America Act (s. 93),\nthe \u201cprovisions\u201d whereof\ndefine the conditions under which alone the provincial legislature may legislate in relation to education, and indicate the limitations imposed on, and the exceptions from, their power of exclusive legislation. It would require an Act of the Imperial Legislature prejudicially to affect any right or privilege reserved under provision 1 (s. 93). Ottawa Separate Schools Trustees v. Mackell (2);\nand this is equally true of any\npowers, privileges and duties * * * extended to the dissentient schools * * * in Quebec\nby provision 2. Provincial legislation affecting them is incompetent.\nIt is authoritatively established that\nthe class of persons to whom the right or privilege is reserved (under provision 1 of s.- 93) must * * * be a class of persons determined according to religious belief and not according to race or language. In relation to denominational teaching Roman Catholics (in Ontario) together form, within the meaning of the section, a class of persons, and that class cannot be subdivided into other classes by considerations of the language of the people by whom that faith is held. Ottawa Separate School Trustees v. Mackell[2]. It is contended that, for the purpose of s. 93 (1), Roman Catholics in Quebec form such a class, and that Protestants in that province, as a whole\u2014and taken together, form another like class not susceptible of subdivision according to their diversities of religious belief. That the latter are so regarded for the purposes of s. 93 (2) would seem to be clear. Section 93 (1), however, deals only with rights and privileges in regard to denominational schools which a class of persons, determined according to religious belief, had by law at Confederation. On this aspect of the case, therefore, we are presently concerned to ascertain what were the classes of persons who had by law in the province of Quebec at Confederation rights and privileges with respect to denominational schools, and in what such rights and privileges consisted; and, in addition, we must take account of any enlargement of, or accession to, such rights and privileges effected by provision 2 of s. 93. The pertinent inquiry will then be whether, and to what extent, the legislation of 1903 would, if valid, prejudicially affect any such right or privilege.\nIt was common ground at bar that the rights and privileges in regard to denominational schools enjoyed at Confederation by any class of persons in Quebec are to be found in the legislation consolidated in caps. 15 and 16 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada:, 1861. The powers, privileges and duties of the Roman Catholic Separate schools and separate school trustees in Upper Canada at the Union were those conferred by the Separate Schools Act of 1863 (26 Vic., c. 5). These statutes must now be considered.\nChapter 16 of the Lower Canada Consolidated Statutes deals with Fabrique schools and is in no wise affected by the legislation of 1903.\nChapter 15, which deals with \u201cEducation\u2014and Normal and Common Schools,\u201d requires careful study and analysis. Its most striking features affecting the matter presently before us appear to be the following:\nA. It gave to every child between the ages of five and sixteen years resident in any school district an equal right to attend the school thereof (s. 66); and, in each of the cities of Montreal and Quebec, such children from any part of the city might attend any school established by, or under the control of, the Commissioners (s. 129). The statute, therefore, conferred on every child resident in any school district in the province the right to education in some public school, established under its provisions in such district. It is perhaps unnecessary to observe that this was not a right enjoyed by a class of persons with respect to denominational schools; it pertained to the individual as \u00e0 citizen. Accordingly it did not fall within the protection of s. 93 (1). But the correlative obligation of Boards of School Commissioners and Trustees may have been limitative of some right or privilege claimed for Quebec denominational schools.\nB. Chapter 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of 1861 made distinct provisions, quite different in their scope and character, for the cities of Montreal and Quebec, on the one hand, and for the other municipalities in the province (which we shall, for convenience, call \u201crural municipalities\u201d), on the other (a). The present reference has to\n(a) The city of Three Rivers is expressly excluded from the rural municipalities (s. 28). It appears to have had special provisions for the organization, control and management of its schools. Vide 9 Vic, c. 27, s. 2, and c. 78; 23 Vic, (1860 c. 74; 1 Edw. VII, (1901), c. 44, s. 222 et seq.\ndo with the educational system of the Island of Montreal, which comprises, in addition to the city of Montreal, municipalities falling within the category which we designate rural. Both divisions; of the statute must, therefore, be considered. The signal difference presently material is that the provisions for \u201cdissentient schools\u201d (which were likewise \u201ccommon schools\u201d for many purposes of the statute (s. 138) but were in other respects clearly distinguished from them) applied only to the rural municipalities. These schools were governed by Board of \u201cTrustees.\u201d All the schools of the cities of Montreal and Quebec were \u201ccommon schools\u201d under Boards of \u201cCommissioners,\u201d each of these cities being considered one municipality not divided into school districts (s. 129). It being thus \u201cotherwise provided,\u201d the provisions with regard to dissentient schools did not apply to them (s. 128). Under the Act of 1861. there were, no \u201cdissentient schools\u201d either in Montreal or in Quebec, although, no doubt, the schools in these cities wera \u201cdenominational schools.\u201d This situation has continued down to the present day and with it we must deal.\nC. A third noteworthy feature of the Act of 1861 is that it appears to divide the population for school purposes into two great classes, the one Roman Catholic, the other Protestant. In this view all the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench agree. As used in this statute and throughout the educational laws of the province of Quebec, the meaning of the term \u201cRoman Catholics\u201d admits of no doubt; nor does the connotation of the term \u201cProtestants\u201d present any difficulty. It is not synonymous with non-Catholic, in that it excludes all persons who do not profess to be Christians; and of these it includes only such as accept what are generally regarded as the principles and doctrines of the Reformation of the 16th century. For present purposes, either of the following definitions of \u201cProtestant\u201d may be accepted:\nA member or adherent of any of the Christian churches or bodies which repudiated the papal authority, and separated, or were severed from the Roman communion in the Reformation of the 16th century, and, generally, of any of the bodies of Christians descended from them; hence, in general language, applied to any Western Christian or member of a Christian Church without the Roman communion. (Murray\u2019s New English Dictionary.) A member or an adherent of those Christian bodies which are descended from the Reformation of the 16th century; in general language opposed to Roman Catholic and Greek. (Century Dictionary).\nIn the fasciculus of sections of the Act of 1861 specially affecting the cities of Montreal and Quebec (ss. 128-134) the classification is unmistakable. The twelve school commissioners for each of these cities, appointed by the respective municipal councils, formed two separate and distinct corporations, one for the Roman Catholics and the other for the Protestants (s. 130), each having exclusive control and management of the schools of the denomination it represented and of the funds apportioned for their support (s. 131).\nIn the general provisions of the Act affecting rural municipalities the denominational division between Roman Catholics and Protestants is perhaps not quite so obvious; but the indications of it appear to be sufficient. Two classes of schools were provided for: one, common schools for the majority in the district, carried on by Commissioners; the other, dissentient schools for a minority professing a religious faith different from that of the majority, carried on by trustees (ss. 27, 55). Dissentients with a religious faith common at least in some distinctive characteristics were contemplated. Thus children from other districts might attend one of these schools only if\nof the same faith as the dissentients for whom the school was established (s. 56 (2)).\nThe cur\u00e9, priest or officiating minister had\nthe exclusive right of selecting the books having reference to religion and morals for the use of the schools for children of his own religious faith (s. 65 (2)).\nBoards of Examiners in Montreal and Quebec were (s. 103 (2)), and in other districts might be, if the Governor in Council so ordered (s. 108), organized in two divisions, Roman Catholic and Protestant respectively. No priest, minister or ecclesiastic might visit any school belonging to inhabitants not of his own persuasion, except with the consent of the Commissioners or Trustees of such school (s. 131). While the terms \u201creligious majority\u201d and \u201creligious minority,\u201d were not defined until 1869 (32 Vic, c. 16, s. 37) to mean\nthe Roman Catholic or Protestant majority or minority as the case may be,\nand this definition, although declaratory in form, must therefore, for present purposes be disregarded, the various provisions of the Act of 1861 alluded to seem to be inconsistent with any other classification of the inhabitants of Lower Canada for educational purposes having been intended by the legislation embodied in that statute. Indeed such a division had persisted in the several earlier school Acts of 1841 (4-5 Vic, c. 18), 1845 (8 Vic, c. 16), 1846 (9 Vic, c. 27), 1849 (12 Vic, c. 50), 1853 (16 Vic, c. 1208), 1856 (19 Vic, c. 14), and 1859 (22 Vic, c. 52). As. Mr, Justice Davidson said in Pinster v. Protestant Board of School Commissioners[3],\nthese cleavages on religious lines in regard to the schools in the country parts and their management have so existed since 1841 * * * It is certain that the division between the two classes of schools is not one of mere administration; the cleavage is religious and denominational as well.\nEverybody in the least familiar with the history of education in the province of Quebec knows that in 1867 in \u201crural municipalities\u201d the \u201ccommon schools\u201d were in fact the schools of the majority, and the \u201cdissentient schools\u201d in fact the schools of the minority, Catholic or Protestant as the case might be. It cannot be seriously disputed that prior to 1867 the non-Catholic non-Protestant elements of the population of Lower Canada were numerically negligible and were so treated in legislation respecting educational matters. The dissentient schools were almost universally Protestant. But common schools and dissentient schools were alike frankly denominational and Christian. This was their character recognized and provided for by law; and the present case is thus clearly distinguished from Maker v. Portland, Wheeler\u2019s Confederation Law of Canada, at p. 367[4]. The dissentient school came into existence only because the religious minority of a school municipality found the regulations and arrangements for the conduct of the common school of the religious majority not agreeable to it. The law so provided (s. 55 (1)).\nThe Trustees of the dissentient schools, when established, had the same rights, powers and duties of management and control over them as the Commissioners had in regard to common schools (s. 55 (2)): the appointment of teachers, the regulation of courses of study, the erection, maintenance and repair of school houses, the control of school property, the making of general rules for the management of the schools, the fixing of public examinations\u2014all these matters, with their incidents\u2014were in their hands (s. 65); and, what is perhaps most important, the moneys for the support of the schools derived from taxes, fees and Government grants were exclusively at their disposal.\nAlthough under the Act of 1861 neither the Commissioners of common schools nor the Trustees of dissentient schools would appear to have had the right to exclude any child from the schools under their control on religious grounds (s. 66), in the case of dissentient schools of the religious minority the right of excluding non-Protestants or non-Catholics, as the case might be, would seem to have been conferred by provision 2 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act of 1867. An analysis of the Separate Schools Act of Upper Canada of 1853, c. 5, makes it reasonably clear that in that province only Roman Catholics had the right of privilege of sending their children to Catholic Separate Schools, although non-Catholic children might be admitted to them as a matter of grace (s. 12). The separate school could be established only by Roman Catholics (ss. 2-3) and \u201cfor Roman Catholics\u201d (s. 2): only Roman Catholics could become separate school supporters (s. 14) or withdraw their support (s. 18): only Roman Catholics who were separate school supporters were exempted from the payment of public school taxes (s. 14): only Roman Catholic pupils might be taken account of in the apportionment of the legislative grant for common schools (ss. 12, 20, 22). As a privilege\nat the Union by law conferred in Upper Canada on the separate schools and school trustees of the Queen\u2019s Roman Catholic subjects,\nthe power of excluding the adherents of other religious faiths was by s. 93 (2) extended to the \u201cdissentient schools,\u201d but not to the \u201ccommon schools\u201d of the province of Quebec. The latter remained subject to the provisions of ss. 66 and 129 of the Act of 1861.\nAs already pointed out, in 1867, only common schools were provided for in the cities of Montreal and Quebec; dissentient schools were confined to the rural municipalities. It cannot be supposed that this state of the law was not present either to the minds of the Canadian public men who negotiated and settled the terms of Confederation, or to the mind of the Imperial Parliament when it enacted the British North America Act. It follows that in the city of Montreal every child between the ages of five and sixteen years resident within the municipality retained after 1867 the right conferred by the Act of 1861 to attend any school under the control of the Commissioners, whether Catholic or Protestant; and the correlative obligation to receive and provide for them incumbent upon both bodies of Commissioners likewise remained unimpaired.\nIn this connection it is important to bear in mind that since 1867 much territory, constituting or comprised in several suburban municipalities, has been annexed to the city of Montreal and now forms part of it for municipal purposes. There was no discussion at bar as to the effect of such annexation on school rights in the annexed territory. In regard to the dissentient school rights a question may arise as to the effect on them of such annexation. But this aspect of the case was not adverted to in argument and we express no opinion upon it. It must therefore be understood that, in the several answers to questions submitted in the present reference, when we speak of the city of Montreal we mean that city as it was as the date of Confederation, and by rural municipalities we mean municipalities which are still without the city limits. Only as to these are definite answers given. As to territory now included in the municipality of the city of Montreal by virtue of annexations made since 1867, the application of the answers to questions no. 1 and (b) and (c) of no. 7 would appear to depend upon how far dissentient schools rights in such territory may persist notwithstanding its incorporation in the city for municipal purposes.\nThe only further observation upon the Act of 1861 which it seems important to make is that it provided for a Council of Public Instruction to consist of not more than fifteen and not less than eleven members to be appointed by the Governor (s. 18). Nothing is said as to religious qualifications of the appointees. It was not until 1869 (c. 16, s. 1) that the personnel of the Council was fixed at\ntwenty-one persons, fourteen of whom shall be Roman Catholics and seven Protestants.\nMoreover, by subs. 4 of s. 21 of the Act of 1861 it was provided that the power of selecting books to be used in the schools of the province, conferred on the Council of Public Instruction, should not extend to books having reference to religion and morals, the selection of such books for each school being given to \u201cthe cur\u00e9, priest or officiating minister (s. 65 (2).\u201d It is, however, contended that the spirit of the Act of 1861 required that membership of the Council of Public Instruction should be confined to Roman Catholics and Protestants. That view prevailed in the Court of King\u2019s Bench. We are, with respect, not prepared to attribute such an unexpressed intention to the legislature. The safeguarding provision as to the selection of books, having reference to religion and morals would seem rather to be indicative of the absence of such an intent. Moreover, the proportion of members of each faith was not fixed, and, for aught that was provided to the contrary, the Council might be wholly Catholic or wholly Protestant The Christian community (Roman Catholic and Protestant) as a whole was nowhere treated as a \u201cclass of persons\u201d which had, within the purview of s. 93 (1), any right or privilege with respect of denominational schools. The Act of 1861 did not recognize or provide for such a right or privilege in regard to the personnel of the Council of Public Instruction.\nWe may now consider the provisions of the statute of 1903 (c. 16). The immediate occasion for that legislation, as indicated in its recital, was the refusal of the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal to recognize the right claimed by persons professing the Jewish religion\nto have their children received and educated at the schools under the control of the School Corporations established by law,\nor\nto acknowledge any obligation to receive in the schools under their control children of the Jewish faith whose parents are not proprietors of immovable property subject to taxation for the benefit of the said schools,\nto which Jewish parents had theretofore sent their children almost exclusively. The recital continued\u2014\nand the validity of such pretension (of the Protestant School Board) has been judicially established.\nIt was further recited that\nthe Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal have by resolution expressed their consent that the above mentioned difference be settled in the manner set forth in the following provisions,\nand, finally, that\nit was expedient to prevent similar differences arising in other localities in the province.\nThe enacting sections of the statute open with a provision (s. 1) framed in very general terms, as to the construction and scope of which there was not a little discussion at bar. This is followed by five sections (ss. 2-6) which deal with particular matters which are the specialia of the statute. It will be most convenient first to consider the latter sections.\nSection 6, so far as is material, reads as follows:\nAfter the coming into force of this Act, children of persons professing the Jewish faith shall have the same right to be educated in the public schools of the province as Protestant children, and shall be treated in the same manner as Protestants for all school purposes.\nJewish children in common with all other children in the city of Montreal had, under the Act of 1861, the right to attend any school under the control of the Commissioners. Section 6, in its application to the Protestant common schools of that city, therefore, does not appear to transcend the legislative power conferred on the provincial legislature by s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act: it is not repugnant either to provision 1 or to provision 2. But as to the Protestant dissentient schools in the rural municipalities, s. 6 disregards and derogates from a privilege conferred on them, as already explained, by provision 2 of s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act and is, in its application to those schools, ultra vires.\nSections 2, 3, 4 and 5 deal with school revenues and taxation and, speaking generally, provide that such taxation payable by persons professing the Jewish religion and revenue for school purposes derived from them, or from their properties, shall go to the support of the Protestant schools, where they exist, and that, in arriving at the basis of the division for school purposes of moneys derived from school taxes and of revenue payable in proportion to population, persons professing the Jewish religion shall be counted amongst Protestants.\nWe do not find in these provisions, in so far as they apply to the city of Montreal, anything which necessarily exceeds the legislative power conferred in the provincial legislature by s. 93 of the B.N.A. Act. They are in reality complementary of, or consequent upon, section 6. It is not ex facie apparent, and it has not been shewn by evidence or otherwise, that any right or privilege enjoyed by any class of persons in regard to denominational schools at the Union is prejudicially affected by them. No increased burden is imposed on the Protestant schools and school commissioners; they were already bound in 1867 to receive Jewish pupils, and, as the statute recites, the Jews took full advantage of this privilege. On the contrary, the Protestant schools derive a distinct financial benefit from the provision that persons professing the Jewish faith shall be considered Protestants in regard to the matters dealt with by ss. 2-5. While the Catholic schools lose a portion of their former revenue, the formal declaration of the obligation of the Protestant schools and their Commissioners to provide for the education of Jewish children, having regard to what appears as to the cost of making such provision, may well afford more than adequate compensation. No grievance on the part of the Catholic schools or school Commissioners in the city of Montreal has been suggested in this connection and on the case now before us we cannot say that their rights and privileges in regard to their denominational schools were prejudicially affected by the provisions of these four sections.\nIn the rural municipalities, however, the situation is entirely different. There the common schools of the majority alone were open as of right to Jewish children, at all events after 1867, owing to the privilege of exclusion then conferred on the dissentient schools by s. 93 (2) of the B.N.A. Act. These common schools were all Roman Catholic and distinctly denominational. A right or privilege of the Roman Catholic majorities in the rural municipalities in regard to revenues available for the support of their denominational common schools, which they enjoyed as a class of persons at the Union, would be prejudicially affected by ss. 2-5 of the Act of 1903.\nUpon the foregoing premises the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Ontario et al[5], and s. 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act (Imp., 1865, c. 63) warrant a judgment upholding the validity of ss. 2-6 of the Act of 1903 in so far as they apply to the cities of Montreal and Quebec, although they should be regarded as ultra vires in so far as they affect rural municipalities, to the extent which will be indicated in the answer to question no. 1.\nSection 1 of the statute of 1903 reads as follows:\nAny provision to the contrary notwithstanding, in all the municipalities of the province, whether governed, as regards schools, by the Education Act or by special laws, or by the Education Act and by special laws, persons professing the Jewish religion shall, for school purposes, be treated in the same manner as Protestants, and for the said purposes shall be subject to the same obligations and shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as the latter.\nThis section contains the generalia of the statute. If it stood alone and entirely divorced from its context, its ex facie construction would be that it conferred upon persons professing the Jewish religion in Quebec all the rights regarding educational matters possessed by Protestants, including the right to establish and maintain separate schools\u2014\u201ccommon\u201d in the cities of Montreal and Quebec and \u201cdissentient\u201d in the rural municipalities,\u2014controlled by Jewish Commissioners or Trustees. Not as Protestants, but as Jews, persons professing the Jewish religion, would, upon the natural and literal interpretation of s. 1, have the like educational obligations, rights and privileges as Protestants, including the enactment in their behalf of school laws the same as those relating to Protestants, as nearly as the latter could be adapted to the case.\nBut it requires only a momentary glance at the context to make it clear that this was not the intent of s. 1. It is obvious from the whole Act that whatever rights it was designed to confer on persons professing the Jewish religion were to be enjoyed in connection with the schools under the control of the Protestant school corporations. In order to reconcile the various provisions, including the preamble, an intention must be attributed to s. 1, though ill-expressed, not to provide for the establishment of separate Jewish schools, but that the Jews shall, for the school purposes to which the statute relates, be included and considered as Protestants, or as belonging to the Protestant denomination, and subject to the obligations and entitled to the rights and privileges which appertain to Protestants; or, conversely, that Protestants shall be deemed for such purposes to include persons professing the Jewish religion. These purposes are defined not otherwise than as \u201cschool purposes\u201d except in s. 6 where the expression is \u201call school purposes.\u201d In other words s. 1 serves as a limited definition section.\nThere is, therefore, here a case for the application of Art. 12 of the Civil Code of Quebec which provides that:\n12. When a law is doubtful or ambiguous, it is to be interpreted so as to fulfil the intention of the legislature, and to attain the object for which it is passed. The preamble which forms part of the act, assists in explaining it.\nOne must, of course, have regard to the subject matter with which the legislature was dealing. The occasion for the Act of 1903, as already stated, was the rejection by the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal of the claims of persons professing the Jewish religion to have their children received and educated in the Protestant Separate Schools which they had theretofore attended; the purpose of the statute was to give legal sanction to agreed terms on which the Jewish pupils were to be accepted; but the reconstitution of the governing body of these schools, or the admission of the Jews to a voice in their government or regulation, was not a subject of the agreement as recited, or of the legislation by which it was sanctioned.\nSection 1 of the Act of 1903 is, no doubt, expressed in the most general terms. It was admitted on all sides at the hearing that the statute was intended to establish the right of Jewish children to be admitted to the Protestant schools, but it was argued that s. 1 went so far as also to sanction the eligibility of persons professing the Jewish religion for appointment to the Boards of Protestant School Commissioners, and therefore to declare that Jews should be considered as Protestants for the purposes of s. 130 of the Consolidated Act of 1861; the argument is founded upon the words:\npersons professing the Jewish religion shall for school purposes be treated in the same manner as Protestants, and, for the said purposes, shall be subject to the same obligations and shall enjoy the same rights and privileges as the latter.\nBut, assuming that these words by themselves might be interpreted to authorize the admission of Jews to representation upon the Protestant School Board, that interpretation must, we think, be rejected, when, applying the principles enunciated by Lord Blackburn in River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[6], the statute is considered as a whole. The provisions of the Act following upon s. 1, and already adverted to, are special or particular enactments, providing for and defining obligations, rights and privileges which seem to be generally comprehended under s. 1. Now by the tenth rule of Bacon\u2019s Maxims \u201cverba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae\u201d; and he says\nall words, whether they be in deeds or statutes or, otherwise, if they be general, and not express or precise, shall be restrained unto the fitness of the matter or person.\nIn Earl of Kintore v. Lord Inverury[7], Lord West-bury said that: If to general words special words are added, the rule specialia derogant generalibus has been applied, and the general words have been limited to the things denoted by the special words of addition; and if, on the other hand, words of general comprehension are added to special words; denoting particular things, the general words are confined in their extent and reduced to signify things ejusdem generis with those which are properly denoted by the special expressions.\nIn Gunnestad v. Price[8], Cleasby, B., said that\nif the language is general, and so general that it appears inapplicable without some limitation, then we are entitled to see by the immediate context, or the subsequent matter to which they (the words) are intended to apply, what, if any, limitation ought to be put upon them.\nHe adds that \u201cthe maxim that general words are limited in their application is constantly acted upon.\u201d And he repeats the words of Bacon quoted above\nLord Halsbury in Cox v. Hakes[9], emphasized the difficulty of supposing that the legislature intended to abrogate or alter long established rights \u201cby mere general words without any specific provision\u201d as to them. He added that\nit is impossible to contend that the mere fact of a general word being used in a statute precludes all inquiry into the object of the statute or the mischief which it was intended to remedy.\nAnd he cited the great case of Stradling v. Morgan[10], in which, at p. 205a, occurs this passage:\nThe sages of the law heretofore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in some appearance; and those statutes which comprehend all things in the letter they have expounded to extend but to some things; and those which generally prohibit all people from doing such an act they have interpreted to permit some people to do it, and those which include every person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some persons only; which expositions have always been founded on the intent of the legislature, which they have collected, sometimes by considering the cause and necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another, and sometimes by foreign circumstances. So that they have ever been guided by the intent of the legislature, which they have always taken according to the necessity of the matter and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\nSee, too, Heydon\u2019s Case[11]. Both these great authorities were quoted recently by Lord Atkinson in Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[12].\nThe rule is thus well established, and this seems to be a case where nothing is lacking to justify its application; and when the preamble of the statute is considered, it becomes reasonably certain that the school purposes referred to in the general provision of s. 1 were not intended to include purposes other than those which are the subject of, or ancillary to, the particular sections which follow.\nIn Bradlaugh v. Clark[13], Lord Blackburn said\nAll statutes are to be construed by the courts so as to give effect to the intention which is expressed by the words used in the statute. But that is not to be discovered by considering those words in the abstract, but by inquiring what is the intention expressed by those words used in a statute with reference to the subject matter and for the object with which that statute was made; it being a question to be determined by the court and a very important one, what was the object for which it appears the statute was made.\nHe cited the passage in Stradling v. Morgan[14] to which Lord Halsbury referred in Cox v. Hakes[15] and he said he thought that in modern times more weight had been given to the natural meaning of words than was done in time of Elizabeth; but, he added, at p. 373,\nThe Civil Code of Canada, article 12, well expressed what I think is the principle, and also the qualification which I think must now be put on the older authorities. \u201cWhen a law is doubtful or ambiguous it is to be interpreted so as to fulfil the intention of the legislature, and to attain the object for which it was passed. The preamble, which forms part of the Act, assists in explaining it.\u201d\nThe last observation has additional force in this case which is concerned with the interpretation of a Quebec statute, and, therefore, governed directly by the rule which Lord Blackburn adopts.\nIn Minet v. Leman[16], Romilly M.R., stated as a principle of construction which he said could not, as a general proposition, be disputed, that:\nThe general words of an Act are not to be construed so as to alter the previous policy of the law unless no sense or meaning can be applied to those words consistently with the intention of preserving the existing policy untouched.\nThis may be rather a broad expression, but it serves to show at least that an intention to change the law must be clearly expressed or necessarily implied. Maxwell, in his work on The Interpretation of Statutes (6th ed.), at p. 149, cites it as authority for the proposition that\ngeneral words and phrases, however wide and comprehensive in their literal sense, must usually be construed as being restricted to the actual objects of the Act and as not altering the law beyond. It is true, as Lord Davey suggested in Powell v. Kempton Park Racecourse Co.[17], that one must not lose sight of the possibility that the legislature took the recited facts only as the occasion of the enactment and deliberately used large words to prevent the same kind of mischief in other forms; but, in the drafting of this statute, we see no satisfactory evidence of an intention to disturb the constitution of the controlling authority of the Protestant schools. Indeed it is apparent that the main purpose, if not the only purpose which at the time was considered of present consequence, was the admission of the Jewish children to the Protestant separate schools as they existed at Montreal, and, when we find that all the provisions in detail necessary for that purpose were specially enacted, it cannot be supposed that the design to transfer a right to participate in the government of the Protestant schools to the Jews, presumably to an extent proportionate to their numerical strength, with all the rights and incidents attendant upon such a change in the constitution of the governing board, would have escaped special mention had anything so important been within the contemplation of the legislature.\nIn Reigate Rural District Council v. Sutton District Water Co.[18], Channell J. said\nIt is always necessary in construing a statute, and in dealing with the words you find in it, to consider the object with which the statute was passed, because it enables one to understand the meaning of the words introduced into the enactment. Where the meaning of the words is absolutely clear beyond any doubt the court has no right to go beyond them, because if they did they would be introducing new legislation. They would be improving upon the legislation which has in fact been passed, under the idea that they could do something better, and this would not be a legitimate thing to do. But when words are capable of one meaning and at the same time of a more extended meaning, whether they are to have the one meaning or the more extended meaning is to be dealt with according to what the court sees to be the object and policy of the Act.\nThe principle of interpretation thus expressed cannot, we think, be doubted, and we see nothing in the object or policy of the Act of 1903 which would justify the court in extending the school purposes referred to in s. 1 to include a declaration of eligibility on the part of those professing the Jewish religion to become members of the Protestant Boards of School Commissioners at Quebec and Montreal.\nThere is another consideration which strengthens this view. It was well known to the legislature at Quebec in 1903 that its exclusive power to legislate for education was limited by the constitutional provisions subject to which it was conferred, and that the legislature was powerless prejudicially to affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons had by law at the Union. Nobody doubted that the Roman Catholic and Protestant separate schools at Quebec and Montreal were denominational schools, or that the Protestants were a class of persons whose rights and privileges were protected; and it could not then, we should think, have been within the region of uncertainty that the right of Protestants to manage and govern their separate schools, as provided by the Consolidated Act of 1861, was perhaps the most important of the rights assured to them, and, therefore, a right from which the legislature could not derogate. In these circumstances the court would, of course, be disposed to interpret legislation at Quebec as intended to operate within the constitutional powers of the legislature, and would seek to apply to any doubtful or ambiguous provision an interpretation according to which it might be upheld compatibly with constitutional limitations. \u201cThere are two modes of reading an instrument,\u201d said Lord Brougham in Langston v. Langston[19],\nwhere the one destroys and the other preserves, it is the rule of the law, and of equity, following the law in this respect (for it is a rule of common sense, which I trust is common to both sides of Westminster Hall), that you should rather lean towards that construction which preserves than towards that which destroys. Ut res magis valeat quam pereat is a rule of common law and common sense.\nAnd In re Florence Land and Public Works[20], James L.J. said\nit is a cardinal rule of construction that all documents are to be construed ut res valeat magis quam pereat.\nMoreover, as is pointed out in Craie\u2019s Statute Laws, 3rd ed, at p. 162, it is the settled policy of the Privy Council not to decide that Colonial Acts are ultra vires if it can avoid that conclusion, but rather to read general words as subject to some limitation. Macleod v. Attorney General for New South Wales[21]; Blackwood v. The Queen[22]. Therefore, upon the application of this principle of construction, there should be no unnecessary extension of the provisions of s. 1 of the Act of 1903 to formulate a legislative project by which persons professing the Jewish religion should be made eligible for appointment to the Boards of Protestant School Commissioners at Quebec and Montreal.\nFrom what has been said it is apparent that we would regard legislation designed to impair the right of Protestants, as a class of persons in the province of Quebec, to the exclusive control, financial and pedagogic, of their schools, as ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nIn our opinion, however, the purview of c. 16 of the Quebec statute of 1903 is confined to a declaration of the right of children of persons professing the Jewish religion to education in the public schools of the province as Protestant children, and to making consequential equitable provisions in regard to taxation and revenue.\nWe may now proceed to deal with the several questions submitted.\nQuestion no. 1: Is the statute of Quebec, 1903, 3 Edw. VII, c. 16 ultra vires?\nAnswer: No, except in so far as it would confer the right of attendance at dissentient schools upon persons of a religious faith different from that of the dissentient minority.\nQuestion no. 2: Under the said statute (a) can persons of Jewish religion be appointed to the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal?\n(b) Is the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal obliged to appoint Jewish teachers in their schools should they be attended by children professing the Jewish religion?\nAnswer to part (a): No.\nto part (b): No.\nQuestion no. 3: Con the provincial legislature pass legislation providing that persons professing the Jewish religion be appointed: (a) To the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal; or (b) To the Protestant Committee of Public Instruction; or (c) As advisory members of these bodies?\nAnswer to part (a): No.\nAnswer to part (b): This Committee is the creature of post-union legislation and, therefore, its personnel is subject to provincial legislative control; but, as it is presently constituted, only Protestants are eligible for appointment to it;\nAnswer to part (c): This question can be answered only when the powers and duties of such advisory members shall have been defined.\nQuestion no. 4: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation obliging the Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal to appoint teachers professing the Jewish religion in their schools should they be attended by children professing that religion.\nThis question is not restricted in its application to the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the City of Montreal, although, probably, that was intended. We answer it as put, however, treating it as applicable to both the Protestant and Roman Catholic Boards of the School Commissioners of the City of Montreal.\nAnswer: No.\nQuestion no. 5: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation providing for the appointment of persons professing the Jewish religion on the proposed Metropolitan Finance Commission, outlined in the project submitted by Messrs. Hirsch and Cohen?\nAnswer: No.\nQuestion no. 6: Can the provincial legislature pass legislation to establish separate schools for persons who are neither Catholics nor Protestants?\nAnswer: Yes. Such legislation would not necessarily interfere prejudicially with rights and privileges enjoyed either by Roman Catholics or Protestants as a class at the Union. Such interference, of course, could not be allowed. Mr. Justice Tellier deals with this aspect of the case succinctly and satisfactorily. There are some rights and privileges of the existing dissentient schools which it might not be competent to the legislature to confer on separate schools so to be established.\nThis question relates solely to legislative power and we so deal with it. Considerations of policy in no wise concern us. This was the only question discussed by counsel representing the Catholic Board of School Commissioners.\nQuestion no. 7: Assuming the Act of 1903 to be unconstitutional, have the Protestants the right, under the present state of the law, to allow children professing the Jewish religion to attend the schools:\n(a) as a matter of grace;\n(b) as a matter of right;\n(c) can the province force the Protestants to accept children professing the Jewish religion under such conditions?\nIt is impossible to answer this question categorically and difficult to answer it intelligently. We deal with it as follows:\nWe assume that the question is to be answered having regard to the law of the province of Quebec bearing on educational matters in so far as such law is valid, exclusive of the Act of 1903, and that \u201cProtestants\u201d in the question means the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the city of Montreal and the Trustees of the Protestant dissentient schools in rural municipalities,\nTo part (a) the answer is: Yes;\nTo part (b): Further assuming that the inquiry intended is whether Jewish children have the right to attend Protestant schools, with a correlative obligation on the part of the Boards of Protestant School Commissioners and Trustees to admit children professing the Jewish children to the schools respectively under their control and to provide therein for their education, the answer is: In the city of Montreal, Yes;\nIn the rural municipalities, No;\nTo part (c): The words \u201cunder such conditions\u201d are quite unintelligible. It is impossible to discern what conditions are meant to be imported. Eliminating them from the question, the answer is:\nIn the city of Montreal, Yes;\nIn the rural municipalities, No.\n[1] [1895] A.C. 202, at pp. 216, 219.\n[2] [1917] A.C. 62, at p. 69.\n[3] Q.R. 23 S.C. 365, at pp. 371, 377.\n[4] [1873] 14 N.B.

Dubuc (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1926: February 11; 1926: March 13.\nPresent :\u2014Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nInsurance\u2014Life and accident\u2014Medical treatment since examination\u2014 Accident after issue and before delivery of policy\u2014Premium\u2014Payment by note\u2014Delivery of policy. Provisions in the application form for a policy of life and accident insurance stipulated that \"the insurance thereby applied for shall not take effect unless and until the policy is delivered to and received by the applicant\" and that the insurance applied for should take effect \"only if the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination.\" The policy, however, stated that \"this policy takes effect as of date policy is written (twenty-sixth day of June, 1924).\" The accident to the plaintiff and his consequent medical attendance took place on the 4th of July and the policy was handed to his father for the insured about 12th July, having been in possession of the local agent for some time before the insured was injured.\nHeld that the policy must be considered as in force at the time of the accident. The provision that the applicant shall not have consulted or been treated by a physician must be limited to the period between the medical examination pertaining to the application and the date stipulated by the contract for the coming into force of the policy.\nHeld, also, that the policy had been effectively delivered to the applicant although the agent who handed it over to the applicant had delivered it notwithstanding the instructions of the company not to deliver the policy unless the agent \"first satisfies himself that the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician * * *.\" The company cannot, consistently with its obligations, impose conditions upon the delivery of the policy which were not provided for by the contract; and moreover the company's agent, exercising as such his own judgment upon the questions of fact involved in the instructions, must be deemed to have acted on behalf of the company in delivering the policy.\nHeld, further, that the premium must be regarded as paid at the time of the accident, inasmuch as on the 30th of June the company's agent had received through discount from the bank, without recourse, the proceeds of a promissory note which was given by the father of the insured in payment of the premium.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1925] 3 W.W.R. 386) aff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial court and maintaining the appellant's action. The material facte of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and F. O. McKenna for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The question is whether a policy of life insurance, upon which the plaintiff (respondent) claims for permanent disability, is to be considered as having taken effect or attached at the time of the injury which the insured received and for which he claims.\nThe plaintiff, who is a young man, at the suggestion of his father, who is a physician, signed an application for the insurance in the usual printed form of the defendant company, dated 13th June, 1924. The application was submitted to Mr. Braniff, the company's agent at Pincher Creek. At the same time the plaintiff's father gave his promissory note, dated 13th June, payable six months after date to the order of Mr. Braniff for $65.58, the amount of the semi-annual premium. The plaintiff underwent his medical examination on 17th June; Mr. Braniff sent the application papers to the Calgary office on 19th June, whence they were forwarded to the head office of the company in New York, where the risk was accepted and the policy executed, dated 26th June, and dispatched on the following day to the Calgary agent, who received it in due course and sent it to the agent at Pincher Creek for delivery. In the meantime, on 30th June, Mr. Braniff had endorsed Dr. Dubuc's note without recourse, discounted it at the Union Bank of Canada at Pincher Creek, and received the proceeds. Subsequently, at maturity, the note was paid by the maker. The plaintiff, on 4th July, met with an accident in which he sustained serious injury to his spine, on account of which he was laid up for a long time, and was still incapacitated at the time of the trial. The policy was delivered by Mr. Braniff to Dr. Dubuc about the middle of July.\nBy the application it is specified that the policy is \"to take effect as of date policy is written,\" and by one of the subsequent printed paragraphs of the application form\nIt is mutually agreed as follows: 1. That the insurance hereby applied for shall not take effect unless and until the policy is delivered to and received by the applicant and the first premium paid in full during his lifetime, and then only if the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination.\nWhen the insured met with the accident, he was travelling with his father in the state of Idaho. The automobile in which they were left the road and went down an embankment. The plaintiff emerged from the wreck badly injured and became unconscious. His father treated him on the spot, had him conveyed to Bonner's Ferry, where he went into hospital in charge of a doctor, whence he was removed on the following day to Calgary, where he was again placed in hospital in charge of Dr. McEachern.\nThe whole defence arises upon the clause in the application which I have quoted, and the principal point is that inasmuch as the applicant had consulted or been treated by a physician during the time intervening between his medical examination and the delivery of the policy, the insurance did not take effect.\nThe policy itself contains the following clause:\nThis policy takes effect as of the twenty-sixth day of June, nineteen hundred and twenty-four, which day is the anniversary of the policy.\nI shall have something more to say about the delivery of the policy, but I think it must be taken to have been duly completed when Dr. Dubuc actually received the policy; moreover I think that the premium must be regarded as paid when, on 30th June, the company's agent received from the bank, without recourse, the proceeds of the note which was given in payment of the premium. Therefore, assuming delivery and receipt of the policy, and payment of the premium, the sole question for consideration is as to the interpretation and effect of the remaining stipulation\nand then only if the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination.\nNow it will be perceived that it is necessary, in order that these words should be given an intelligible meaning, to interpret them reasonably and with the necessary implications. The word \"then,\" in the context in which it stands, is to be understood as equivalent to \"in that case\" or, describing the case,\nin the event that the policy has been delivered and the first premium paid;\nit would not do to interpret the word as an adverb of time, because not only is that not its natural significance in this place, but moreover because the obvious reason of the clause is that failure of the applicant's health, so far as to cause him to consult a physician or to receive medical treatment, would naturally affect the basis of the application, and require reconsideration of the risk, which, unless re-accepted, would not attach at any time. Therefore, adopting the only meaning which I think permissible, the clause, in its application to a state of fact in which the applicant had consulted or been treated by a physician after his medical examination, would read as follows:\nIt is mutually agreed as follows: that * * * the insurance hereby applied for shall take effect only if the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination.\nWhen this clause is considered in relation to the provision that the policy shall take effect as of its date, it acquires a definite and reasonable meaning. The clause qualifies or creates an exception from the special stipulation that the policy is to take effect as of its date, and the words\nhas not consulted or been treated by any physician since\nhave relation only to a time antecedent to that date; the insurance applied for, which, if it ever become effective, is to take effect as of the date of the policy, is not to take effect if the applicant has consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination. This protects the company against such an impairment of health between the date of the medical examination and the date of the policy as was considered apt materially to affect the condition of the applicant as represented by the application and the medical certificate, and the word \"since\" cannot consistently with the structure and intent of the application and the policy, when read together, have reference to any time subsequent to the date stipulated by the contract for the coming into force of the policy. Previously to this date the applicant had not consulted or been treated by any physician since his medical examination, and therefore the policy attached as of the date particularly mentioned both in the application and in the policy. Moreover any other reading of the clause would involve the extraordinary situation whereby the applicant for a policy to take effect as of its date, whose application had been accepted, whose policy, to take effect of its date, had been written and executed by the company, and whose premium, reckoned from the policy date, had been paid and accepted by the company, would remain subject to all the vicissitudes of delay, accident in transmission, negligence in delivery, and other fortuitous occurrences, which might render ineffectual or postpone the very risk which it was the object of the transaction to insure.\nThen it is said that the policy was not delivered, and this rests upon the view that Mr. Braniff, the agent who actually handed out the policy to Dr. Dubuc about the middle of July, and who in ordinary course was the agent of the company through whom delivery should be made, had no authority to deliver the policy because of the instructions which accompanied it. This point arises because the plaintiff's counsel, upon examination for discovery of Mr. Blackey, the defendant's Calgary manager, called for production of the letter which accompanied the policy when it was sent to Mr. Braniff for delivery, and defendants counsel informed him in reply that the defendant did not have the letter, but he produced a printed form which the plaintiff's counsel then put in as a part of the discovery with an admission that the letter which accompanied the policy, when it was sent from the Calgary office to the local agent at Pincher Creek, was in that form. In this form of letter the agent is told\nyou are allowed not to exceed one month from this date to deliver these policies,\nand, by a printed notice in the margin, it is said that a policy must not be delivered\nif any change whatever has occurred in the health or occupation of the applicant, or if he has consulted or been treated by a physician since the date of his medical examination. In such case the agent must at once return the policy to his branch office with full particulars and await further instructions.\nAnd by a subsequent paragraph in the margin it is said:\nA policy must not be delivered to a third party tendering the premium unless the agent (by personal interview with the applicant if possible) first satisfies himself that the applicant has not consulted or been treated by any physician, and that there has not been any change whatever in the health or occupation of the applicant since the date of his medical examination.\nNow the company could not, consistently with its obligations, impose conditions upon the delivery of the policy which were not provided for by the contract. I doubt that it was the intention of the company to instruct the agent to withhold delivery, except as authorized by the contract; for the reasons which I have mentioned, I think that the insured was entitled to his policy when he received it, and therefore that the agent did not misinterpret his instructions; he still remains the company's agent; he was to exercise his own judgment upon the questions of fact involved in his instructions, and therefore I think that the delivery of the policy made by the agent must be regarded as delivery by the company.\nAlthough, by the application, the policy was not to take effect unless and until delivered, there is nothing to indicate an intention that, when delivered, it should not operate according to its terms, and therefore as of 26th June.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned judges in the appellate court below, and in this court by my brother Newcombe J., I agree that this appeal be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1925] 3 W.W.R. 386.\n"

If, where either of said statutes apply, a wife is named as sole beneficiary in a policy of insurance on her husband\u2019s life, and it appears that subsequent to the date of the policy he made a will, produced and sworn to by her as his last will, which declares her to be the Bole beneficiary of his life insurance, and no reason is shown for believing that any alteration in the designation of beneficiary has been made, the insurer is not entitled to require the production of letters probate as a condition precedent to payment to such beneficiary. A requirement of the policy that the \u201ctitle of the person claiming shall be duly proven\u201d is satisfied by the production of the policy naming the claimant as sole beneficiary. Letters probate of the deceased\u2019s will form no part of her chain of title.\nIf an appeal, though within the jurisdiction Of the court, be manifestly entirely devoid of merit or substance, the court will entertain favourably a motion-to quash it.\nThe plaintiff sued to recover the amount of a policy of insurance and interest thereon, and, having begun action by a specially endorsed writ, moved before a judge in chambers for speedy judgment under Order XIV, r. 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and it was ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the sum mentioned in the policy and that the action should proceed as to the demand for interest. The order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nHeld, the order for judgment was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as now defined in s. 2 (e) of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 139, as amended); also it was not an order amounting merely to an exercise of judicial discretion within the purview of s. 38 of said Act; and grounds urged under those sections against the defendant\u2019s right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada were not maintainable; but the court, applying the principles stated in the first part of this head-note, quashed the appeal on the ground that it was manifestly devoid of merit.\nMOTION by the plaintiff (respondent) to quash an appeal taken by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming an order made by a judge in chambers, on a motion for speedy judgment under Order XIV, r. 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, that judgment be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for the principal sum mentioned in a policy of life insurance, and that the action should proceed as to the demand for interest.\nW. D. Herridge for the motion.\nG. F. Macdonnell contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\n\u00c0nglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) sues in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to recover the amount of a policy of insurance ($7,500) on the life of her late husband, and interest thereon. She is the sole beneficiary named in the policy. The defendant company, under authority of a judge in chambers, entered a conditional appearance. It, no doubt, intended to dispute the jurisdiction of the British Columbia court, although it does business in that province and is registered there as an extra-provincial company. The insured made application for the insurance at Calgary, Alberta, where he then resided. He removed to Vancouver a short time before his death which occurred there on the 29th of March, 1925. The head office of the insurance company is at Toronto and the policy is payable there. Objection to the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Court appears to have been subsequently abandoned.\n\u201cProofs of loss\u201d were duly made by the claimant on forms furnished by the defendant company. The only exception taken to their sufficiency was the absence of probate of the last will of the insured. To a question in the forms as to the existence of such a will the answer made by the claimant was: \u201cYea, but not yet probated\u201d The plaintiff declined to comply with the demand of the company that she should furnish probate on the ground that the will of the insured was not an element in her title to the insurance moneys and that to obtain it would put her unnecessarily to very great expense. She did, however, furnish the company with what she, in her affidavit made in support of the motion for judgment, swore to be\nher husband\u2019s last will and testament which was executed by him just before he went to St. Paul\u2019s Hospital in the city of Vancouver on his last illness.\nThis document bears date of 24th of January, 1925, and contains a clause which declares the plaintiff sole beneficiary of her husband\u2019s life insurance. The plaintiff also deposed that she is solely entitled to the insurance moneys in question.\nHaving begun this action by a specially endorsed writ, the plaintiff moved before a judge in chambers for speedy judgment under order XIV r. 1 of the rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. She was not cross-examined, as she might have been, oil her affidavit filed in support of this motion which contained both the foregoing statements; nor were they contradicted. The only grounds of defence suggested in answer to the motion were the plaintiff\u2019s failure to produce the letters probate of her husband\u2019s last will and to furnish the defendant with a formal discharge for the moneys payable under the policy. In reply the plaintiff asserted that production of this discharge had been dispensed with by the company\u2019s officers. She has, nevertheless, executed such a document and offers to furnish that or any other form of release which the company may demand. No exception has been taken to the sufficiency in form of the discharge thus offered.\nNo material fact is in dispute and no fact is suggested in the affidavits filed on behalf of the defendant in answer to the motion for judgment which casts the slightest doubt on the plaintiff\u2019s right to immediate payment of the insurance moneys. The only ground for resisting her claim to judgment preferred at bar in this court is the absence of such further assurance as probate would furnish that the document which she has sworn is her husband\u2019s last will is such in fact. Subject to this objection, the liability of the defendant to pay the policy sued upon is admitted.\nIt is obvious that probate would not afford any assurance that the insured had not, subsequently to the 24th of January, 1925 (the date of the will sworn to), executed another \u201cdeclaration\u201d under the Life Insurance Act of Alberta (Alta. statute, 1924, c. 13, s. 25 et seq.), not in the form of a will or codicil, altering the designation of beneficiary as permitted by s. 29 of the statute. Identical statutory provisions exist in Ontario (Ont. statutes, 1924, c. 50, s. 136 et seq.) where the defendant suggests that the contract of insurance was made, British Columbia (R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 117, s. 25 et seq.), Manitoba (Statutes of 1924, c. 99, s. 25 et seq.), Saskatchewan (Statutes of 1924, s. 31, s. 194 (d) et seq.), New Brunswick (Statutes of 1924, c. 31, s. 25 et seq.), Nova Scotia (Statutes of 1925, c. 2, s. 25 et seq.) and Prince Edward Island (Statutes of 1924, c. 9, s. 25 et seq.). In the province of Quebec, chapter 244 of the Revised Statutes of 1925 makes provisions in some respects similar. For present purposes it is immaterial whether the rights of the parties in respect of the insurance moneys in question are governed by the Ontario statute or by the Alberta statute. So far as they are material the provisions of both are the same.\nIf the defendant company should be entitled in the present case, as a condition precedent to payment, to require the production of letters probate or other proof that the insured had not by subsequent \u201cdeclaration\u201d within s. 29 of the Alberta statute (s. 140 of the Ontario statute) altered the designation of the beneficiary named in the policy sued upon, wherever alteration of beneficiary is permitted under the law any claim by a preferred beneficiary for payment to him according to the tenor of a matured policy of life insurance may be successfully resisted on similar grounds without alleging, or offering evidence of, the existence of any reason for believing that any alteration in the designation of beneficiary has in fact been made. Section 28 of the Alberta statute (s. 139 of the Ontario statute), in expressly creating a trust of the insurance moneys in favour of the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) in the preferred class, not only takes the moneys out of the estate of the insured but makes clear the status of the designated preferred beneficiary to recover the same from the insurer, without intervention of the insured\u2019s personal representatives, as a trust fund in the hands of the insurer of which such beneficiary is the owner in equity. Gregory v. Williams[1]; Re Empress Engineering Co.[2]; Gandy v. Gandy[3]. The case at bar is thus clearly distinguished from In re Engelback\u2019s Estate, Tibbets v. Engelback[4]; and similar authorities. See Re Fleetwood\u2019s Policy[5].\nThe learned judge in chambers, on the 11th of August, 1925, ordered that judgment be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant company for the principal sum mentioned in the policy and that the action should proceed as to the demand for interest. On appeal this order was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on January 5, 1926, the court being of opinion that the affidavits filed on behalf of the defendant disclosed no defence to the action.\nThe defendant has appealed to this court. The plaintiff moves to quash the appeal. Two grounds were originally urged at bar in support of the motion, (a) that the order for judgment was not a final judgment within s. 2 (e), and (b) that it was an order made in the exercise of judicial discretion and, therefore, unappealable under s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act.\nFormerly, when only\na judgment, rule, order or decision whereby the action, suit, cause, matter, or other judicial proceeding (was) finally determined and concluded\nwas a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for the purposes of appeal to this court, an order for judgment, however conclusive of the rights of the parties in controversy in the action, was not so regarded, Rural Municipality of Morris v. London & Canadian Loan Co.[6]. But, under the present definition of \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d i.e.,\nany judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding (s. 2 (e)),\nthe final character of an order for judgment such as that before us is indubitable.\nNor does such an order amount merely to an exercise of judicial discretion within the purview of s. 38. In directing judgment the judge in chambers\u2014and the Court of Appeal in affirming him\u2014necessarily determined judicially that the matters urged in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim were devoid of merit and afforded no substantial ground of defence. Such a decision and the order giving effect to it are not discretionary, although an order dismissing a motion for judgment, if based on the view that the suggested defences disclose matter which should be disposed of after trial rather than summarily upon motion, may be discretionary as well as not final.\nUpon the argument of the motion, however, it was suggested to counsel for the respondent that he should consider the advisability of asking that the appeal be quashed for such manifest lack of substance as would bring it within the character of vexatious proceedings designed merely to delay the plaintiff\u2019s recovery\u2014\u201cproceedings against good faith.\u201d Supreme Court Act, s. 50; Fontaine v. Payette[7]. Every court of justice has an inherent jurisdiction to prevent such abuse of its own procedure, Reichel v. McGrath[8]. If an appeal, though within its jurisdiction, be manifestly entirely devoid of merit or substance, this court will entertain favourably a motion to quash it, as it does in cases where costs only are involved, (Schlomann v. Dowker[9]; Angers v. Duggan, 19 Feb., 1907, Cameron, 3rd Ed., p. 92; M oir v. Huntingdon[10]; Assn. Pharmaceutique v. Fauteux, 20 Feb., 1923), as a convenient way of disposing of the appeal before further costs have been incurred. The motion stood over to permit counsel to consider it from this aspect and was subsequently further argued.\nAfter full consideration we are satisfied that the appeal lacks merit and that interference with the order for judgment, unanimously affirmed by the provincial appellate court, would be clearly unjustifiable.\nLiability on the policy is admitted. The only defence suggested is that production of probate of the last will of the insured is a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to payment. The policy requires that the\ntitle of the person claiming shall be duly proven.\nThat condition was satisfied by the production of the policy which named the plaintiff as sole beneficiary. The statute makes her a preferred beneficiary and a cestui qui trust entitled to claim payment to herself on maturity of the policy. Letters probate of the will of the deceased form no part of her chain of title. Moreover, the statute\u2014whether that of Ontario or that of Alberta applies\u2014explicitly protects the insurer making payment to her as such beneficiary against any claim that might afterwards be made under an \u201cinstrument in writing affecting the insurance money\u201d of which it had not received notice before such payment.

A mortgage in favour of M. upon the four last mentioned lots had been discharged by the Crown in 1922 by the payment to M. of the sum of $22,000. It was alleged by the Crown in its information exhibited in the Exchequer Court that it was willing to pay as compensation for the five lots \u201cthe sum of $22,000, including thereon the said sum of $22,000,\u201d paid to M. in advance and without reference to the appellant.\nHeld that the payment to M. of the mortgage, although satisfying any claim in respect of the four lots covered by the mortgage, could not be applied towards compensation for lot 149, and that the case should be remitted to the Exchequer Court to determine the amount of compensation for that lot.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nR. Cassidy K.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and A. B. Macdonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014On the 29th of May, 1923, the Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of His Majesty the King, exhibited in the Exchequer Court an information to which Roland Stuart and John Roper Hull and the Royal Trust Company, executors of the estate of William James Roper, deceased, were made defendants. This information was exhibited under s. 26 of the Expropriation Act (R.S.C., c. 143) in the matter of the expropriation of five parcels of land, to wit: lots 149, 9011, 9565, 9565A and 9566 in group one, Kootenay district, British Columbia, containing an area of 615.97 acres, more or less. It alleged that these lands were taken for the purpose of a public work of Canada, a public park, and that, on the 4th of April, 1922, a plan and description of the land was deposited of record in the land registry office of the Nelson Land Registration District. Information also states that the defendant Roland Stuart claims to have been the owner in fee simple of the lands at the time of filing the plan and description, subject however to the following registered mortgages: (a) a mortgage, dated 11th of December, 1911, over lot 149, in favour of one William J. Roper for $10,000, the full amount whereof had been paid to the trustees of the Roper\u2019s estate, but a final discharge of the mortgage had not yet been registered; (b) a mortgage dated the 11th of February, 1912, over lots 9011, 9565, 9565A and 9566 in favour of William J. Malcolm to secure payment of $16,230.80, with interest at 7 per cent per annum,\nwhich said mortgage was discharged by His Majesty the King, through the Minister of the Interior of the Dominion of Canada on the 5th day of June, 1922, by the payment to the said William J. Malcolm of the sum of $22,000, and a formal discharge of the said mortgage has been registered in the said land registry office.\nIt was further alleged that His Majesty the King was willing to pay to whomsoever the court might adjudge to be entitled thereto, in full satisfaction of all estate, right, title and interest, and all claims for damages that may foe caused by the expropriation,\nthe sum of $22,000, including therein the said sum of $22,000 paid as aforesaid to discharge the said mortgage held by William J. Malcolm.\nThe defendant Roland Stuart alone filed a defence to the action. He alleged that the tender of $22,000 was not a sufficient and just compensation for the lands expropriated and claimed as compensation $500,000, with interest and costs. No question was raised as to the payment of the Roper mortgage on lot 149.\nOn lot 149 there is a hot spring known as Sinclair Springs. Its temperature is about 112 degrees and it has a considerable flow. The other lots are about two and a half miles by road from lot 149.\nThe contention of the defendant Stuart briefly is that all these lots were purchased as parts of one and the same scheme. Lot 149, on which the spring is located, owing to its mountainous character, is not suitable for building purposes, but the other lots it is urged, are an admirable site for hotels, camps and a golf course, the whole in beautiful mountain scenery. The Banff-Windermere Highway passes close to the spring, but is open only for four months of the year. The defendant describes the property as being an ideal pleasure and health resort, and claims that it has a special adaptability as such. He further contends that it is expropriated by the Government for the same purposes as those for which he intended to use it himself.\nThe case after a somewhat lengthy trial, and production of evidence taken in England under a commission in which the spring and its surroundings were compared to other hot springs in America and Europe, was submitted to the learned President of the Exchequer Court, who also, in company with counsel for the respective parties, visited the property. By his judgment, the learned President declared the lands vested in the Crown, and adding ten per cent for compulsory taking to the $22,000 tendered, awarded $24,200 as compensation for the lands and for all damages resulting from the expropriation. He further declared that the defendant Stuart was entitled to recover from the Crown $2,200, together with interest on $24,200 from April 4, 1922, to June 5, 1922, and interest on $2,200 from the last mentioned date to the date of the judgment, the Crown\nhaving paid the balance of the damages to the mortgagee on account of the defendant.\nFrom this judgment the defendant Stuart appeals.\nThe appellant at the trial relied on some highly speculative features in connection with the expropriated lots, but it appeared to us, after the very full argument submitted on his behalf, that the learned President had duly considered all the elements which can appropriately enter into the valuation of such a property, and that he had placed a value on the lands with any potentialities or special adaptability which they possessed at the date of the expropriation. The defendant\u2019s grievance, as alleged, is that this valuation is inadequate, but after considering all the evidence to which we were referred, we do not think we would be justified in disturbing the learned President\u2019s estimate of value.\nA difficulty however arises in connection with the course adopted by the Crown in paying to the mortgagee Malcolm the $22,000 it tendered as compensation. Malcolm had a mortgage on lots 9011, 9565, 9565A and 9566. He had no interest in lot 149, and under his mortgage could claim no part of the compensation granted for that lot. Undoubtedly Stuart was entitled to compensation for the compulsory taking of lot 149.\nIt may be observed that under the Expropriation Act, the compensation money stands in the stead of the land or property expropriated, and any claim to or encumbrance on such land or property is as respects His Majesty converted into a claim to the compensation money, or to a proportionate share thereof, and is void as respects the land or property taken (s. 22). The information which is exhibited by the Attorney General should set forth, inter alia, the persons who, at the date of the deposit of the plan and description of the land or property, had any estate or interest in such land or property and the particulars of such estate or interest, and any charge, lien or encumbrance to which the land was subject, so far as it can be ascertained, and also the sums of money which the Crown is ready to pay to such persons respectively, in respect of any such estate, interest, charge, lien or encumbrance (s. 26). The expropriation proceedings, as far as the parties thereto are concerned, bar all claims to the compensation money or any part thereof, including any claim in respect of all mortgages, hypothecs or encumbrances upon the land or property, and the court makes\nsuch order for the distribution, payment or investment of the compensation money, and for the securing of the rights of all persons interested, as to right and justice, and according to the provisions of this Act, and to law appertain (s. 29).\nS. 33 adds that the Minister of Finance may pay to any person, out of any unappropriated moneys forming part of the consolidated revenue fund, any sum of money to which under the judgment of the Exchequer Court he is entitled as compensation money or costs.\nIf the course mapped out by the statute had been followed, the Exchequer Court would have made an order indicating the persons (owners or mortgagees) entitled to the compensation money, or to a proportionate share thereof, and these persons in due course would have been paid by the Minister of Finance. The Crown however paid to Malcolm in advance, and without reference to Stuart, the whole amount which it tendered to the latter as compensation for the expropriation of the five lots. The sum it paid on the Malcolm mortgage no doubt satisfied any claim for compensation in respect of the property covered by that mortgage, to wit lots 9011, 9565, 9565A and 9566, but that payment cannot be applied towards compensation for lot 149. We think therefore that the action should be remitted to the Exchequer Court to determine the amount of compensation payable in respect of lot no. 149.\nUnder all the circumstances, and as the appellant fails with respect to the greater part of his claim, we think that there should be no order as to the costs of this appeal. The costs of all proceedings in the Exchequer Court will be in the discretion of the judge when disposing of the matter referred back.\nAppeal allowed, no costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Robert Cassidy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Edwards.\n"

Taschereau for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and Gravel K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal by special leave of this court from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Quebec.\nOn the 24th of June, 1910, the appellant obtained leave from the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada to cross the tracks of the respondent in St. Valier street, in the city of Quebec. By the order of the Board, certain directions were given as to the installation of semaphores, of a diamond and derails, of the interlocking plant and of an annunciator to warn signalmen of the approach of trains. The order further contained the following provision:\u2014\n7. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company shall employ and pay the signalman necessary to operate the interlocking plant, at the joint expense of the applicant company (the present appellant); the applicant company to reimburse the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to the extent of one half the said expense upon the rendering of monthly accounts by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to the applicant company.\nAn accident having happened to a signalman while lifting a semaphore lever, the workman brought an action against the present respondent under the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (R.S.Q. 1909, ss. 7321 et seq.), and was awarded $3,000 as compensation, with interest and costs. The respondent had contested the plaintiff\u2019s action, so that it was condemned to pay a considerable sum for costs as well as for the interest on the capital sum awarded. The respondent paid the amount of the judgment, and claimed one half of its expenditure from the appellant. It was granted merely one half of the capital sum awarded to the signalman, the court being of the opinion that it had uselessly contested the latter\u2019s action, thus incurring by its own fault liability for the costs of contestation and for interest. This judgment having been affirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the appellant obtained special leave to appeal to this court. We are all of opinion that the compensation granted to the signalman under the statute is an expenditure which comes fairly within the terms of the seventh paragraph of the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The respondent is ordered to employ and pay the signalmen necessary to operate the interlocking plant at the joint expense of the appellant, and the obligation of the latter is to reimburse the respondent to the extent of one half \u201cthe said expense.\u201d To borrow the language of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[1], the right conferred on the workman, by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, is the result of a statutory condition of the contract of employment made with him, and his right to compensation arises, not out of tort, but out of his statutory contract. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in question in that case was the statute passed by the legislature of British Columbia, but the language of their Lordships applies with equal force to the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The right to compensation under that Act does not arise out of a fault committed or presumed, but is a right possessed by the workman under his contract of employment. It follows that when the respondent paid this compensation to the signalman, it made a payment to which paragraph 7 of the order applies, and the liability of the appellant to reimburse one half of this payment cannot be questioned.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Laurent, Gagn\u00e9, Devlin & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pentland, Grant, Thomson & Hearn.\n[1] [1920] A.C. 184, at p. 191.\n"

F. Macdonnell for motion.\nF. Hogg K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff (McBride) seeks to compel the defendant club to register him as an assignee of a share of its capital stock. This relief, denied by the trial judge, having been accorded by the Appellate Divisional Court, the defendant now appeals to this court.\nUnder the authority of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act the Appellate Divisional Court granted special leave to appeal and, the applihttp:\/\/ofsys.com\/T\/OFC4\/CP\/786\/4AAHebkg\/VF\/Referencement.ofsyscation therefor having been brought on after the expiry of the 60 days prescribed by s. 69 of the Supreme Court Act, the court by its order, exercising the power conferred by s. 71 of the Supreme Court Act, also extended the time for bringing the appeal to the 15th of February, 1926.\nThe appeal having been duly launched under the terms of this order the plaintiff now moves to quash it. The sole ground relied on at bar in support of the motion was that the power conferred by s. 71 cannot be exercised where special leave to appeal is necessary.\nIn our opinion this objection cannot be maintained. S. 39 of the Supreme Court Act subjects the right of appeal conferred by s. 36 to two alternative conditions: either (a) the amount or value of the matter in controversy must exceed $2,000, or (b) special leave to appeal must be obtained. Upon condition (b) being satisfied the same right of appeal exists as in cases which fall within condition (a) and there is no good reason why s. 71 should not apply equally to both classes of appeals.\nMoreover, the matter appears to be covered by authority. In Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab, the court of appeal for Ontario on the 31st of December,\n1909, made an order extending the time for appealing to this court from its judgment pronounced on the 13th of May, 1909. The value of the matter in controversy being less than $1,000, special leave to appeal was required, and by s. 48 (e) of the Supreme Court Act, as it then stood, this court or the court of appeal was empowered to grant such leave. This court having, on the 25th of February, 1910, refused leave on the ground that its right to grant it did not exist after the expiry of the 60 days prescribed by s. 69, notwithstanding the order of extension made by the court of appeal (1), the latter court on application to it on the 24th of March, 1910, gave special leave to appeal and further extended the time for appealing. The appeal was subsequently heard on the merits and dismissed (2). See also Brussels v. McCrae (3).\nThe motion will be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n"

Held, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the commission stipulated in the contract of agency as, at the date of its revocation, they had not taken any orders and had not performed various other duties for the discharge of which the stipulated commission would remunerate them.\nHeld, also, that assuming the revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s agency to have been unfair and actuated by reprehensible motives, it was not open to them to have a judgment based upon a right not asserted in their declaration or at trial, to recover damages for unlawful revocation of the agency.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014Neither can compensation be allowed on a quantum meruit basis for whatever benefit the defendant company may have derived from such work as the plaintiffs had done before the revocation of their mandate.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 40, K.B. 97) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellants\u2019 action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nGeoffrion K.C. and Badeaux for the appellants.\nJohn T.

The majority of the court held that the brokers\u2019 employment was revocable at the will of the principals; that it was revoked before any orders had been obtained; that the commission at the fixed rate would be earned only when the brokers had performed other important services subsequent to obtaining the orders; that no claim for quantum meruit had been preferred or attempted to be proved at the trial; that no claim for damages for wrongful revocation of the agency had been put forward by the plaintiffs and that they had failed to establish the only cause of action which they had presented.\nThe facts out of which this litigation arose are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Hall and in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Greenshields. The latter learned judge concludes his opinion in these words:\nLest there be any uncertainty as to my holding, I do not maintain the action as an action for damages, but I maintain it as and for commission earned under a contract. If my concluding statement is incorrect, the action of respondents is unfounded and should be dismissed[2].\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously took the view that it was not open to the plaintiffs to have in the present action a judgment based upon a right to damages for wrongful revocation of their agency.\nWhatever recourse the plaintiffs might have on the footing of an unfair and inopportune (intempestive) revocation of their agency. (Galibert v. Atteaux[3]; Baugh v. Porcupine et al[4]; Labont\u00e9 v. Desjardins[5]; Cyr v. Lecours[6]; Comp. 2 Colin & Cap., 3 ed., 717; 6 Aubry et Rau, 6 ed., 186; Fuzier Herman R\u00e9p., vo. Mandat, no. 783), it seems to be impossible to accord such relief in this action. The defendants have not been called upon, and have been given no opportunity, to meet such a demand.\nNeither can compensation on a quantum meruit basis for whatever benefit the defendants may have derived from such work as the plaintiffs had done before the revocation of their mandate be now allowed. If, under the circumstances of this case, such a demand could be made, no claim was preferred on that basis and evidence at the trial was not directed to establishing the value of what the plaintiffs had done up to the time of the revocation. It has also been suggested that from the defendants\u2019 circular letter of the 11th of March:\nTo our brokers:\nEffective May 1, 1920, brokerage covering the sale of raisins for the account of this company will be paid upon the basis of 1\u00bd per cent. On sales made prior to May 1, 1920, brokerage will be paid at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent.\nRaisins have advanced so greatly in price during the last few years that the brokerage is out of proportion with the service rendered, hence the revision.\nPlease advise us by return mail if you desire to continue representing this company, in the territory assigned to you, upon the basis of 1\u00bd per cent brokerage.\nand the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of the 22nd of March accepting the new basis of remuneration, which was couched in these terms:\nDear sir:\nWe have received your brokers\u2019 letter dated March 11 pertaining to reduction of commission.\nWe certainly wish to remain as representatives for the California Assorted Raisin Co. in the assigned territory as in the past, even if at a new rate of commission * * *.\nit is a fair inference that the plaintiffs were engaged to represent the defendants at least until the close of the business year then about to open. But what the defendants asked was whether the plaintiffs desired \u201cto continue representing\u201d the company and the plaintiffs\u2019 assent was to remain such representatives \u201cas in the past.\u201d The plaintiffs had been acting as selling agents for the defendants from 1916. There is no suggestion that during that period there ever was an engagement for any definite time, or that the plaintiffs\u2019 mandate was not revocable at any moment at the will of the defendants. The continuing mandate contemplated in the letters quoted was evidently to be on the same footing as formerly as to all its terms except the rate of commission. It would require something much more definite and precise to exclude the application to it of the general rule of law expressed in the Civil Code:\nArt. 1756. The mandator may at any time revoke the mandate * * *.\nThis is a term recognized by law in every contract of agency (Cantlie v. Coaticook Cotton Co.[7], Pand. Belges, 1896, no. 222), unless clearly excluded, when, of course, conventio vincit legem. The basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 action is a contract of agency or mandate, inherent in which is the risk of revocation at the will of the principal.\nOn the evidence it is clear that the plaintiffs were not in a position to obtain, and they did not in fact obtain any orders for the year 1920, although they did certain preparatory work in the mutual interest of themselves and of the defendants, which would probably have proved advantageous to both parties had the plaintiffs subsequently received, as they expected, and probably with good reason, authority to solicit and take actual orders. The plaintiffs in fact did none of the manifold things which they would have been obliged to do in order to become entitled to the stipulated commission had their agency not been revoked. That commission was a single fixed percentage to cover all the services to be rendered by the plaintiffs in the course of their duty as defendants\u2019 agents. It could be earned only by, and no part of it was payable until, the complete fulfilment of those services.\nIt may be that the revocation of the plaintiffs\u2019 agency was as unfair and was actuated by motives as reprehensible as they suggest. To whatever liability such action of the defendants may have subjected them, that liability was not the contractual obligation to pay commission which is the sole basis of the claim made in this action.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s action, as I read it, and I have very carefully read it, is not an action in damages for breach of contract by reason of the termination of his agency. He claims commission under the agency contract for orders which he alleges he obtained for the sale of the defendant\u2019s raisins between the 28th of January and the 4th of May, 1920. To be entitled to that commission, it did not suffice to secure what are called memorandum orders, but commission was due only on sales actually carried out. The appellant did not carry out the sales. It may well be that he was prevented from so doing by the termination of his agency early in May, 1920, but if this termination was a breach of his contract, he had a cause of action against the respondent which he has not asserted in this case. We must deal with his action as brought, and it would not be permissible to transform it into a claim for damages for wrongful dismissal. Having thus stated my reason for concurring in the judgment dismissing the appeal, I do not wish to be taken as agreeing in the conclusion that the respondent had the right to terminate the appellant\u2019s agency during the season of 1920, having regard to the circular letter of the 11th of March offering the agency to the appellant at a commission of 1\u00bd per cent on sales subsequent to May 1st, 1920, and the acceptance by the appellant of this agency on these terms. The respondent terminated the agency shortly after May 1st, so that the appellant had no opportunity thereafter to earn his commission. If this was a breach of the agency contract, the appellant had the right to claim damages, but, as I have stated, this is not the cause of action which he asserts in these proceedings.\nI therefore think that his appeal fails.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Buchanan, Badeaux & Buchanan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Foster, Mann, Place, MacKinnon, Hackett & Mulvena.\n[1] [1925] Q.R. 40 K.B. 97.\n[2] Q.R. 40 K.B. 97, at p. 104.\n[3] [1895] Q.R. 23 S.C. 427.\n[4] [1911] 17 Rev. de J. 415.\n[5] [1911] Q.R. 40 S.C. 521.\n[6] [1914] Q.R. 47 S.C. 86.\n[7] [1887] M.

The defendant (appellant) denied the payment of the premium which became payable on 1st September, 1923, the last to mature. It is upon the issue so raised that the right of recovery depends.\nThe policy, dated 27th August, 1922, covered the life of Wilbur Fletcher Baker for the term of three years next following. It was payable to his mother, Hester Anne Baker, the respondent, if living, at the death of the insured, otherwise to his executors or administrators. The amount of the premium was $27.70, and was, by the terms of the policy, payable\non the delivery of this policy * * * a like amount on or before the 1st day of March and September in every year during the continuance of the contract, until the premiums for three years shall have been fully paid.\nBy the conditions of the policy, thirty days of grace were allowed for the payment of renewal premiums, and, if any premium were not paid when due, the policy was to be void and all liability of the company thereon to cease: provided that the company might revive the policy within the time and upon the terms thereby stipulated. It was further provided that\nall premiums are payable at the head office of the company, but will be accepted elsewhere in exchange for the company\u2019s printed receipts, signed by the president, and countersigned by any authorized agent.\nThe head office of the appellant company is at Waterloo in the province of Ontario. By agreement of 1st September, 1921, the company appointed Lewis B. Willan its agent for Southern Saskatchewan\nto solicit personally and through sub-agents for applications for life insurance, and to receive premiums for the said company,\nand, within this district, he was to have power to appoint sub-agents, subject to the approval and rules of the company. He was to be responsible for all moneys received for or on behalf of the company either by himself or by his agents, and it was stipulated that such moneys should be treated as trust funds of the company, and should be used for no purpose other than as specifically authorized by the agreement. It was also provided that at the close of each month or oftener, as required by the company, the agent should make, on the forms furnished for that purpose, a full report of all collections, the report to be made to the head office not later than the first day of the next succeeding month. By the company\u2019s instructions, which accompanied the contract, renewal premiums, due on the first of the month, were to be reported by the sixth of the month following.\nBy agreement of 1st February, 1922, Mr. Willan, who is therein described as general agent for the appellant company, appointed the above named Wilbur Fletcher Baker district agent for the company\nwithin the limits and under the instructions contained in the company\u2019s manual of rates, book of instructions to agents and requirements and provisions herein stated, or that may hereafter be communicated to him by the company, to solicit, personally and through sub-agents, for applications for life insurance, and to receive premiums for the said company, all of which applications and premiums so received by the district agent shall be delivered to the general agent (Willan) at his office in the Aldon Building in the city of Regina.\nBy this agreement the area within which the district agent had permission to operate was defined as the city of Moose Jaw and its environs, as thereby described, and the sub-agent had authority within his district to appoint sub-agents, subject to the approval and rules of the company. It was moreover stipulated that the district agent should be responsible for all moneys received for or on behalf of the company, or on behalf of the general agent, either by him or by agents or other persons appointed or employed by him, and that\nall such moneys shall be treated as trust funds of the general agent, and shall be used for no purpose other than as herein specifically authorized.\nThen it was provided that\npromptly at the close of each month, or oftener if required by the general agent, the district agent shall make, on the forms furnished for that purpose, a full report of all collections, enclosing therewith proper vouchers for commissions and authorized expenses and a remittance for the amount due to the general agent. This report must be made to the general agent at his office in the Aldon Building in the city of Regina, Saskatchewan, not later than the first day of the next succeeding month.\nMoreover, it was stipulated that\nAll records of business done for the company by the district agent shall be entered upon records belonging to the general agent and all books of account, together with card records, bank books, policy registers, documents, vouchers and all other books and papers connected with the business of the company, whether paid for by the district agent or not, shall be at any and all times open to the officers of the company, and of the general agent in particular, or their respective representatives, for inspection, and freely exhibited and delivered to the general agent at any time on demand.\nThis agreement, by its terms, took effect as of 1st February, 1922, a date antecedent to the policy.\nThe insured paid the first and second premiums; these payments are not disputed. The policy was by its terms to be computed as from 1st September, 1922. The assured met with an accident on 7th or 8th September, 1923, followed by erysipelas, from which he died on 7th October following.\nThe respondent in making her case at the trial produced a receipt for the semi-annual premium of 1st September, 1923, made out in the company\u2019s printed form, signed by the company\u2019s president and managing director, and\ncountersigned, dated September 1, 1923, W. F. Baker, Agent.\nFollowing this counter-signature on the form of receipt is the printed note,\nThis receipt is not binding unless signed by an agent or cashier of the company.\nThe respondent testified that the counter-signature \u201cW. F. Baker,\u201d was that of her son, the insured, and that the receipt was found after her son\u2019s death in her room, where he and Mr. Willan had been transacting some busi- ness during her son\u2019s illness. It was on 13th September that Mr. Willan was there, and Mrs. Baker says that\nafter Mr. Willan left, the papers were there and that receipt was put in my room.\nThe deceased had an office in the Grayson Block on Main street where he transacted his insurance business, but he lived with his mother at her home. She says that her son did not visit his office after he was injured on 7th or 8th September; that he kept his business papers there, and the policy and his private papers at home; that she thought that the premium receipts, other than the one in question, were kept along with the insurance policy; that at the time Mr. Willan was there, her son had a good many of his office papers at the house going over them; that the policy was always kept in a private drawer; that she found the receipt \u201cjust where he left it for her.\u201d Then the respondent\u2019s son, Fred Baker, was called as a witness on her behalf. He said that previously to his brother\u2019s death, they (meaning his mother and he) could not find the September receipt; that the other receipts were kept with the policy which was in the desk at home; that the September receipt was not with the policy; that it was found after his brother\u2019s death in his mother\u2019s dresser. Ernest George Cook was called for the appellant and he testified that he had been appointed a sub-agent for the appellant company by the deceased, and he produced his agency agreement, whereby he was authorized to procure applications for insurance in the appellant company upon terms which were defined, or to be communicated. He said that Fred Baker came to his office on Saturday afternoon, a day or two before the expiration of the days of grace for paying the premium, and told him that he did not know whether the premium upon his brother\u2019s policy had been paid; that he wanted to make sure of it, and wanted him to see Mr. Willan; that he, Cook, then told Baker that Mr. Willan would be coming to Moose Jaw on the following Monday; that Mr. Coleman of his office had been talking to Mr. Willan on the telephone, and that he had told Mr. Coleman that he would be coming on Monday. He said:\u2014\nA. I suggested to Fred Baker that he should wait and see Mr. Willan on Monday, and he thought he would do so, I know his intention was to pay the premium then, if it was not paid, I think he did not know whether it had been paid or not. Q. As far as you know he was not sure one way or the other? Did he tell you that he would tender it on Monday?\nA. Yes, he did.\nQ. He said he would do so?\nA. Yes.\nIn cross-examination Mr. Cook testified that he had no authority to receive the premium for the company, and that he told Fred Baker so. Mr. Coleman said that, on the Saturday mentioned, Mr. Willan had telephoned from Regina to enquire as to the condition of Wilbur F. Baker; that he, Coleman, had answered the telephone, and that in the conversation Mr. Willian \u201cmentioned that he would be up to Moose Jaw on Monday.\u201d Then Fred Baker was recalled, and he testified that, as a result of the conversation which he had with Mr. Cook, he had refrained from remitting the premium to Mr. Willan at Regina on Saturday, relying upon the assurance received from Cook, such as it was, that Mr. Willan would be at Moose Jaw on the following Monday, which was the last day for payment of the premium; that it transpired however that Mr. Willan did not come until Tuesday; that on Tuesday he tendered the premium, but that Mr. Willan would not accept it.\nUpon this evidence the plaintiff rested her case. There was no proof of payment of the premium, except in so far as the receipt operated as an acknowledgment; no books, accounts or entries were produced to show the payment; no evidence of any appropriation for the purpose. The defendant then moved for judgment.\nThe insured and the agent to receive the premium and to give the receipt being the same person, it is obvious that, upon the question of actual payment, the mere production of a receipt signed by the district agent, who was also the insured and the beneficiary under the policy, if he survived his mother, if evidence at all, was of very little value. It was the duty of the agent to keep account of his receipts for the company, and to keep the moneys so received separate from his own. If then the premium had been paid to the district agent, or appropriated by him for the company, one would naturally expect to find trace of it in his accounts. Although no such evidence was produced, and the plaintiff\u2019s case rested solely upon the receipt, the learned judge, upon the motion for judgment intimated that he would not allow the motion without serious consideration, and the defendant\u2019s counsel, being unwilling to rest his case upon the material before the court, proceeded to call his witnesses.\nIt was proved for the defence that, on 1st September, 1923, the deceased was indebted to Mr. Willan, the company\u2019s general agent, in the sum of $648.32; that on 13th September, while the deceased was ill, Mr. Willan went to his house to assist him in the preparation of his report and statement for the preceding month; that a statement was then prepared showing $389.42 due for August premiums; that the deceased had not the money to pay the amount so due; but that he borrowed from the Canadian Bank of Commerce by discounting a note, the proceeds of which were credited to the deceased\u2019s bank account no. 1, and applied to the extent of $200 in payment of a cheque for that amount which the deceased gave to Mr. Willan on account, leaving a balance due of $189.42, which he promised to pay, saying that\nas soon as he got around he would be able to square the whole thing, not only that but the other amount that I owe as well.\nThe August statement did not include amounts payable to the general agent for premiums collected during June and July. Mr. Willan gave evidence that the total deficit when discovered was $1,343.30. It appeared that the deceased kept at the Canadian Bank of Commerce an account described as trust account no. 2, upon which he drew the cheques which he remitted to the general agent in payment of premiums collected. Senator Laird, the vice-president of the appellant company, testified that he had an interview with the deceased on 3rd April, 1923, when he instructed him\nthat all the company\u2019s business and all company funds should be done through a specific trust account for that purpose;\nthat the deceased told him that he already had a trust account that he called no, 1, but that he would open a trust account, no. 2, for the purpose of carrying the company\u2019s business, and Mr. Laird says he understood that this account would be opened in the Bank of Commerce. These bank accounts were produced; no. 1 begins on 31st March, 1923, and continues to the end of September, showing a credit balance of $11.29 on 17th September, 1923, the date of the last transaction, except a deposit of $31 on 3rd October. September opened with a credit balance of $1.36, and during that month were deposited $15 on the 1st, $50 on the 4th, $50 on the 5th, and $240.03, proceeds of discount, on the 14th. There is no evidence of the source of the three earlier deposits, amounting to $115. Trust account no, 2 was opened by a deposit of $336.75 on 4th May, 1923, the month following Mr. Laird\u2019s instructions. This account was active until 23rd July following, when it showed a balance of $1.42. There are no subsequent deposits or withdrawals shown upon this account. The bank manager explained that the deceased told him that his cheques might be charged to either account. It appeared that the deceased had sent to the; general agent cheques on account of monthly settlements for which there were not sufficient funds. Senator Laird testified that the first he heard of these was in June, and that the deceased was in arrears from that time until his death. Mr. Willan and Senator Laird proved the system of issuing and distributing the official receipts, including the one upon which the plaintiff relies. It was shown that these receipts were issued by the head office and sent to the general agent about two months before the premiums became due, and that, when received by the general agent, they were sent out by him to the district agents, with bills for the premiums; that the deceased\u2019s receipt was accordingly sent to him a month or two before the expiry of the days of grace. The head office at the time of forwarding these receipts also sent notices to the policyholders, informing them of the dates when their premiums became payable, and therefore, in ordinary course, the deceased would receive notice of the maturity of his premium about the time that his September billing, accompanied by the receipt forms, including his own, came to hand. It was through this process that the deceased came into possession of the receipt for the premium in question, signed by the president of the company, and there is no doubt that he countersigned that receipt, presumably on 1st September, because it bears no other date. The learned trial judge considered that the receipt was prima facie proof of payment which had not been refuted by the evidence which he describes as\nreferring to Baker\u2019s shortage in his accounts and his banking business,\nand that the burden was on the defendant to show that the payment acknowledged by the receipt had not been made. He reviewed the evidence as to the efforts made by Fred Baker on 29th September and 1st October to pay the premium to the sub-agent, Cook, or to Willan, and he finds\nthat Fred Baker was acting as agent for his brother, the insured, or his mother, the plaintiff, and that the tender (which he made to Willan on 2nd October) was good, although not made until one day after the expiration of the thirty days grace, either on the doctrine of estoppel or on the ground that the thirty days grace were extended by the actions of Willan;\nhe referred to Tattersall v. Peoples Life Assurance Co.[2]. He found moreover,\nthat Fred Baker did not send the premium to Regina solely on account of the assurance that Willan would be in Moose Jaw on October 1, and that he had not sent it to Regina on October 1, because he was assured that Willan would be in Moose Jaw on October 2. If the action of the defendant through Willan did not amount to an estoppel, then it seems to me there was an extension of the time for one day on account of Willan\u2019s actions and statements.\nHere it may be observed that if, as the learned judge found, Fred Baker, in his endeavours to pay the premium at the end of September and on 1st and 2nd October, was acting as agent for the insured or his mother, that fact is in direct conflict with any probability that the individual whose agent he was considered at the time that the premium had been paid on 1st September, the date of the receipt.\nIn the Court of Appeal Lamont J.A., who pronounced the judgment, having summarized the trial judgment, says that the evidence shews that it was a breach of the agent\u2019s duty to countersign and deliver a receipt for renewal of premium before he actually obtained the money; that a breach of duty will not be presumed; that the receipt was prima facie evidence of payment, because the deceased had authority to receive the premium and deliver the receipt to the insured, and that\nthe onus of displacing the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie proof of payment was on the defendants, and the question is, have they succeeded in establishing that the premium was not in fact paid by Baker to himself as agent of the company. The learned Justice of Appeal considered that the evidence did not shew that the premium had not been paid; he says that, although the contract required the insured to treat the moneys of the company as trust funds, Baker had in practice been permitted by Willan to retain out of his collections the amount to which he was entitled for commissions, and to remit the balance only; that, for the months of June, July and August, Baker had not been remitting the full amount of the balances shewn in his reports; that if therefore he had collections in his pocket, the use by him of that money, up to the amount coming to him for commissions, would appear to have been sanctioned by the existing practice, and that at any rate the evidence did not warrant a finding that\nBaker committed a breach of his duty by handing over to himself, as a policyholder, the receipt for payment of the premium without first having received the same.\nI have already shewn that the evidence of payment of the premium, if any, furnished by the facts which the plaintiff proved is of a very fragile character. The case is that the receipt was found in the plaintiff\u2019s room, which the insured had been using, and where he had been working with Mr. Willan upon his accounts; that his business papers had been brought there from his office; that the receipt when found was countersigned by the deceased, without whose signature it was expressed not to be binding, and that the receipt was not with the policy, although the policy was also in the room. It is the inference to be drawn from these facts which constitutes the alleged prima facie case of the plaintiff; but, whatever might otherwise have been the strength of this proof, it has to be considered with the evidence subsequently adduced by the defendant company in its defence, where it is shewn, as appears from the foregoing narrative, that the insured was in default in payment of premiums collected in June, July and August; that his bank balances had been found deficient and that payment of his cheques had been refused in consequence; that the balances to the credit of his two bank accounts on 1st September were only $1.36 and $1.42 respectively; that there was no deposit to the credit of either account which could be identified as including the premium in question; that on 13th September, when the deceased, with Willan\u2019s assistance, prepared his August statement, he could not pay the premiums, amounting to $389.42, which he had collected for that month, and that the $200 which he paid on account were borrowed from the bank; that the combined balances in both accounts at the end of the accounting period of September amounted to only $12.71; that the state of the accounts was inconsistent with any right to make deductions for commissions; that the receipt forms signed by the president of the company, including Baker\u2019s, were sent to the district agent for collection, and that his possession of the receipt in question was therefore no evidence in itself that he had paid his premium. There was no suggestion of any record, credit, entry or note of the payment. It was of course the duty of the insured, as agent, to keep separate the company\u2019s money, and to have a just account of his receipts, and agency transactions always available for the information of his principal. Guerreiro v. Peile[3], Clarke v. Tipping[4]. In Gray v. Haig[5], the Master of the Rolls said:\u2014\nIt cannot, however, be too generally known or understood, amongst all persons dealing with each other, in the character of principal and agent, how severely this court deals with any irregularities on the part of the agent, how strictly it requires that he who is the person trusted shall act, in all matters relating to such agency, for the benefit of his principal, and how imperative it is upon him to preserve correct accounts of all his dealings and transactions in that respect.\nIt is suggested by the judgment on appeal that \u201cBaker had collections in his pocket.\u201d That is mere conjecture, but, if he had the money wherewith to pay his premium, that does not, in the absence of other requisite evidence, establish the appropriation or payment of it to his principal\u2019s account.\nIn view of these facts, it is, I think, impossible, having regard to the weight of evidence, to find that the premium was paid. At best there is only some evidence of payment. Although ordinarily a receipt is prima facie proof of payment, here it is very questionable that, having regard to the facts and circumstances which accompanied the proof of the receipt, it could be taken as any evidence, still less as affording sufficient weight or probability to make prima facie proof. In any event I would have thought that any inference of payment which was admissible upon the plaintiff\u2019s case was overborne by the facts established for the defence.\nBut the fatal infirmity of the judgment consists in the misdirection that the onus of proof of the issue as to payment of the premium was, by the production of the receipt, shifted to the defendant, upon whom it thereafter devolved to establish that the premium had not been paid. On the contrary the burden of proving the affirmative of that issue rested upon the plaintiff uninterruptedly from the beginning to the end of the case. If, as the learned judges hold, the receipt, which was the plaintiff\u2019s exhibit, should be regarded as prima facie evidence of payment, and if, in the plaintiff\u2019s case, as rested at the trial, there was no evidence to negative or to disparage the presumption of payment arising from the possession of the receipt, then there was at that stage a burden upon the defendant to adduce evidence in answer to the prima facie proof\u2014a burden which I think was amply satisfied; but the plaintiff had propounded the allegation that the premium was paid and the burden always rested upon her to establish that issue. Then, if at the end of the case the learned judge who tried the facts were left in uncertainty as to how the issue should be found, it was not the defendant who should have suffered; the trial judge ought rather to have regarded the receipt simply as one fact in the case, upon which there was no attendant or consequential shifting of the burden to prove the issue, and to be considered not otherwise than as a part or incident of the whole body of the evidence. Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co.[6], Smith v. Nevins[7], per Duff J. The truth is that the judgments have confounded two different rules connected with proof which for the justice of the case it is necessary to distinguish, namely, the rule which requires that the burden of establishing an issue of which the proof is essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case shall rest upon the plaintiff, and the rule applicable to the condition which arises in the course of a trial, when a stage has been reached at which there is prima facie proof or presumption of the truth of an allegation, which ought therefore to be found true in the absence of further evidence; and this confusion has resulted in a finding which, I have no doubt, the evidence as a whole does not justify.\nIt remains to consider briefly the view expressed by the learned trial judge that the conversations which took place on 29th September and 1st October between Fred Baker, Mr. Cook, the sub-agent of the defendant company at Moose Jaw, and Mr. Willan, the general agent at Regina, operated either to estop the defendant company from denying the payment of the premium, or as an extension of the time for payment until 2nd October, when it was actually tendered by Fred Baker to Willan. It is clear that neither Cook nor Willan had any authority to extend the time for payment, and not only that, but Mr. Willan was expressly instructed in the documents defining his agency that renewal premiums were not to be received after the expiry of the days of grace, unless the policy were revived upon proof satisfactory to the company; and moreover, the evidence upon which the plaintiff relies to establish estoppel is lacking in the requisite elements. To mention only one particular, the information which Mr. Willan communicated to Mr. Cook by telephone, to the effect that he would be at Moose Jaw on 1st October, can justly be regarded as no more than a statement of intention, which, although not executed, did not lay the foundation for estoppel.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs both in this court and in the Court of Appeal, and the action should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gordon & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Haig & Haig.\n[1] [1925] 19 Sask.

Motion granted with costs.\nThe plaintiff claims to be the owner of lands in the township of Magog, in the province of Quebec, abutting on Lake Memphremagog and complains that the defendant company, as owner of certain dams at the outlet of the lake, has by its use and maintenance, injured her property by flooding and undermining the bank of the lake, and claims over $2,000. The plaintiff seeks an injunction as well as damages. The defendant company, besides denying all the plaintiff\u2019s allegations except its ownership of the dam, sets up in paragraphs four and five the following pleas:\n4. That dams or constructions at the point in question have existed since the year 1835, and have moreover existed at the same elevation since the year 1882, the dam erected in that year having been carried away in 1915. The said dam or construction was replaced by a temporary dam erected in the same year which was replaced by the present dam in the year 1920 and 1921, all of which dams or constructions had approximately the same elevation.\n5. So far from having caused the waters in the said lake to rise beyond their normal and usual height, defendant\u2019s autorus, by means of removing certain obstructions from the outlet of the said lake, and enlarging its sluice openings, prevented the waters in the said lake from rising to their normal height at times of freshets. The defendant also by other pleas alleges that the plaintiff owing to the situation of the land in question, and by her own neglect, is herself the author of the damage in question, and finally by paragraph 9 claims that the action is prescribed. The plaintiff inscribed in law against paragraphs four and five, alleging that they did not constitute in law valid reasons in support of the defendant\u2019s conclusion, asking for the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action and on other grounds. The matter of inscription came up before a judge of the Superior Court who maintained the inscription in law and ordered the two paragraphs struck from the defence. The defendant company appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.\nThe defendant company, having appealed to this court, made a motion before the Registrar for an order affirming the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the appeal. The Registrar having refused to grant the order, the defendant company made a motion before the court by way of appeal from that decision.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel, granted the motion with costs and affirmed its jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, holding that the judgment appealed from was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of par. e of s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act.\nMotion granted with costs.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for motion.\nA.

The company resisted the claim on the ground that the assured had answered falsely to the question whether he was, at the time of the issue of the policy and for some years before, of sober and temperate habits. The policy contained a clause to the effect that the declarations made by the assured were, in the absence of fraud, to be considered as representations, and not as warranties.\nHeld that, according to the law of Quebec, the onus rests upon the insurer to establish misrepresentation of a fact of a nature \u201cto diminish the appreciation of the risk or to change the object of it\u201d and further, that he was induced to enter into the contract by such misrepresentation.\nHeld, also, that the appellant company had not sufficiently discharged the onus of establishing that the assured was not of sober and temperate habits.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 38, K.B. 529) aff.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and Prud\u2019homme K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal is concerned with a claim by the respondent bank as the assignee of a policy of insurance on the life of the late Joseph Emile Octave Morin, who died at some date between October, 1920, and April, 1921. The appellant company resisted the claim on the ground that the applicant\u2019s answer to one of the questions in the application was untrue. The question was:\u2014\nAvez-vous maintenant et avez-vous toujours eu des habitudes de sobri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de temp\u00e9rance?\nand to this, the applicant answered \u201cOui.\u201d\nThe policy contains a clause to the effect that the declarations made by the assured are, in the absence of fraud, to be considered as representations, and not as warranties. The effect of such a clause was considered in Kiernan v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.[2], and the result of the examination of the law there is that in the province of Quebec the onus rests upon the insurer to establish misrepresentation of a fact of a nature\nto diminish the appreciation of the risk or to change the object of it,\nand further, that he was induced to enter into the contract by such misrepresentation.\nThe learned trial judge, applying himself to the issues of fact, first, whether the representation complained of was an untrue statement of fact; second, whether, if untrue, it was calculated to \u201cdiminish the appreciation of the risk,\u201d expresses himself satisfied that the assured, Morin, had enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his fellow-citizens; that he had always \u201cpass\u00e9,\u201d first, in his village of St. Jean Port Joli, and afterwards at Vilmontel and Amos,\ncomme un homme ayant plutot des habitudes de temp\u00e9rance ou sobri\u00e9t\u00e9;\nthat it had not been established, and indeed that there was nothing to shew that his representations on this subject were calculated to diminish the appreciation of the risk; and that Morin might honestly have made the representations complained of. Nevertheless, after observing upon the difficulty of drawing the line of demarcation between people who can be described as being sober and temperate and those whose habits fall within the description \u201cintemperate,\u201d he would not be disposed to say either that Morin\u2019s habits were those of sobriety and temperance or that he was an habitual drunkard.\nThe appreciation of the findings of the learned trial judge is, perhaps, a task of a little delicacy. His view, I think, may not unjustly be summed up thus: Morin was a man given to the habitual moderate use of intoxicating liquor, and at times to the excessive use of it. He was classed by his neighbours and by those familiar with his life as a man rather temperate in his habits, and although\u2019 strictly the learned trial judge himself was not disposed to characterize his habits as \u201csober and temperate,\u201d he considered that the departure from accuracy in the statement of the assured was not sufficiently serious to prejudice an insurer in his appreciation of the risk; in other words, if a reasonable insurer had known the facts as the learned judge conceived them to be, the judgment of the insurer would not thereby have been influenced adversely to the application.\nIn the Court of King\u2019s Bench, three of the learned judges appear to have taken the view that in substance there was no misrepresentation. One, Mr. Justice Green-shields, expresses no opinion as to the proper characterization of Morin\u2019s habits, but finds as a fact that, assuming there was misrepresentation, the company was not induced thereby to issue a policy. The fifth of the learned judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Mr. Justice Howard, thought the company was entitled to succeed on the ground that, although at the time the policy was issued, and for several years before, Morin had been of sober and temperate habits, such epithets could not properly be applied to his habits at an earlier period\u2014in 1913, 1914 and 1915\u2014when he was a member of the Quebec legislature; and on that ground, as well as on the ground that the representations constituted warranties, he dissented from the judgment of the court.\nThe question addressed to Morin had relation to his habits. Occasional excess is not necessarily, within the meaning of the words employed, inconsistent with an affirmation that the habits of the applicant are temperate, and, in applying the standard indicated by the question, as the Law Lords pointed out in Weins v. Standard Life[3]. it would be useless to attempt a precise definition of such terms. What would be excess in one might be moderation in another. Differences in the capacity for imbibing strong drink are such that quantity does not in itself necessarily afford a test. Then, as Lord Watson says, at p. 797, in judging of a man\u2019s sobriety for the purposes of applying such a standard, his occupation and position in life and the habits of those among whom he lives and works must always be taken into account.\nThere is virtual unanimity in the Court of King\u2019s Bench upon the character of Morin\u2019s habits at the time the policy was issued and for some years before. In support of this view, there is a very weighty body of evidence, and of special weight is the evidence given by the agent of the respondent bank at Amos, Rivard. It was Rivard\u2019s duty, and he says he was exact in discharging that duty, to report to his head office upon the habits of the customers of the bank, if there was anything in those habits worthy of remark. Morin was one of his customers, and although he was in the habit of drinking in moderation, Rivard considered him on the whole a temperate, hard-working man. He had made two reports upon him, the second of which he produced, and in which there was no reference to Morin\u2019s habits. The first report, fifteen months earlier, was not produced, and he was unable to speak positively as to its contents, but said that if there had been any reference to Morin\u2019s habits in the first report, it probably would have been repeated in the second. Rivard may properly be considered a witness not wholly disinterested, but his testimony as to Morin\u2019s habits is corroborated by the nature of his reports to the head office, and to his evidence importance must be attached.\nTo the same effect is the evidence of Dr. Bigu\u00e9, the respondent company\u2019s medical examiner at Amos, of Joseph Germain, the respondent company\u2019s local agent, and of Mons. Par\u00e9, a King\u2019s Counsel there; and this evidence is supported by that of other respectable witnesses.\nAs against this evidence, there is testimony given by one witness, a total abstainer, and obviously not without bias,-and by another who, admittedly, was not on friendly terms with Morin during his lifetime. The testimony of these two witnesses cannot be reconciled with the other evidence as to Morin\u2019s habits, during the period of which they speak, nor can it be reconciled with the learned trial judge\u2019s finding, as to Morin\u2019s reputation in Vilmontel and in Amos. There is really no sound juridical reason for rejecting the testimony of those witnesses who aver that, during his residence at Vilmontel, Morin was not a man of intemperate habits within the contemplation of the question.\nMuch more serious was the attack made upon Morin\u2019s habits at an earlier period; that is to say, from 1912 to 1915; during the greater part of which period he was a member of the Quebec legislature. The most important witnesses called by the appellant company were Lavall\u00e9e and Roy. As to these witnesses, Lavall\u00e9e is obviously unreliable. As for the evidence of Roy, who was the barkeeper at the Mountain Hill hotel in Quebec, it must be contrasted with that of Fortin, who was the owner of the hotel, who knew Morin intimately, and declares that his use of liquor was moderate. On this statement, Fortin was not cross-examined.\nThe evidence of both these witnesses, Lavall\u00e9e and Roy, must, moreover, be appraised in light of the finding of the learned trial judge, that there was nothing in the evidence to shew that any departure from strict accuracy in Morin\u2019s answers was calculated to diminish the company\u2019s appreciation of the risk. The learned trial judge rightly emphasized the fact that the company was informed that Morin indulged in the moderate use of liquor, and the conduct of the company in accepting the risk with this knowledge may properly be regarded as satisfactory evidence that such a use of intoxicants would not necessarily be incompatible with temperate habits, within the meaning of the application, as understood by the company. The learned trial judge\u2019s finding, coupled with his findings as to Morin\u2019s reputation at the village at which he lived during the same period, seem to shew that the learned judge did not consider that the evidence of these witnesses could be accepted without substantial qualification, and that this evidence, in so far as he accepted it, did not, in his view, justify the conclusion that, in the answer complained of, Morin had fallen into any serious misrepresentation.\nThe judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench ought not to be disturbed. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion prepared by my brother Duff. I fully concur in his view that the evidence sufficiently establishes that the habits of the insured at the time the policy was issued and for some years before were sober and temperate. But the evidence as to the earlier period, 1913-15, is far from satisfactory. That the insured\u2019s habits were then those of a sober and temperate man is in my opinion not established. A very slight addition to the evidence adduced by the defendant would, I think, warrant the determination of this issue in the negative and, if it had been proven that during that period the insured was not a man of sober and temperate habits, I should hesitate long before regarding the misrepresentation thus shewn as not material in the sense indicated in Kiernan\u2019s case. But the burden of convincing the Court that the deceased was not of sober and temperate habits rested on the defendant. Not being entirely satisfied with the proof adduced to discharge that onus, I concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foster, Mann, Place, MacKinnon, Hackett & Mulvena.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Prud\u2019homme.\n[1] [1925] Q.R. 38, K.B. 529.\n[2] [1925] S.C.R. 600, at pp. 602, 603 and 604.\n[3] 21 Scot.

Negotiations took place, resulting, as the parties believed, in a settlement, the action begun by the college was dismissed by consent and the city took possession and constructed the street which became an important thoroughfare. A board of arbitrators was appointed, as had been agreed, to fix the amount of compensation to the college, but the parties, on appearing before it, were unable to agree as to the principle upon which compensation was to be assessed under the settlement agreement, and in the result the college brought this action, asking for specific performance of the agreement as it conceived and alleged it to be, and alternatively a judgment setting aside the consent order dismissing its former action, on the ground that the order was founded upon a supposed agreement which had never, in fact, been concluded. At trial Riddell J. held the agreement had been made on the terms asserted by the college and was binding on the city. The Appellate Division varied this judgment, holding that, as the parties had differently understood what the terms of the agreement were, they were never ad idem, there had, therefore, been no agreement, and as, under the circumstances, the parties could not be restored to their former position, what had been done should stand and the city should compensate the college on certain basis laid down (see statement of the case infra) and directed a reference to the Master. The college appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, that although there were disputes in certain respects as to the terms of the agreement, both parties understood that the college was to be fairly compensated; if there was no agreement the college must be compensated on equitable terms; so in the practical result it mattered little whether the right to compensation was considered as springing out of a specific agreement or resting upon equitable considerations; fair compensation would include payment of the value of the lands taken, not necessarily limited to the market value, but the value to the college in view of the purposes for which the land was used, and to which it had been dedicated; also compensation for any loss in respect of the diminution in value to the college of the remaining property in view of the purposes for which the property was in use or had been dedicated, whether caused by the construction or maintenance of the street or the severance of the lands taken; also indemnity for any loss consequent upon changes necessitated by the severance of the lands taken, such, for example, as the destruction and re-erection of buildings, in so far as this head of compensation was not included under the next preceding head; the value of the lands taken and the diminution in value of the property retained should be ascertained as of the date when the city took possession, and interest should be allowed from that date.\nThe judgment also provided for the closing of a certain street under certain conditions, and of a lane, and conveyance to the college, as had been agreed; for certain allowances to the city; and for assessment of compensation by the board of arbitrators which had been already constituted. It not having been explicitly agreed that the city should bear the expense of providing additional lands for the site of an Arts College, the question whether the cost of re-instatement in that sense would be a proper measure, in whole or in part, of the loss caused by the construction and maintenance of the street opened by the city must be one for the arbitrators. The difficulties usually attending an action to compel specific performance of an agreement to refer to arbitration did not arise. The action was strictly an action founded upon the equity vested in the college, in consequence of the acceptance of possession by the city and its subsequent acts, to have the terms upon which possession was given carried into effect. In such a case, the absence of statutory formalities touching the evidence of those terms is not an answer, as it would be in a common law action\u2014for services, for example, as in McKay v. Toronto ([1920] A.C. 208)\u2014and the court will not hesitate to exert its powers as far as possible to see that the agreement is carried out, even though some of its terms should not be susceptible of enforcement by process in personam. Wilverhampton & Walsall Ry. Co. v. London & N.W. Ry. Co. (L.R. 16, Eq. 433). In view of the fact that the board of arbitrators had been constituted, it was a proper case for a declaratory judgment.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff college from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, dated June 27, 1925, varying the judgment of Riddell J., the trial judge, dated June 9, 1924, in favour of the college.\nThe city of Toronto (defendant, respondent) had provided by by-law for a certain street extension and for the expropriation of part of the land occupied by the college lying on the line of projected extension. After certain communications had taken place between the city\u2019s assessment commissioner and the college, the city proposed to take expropriation proceedings, whereupon the college, which is a \u201cfederated college\u201d associated with the University of Toronto, relying upon the exemption from compulsory taking of real property of federated colleges created by s. 15 of the University Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 279, sued to restrain the city from interfering with its possession and enjoyment of its lands, and procured an interim injunction, which was dissolved upon an undertaking by the city to expedite the trial. Negotiations were resumed, resulting, as the parties believed, in an agreement of settlement, the action begun by the college was dismissed by consent, and the city went into possession and constructed the street (now known as Bay street), which became an important thoroughfare. A board of arbitrators was appointed, as had been agreed, to fix the amount of compensation to the college, but the parties, on appearing before it, were unable to agree as to the principle upon which compensation was to be assessed, the college contending, and the city denying, that certain letters between Rev. Father Carr, acting for the college, and the city\u2019s assessment commissioner formed part of the settlement agreement, and the arbitration, therefore, did not proceed. The college then brought this action, asking for specific performance of the agreement as it conceived and alleged it to be, and alternatively a judgment setting aside the consent order dismissing the former action, on the ground that the order was founded upon a supposed agreement which had never, in fact, been concluded.\nThe trial judge, Riddell J., gave judgment for the college, declaring that the agreement had been made on the terms asserted by it and was binding on the city. He also held that the college land was not liable to expropriation by the city, his holding in this respect being not disturbed on appeal and its soundness not contested upon the present appeal.\nUpon appeal by the city the judgment of Riddell J., was varied by the Appellate Division, which held (under its formal judgment based on reasons of the majority of the court, certain varying views being expressed on certain questions), that the former action was dismissed under a mistaken belief of both parties that a settlement had been agreed upon, the college believing that the city had assented to the terms stipulated for by the college and the city believing that the college had assented to the terms stipulated for by the city, whereas the parties were never ad idem; that in the belief aforesaid the parties delivered possession of certain lands and made changes, alterations and expenditures thereon and on the remaining lands of the college; that the parties could not be restored to their former position, and that what had been done should stand; the city should retain the lands possession of which had been delivered to it by the college; the college should retain the land formerly part of a certain lane which the city had closed and given to it; that the college was entitled to receive from the city by way of compensation for the lands possession of which was delivered to the city, the market value thereof on November 11, 1921 (the date of taking possession) and interest thereon from that date, and such damages, if any, as it sustained by reason of the severance of the said land from the remaining lands of the college, or by reason of the remaining lands of the college being in- juriously affected by reason of the city\u2019s public work for the purposes of which the lands of the college were taken, less the value of any benefit or advantage which the college had derived or might derive from the said public work for which the lands were taken, and less the value of the land formerly part of the lane aforesaid, and less the value to the college of any changes, alterations and expenditures made by the city on the remaining lands of the college or on the buildings and erections thereon. A reference was directed to the Master to inquire and report on the amount of compensation. The college appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nN.W. Rowell K.C. for the appellant.\nG.R. Geary K.C. and W.G. Angus for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014In 1920, by-laws were passed by the proper authority of the respondent corporation, providing for the extension northward of Terauley street and for the expropriation of part of the land occupied by the appellant college between Ste. Mary and St. Joseph streets lying on the line of the projected extension. Communications took place between the college and the respondent\u2019s assessment commissioner first on the subject of a possible deviation, in order to avoid any interference with the college property, and afterwards, that being abandoned, on the subject of compensation to the college. Some months after the opening of these communications, the corporation announced that it would proceed in the ordinary way, under the expropriation by-law, to take possession of so much of the college property as might be necessary to allow the street extension to proceed. Thereupon, the college, which is a \u201cfederated college,\u201d associated with the University of Toronto within the meaning of the University Act, R.S.O. 279, took proceedings, relying upon the exemption from compulsory taking of real property of such federated colleges created by s. 15 of that statute, and procured an interim injunction, which was dissolved upon an undertaking by the corporation to expedite the trial. Negotiations having been resumed, by consent the action was dismissed, and the corporation went into possession, and since then the street has been constructed according to the projected plan, and, with the usual concomitants of a city thoroughfare (including two tramway lines), is now and has been for some time in use as a highway.\nThe dismissal of the action and the entry upon the college lands were concurred in by both parties under the belief that they had agreed upon the terms of a complete settlement. One of the stipulations about which there was no dispute was that the question of compensation was to be passed upon by three arbitrators, one of whom, the chairman, was to be Sir Thomas White, the others to be appointed by the College and the corporation respectively. These appointments having been made and the board having been duly constituted, the parties, upon appearing before it, were unable to agree as to the principle upon which compensation was to be assessed under the arrangement, and in the result the action out of which this appeal arose was brought, in which the college prayed specific performance of its agreement with the corporation as it conceived and alleged it to be, and alternatively, a judgment setting aside the consent order dismissing its former action, on the ground that the order was founded upon a supposed agreement which had never, in fact, been concluded.\nAs already mentioned, the first action of the college was founded upon the contention that, being a \u201cfederated college,\u201d associated with the University of Toronto, the corporation, by force of the enactments of the University Act, was debarred from taking any part of its lands compulsorily; and the soundness of this position was not contested upon the appeal before us. Without the assent of the college, therefore, the assumption of possession by the corporation would have been wrongful. Possession, however, was assumed, and, under the belief that a valid assent had been given, works were constructed which have become affected with a public interest, and private rights have been acquired on the faith of the permanence of the altered situation, and it is not now suggested that restoration to the College of the property taken would be a practicable or permissible solution of the difficulties that have arisen. But the maintenance of the status quo necessarily involves one of two consequences; either the corporation must carry out the agreement under which it entered, if there was such an agreement, or, if there was none, the college must be compensated on equitable terms, in view of the prejudice its interests have suffered in consequence of the extension of the street.\nThe college puts its case alternatively, but in the practical result it would appear to matter little whether the right to compensation is considered as springing out of a specific agreement or resting upon equitable considerations. Up to a certain point, there is little room for dispute. The burden of the communications between the parties is that the college is to be fairly compensated. Proposals as to specific methods for reaching this end are put forward, and are in part or wholly rejected, but there is nothing in the communications to suggest that the college ever abandoned this position, or that on part of the corporation the college was supposed to have abandoned it. The college authorities were trustees of the college property. They were masters of the situation in a legal sense, and, while a stiff and uncompromising stand on the apex juris, with the possibility of an acrimonious discussion, would no doubt have been distasteful, and possibly inadvisable in the larger interests of the college, still it was their duty to protect the College patrimony, not to set up extortionate or extravagant claims, but, on the other hand, to require just and reasonable compensation. The corporation must have recognized this, and no doubt did so, and Mr. Forman\u2019s report, construed in light of the information in his possession and in that of the Board of Control, as to Father Carr\u2019s attitude, and of the subsequent conduct of the parties, seems to be fairly capable of a reading in harmony with this.\nFair compensation would include payment of the value of the land taken, not necessarily limited to the market value but the value to the college in view of the purposes for which the land was used, and to which it had been dedicated. It would also include compensation for any loss in respect of the diminution in the value to the college of the remaining property in view of the purposes for which the property was in use or had been dedicated, whether caused by construction or maintenance of the street or the severance of the lands taken. It would also include indemnity in respect of any loss consequent upon changes in the college grounds or in the property purchased for an arts college site necessitated by the severance of the lands taken, such, for example, as the destruction and re-erection of buildings, in so far as this head of compensation is not included under the next preceding head.\nThe value of the lands taken and the diminution in value of the property retained should be ascertained as of the date when possession was taken by the corporation, the 11th of November, 1921, and interest should be allowed from that date. It was specifically agreed that the northerly 315 feet of the lane bounding the old college grounds on the west, running from St. Mary street to St. Joseph street, should be closed, and possession of the site delivered to the college. This, apparently, has been done. It was also a term of the agreement that in the event of the college acquiring the property on both sides of Elmsley Place, the corporation would close that street, and the residue of the lane above mentioned, extending from St. Joseph street to St. Mary street, both parcels to be conveyed to the college.\nIt was also specifically agreed that the corporation should pay the difference in value between the lands taken and such part of the lands acquired by the college for the site of an arts college as it might be obliged to use for any extension of its playgrounds to the west caused by the severance, if the value to the college of the property required for this extension were found to be greater than the value of the property taken by the corporation. This item, however, would appear to be sufficiently provided for by the second of the heads of compensation already mentioned.\nThere seems to be no obstacle in the way of giving effect to what appears to have been in substance the understanding between the parties as to the terms upon which possession was to be taken. As already stated, one term of the arrangement was that compensation should be assessed by a board of three arbitrators, and the members of the board have been appointed, and the board has been daily constituted. The difficulties usually attending an action to compel specific performance of an agreement to refer to arbitration do not arise. The action is strictly an action founded upon the equity vested in the college, in consequence of the acceptance of possession by the corporation and its subsequent acts, to have the terms upon which possession was given carried into effect. In such a case, the absence of statutory formalities touching the evidence of those terms is not an answer, as it would be in a common law action\u2014for services, for example, as in McKay v. Toronto[1] \u2014and the court will not hesitate to exert its powers as far as possible to see that the agreement is carried out, even although some of its terms should not be capable of enforcement by process in personam. Wolverhampton v. Walsall[2]. In view of the fact that the board of arbitrators has been constituted, it seems a proper case for a declaratory judgment.\nIt may prove to be a task of delicacy and difficulty to ascertain the value to the college of the lands taken and the diminution in value of the property retained, whether caused by the severance or by the construction and maintenance of the street; it will be for the arbitrators to decide what that value or diminution in value is, in so far as it can be appraised in pecuniary terms with reasonable certainty.\nTo prevent misconception, it should be stated that it was no part of the explicit understanding between the parties that the corporation should bear the expense of providing additional lands for the site of an arts college. Whether the cost of reinstatement in that sense would be a proper measure, in whole or in part, of the loss caused by the construction and maintenance of Terauley street, must be a question for the arbitrators.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division should be varied in accordance with the subjoined minute. The appellant college to have the costs of the action and of the appeal to this Court; the corporation to have the costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nJUDGMENT:\nDeclare that the corporation took possession under an agreement (a) that, in the event of the college acquiring the property on both sides of Elmsley Place, as shewn on plan 65-e, the corporation should close the street known as Elmsley Place and, likewise, the balance of the lane to the east extending northerly from St. Joseph street to connect with the lane to be closed southerly from St. Mary street, a distance of three hundred and fifteen feet, both parcels to be conveyed to the College free of cost; and (b) that the college was to be compensated for the loss caused by the construction and maintenance of Terauley street, through the college property, such compensation to be determined by a board of arbitrators, which has since been constituted. Declare that such compensation ought to include:\u2014\n(1) Compensation in respect of the value to the college of the land taken.\n(2) Compensation in respect of the diminution in value to the college of the college property retained by it, including the lands recently acquired for an arts college site, caused by the construction and maintenance of Terauley street, and by the severance of the lands taken, allowance to be made for the value of the site of the lane vested in the college and of any beneficial expenditures made by the corporation on the college grounds.\n(3) Interest on the sums allowed in respect of the two preceding heads of compensation from the 11th of November, 1921.\n(4) Indemnity in respect of loss incurred in consequence of the removal of buildings and erections, and otherwise in alterations in the college property necessitated by the severance of the lands taken, in so far as this is not allowed for under the second head above mentioned. Further directions reserved, and all parties to have liberty to apply.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division is to be varied in accordance with this minute.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Day, Ferguson & Walsh.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.M.

The agreement for sale contained the following covenant: \"The purchasers covenant with the vendor that they will pay to the vendor the said sum ***.\" The agreement also contained the following clause: \"The terms ' vendor' and ' purchasers' in this agreement shall include the executors, administrators and assigns of each of them.\" P. sued F. with A. and W. A. M., W. M's. executors, for the balance of the purchase price, alleging that the covenant was a joint and several covenant, or, alternatively, that F. and W. M. were partners in the purchase of the land and therefore jointly and severally liable.\nHeld that the covenant was in form joint and not several and that W.M's. executors were not liable. White v. Tyndall (13 App. Cas. 263) foll.\nHeld, also, that although the property was bought by F. and W.M. with the intention of turning it over at a profit, there was no evidence from which to infer an agreement in the juridical sense that the property was to be held as partnership property.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia reversing the judgment of the trial court and dismissing the plaintiff's action as against the respondents.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nD. Donaghy and J. F. Smellie for the appellant.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014I see no reason to differ from the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal founded on the authority of White v. Tyndall[1], that the covenant in question, assuming there was no partnership, is a joint covenant. The argument based upon the stipulation in the agreement that \"vendor\" and \"purchasers\" in the agreement shall include the executors, administrators and assigns of each of them, is conclusively answered by the observations of Lord Herschell at pp. 276 and 277.\nThe question raised by the allegation of the appellants that the debt sued upon is a partnership debt, presents more room for controversy. Foster and Miller unquestionably intended to buy the property, to sell it again at an enhanced price, and thereby to make profit. Indeed, the sole object of purchasing the land was to dispose of it profitably. No doubt they intended to share the outlay equally between them. As regards the purchase money, the law would, of course, give to either of them a right of contribution against the other for any payment on the joint debt in excess of his own proper share, and on a sale, each would be entitled to share in the price according to his interest. The inevitable result, if the property was held in common and sold, would be that, as between Foster and Miller themselves, the right to share in the profits and the legal responsibility for losses would be equally distributed. But these consequences all flow from the fact that these two persons were jointly responsible for the purchase money, and that each was entitled to an undivided moiety in the equitable estate vested in them, as the result of the contract of purchase.\nPartnership, it is needless to say, does not arise from ownership in common, or from joint ownership. Partnership arises from contract, evidenced either by express declaration or by conduct signifying the same thing. It is not sufficient there should be community of interest; there must be contract. In the first chapter of Story's book on Partnership, there is this passage:\u2014\nIn short, every partnership is founded on a community of interest; but every community of interest does not constitute a partnership; or, as Duranton expresses it: \"La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aussi produit une communaut\u00e9; en un mot, toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est bien une communaut\u00e9; mais toute communaut\u00e9 n'est point une soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il faut pour cela la volont\u00e9 des parties.\"\nThe Roman law has recognized the same distinction: \"Ut sit pro socio actio, societatem intercedere oportet: nec enim sufficit rem esse communem, nisi societas intercedit. Communiter autem res agi potest etiam citra societatem; ut puta, cum non affectione societatis incidimus in communionem, ut evenit in re duobus legata; item si a duobus simul empta res sit; aut si hereditas vel donatio communiter nobis obvenit; aut si a duobus separatim emimus partes eorum, non socii juturi. Nam cum tractatu habito societas coita est, pro socio actio est; cum sine tractatu in re ipsa et negotio, communiter gestum videtur.\" And again: \" Qui nolunt inter se contendere, solent per nuntium rem emere in commune, quod a societate longe remotum est!\"\nPothier's comment on the words \" si a duobus simul empta res sit \" is this: \" Scilicet non animo contrahendae societatis \" 17 Pand. II. 30 n.\nThe real question is whether, from the evidence before us, one ought to infer an agreement in the juridical sense that the property these two persons intended dealing with was to be held jointly as partnership property, and sold as such. Is this what they contemplated? Had they in their minds a binding agreement which would disable either of them from dealing with his share\u2014that is to say, with his share in the land itself\u2014as his own separate property? A common intention that each should be at liberty to deal with his undivided interest in the land as his own would obviously be incompatible with an intention that both should be bound to treat the corpus as the joint property, the property of a partnership. English law does not regard a partnership as a persona in the legal sense. Nevertheless, the property of the partnership is not divisible among the partners in specie. The partner's right is a right to a division of profits according to the special arrangement, and as regards the corpus, to a sale and division of the proceeds on dissolution after the discharge of liabilities. This right, a partner may assign, but he cannot transfer to another an undivided interest in the partnership property in specie.\nNow Foster's arrangement with MacDonald was obviously not a transfer of a partner's right to his share of the profits, nor did it involve the introduction of MacDonald by agreement with Miller, as a partner in Miller's place. Nothing in the correspondence points to this. And I cannot accept Mr. Donaghy's contention that the transfer to MacDonald was a transfer resulting from an understanding between Foster and Miller. Miller's letters indicate very clearly, and in Foster's evidence there is nothing inconsistent with this, that both Miller and Foster as- sumed that Foster was entitled to assign his interest in the property. It is true, no doubt, that in the special circumstances under which Miller advanced the funds for the first payment, Miller had, as between himself and Foster, a lien on Foster's undivided interest for the amount of the advance; a lien which, it may be (the evidence is not sufficiently explicit to enable one to form an opinion upon the point), was, as against MacDonald and his creditors, displaced by the operation of the Land Registry Act, although I think it quite probable that it was not. But this lien was not a partner's lien. It was a lien in the nature of salvage, which the law vests in one co\u2014owner, who advances money at the request of the other to make a payment to save or protect the common property. The fair conclusion from all the facts appears to be that the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal were right in their view, that a partnership was not constituted.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Sydney Child.\nSolicitor for the respondents: E. A. Boyle.\nSolicitor for the defendant: E. A. Dickie.\n[1] 13 A.C. 263.\n"

Act ss. 92 (2), 125.\nThe Halifax city charter provided for the levying of a \u201cbusiness tax,\u201d which should be \u201cpayable by every occupier of any real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, except such as is exempt * * * and shall be payable by the occupier whether as owner, tenant or otherwise, and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\u201d The tax was based on the value of the premises occupied. S. 394 provided: \u201cExcept as is herein otherwise provided, if any property is let to the Crown or to any person, corporation or association exempt from taxation, such property shall be deemed to be in the occupation of the owner thereof for business or residential purposes as the case may be, and he shall be assessed and rated for household tax or business tax according to the purpose for which it is occupied.\u201d\nThe appellant estate leased to His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, premises for a ticket office of the Canadian National Railways. The lessee was to pay \u201cthe business taxes, if any.\u201d The city assessed the appellant estate for business tax.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, reversing the decisions of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (57 N.S.R. 461), (which divided equally) and of Rogers J., that the appellant estate was not liable for the tax; that the tax made payable by the owner by force of s. 394 of the city charter was an indirect tax and not within provincial powers given by s. 92 (2) of the B.N.A. Act.\nA tax is indirect which is imposed upon a person in contemplation that another will pay it; the intention or expectation that the burden will be shifted may be shown by the form in which the tax is imposed, or may be ascertained by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies; in the present case it could not be supposed that the legislature expected that the person upon whom the tax was imposed would ultimately bear it; the landlord was put in the position of the tenant because the tenant was exempt, and made responsible for the taxes levied for the use of the premises by the tenant for the business purposes for which they were leased, from which it must be anticipated that the taxes would be passed on to the tenant as part of the rent; the ordinary and natural course of business and the substantial character of the tax, based as it was upon the value of the premises occupied and having relation only to the tenant\u2019s occupation, showed that the ultimate burden would not rest with the landlord. City of Montreal v. Attorney-General for Canada ([1923] A.C. 136), disc, and dist.\nPer Duff, J. (dissenting): The question of the incidence of local rates levied on occupiers and owners of real property respectively is one so complex and obscure, depending so often upon the appreciation of variable factors, that it must be presumed that the legislation creating the tax contemplated only the person called upon to pay it as the person of incidence, and such legislation cannot be treated, by the courts as ultra vires unless it is affirmatively established to be so. The present case is in principle governed by City of Montreal v. Attorney-General for Canada ([1923] A.C. 136.)\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1] affirming by an equal division of the court the judgment of Rogers J. holding that the appellant estate was legally liable for payment of a certain business tax assessed against it by the respondent city.\nThe matter came before Rogers J. by way of a case stated under the provisions of s. 410 of the Halifax city charter. The case stated was as follows:\u2014\n1. At all times material to this case the estate of James P. Fairbanks was the owner of the ground floor of premises known as no. 107-109 Hollis street in the city of Halifax.\n2. The said premises were leased by the said estate of James P. Fairbanks to His Majesty the King by lease dated the 22nd day of March, A.D. 1922, a true copy of which is hereto annexed and forms part of this case.\n3. At all times material to this case the said premises were in occupation of His Majesty the King as a railway ticket office.\n4. Section 370 of the Halifax city charter provides as follows: \u201cThe taxation of the city shall consist of: (a) Business tax, (b) Household tax, (c) Licenses and special taxes, (d) Poll tax, (c) Real property tax, all as hereinafter specified and defined.\u201d\n5. Section 371 of the Halifax city charter provides as follows: \u201c(1) The business tax shall be a tax payable by every occupier of any real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, except such as is exempt as is herein provided, and shall be payable by the occupier whether as owner, tenant or otherwise, and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\n(2) Such tax shall be at the rate fixed as hereinafter provided on fifty per cent of the value of the premises so occupied, except in the case of premises, the value of which is less than two thousand dollars, and occupied solely for the purpose of selling merchandise by retail, in respect to which the tax shall be at the said rate on twenty-five per cent of the value of the premises so occupied.\u201d\n6. Section 394 of the Halifax city charter provides as follows: \u201cExcept as is herein otherwise provided, if any property is let to the Crown or to any person, corporation or association exempt from taxation, such property shall be deemed to be in the occupation of the owner thereof for business or residential purposes as the case may be, and he shall be assessed and rated for household tax or business tax according to the purpose for which it is occupied.\u201d\n7. The assessor for the city of Halifax purported to assess the said estate of James P. Fairbanks, in respect to the said premises, for a business tax for the year beginning May 1, 1924, and ending April 30, 1925.\n8. The said estate of James P. Fairbanks duly appealed from the said assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals for the city of Halifax.\n9. The said Court of Tax Appeals dismissed the said appeal and confirmed the said assessment.\nThe questions for the opinion of the trial judge were:\u2014\n1. Whether the said estate of James P. Fairbanks is legally liable for the payment of the said business tax.\n2. Whether section 394 of the Halifax city charter is intra vires the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia.\n3. Whether the said Court of Tax Appeals was right in dismissing the said appeal and confirming the said assessment.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. and C. J. Milligan for the appellants\nF. H. Bell for the respondent:\nThe lease was made by the Fairbanks estate to His Majesty the King, represented therein by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, acting under the authority of an Order in Council, and was for five years from May 1st, 1922, at an annual rental of $3,000, and stipulated that the lessee should pay \u201cthe business taxes, if any,\u201d and the water taxes, the lessors to pay \u201cthe yearly assessment\u201d of the premises and all other taxes, and that the lessee should only use and occupy the premises for the purpose of a ticket office of the Canadian National Railways.\nRogers J. held that the Fairbanks estate was liable for the tax and that s. 394 of the Halifax city charter was intra vires. His judgment was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, on an equal division of the court, Harris C.J. and Ritchie E.J. supporting the judgment below and Mellish and McKenzie J.J. contra. Mellish J., however, adopted the ground that the Crown could not foe said to be occupying the premises \u201cfor the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling\u201d within s. 371; that the Crown could not be said to be engaged in or exercising any trade, profession or other calling even although the purposes of government might require the servants and agents of the Crown to engage in doing that which per se might be so described; and he therefore found it unnecessary to deal with the question of the validity of s. 394.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc to the Fairbanks estate and to the Attorney-General of Canada who had asked to be joined as intervenant.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. and C. J. Milligan for the appellants.\u2014The city was attempting to impose a direct tax on Crown property. The statutory fiction attempted in s. 394 does not alter the fact that the Crown remains in actual possession under its lease, and it is the occupancy by the Crown which is actually taxed. Such taxation is invalid.\nIf not a direct tax on the Crown property, it is an indirect attempt to subject the Crown to taxation and is ultra vires. See City of Montreal v. Attorney-General of Canada[2]. In that case and in Smith v. Vermillion Hills[3] the validity of the taxation was upheld because the tax in question was held to be an occupation tax levied on the beneficial interest of the tenant in the lands. The Montreal Case2 is not the converse of the present case. The cases are clearly distinguishable. That the tax in the present case is invalid; see Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Montreal[4].\nS. 394 is indirect taxation and ultra vires. B.N.A. Act, s. 92 (2); Manitoba \u201cGrain Futures Taxation Act\u201d Case[5]; Cotton v. The King[6]; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[7]; Attorney-General for Quebec v. Reed[8]; Security Export Co. v. Hetherington[9].\nS. 371, defining the tax, only makes it payable by an occupier \u201cfor the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain\u201d His Majesty is not such an occupier, and the tax cannot therefore be levied on anyone in respect to His Majesty\u2019s occupancy.\nF. H. Bell for the respondent: The tax is not on property of the Crown. It is levied directly on the owner of property in the city and properly subject to its taxing authority. It is a tax on persons, in respect of property, but not on property. The contention that the Crown is affected or concerned is based wholly on speculation as to its effect and ultimate incidence.\nThe tax is not \u201cindirect\u201d within any of the interpretations by this court or the Judicial Committee. The interpretations in the leading cases: Bank of Toronto v. Lambe.[10]; Cotton v. The King[11]; Barthe v. Alleyn-Sharples[12], and the Manitoba \u201cGrain Futures Taxation Act Case\u201d[13]; seem to confine it to cases where the tax is laid on commodities intended for sale, or to transaction such as sales, or on persons acting in a representative capacity, as executors, agents or trustees, who must necessarily be considered as passing the tax on to their principals. The fact that a tax may possibly, even probably, be shifted in whole or in part, does not make it indirect. It may happen in the case of every direct tax. See Brewers and Maltsters\u2019 Association of Ontario v. Attorney General for Ontario[14]; Barthe v. Alleyn-Sharples[15]. The tax in question cannot be differentiated in this respect from any other tax on the owner of land.\nThe decision in Attorney-General of Canada v. City of Montreal[16], cannot stand in view of subsequent decisions by the Judicial Committee, The reasoning of Strong J., dissenting, is entirely in accordance with those decisions and is confirmed by them. See Smith v. Vermillion Hills[17]; City of Montreal v. Attorney General of Canada[18]. The last mentioned case is the exact converse of the present one and its reasoning is wholly applicable.\nAs to the ground taken by Mellish J., that s. 394 is inapplicable, because the Crown cannot be considered as carrying on any description of trade, there is no supporting authority. The question is covered by Brighton College v. Marriott[19]. The judgment of Harris C. J. below on this point is supported by Mersey Docks v. Lucas[20], and Port of London Authority v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[21]. The judgment of the majority of court (Anglin C. J. C., Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret J. J.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014This appeal comes before the court from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon a case stated under the provisions of s. 410 of the city charter of Halifax, proclaimed to come into force 28th January, 1914, and the real question is whether s. 394 of that Act, as amended, is intra vires of the legislature of the province.\nThe estate of Fairbanks was the owner of the ground floor of nos. 107-109 Hollis St. in the city of Halifax, and these premises were leased by the estate to His Majesty the King, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, acting under the authority of an order in council of 31st May, 1922. The premises, as described in the lease, consist of\ncertain space for passenger offices in the city of Halifax, being space 31 ft. 9 inches by 48 feet 3 inches, for a ticket office on the ground floor of a building adjoining Queen Hotel, nos. 107 and 109 Hollis street.\nThe lease is dated 22nd March, 1922, and it runs for the term of five years, commencing on 1st May, 1922. The annual rent reserved is $3,000. The lessee covenants to pay the rent\nand the business taxes, if any, and the water taxes during the term; the lessors binding themselves to pay the yearly assessment of the said leased premises and all other taxes of every kind which may be lawfully imposed or levied thereon during said term;\nthe lessee covenants moreover to use and occupy the premises only for the purposes of a ticket office of the Canadian National Railways.\nBy c. 39 of the Nova Scotia Act of 1916, it was enacted that immediately after the passing of that Act the city of Halifax should cause to be prepared an Act in amendment of ss. 369-483 of its charter relating to taxation, striking out therefrom all the provisions authorizing and requiring personal property to be assessed and rated for taxation within the city and substituting therefor provisions authorizing and requiring the imposition and rating of business and household taxes as thereby defined. The city charter so required to be amended is the revised and consolidated Act which was prepared and brought into force by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor on 28th January, 1914, pursuant to c. 67 of the Act of 1913. The Act of 1916 defines \u201cbusiness tax\u201d to be\na yearly tax based upon the assessed value of any premises used for the purposes of any business, trade or profession, to be paid by the occupier of the same.\nThere have been numerous amendments of the city charter since 1916, but this definition, so far as I have discovered, has not been expressly repealed, although it appears in the amending Act prepared by the city authorities, as subs. 1 of s. 371, in a form somewhat varied or limited, as follows:\n371. (1) The business tax shall be a tax payable by every occupier of any real property for the purposes of any trade, profession or other calling carried on for purposes of gain, except such as is exempt as is herein provided, and shall be payable by the occupier whether as owner, tenant or otherwise, and whether assessed as owner of such property for real property tax or not.\nThe \u201chousehold tax\u201d is a tax based upon the assessed value of any premises occupied for residential purposes, to be paid by the occupier. The ordinary business tax rate is one per cent of the value of the premises occupied. There are provisions for licenses and special taxes; for a poll tax; for taxes upon buildings and other improvements, and finally it is provided that the remainder of the amount yearly required by the city, after deducting the probable amounts to be yielded by the taxes above mentioned, shall be raised by a rate sufficient to produce that amount on the assessed value of the land apart from buildings or other improvements. By s. 11, it is enacted in effect that when the Act providing the necessary amendments shall have been prepared it shall be submitted to the Governor in Council who may approve subject to such further changes, amendments or additions as are considered desirable; that the Act may then be embodied in an order of the Governor in Council and declared to be in force, and that upon publication of the order in the Royal Gazette,\ntogether with the said amended (sic) Act as a schedule thereto, and also specifying the sections so repealed, the said sections shall be repealed and the said amended Act shall be in force and effect in the place thereof.\nBy order in council of 24th August, 1918, reciting ss. 1 and 11 of c. 39 of 1916, and that the city of Halifax had caused to be prepared the Act therein referred to, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council approved the said Act and ordered and declared that it should be in force and effect, and that the sections of the Halifax city charter specified in the schedule were repealed to the extent mentioned in the schedule. The amending Act is introduced as part V. of the Halifax city charter under the title \u201cTaxation,\u201d and it comprises ss. 369 to 401-P inclusive, 413 and 416. The sections mentioned in the schedule as repealed are ss. 369 to 401, both inclusive, and ss. 413 and 416. The Act was published in the Royal Gazette of September 4, 1918, and is to be found at pp. 653 to 661 of the files of the Royal Gazette for that, year. The amending sections which were so brought into force on 4th September, 1918, were, by statute, c. 79 of 1919, s. 2, ratified and confirmed and declared to have the same force and effect as though they had been contained in an Act of the legislature passed at that date.\nIt is provided by s. 370, as sanctioned by the amending Act, that\nthe taxation of the city shall consist of:\n(a) Business tax,\n(b) Household tax,\n(c) Licenses and special taxes,\n(d) Poll tax,\n(e) Real property tax,\nall as hereinafter specified and defined.\nFrom the foregoing, it will be perceived that by the scheme of the legislation under review, the city revenue to be provided by taxes, in addition to the proceeds of the business and household taxes, licenses and special taxes, poll tax and tax upon the value of buildings and other improvements, is derived from a general levy against real property. By s. 391 some exemptions are provided, including\nthe property of His Majesty used for Imperial, Dominion or Provincial purposes.\nIt is provided by s. 394 of the Amending Act, as proclaimed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and confirmed by the legislature, following a like provision in the Act of 1916, that:\nExcept as is herein otherwise provided, if any property is let to the Crown or to any person, corporation or association exempt from taxation, such property shall be deemed to be in the occupation of the owner thereof for business or residential purposes as the case may be, and he shall be assessed and rated for household tax or business tax according to the purpose for which it is occupied.\nThe case must be considered upon the statement of it in which the parties have concurred as depending upon the questions submitted, which are as follows:\n1. Whether the said estate of James P. Fairbanks is legally liable for the payment of the said business tax. 2. Whether section 394 of the Halifax city charter is intra vires the legislature of the province of Nova Scotia.\n3. Whether the said Court of Tax Appeals was right in dismissing the said appeal and confirming the said assessment.\nIt is stated that the assessor for the city of Halifax assessed the estate of Fairbanks in respect to the premises for a business tax for the year ending April 30, 1925, the premises being, during that period, in possession of the King as a railway ticket office. The estate of Fairbanks appealed from the assessment to the Court of Tax Appeals for the city, and upon the appeal the assessment was confirmed. The court stated the case for the opinion of a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the appeal was heard by Rogers J., who answered the questions submitted favourably to the city. The estate then appealed to the Supreme Court of the province sitting en banc. The judges who heard the appeal were the Chief Justice, Ritchie E. J. and Mellish and McKenzie JJ. The learned judges were equally divided in opinion, the Chief Justice and Ritchie E. J. holding that the appeal should be dismissed, and Mellish and McKenzie JJ. that the estate was not legally liable for the payment of the business tax, and that the Court of Tax Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal and confirming the assessment. The estate thereupon appealed to this court, and its objections are two: first, that the leasehold was land or property belonging to Canada and therefore exempted from taxation by s. 125 of the British North America Act, 1867; and, secondly, that the business tax, as defined by s. 371, and, by force of s. 394, made payable by the owner (i.e. the estate of Fairbanks) was an indirect tax, and therefore not within the powers of taxation committed to the province by s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act, 1867, as\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes.\nThe power of direct taxation was considered in Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Company[22], where a question arose as to whether an Act imposing stamp duty on insurance policies, renewals and receipts, was direct taxation. Sir George Jessel, M.R., delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, held that, whether the words were considered as used in the sense of political economy, or as used in jurisprudence in the courts of law, there was a multitude of authorities to show that such a stamp imposed by the legislature was not direct taxation, and he said that\nall that is necessary for them (their lordships) to say is that, finding these words used in an Act of Parliament, and finding that all the then known definitions, whether technical or general, would exclude this kind of taxation from the category of direct taxation, they must consider it was not the intention of the legislature of England to include it in the term \u201cdirect taxation,\u201d and therefore that the imposition of this stamp duty is not warranted by the terms of the second subsection of s. 92 of the Dominion Act.\nIn Attorney-General for Quebec v. Reed[23], a question arose as to the validity of the Quebec Act, c. 9 of 1880, which imposed a duty of ten cents upon every exhibit filed in court in any action pending therein, and Lord Selborne, pronouncing the judgment, said:\u2014\nNow it seems to their lordships that those words (direct taxation) must be understood with some reference to the common understanding of them which prevailed among those who had treated, more or less scientifically, such subjects before the Act was passed. Among those writers we find some divergence of view. The view of Mill and those who agree with him is less unfavourable to the appellant\u2019s arguments than the other view, that of Mr. McCulloch and M. Lattre. It is, that you are to look to the ultimate incidence of the taxation, as compared with the moment of time at which it is to be paid; that a direct tax is\u2014in the words which are printed here from Mr. Mill\u2019s book on political economy\u2014\u201cone which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it.\u201d And then the converse definition of indirect taxes is, \u201cthose which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another.\u201d\nAnd in conclusion, he said:\u2014\nWhere a stamp duty upon transactions of purchase and sale is payable, there may be special arrangements between the parties determining who shall bear it. The question whether it is a direct or an indirect tax cannot depend upon those special events which may vary in particular cases; but the best general rule is to look to the time of payment, and if at the time the ultimate incidence is uncertain then, as it appears to their lordships, it cannot, in this view, be called direct taxation within the meaning of the 2nd section of the 92nd clause of the Act in question, still less can it be called so, if the other view, that of Mr. McCulloch, is correct.\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[24], the validity of a statute of Quebec, c 22 of 1881, was in controversy. This Act imposed taxes on certain commercial corporations carrying on business in the province, including banks, as to which the tax imposed was a sum varying with the paid-up capital, and an additional sum for each office or place of business. Lord Hobhouse, who gave the judgment, considered the meaning of \u201cdirect taxation,\u201d and he adopted the definition of John Stuart Mill, to which Lord Selborne had referred in the Reed Case[25], as a fair basis for testing the character of the tax in question, and as embodying\nwith sufficient accuracy for this purpose an understanding of the most obvious indicia of direct and indirect taxation, which is a common understanding, and is likely to have been present to the minds of those who passed the Federation Act.\nThis definition, as quoted in the judgment, is as follows:\u2014\nTaxes are either direct or indirect. A direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person, in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another; such are the excise or customs. The producer or importer of a commodity is called upon to pay a tax on it, not with the intention to levy a peculiar contribution upon him, but to tax through him the consumers of the commodity, from whom it is supposed that he will recover the amount by means of an advance in price.\nLord Hobhouse said that the legislature could not possibly have meant to give a power of taxation, valid or invalid, according to its actual results in particular cases, but that it must have contemplated some tangible dividing line, referable to, and ascertainable by the general tendencies of the tax, and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies. And he held that, both according to the probabilities of the case and the frame of the Act, the Quebec legislature must have intended and desired that the very corporations from whom the tax was demanded should pay and finally bear it, and that it was carefully designed for that purpose; he said that it was not like a customs duty, which enters at once into the price of the taxed commodity.\nThere the tax is demanded of the importer while nobody expects or intends that he shall finally bear it.\nIn Brewers and Maltsters\u2019 Association of Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario[26], we have Lord Herscheli\u2019s comments upon the foregoing authorities. The question was as to the power of the legislature of Ontario to impose license duties upon brewers and distillers for the sale of liquor manufactured by them, and their Lordships considered that, as in the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[27], the tax was demanded from the very person whom the legislature intended or desired should pay it; that there was neither expectation nor intention that he should indemnify himself at the expense of some other person, and Lord Herschell observed that:\nNo such transfer of the burden would in ordinary course take place or can have been contemplated as the natural result of the legislation in the case of a tax like the present one, a uniform fee trifling in amount imposed alike upon all brewers and distillers without any relation to the quantity of goods which they sell. It cannot have been intended by the imposition of such a burden to tax the customer or consumer. It is of course possible that in individual instances the person on whom the tax is imposed may be able to shift the burden to some other shoulders. But this may happen in the case of every direct tax. It was argued that the provincial legislature might, if the judgment of the court below were upheld, impose a tax of such an amount and so graduated that it must necessarily fall upon the consumer or customer, and that they might thus seek to raise a revenue by indirect taxation in spite of the restriction of their powers to the imposition of direct taxation. Such a case is conceivable. But if the legislature were thus, under the guise of direct taxation, to seek to impose indirect taxation, nothing that their lordships have decided or said in the present case would fetter any tribunal that might have to deal with such a case if it should ever arise.\nIn the case of Cotton v. The King[28], which has been much discussed, the question of direct taxation was considered with regard to the legislation of Quebec regulating succession duties. Lord Moulton pronounced the judgment. He considered the earlier cases, and he said that in their lordships\u2019 opinion those decisions had established\nthat the meaning to be attributed to the phrase \u201cdirect taxation\u201d in s. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, is substantially the definition quoted above from the treatise of John Stuart Mill and that this question is no longer open to discussion.\nHe reviewed the succession duty Acts of Quebec, and he said that\nto determine whether such a duty comes within the definition of direct taxation it is not only justifiable but obligatory to test it by examining ordinary cases which must arise under such legislation.\nAnd he held the taxation invalid because the payment was obtained from persons not intended to bear it, within the meaning of the accepted definition.\nVery recently the question came before the Judicial Committee again in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[29]. Lord Haldane, who pronounced the judgment, pointed out that by successive decisions of the Board the principle laid down by Mill and other political economists has been judicially adopted as the test for determining whether a tax is or is not direct within the meaning of the British North America Act.] He said:\u2014\nThe principle is that a direct tax is one that is demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired should pay it. An indirect tax is that which is demanded from one person in the expectation and with the intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another. Of such taxes excise and customs are given as examples.\nThe legislation in question provided that, upon certain contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery, the seller or his broker should pay to the province a tax computed upon the quantity sold or agreed to be sold, and that the person actually entering into the contract of sale, whether as principal, broker or agent, should pay the tax. Lord Haldane concluded:\u2014\nTurning to the only remaining question, whether the tax is in substance indirect, and bearing in mind that by s. 5 the liability is expressed as if it were to be a personal one, it is impossible to doubt that the tax was imposed in a form which contemplated that some one else than the person on whom it was imposed should pay it. The amount will, in the end, become a charge against the amount of the price which is to come to the seller in the world market, and be paid by some one else than the persons primarily taxed. The class of those taxed obviously includes an indefinite number who would naturally indemnify themselves out of the property of the owners for whom they were acting.\nBy the foregoing authorities it is shown not only that a tax is indirect which is imposed upon a person in contemplation that another shall pay it, but also that the intention or expectation that the burden will be shifted may be shown by the form in which the tax is imposed, as in the last cited case, or may be ascertained by the general tendencies of the tax and the common understanding of men as to those tendencies, as explained by Lord Hobhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[30]. Common business experience and knowledge must of course be imputed to the legislature, and results which follow in the natural and ordinary course of common business transactions must be held to have been contemplated.\nIn City of Montreal v. Attorney-General for Canada[31], the Judicial Committee had to consider the validity of a tax imposed by the legislature of Quebec; land in the city of Montreal, belonging to the Dominion Crown and leased to a tenant, who occupied it for industrial and commercial purposes, had been assessed under a section of the city charter of Montreal which enacted that persons occupying, for commercial or industrial purposes, buildings or land belonging to the Federal Government should be taxed\nas if they were the actual owners of such immovables, and shall be held to pay the annual and special assessments, the taxes and other municipal dues.\nIt was contended, first, that this legislation conflicted with the constitutional immunity provided by s. 125 of the British North America Act, which declares that no lands or property belonging to Canada shall be liable to taxation; and, secondly, that, if the taxation did not fail upon that ground, it was not direct taxation, and was therefore incompetent. Lord Parmoor, who delivered the judgment, reviewed the legislation; he said that the effect of it was that the occupant was made liable to pay on an annual assessment, not to exceed one per cent of the capitalized value of the occupied property, and he proceeded to say:\u2014\nThe method of assessment determines the amount for which an occupier is liable during his occupancy, but does not alter the incidence of the taxation or transfer the incidence from the occupant to the owner. There is no suggestion that the assessment, in the case under appeal, has not been fairly ascertained, or that there has been any attempt to differentiate between the tenants of the Crown lands and the tenants of private individuals or corporation, to the disadvantage of the Crown tenants. The ultimate incidence of taxation imposed on tenants, as the occupants of lands, is a matter on which economic experts have expressed different opinions. If, however, municipal taxation is to be regarded as ultra vires, on the ground that the ultimate incidence of taxation, or some portion of it, may or will fall on the owner, it is difficult to see in what form such taxation could be validly imposed. The question to be determined is the simpler one, whether the taxation, which is impeached, is assessed on the interest of the occupant, and imposed on that interest. In the opinion of their lordships the interest of an occupant consists in the benefit of the occupation to him during the period of his occupancy, and does not depend on the length of his tenure. The annual assessment, to which objection is taken, is an assessment for which the tenant is only liable so long as his occupancy continues and which ceases so soon as his occupancy is determined. If on the cessation of his tenancy the Crown chooses to leave the land unoccupied or to occupy the land by an official acting in his official capacity, there would be no further liability to taxation under art. 362-a of the charter affecting either the land or the Crown.\nThe objection that the tax was indirect had been distinctly put at the argument, and is thus reported:\u2014 The article is ultra vires, because the taxation is not direct taxation according to the view in Cotton v. The King[32]; a tenant taxed as owner will obtain an indemnity from the Crown in the form of the rent paid or otherwise.\nIt must therefore be inferred that in the opinion of their Lordships the tax was not indirect although the property, belonging to the Crown, was in the occupation of a tenant who was to be taxed as the actual owner, and held to pay the taxes so imposed. The judgment seems to have proceeded upon the view that it was the tenant\u2019s interest only that was assessed, the amount of the tenant\u2019s liability being determined by the method of assessment.\nIt was forcibly argued by Mr. Bell, on behalf of the respondent, that the present case was the exact converse of the Montreal Case[33] and concluded by the reasoning of the judgment in the latter; that in the Montreal Case33 the municipal authority assessed the leased property at its full value as if the tenant were the owner, and this it might do notwithstanding that the property of the landlord was exempt from taxation; while in this case, where the property of an individual is leased to the Crown for its business purposes, it is still for these purposes deemed to be in the occupation of the owner, who is therefore made liable for the business tax; and he urged that there was no distinction in principle between the two cases; that whereas in the Montreal Case33 the Crown would naturally, in the course of business, receive less rent by the amount of the tax levied in respect of the value of its interest in the demised property, it would, in the Halifax Case, naturally, and in the ordinary course, be required to pay more rent by the amount of the tax chargeable to the landlord by reason of the tenant\u2019s occupation of the property for business purposes and his exemption from the business tax which is ordinarily borne by the tenant. This argument is however shown to be unsound when it is considered that, in the view which the Judicial Committee seems to have taken of the Montreal Case (2), it was the occupier\u2019s interest which was assessed, and if I do not misinterpret the decision, the direction to tax the occupier as if he were the actual owner was intended only to regulate the method of assessment. It is said, and it seems obvious enough, that all taxation, including that nominally charged on things, is in the last resort paid by persons. Adam Smith (McCulloch\u2019s New Ed., 1839, p. 371 et seq.) considered that every tax must finally be paid from one or other of the different sources of revenue, rent, profit and wages, and accordingly he grouped taxes under those three headings, with their subdivisions. The ascertainment of the actual person by whom a particular tax is ultimately paid is, owing to the possibilities of shifting the burden as originally imposed, frequently a difficult problem; but, that there may be indirect taxation of land, or of persons in respect of land, in the sense in which the expression \u201cdirect taxation\u201d has passed into the constitution of Canada, I see no reason to doubt. And such taxation is no more competent to the provinces than indirect taxation of persons in respect of their personal property, earnings or profits. It would seem to have been the view in the Montreal Case[34] that the taxation of a tenant in the ordinary case was not indirect by reason of the incidence of the taxation, and that therefore it was not necessary to attempt to ascertain where the burden would ultimately rest; it does not necessarily follow from the decision that the taxation of a tenant is not indirect if the assessment embrace the landlord\u2019s estate in the demised premises as well as that of the tenant, when the increased charge would cause the tenant to stipulate, and compel the landlord, if he would lease his property, to agree for an equivalent reduction of the sum which would otherwise represent the fair or obtainable rent. It may perhaps be gathered from the few brief lines m which Lord Parmoor disposes of the question of indirect taxation that in the facts of the case he found nothing to distinguish it in principle from the ordinary case of landlord and tenant, where there is a tax upon the rent, or upon the tenant\u2019s interest, to be paid by the tenant; that in such a case it could not be supposed that the legislature intended or contemplated any putting over of the tax, and that the court would therefore not follow the incidence of the taxation. We are told no more than that\nthe ultimate incidence of taxation imposed on tenants as the occupants of lands is a matter in which economic experts have expressed different opinions. If however municipal taxation is to be regarded as ultra vires on the ground that the ultimate incidence of taxation, or some portion of it, may or will fall on the owner, it is difficult to see in what form such taxation could be validly imposed.\nI can only conclude therefore that the Attorney-General failed in his alternative contention in the Montreal Case[35] for lack of evidence, either in the form of the tax as imposed, or in the facts of that particular case, to establish any legislative expectation or intention that the tenant would indemnify himself at the expense of the landlord; the burden being upon him to make out that it was expected or intended, having regard to the form of the tax and the facts and circumstances of the case, that the tax would be passed on by the tenant. In that view the decision does not affect the case now under consideration, where the tax appears to have all the indicia to which the judicial authorities have referred as definitive of indirect taxation. The motive and intention are reasonably apparent; seeing that the tenant is exempt from taxation, the landlord is made liable for the tax which would have otherwise been chargeable to the tenant in respect of the special purpose for which he occupied the premises; and, whatever may be said about the Montreal Case36, the landlord is by the legislation now in question put in the position of the tenant, because the latter is exempt, and made responsible for the taxes levied for the use of the premises by the tenant for the business purposes for which they were leased, from which nothing is more to be anticipated than that the taxes will be immediately passed on to the tenant as part of the rent. A more inviting, indeed compelling, case for the landlord to exact indemnity from his tenant, for whose particular and beneficial enjoyment of the property he is obliged to pay a special tax, it is difficult to imagine.\nIt may I think be said of this business tax, with relation to the case of the exempted tenant, as was said by Lord Hobhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[36], with regard to Customs duty, that it enters at once into the price of the taxed commodity. The business tax is a tax payable by the occupier by reason of the trade which he carries on upon the demised premises. It is a tax which cannot be levied save for the tenant\u2019s occupation for the particular purpose; but, when the tenant is exempt from taxation, the legislature would nevertheless avail itself of his occupation by declaring that it shall be deemed to be that of the owner, thereby making the owner liable for the tax which would have fallen upon the tenant if he had not been exempt. Consequently, in the competition for the leasehold, the tenant exempt from taxation is subject to the disadvantage, that the rent which he offer\u2019s is of less value to the landlord, by the amount of the tax, than it would be in the case of his non-exempt competitors. Therefore it seems out of question that the landlord would ultimately assume the burden of the tax. He did pass it on as was natural to expect; that was a result which is not likely to vary in particular cases, and the tenant, in paying the tax as part of his rent, pays no more than the annual value of the premises, or in the aggregate precisely the same as the non-exempt tenant would pay in rent and business tax combined. Thus it may justly be said that, as to tenants exempt from taxation, the tax enters immediately into the rent. In holding in the Brewers and Malsters Case[37], that the tax was not indirect, Lord Herschell said that no transfer of the burden would in ordinary course take place or could have been contemplated as the natural result of the legislation, having regard to the uniformity and trifling amount of the license fee, which was imposed upon all brewers and distillers without any relation to the quantity of the goods which they sold, and that it could not have been intended by the imposition of such a burden to tax the customer or consumer. The conditions in the present case are the very opposite. The ordinary and natural course of business and the substantial character of the tax, based as it is upon the value of the premises occupied, and having relation only to the tenant\u2019s occupation, show that the burden will not rest with the landlord. It would be doing less than justice to the intelligence, foresight or intention of the legislature to suppose that it anticipated or expected that the person upon whom the tax was imposed would ultimately bear it. In considering the character of the tax levied in the Manitoba Case[38], their Lordships of the Judicial Committee had regard to a statement of facts submitted with relation to the grain trade, showing the course of business in the sale and disposal of the commodity, and it is said that\nit is impossible to doubt that the tax was imposed in a form which contemplated that some one else than the person on whom it was imposed should bear it.\nThe form of the tax in the present case, in view of the implications of the statute, seems to be that inasmuch as the occupiers of all premises for business purposes are required to pay a tax based upon the value of the property so occupied, and inasmuch as certain persons may become occupiers who are exempt from taxation, therefore when the tenant is exempt and the landlord is not exempt, the landlord shall be deemed to be the occupier and shall pay the tax which would otherwise fall directly upon the tenant; thus conclusively pointing to the probability and intention that in the end the tax will become part of the rent. The landlord would obviously exercise the means of which he has the control to indemnify himself against the ultimate burden.\nI would therefore answer the questions in the negative. In this result the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout to the appellant.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The question mainly discussed in the courts below was whether or not the legislation in question, s. 394 of the charter of Halifax, offends against the prohibition of s. 125 of the British North America Act. This question is much the same as that which was passed upon in the Montreal Case[39]. There, the legislation provided for the assessment of proprietors of land, and, subsidiarily, enacted that where land exempt from taxation, including Crown land of the Dominion or of the province, was occupied by a private person for industrial or commercial purposes, the occupant should be deemed, for the purposes of assessment to the property tax, to be the proprietor, and should be assessed accordingly.\nIt was contended on behalf of the Dominion that this in effect amounted to an assessment of Crown lands, where the lands assessed in virtue of such occupancy were the property of the Dominion, and that it was consequently obnoxious to s. 125. This contention was rejected on the authority of the previous decision in Smith v. Vermillion Hills[40].\nIn principle, this decision, in so far forth as concerns the suggestion that the legislation now before us infringes upon s. 125, seems to govern the present case.\nBut another contention is now advanced, which in effect is that the enactment upon which the impeached assessment rests cannot be sustained by the authority given to the provinces on the subject of \u201cdirect taxation\u201d\u2014in other words, that the tax is one which does not fall within the category of \u201cdirect taxation\u201d.\nThe able review of the decisions upon this subject in the judgment of my brother Newcombe is one which may be accepted for the most part without criticism. It is only when one comes to the application of the doctrine of the cases that difficulty arises.\nThe first paragraph in Mill\u2019s third chapter of Book V. has been adopted as affording a guide to the application of section 92 (2). But it would, I think, be going far beyond the authorities and would be a grave error to suppose that by force of the decisions of the Judicial Committee the whole of that chapter had become incorporated as a part of s. 92. I am inclined to think that one must, in applying the decisions, attend mainly to the thing decided, rather than to particular expressions.\nMost of the cases in which provincial legislation in this field has been held invalid have been comparatively simple, not to say obvious, cases: taxes imposed upon trustees in respect of the property of their beneficiaries, as in Cotton Case[41], taxes imposed upon agents in respect of transactions on behalf of their principals, as in the Manitoba Case[42], and taxes universally classed as indirect, such as taxes on commodities or stamp duties (Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Co.[43]. Reed\u2019s Case[44] was a very special one. The stamp duty there in question was collected by means of the requirement that all exhibits in legal proceedings should be stamped\u2014the ultimate liability to pay being ascertained only at the termination of the litigation, and then determined by law. The determination of the incidence of local rates on occupiers, building owners and land owners presents extraordinary difficulties. Mill treats the subject, in chapter 3, in a very summary way, as compared with the searching analysis it has received during the last thirty years, notably in the masterly treatise of Professor Seligman, published in 1898, in the memoranda presented to the Royal Commission of 1898 by the British economists, and in the commentary of Professor Edgeworth thereon. The subject is beset with difficulty and obscurity, and differences of opinion divide economists on most phases of it.\nMill, writing in 1848, says that the burden of a tax on occupiers remains where it is laid, while a house tax, levied on the builder or owner, is an indirect tax. Dr. Marshall, in a note retained in the edition of the \u201cPrinciples\u201d of 1920, says,\nThe burden of * * * rates is * * * shifted from the occupiers of business premises partly on to their landlords, and partly on to their customers.\nAccording to Professor Seligman, the incidence of such rates\u2014that is to say, rates on urban land or urban buildings or urban occupiers\u2014is determined by a great variety of factors, varying in character, as well as in force and activity, not only with the locality but with the economic conditions prevailing. All such rates as a rule, he says, experience has shewn will fall on occupiers in the crowded areas of great cities, and the same rule holds, according to him, in the United States in times of abounding prosperity, while in decaying towns and decaying parts of large cities, and generally in times of depression or stagnation (all too frequent everywhere), the burden falls upon the landlord. According to him, rates of precisely the same character, levied at one and the same time, in states like California and New York, may fall in one locality within the state ultimately upon the landlord, and in another, ultimately upon the occupier. Obviously, if the application of the canon adopted from Mill is to be regulated by determining in each case the fact of incidence, the courts have set before them in this region of municipal rates a task well-nigh impossible of performance.\nThis difficulty is recognized in the judgment in the Montreal Case[45]. And in truth, in view of the difficulties and obscurities surrounding the subject, it seems reasonably safe to say that legislation imposing such taxes does not contemplate their ultimate incidence, but only the immediate application of them. It may properly be observed also that if Mill\u2019s view, baldly expressed in the third chapter, that a tax on house landlords is an indirect tax, be accepted as controlling the operation of s. 92 (2), it would probably h\u00e1ve the effect of eviscerating any system of municipal taxation now or hitherto in force in this country.\nEffect, of course, must be given to provincial legislation, unless the courts can clearly see that it is ultra vires.\nIt seems, moreover, not unreasonable to hold that such subsidiary provisions as that in question in the Montreal Case[46] and that now in question are not really infringements against the principle of s. 92 (2). Both provisions aim at avoiding inequality. In each case there is an assessment in respect of the capital value or a proportion of the capital value of real property. In the legislation in question in the Montreal Case46, the occupier of exempt property for industrial or commercial purposes was held as if proprietor. Under the legislation before us, the owner of property in occupation of an exempt occupier is held as if he were occupier.\nSuch ancillary provisions would appear to be not inadmissible as part of a scheme of local rates authorized by s. 92 (2).\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant, the estate of James P.

Donald, [1926] S.C.R. 371\nDate: 1926-02-02\nThe City of St. John (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nCharles Donald (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1925: October14, 15; 1926: February 2.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nNegligence\u2014Employer and contractor\u2014Person damaged by contractor\u2019s negligence\u2014Liability of employer\u2014Work necessarily attended with danger\u2014Duty of employer\u2014Duty of owner of land to prevent use thereof causing a nuisance\u2014Servant or independent contractor\u2014Contract reserving powers of control to employer\u2014\u201cCasual or collateral\u201d negligence.\nThe defendant city employed M. as a contractor to deepen a stream within the city. In the contract and specifications wide powers of interference and control were reserved to the city, but there was no evidence of actual interference. The work involved rock excavation. Near the work M. built a shack on or partly on land included in a street limit but not used as part of the roadway, and in this shack he placed tools and appliances for the work, including a forge and also a box of dynamite. An explosion occurred, damaging plaintiff\u2019s house. At trial the jury found that the explosion was caused by the negligence of M. or his servants, the negligence consisting in the storing of the dynamite in a shed used as a storehouse for tools, instead of being locked up in a separate structure used for explosives only. No question was put to the jury involving the city\u2019s liability, which was dealt with by the trial judge on considerations of law upon the contract and as upon undisputed facts.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, and of Crockett J. at the trial, that the city was liable.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J.: The principle applicable was that where work is necessarily attended with risk, the person causing it to be done has the duty of seeing that effectual precautions are taken; and he cannot escape from the responsibility attaching on him of seeing that duty performed, by delegating it to a contractor. The city, in ordering work involving storage of dynamite near a highway and neighbouring houses was, at its peril, bound to see that the duty of taking preventive precautions against its manifest danger producing injurious consequences was performed; the most obvious of such precautions was to provide the safest storage possible; not only was there no proper stipulation or instructions as to storing of explosives, but the city\u2019s duty to see that proper storage was provided would not be satisfied by merely stipulating or giving instructions for it; failure to see that the duty was performed entailed liability on it as employer to those injured as a result of its non-performance. The improper storage of the dynamite could not be regarded as casual or collateral negligence on M\u2019s part; it was negligence in the performance of an essential part of the work; it was not such an act of negligence as could not have been anticipated and guarded against; and carelessness in the storage and handling of explosives is not something so unusual that no sane contractor might be expected to be guilty of it.\nDealing with other grounds argued, Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret J. held that, although the evidence should warrant an inference that the shack was on premises owned or controlled by the city, it did not satisfactorily appear that the city had, or should be deemed to have had, such notice that dynamite was stored therein as might entail liability on the ground taken by Newcombe J.; also, that the, relation between the city and M. was that of employer and independent contractor, not of master and servant; the mere existence of wide powers of interference and control reserved to the city (but which were not exercised), did not suffice to make the contractor and his workmen servants of the city.\nPer Duff J.: The storing of the dynamite at or near the site of the operations in progress and in the vicinity of dwelling houses and public streets was an act incidental to the carrying out of these operations by the city in virtue of powers vested in it as the municipal authority, through the instrumentality of the contractor. The nature of the work itself obviously dictated the duty of taking suitable precautions. This duty rested upon the city primarily as the donee of the powers in pursuance of which the work was being executed, and this duty it could not discharge by delegating it to a contractor. Hardaker v Idle (1806), 1 Q.B., 335; Vancouver v. Hounsome, 49 Can. S.C.R., 430.\nPer Mignault J.: The duty was imposed on the city to supervise the storage of explosives, which duty it could not discharge by delegating it to the contractor.\nPer Newcombe J.: Where a person is in possession of fixed property, he must take care that it is so used that other persons are not injured. This duty exists, though the property is in use by a contractor permitted, for purposes of his contract, on the premises. Such injuries are in the nature of nuisances. The shack was on land which, although included in the street appropriation, could not in its existing condition be used for street purposes, and was vacant unimproved land, as to which the city was under the obligation of an individual proprietor to see that it was not used in a manner to cause a nuisance. It may be assumed that the shack was not built without the city\u2019s knowledge and approval and that it was a consequence not improbable of the location and building of the shack, which the city should have realized, that the explosives for the work would be kept there; and the city could not escape liability for the user which, for purposes of the work, the contractor made of the shack, amounting to a public nuisance upon the city\u2019s property.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, affirming the judgment of Crockett J. (who tried the case with a jury) in favour of the plaintiff, in an action for damages to plaintiff\u2019s property caused by an explosion of dynamite.\nHon. J. B. M. Baxter K.C. for appellant\nG. H. V. Belyea K.C. for respondent The defendant city employed the defendant Moses as a contractor to deepen a stream called Newman\u2019s Brook which crosses Adelaide street in that city. Under the contract the city had certain wide rights of inspection and direction by its engineer, of approval or rejection of materials, etc. The clauses in this regard are set out in the judgment of Anglin C.J.C. There was, however, no evidence of any actual interference. There was no express provision in the contract with regard to explosives. The work involved rock excavation. Moses brought his tools and appliances from the place where he had been working on another contract, about a mile distant, and built a shack in which they were placed. They included a forge and a box containing dynamite. The shack was built near the work, and on or partly on land which was included in the street limit of Adelaide street but was on a lower level than the travelled roadway which had been built up. The plaintiff\u2019s house was on Adelaide street, near the shack, but on the opposite side of the street. An explosion occurred, damaging plaintiff\u2019s house. The facts are more particularly set out in the judgments of Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe J.\nAt the trial the jury found that the explosion was caused by the negligence of the defendant Moses or his servants, that the negligence consisted \u201cin the storage of dynamite or other explosive in a shed used also as a storehouse for tools, instead of keeping it locked up in a separate structure used for explosives only,\u201d and found the damages to be $900, for which judgment was given. No question was put to the jury involving the liability of the city, nor was the court requested by either side to submit any such question. The question of its liability would appear to have been dealt with by the trial judge upon considerations of law, having regard to undisputed facts.\nBoth defendants, the city and Moses, were held liable by the judgment at trial. Moses did not appeal. The city appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, which affirmed the judgment at trial. The city (by special leave granted by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division) appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Hon. J. B. M. Baxter K.C. for appellant: The damage was not caused by any act done in the performance of the work, or on the site of the \u201cwork or on any land occupied by Moses with the consent or knowledge\u201d of the city. If caused by negligence at all it was the casual or collateral negligence of the servants of Moses. The contract did not necessarily contemplate the use of a high or dangerous explosive in such a place as to be dangerous to plaintiff\u2019s property. The city was not under any duty towards plaintiff with regard to storage of dynamite or other explosive. There was no evidence of negligence.\nThe storage of materials cannot be treated as an act done in the performance of the work. The dynamite was not stored upon the actual site of the work. The city did not have notice of the building or of the storage. To carry the judgment at trial to its logical conclusion the result must have been the same if Moses had rented or occupied private land for the storage at any distance from the work. And until the dynamite was actually taken upon the site of the work what could prevent Moses appropriating it to other work?\nThe duty was not that of Dalton v. Angus[1], which was purely a case of lateral support ; nor that of Hughes v. Percival[2], a case of interference with a party wall; and that the precaution required was in the execution of the works, see that case at pp. 725, 726; and see reference thereto in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[3], (\u201cwork ordered by him\u201d).\nThe above cases, and also Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council[4]; Holliday v. National Telephone Co.[5]; Kitchener v. Robe and Clothing Co.[6]; are, in view of their circumstances, distinguishable. And see the Hardaker Case3 at p. 344 where Rigby L. J. points out the distinction between cases of master and servant and of employer and independent contractor, and defines \u201ccollaterel negligence\u201d as \u201cnegligence other than the imperfect or improper performance of the work which the contractor is employed to do,\u201d Reference to the rule stated in Pickard v. Smith[7], to the test laid down in Greenwell v. Low Beechburn Coal Co.[8], (\u201cwhat act has been done which it is the duty of the defendants to take due care to prevent\u201d); to Beven on Negligence, 3rd Ed. (1908), vol. 1 pp. 597, 607; 20 Hals., 264 para. 619; 16 Hals., 136 para. 238.\nThe provisions of the contract are only such as are required to secure to the city a proper workmanlike execution of the contract, as was said by Greenshields J. in Smith v. City of Montreal[9], or give the city control over the way in which the work shall be done and the kind of material to be used, as pointed out by Beck J. in Smith v. Ulen[10]. The retention of a power of control is not sufficient to displace the relation of employer and contractor and substitute that of master and servant. In the Hardaker Case[11], while Rigby L. J. seems to have taken that view, the decision is the other way. See at p. 343, per Lindley L. J. and at p. 344 per A. L. Smith L. J. Reference also to Murphy v. Ottawa[12]; Reedie v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[13]; Dooley v. City of St. John[14]; Smith\u2019s Master and Servant, 7th Ed. (1922) p. 238. It is a question of fact in each case whether the defendant was acting as master towards a servant or not: Brady v. Giles[15]. See also Bennett v. Castle & Sons[16].\nG. H. V. Belyea K.C. for respondent G. H. V. Belyea K.C. for respondent:\u2014The city having undertaken a work necessarily attended with danger to the public and to the respondent, was under a duty to see that all necessary precautions were taken and could not rid itself of liability by entering into a contract for its performance by another. City of Kitchener v. Robe & Clothing Co. Ltd.[17]; Dalton v. Angus[18]; per Lord Watson and Lord Blackburn; Quarman v. Burnett[19]; Halliday v. National Telephone Co.[20]; Hardaker v. Idle District Council11; Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council[21]; Black v. Christ Church Finance Co.[22]; Longmore v. McArthur[23]; Waller v. Corporation of Sarnia[24]; Pinn v.

Smith[31]; Hughes v. Percival[32]; Tarry v. Ashton[33]; Moses\u2019 negligence in storing the dynamite as he did was not collateral or casual. Crockett J. in his judgment defined collateral or casual negligence as \u201csome act or omission on the part of the contractor or his servants which could not reasonably have been anticipated or guarded against,\u201d referring to Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council38; Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural District Council27. As to appellant\u2019s contention that it is only liable for Moses\u2019 negligence \u201cin the execution of the work,\u201d this is dealt with in the appeal judgment as follows \u201cIf the explosion had occurred during the time that the dynamite was being transported to the shack and damage had been caused x x x it would at most have been caused by casual or collateral negligence and the city should not have been held liable therefor; but the situation is entirely changed when once the dynamite is placed in the shack in close proximity to the work for the sole and exclusive purpose of being used in connection with the work x x\u201d. Reference to terms of the contract. The case is a stronger one than the Robinson Case [34]. The decision of Buckley L. J. in that case was adopted by Anglin C. J. C. in City of Kitchener v. Robe & Clothing Co. Ltd.[35]. See also judgment of Idington J. As to holdings against finding collateral negligence, see also Penny v. Wimbledon Rurban District Council[36]; Holliday v. National Telephone Co.[37], and Hardaker v. Idle District Council[38]. As to negligence \u201cin the performance of the contract\u201d see Black v. Christ Church Finance Co.[39]. Even if the contract prohibited storage of dynamite on the public highway and Moses was instructed to remove it, the appellant would nevertheless be liable under the authorities. He supplied it to the city in pursuance of his contract for the exclusive purpose of being used for the removal of the solid rock, and placed it where he did with appellant\u2019s consent or knowledge.\nThe city, having caused to be brought and used dangerous materials upon city property forming and being used as part of the scene of operations under the contract, is vicariously liable to respondent for damage caused by their escape, under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher[40]. The city was liable as an owner or occupier for damage to respondent by a nuisance existing on or originating from its land. Attorney General v. Tod Heatley[41]; Barker v. Herbert[42]; Job Edwards Co. Ltd. v. Birmingham Navigations[43]; Jones v. Festiniog Ry. Co.[44]; Dominion Gas Co. v. Collins[45].\nReference also to Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, vol. I p. 410; Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 7th Ed. pp. 110-111; Black v. Christ Church Finance Co.[46]; Waller v. Corporation of Sarnia[47]; Miles v. Forest Granite Co.[48]; Grant v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[49]; Canadian Southern Ry. v. Phelps[50]; Rainham v. Belvedere[51]; Midwood v. Mayor of Manchester[52]; Charing Cross Electric Co. v. Hydraulic Co.[53].\nThe city is liable for Moses\u2019 negligence, since the relation of master and servant was created under the contract terms and the circumstances surrounding the performance of the work (presence of appellant\u2019s officials to give orders). Reference to Salmond\u2019s Law of torts, 5th Ed. p. 96; Performing Right Society v. Mitchell & Booker[54]; Pollock on Torts, 12th Ed. pp. 79, 80; Yewens v. Noakes[55]; Regina v. Negus[56]; Warburton v. Great Western Ry. Co.[57]; Hastings v. LeRoi Ltd.[58]; Dallontonia v. McCormick[59]. Anglin C. J. C.\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover damages for injury to his house caused by an explosion of dynamite stored by the defendant Moses in a shack nearby. Moses was employed by his codefendant, the city of St. John, as a contractor to deepen Newman\u2019s Brook, which crosses Adelaide St. in that city. The authority of the city to undertake this work is not questioned ; neither is any doubt cast upon its right to employ a contractor to perform it.\nThe use of dynamite or some other powerful explosive for blasting was necessary for the economical carrying out of the work, which involved rock excavation. A short time before the explosion occurred, Moses had caused a quantity of 40 per cent dynamite\u2014estimated at about 50 pounds\u2014 to be placed in a shack which he had erected on, or immediately adjoining Adelaide St. and adjacent to the work. This shack was built for use as a toolhouse. It also contained a forge for blacksmithing purposes in connection with the work.\nThe jury found that the storing of the dynamite in a shed used also as a storehouse for tools instead of keeping it locked up in a separate structure used for explosives only was negligence which caused the explosion. While the immediate cause of the explosion is not known, this finding of the jury has not been impugned.\nBoth defendants were held liable by the judgment of the trial court which was affirmed on appeal. The recovery being for $900 only, a further appeal to this court did not lie without special leave under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. That leave was granted to the city of St. John by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The defendant Moses submitted to the judgment against him.\nThe plaintiff rests his claim against the city on three distinct bases:\n(a) that the dynamite required for carrying out the contract having been stored by Moses either on property of the city, or on property of which it had a right of occupation by license, its explosion, due to negligence in storing, entailed liability on the city whatever may have been its relationship with Moses;\n(b) that in carrying out the work undertaken Moses, if not the servant of the city, was at least by the terms of his contract so much under the control of its engineer that it cannot escape liability on the ground that he was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d;\n(c) that, if Moses should be regarded as an \u201cindependent contractor,\u201d the city is nevertheless liable because the work contracted for was of such a character that in the natural course of things injurious consequences to neighbouring property (including that of the plaintiff) must be expected to arise from its performance unless precautions were taken to prevent such consequences, and the defendant city, therefore, owed a duty to the plaintiff to see that such precautions were taken, responsibility for the discharge of which it could not escape by delegating that duty to a contractor.\n(a) Although the evidence should warrant an inference that the shack in which the dynamite was stored was on premises owned or controlled by the municipality, I am not satisfied that its engineer had, or should be deemed to have had, such notice that dynamite was stored in the shack as might entail responsibility apart from the other grounds on which the plaintiff rests his claim. It is unfortunate that these aspects of the case were not more fully investigated at the trial and that we are without the advantage of findings upon them by the jury. If I thought a finding of tacit sanction by the city of the storage of dynamite in the shack justifiable, I should probably be disposed to support the judgment against it on the ground which I understand commends itself to my brother Newcombe.\n(b) On this branch of the case the learned trial judge expressed these views:\nAs to whether, by the terms of the written contract, Moses was in fact an independent contractor, or whether the city corporation retained such control of the work as to create the relationship of master and servant, I have not deemed it necessary to decide, inasmuch as in the circumstances indicated the defence as to the damage complained of being caused by the act of an independent contractor is, in my opinion, of no avail. I feel, however, constrained to say that had it been necessary for me to decide this question, the provisions in the contract and specifications as to the work being carried on under the direction of the city\u2019s engineer, and requiring the contractor and his foreman and servants to obey at all times the orders of the engineer, as well as the fact of the city\u2019s fixing the scale of wages to be paid by the contractor to his employees, and the provisions requiring him to save the corporation harmless from all suits and actions brought against it by reason of the carrying out of the work, are considerations which, in the absence of the clearest possible authorities to the contrary, I should have found it most 20095\u20144\u00bd difficult to reconcile with the idea of Moses being an independent contractor in the sense contended for.\nIn deliverying the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Hazen C. J., said:\nI do not base my judgment on the ground that the relationship of master and servant existed between Moses and the city, but I certainly, like Mr. Justice Crockett, would have great difficulty in coming to the conclusion, in view of the clauses contained in the contract specification and conditions thereunder, that Moses was an independent contractor. He was to be subject to the control and direction of his employer in \u2018 respect to the manner in which the work was to be done, and that I think would constitute him a servant of the city, which would therefore be liable for his negligence.\nThere is no suggestion in the evidence that there had in fact been interference by any civic official in the performance of his contract by Moses. No directions had been given him as to the bringing of dynamite to the work, or as to its storage. Indeed failure to give such instructions is one of the grounds on which the plaintiff imputes responsibility to the appellant. There is no proof that the presence of dynamite in the shack, or in the neighbourhood of the work, was known to any employee of the city.\nThe clauses of the contract and specifications relied upon to establish such control by the city as would preclude its plea that Moses was an independent contractor read as follows:\nAll labour and materials of every description requisite for performing the work to be provided by the contractor but be subject at all times to the approval or rejection of the city engineer. * * * And the contractor further agrees with the city that he will carefully and skilfully carry on and perform the work to be done under this contract and that he will employ proper and skilled men to do the work, and to supply and use, in doing the work, good, proper, and requisite materials to the satisfaction of the engineer. * * * The contractor is to furnish at his own cost all of the labour and all of the material required. * * * the engineer and the clerk of works are to have full power and liberty to inspect the various parts of the work at all times during their progress, and in case of the contractor refusing to allow such inspection the work is to be deemed insufficient and not in accordance with the terms of the specifications.\nThe contractor is not to use the land forming the site of or connected with the works for any other purpose whatsoever than the proper carrying on of the works. * * * No person is to be employed or allowed to remain on the work or any part thereof who shall be objectionable to the engineer.\nThe contractor shall attend to, and execute, without delay all orders and directions which may from time to time be given by the engineer in connection with the contract, and in case of his refusing to comply with such orders and directions, or of his not proceeding with all due diligence and expedition within twenty-four hours after a written notice requiring the same has been delivered to him, or his foreman, as hereinafter provided, the commissioner shall be at liberty to use free of cost and charge for wear and tear all, or any, of the contractor\u2019s tools, implements and materials to perform such work as he requires and direct agreeably with the specifications, and the contractor shall repay to the city all the cost and charges and expenses to be thereby incurred or the same may be deducted from any amount that may be due to the contractor and retained by the city in reimbursement of all such costs, charges and expenses.\nWide as are the powers of interference and control thus reserved to the city, their mere existence does not in se suffice to make the contractor and his workmen in carrying out the work contracted for the servants of the city. It may, as Sir Frederick Pollock says (Law of Torts, 12th Ed., p. 80-81), sometimes\nbe a nice question whether a man has let out the whole of a given work to an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d or reserved so much power or control as to leave him answerable for what is done.\nBut in the absence of actual interference by the employer or his representative in exercise of the power thus reserved resulting in the injury for which damages are claimed\u2014 here there was none\u2014the authorities seem to be reasonably clear that the mere reservation, to quote Smith\u2019s Law of Master and Servant, (7th Ed., p. 238).\nby contract (of) general rights of watching the progress of works which the contractor has agreed to carry out for him, of deciding as to the quality of the materials and workmanship, of stopping the works or any part thereof at any stage, and of dismissing disobedient or incompetent workmen employed by the contractor will not of necessity render (the employer) liable to third persons for the negligence of the contractor in carrying out the works.\nThis passage is cited with approval by McCardie J., in Performing Right Society v. Mitchell & Booker[60]. That learned judge says that\nthe question whether a man is a servant or an independent contractor is often a mixed question of fact and law. If, however, the relationship rests upon a written document only, the question is primarily one of law. The contract is to be construed in the light of the relevant circumstances.\nHe proceeds to discuss the criteria indicated by the authorities for determining whether the relationship of the employed to the employer is that of independent contractor or of servant, and then says that\nThe final test, if there be a final test, and certainly the test to be generally applied, lies in the nature and degree of the detailed control over the person alleged to be the servant. This circumstance is, of course, only one of several, but it is usualy of vital importance. He cites as authority the leading case of Hardaker v. Idle District Council[61], which has often been followed and, so far as I am aware, has never been seriously questioned. The powers of supervision and control of the city engineer in the present case are not wider than those that were reserved to the district council\u2019s inspector in the Hardaker Case61. While the defendants were there held liable on the ground that they could not delegate their duty to provide against injury to the gas mains (escaping gas from which caused damage to the plaintiff) so as to avoid liability for a breach thereof, a majority of the Lords Justices (Lindley and A. L. Smith, L.JJ.) concurred in holding that\nlarge as the inspector\u2019s power was, Thornton (the contractor) was not * * * the servant of the defendants (p. 343) : the true relation was that of principal and contractor (p. 344).\nSo far as the decision of the majority in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in Dallantonia v. McCormick[62], where a contractor\u2019s workman was injured by the fall of loose overhanging rock, may be inconsisitent with the opinion on the question now under consideration expressed by Lindley and A. L. Smith, L.JJ., in the Hardaker Case61, I am not prepared to accept it. Dallantonia\u2019s Case62 is, however, distinguishable from the case now before us in several features, notably in that there the engineer of the defendant company had knowledge of the danger to which the contractor\u2019s workmen were exposed while at work and directed its removal but failed to see that his instructions were effectively carried out. These facts may have entailed liability of the company.\nI am, with respect, not disposed to regard the relation between the defendants in the present instance as that of master and servant or as other than that of employer and independent contractor\n(c) The doctrine enunciated by Cockburn L.C.J., in Bower v. Peate[63], which is made the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the third branch of the case, was doubted by Lord Blackburn in Hughes v. Percival[64], as possibly too broadly stated; but the learned Lord did not indicate \u201chow far this general language should be qualified\u201d. (See observation of A. L. Smith L.J. in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[65]. Lords Watson and Fitzgerald (p. 451 cited Bower v. Peate[66], without any suggestion of qualification. Mr. Salmond in his valuable work on Torts (6th ed.), at p. 124, treats Lord Blackburn\u2019s expression of doubt as a statement that Sir Alexander Cockburn\u2019s general proposition should not be supported. He concludes (p. 125) that\nthe vicarious responsibility of the employers of independent contractors is not the outcome of any far-reaching general principle, but represents merely a number of more or less arbitrary exceptions based on considerations of public policy.\nWhile it is\na proposition absolutely untenable that in no case can a man be responsible for the act of a person with whom he has made a contract (Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Consumers\u2019 Company)[67].\nit is, no doubt, the general rule that the person who employs an independent contractor to do work in itself lawful and not of a nature likely to involve injurious consequences to others is not responsible for the results of negligence of the contractor or his servants in performing it. The employer is never responsible for what is termed casual or collateral negligence of such a contractor or his workmen in the carrying out of the contract; and it is not universally true that he is responsible for injury occasioned by improper or careless performance of the very work contracted for; he is not so where the work is not intrinsically dangerous and, if executed with due care, would cause no injury, and the carrying out of it in that manner would be deemed to have been the thing contracted for. His vicarious responsibility arises, however, where the danger of injurious consequences to others from the work ordered to be done is so inherent in it that to any reasonably well-informed person who reflects upon its nature the likelihood of such consequences ensuing, unless precautions are taken to avoid them, should be obvious, so that were the employer doing the work himself his duty to take such precautions would be indisputable. That duty imposed by law he cannot delegate to another, be he agent, servant or contractor, so as to escape liability for the consequence of failure to discharge it. That, I take it, is a principle applicable in such a situation whatever be the nature otherwise or the locus of the work out of which it arises.\nInjuries due to improper acts authorized by the employer, to his negligence in the selection of the contractor, to his failure to impart proper instructions, to his neglect to prevent the creation on his own property by the contractor of a nuisance, or its continuance, or to his giving employment to do acts which, though lawful, can be done only at the peril of him who does them, are really not within the purview of the doctrine imputing vicarious responsibility. In these cases the responsibility is rather direct and rests on personal acts or omissions.\nContracts for works involving interference with rights of support (Dalton v. Angus[68]; Hughes v. Percival)[69]; and for works entailing the creation of dangers on highways (Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council[70]; Holliday v. National Telephone Co.)[71] it is well established, subject the employer to vicarious responsibility for negligence on the part of his contractor which is not casual or collateral. The duty to take precautions for protection of the property endangered in the one case, and of the public in the other, cannot be delegated by the employer so as to avoid responsibility. These are admitted exceptions to the general rule giving the employer immunity from responsibility for the acts or omissions of the independent contractor. But the extension of this class of exception to contracts for works of other kinds the carrying out of which, unless precautions be taken to obviate the danger, involves equally manifest risk to those of the public who happen to come, or to possess property, within the region affected by it, is contested.\nAs early as 1861, however, in Pickard v. Smith[72], Williams J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, could find no sound distinction between the case of a public highway and of a road which may be, and to the knowledge of the wrongdoer will in fact be, used by persons lawfully entitled to do so. In Black v. Christ Curch Finance Co.[73], vicarious responsibility of the employer for negligence in the setting out of fire on open bush land, \u201can operation necessarily attended with great danger,\u201d was upheld by the Privy Council. The employer could not delegate his duty to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the fire spreading so as to escape responsibility for their being neglected. In Odell v. Cleveland House, Limited[74], the same doctrine was applied to a case of employment of a contractor to demolish the upper portion of a building, and the statement of law by Cockburn, L. C. J., in Bower v. Peate[75], was made the basis of the judgment. In Hardaker v. Idle District Council[76], while the contract was for work on a highway, the injury was to persons and property in an adjacent house. In this latter case the liability of the employer was rested upon the principle stated by Lord Blackburn in Dalton v. Angus,[77], that\na person causing something to be done the doing of which casts upon him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching on him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to a contractor. He may bargain with a contractor that he shall perform the duty and stipulate for an indemnity from him if it is not performed, but he cannot thereby release himself from liability to those injured by the failure to perform it;\nLord Watson, at p. 831, said\nIn cases where the work is necessarily attended with risk he (the employer) cannot free himself from liability by binding the contractor to take effectual precautions. He is bound, as in a question with the party injured, to see that the contract is performed, and is therefore liable, as well as the contractor, to repair any damage which may be done.\nIt is true that these noble Lords were immediately dealing with a case of interference with a right to support; but they are, in these passages, as I read them, stating a principle of general application; and that principle, I think, governs the determination of the present case.\nThe work here contracted for was rock excavation necessarily requiring, for economic reasons, the use of a high explosive. Convenience, amounting to practical necessity, demanded that a reasonable quantity of the explosive should be readily accessible. That in turn involved its being stored upon, or adjacent to, the site of the work, and in dangerous proximity to neighbouring buildings, one of which was that owned by the plaintiff. The dynamite was accordingly brought by Moses to, and stored in, the tool-house. It was there solely for the purpose of his contract with the city. In so storing it he was acting under that contract, though improperly. Black v. Christchurch Finance Co.[78]. Had the city carried on the work by day labour its legal duty to see that its servants safely stored the dynamite required and its liability for injurious consequences resulting from improper and dangerous storage of it would admit of no doubt. The danger to persons using the highway and to adjacent properties from improper storage of such an explosive must have been obvious to any thinking person. The employer ordering work involving storage of dynamite near a highway and neighbouring houses, was, at his peril, bound to see that the duty of taking preventive precautions against its manifest danger producing injurious consequences was performed. The most obvious of such precautions was to provide for the dynamite the safest storage possible. Compare Wetherbee v. Partridge[79].\nIf an obligation was imposed on the city, as employer, to exact a proper contractual stipulation or to give proper instructions as to the storing of the explosive, that duty was entirely neglected. (Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural District Council[80]). But the city\u2019s duty to see that proper storage for the dynamite was provided would not be satisfied by merely stipulating or giving instructions for it. Failure to see that the duty was performed entailed liability on it as employer to those injured as a result of its non-performance. As put by Lord Lindley in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[81], the case is not one in which the contractor performed the city\u2019s duty for them, but did so carelessly; the case is one in which, so far as the providing of a proper place for storing the dynamite was concerned, no effort was made to discharge the duty of the city.\nNor can the improper storage of the dynamite be regarded as casual or collateral negligence on the part of Moses. It was negligence in the performance of an essential part of the work which he was employed to do\u2014in the discharge of the very duty (amongst others) which the law would have thrown upon the city had it been acting by the hands of its servants. Hardaker v. Idle District Council, per Rigby L.J.[82]; Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural District Council[83]. Moses expressly agreed to provide, and by implication to care for, all necessary material. The dynamite required for the work was part of such material, and its storage at a point reasonably accessible for the men engaged in the work was one of the obligations which Moses impliedly undertook. Improper storage was not such an act of negligence as could not have been anticipated and guarded against; Penny v. Wimbledon Urban District Council [84]; Pearson v. Cox[85]; and carelessness in the storage and handling of explosives is not something so unusual that no sane contractor might be expected to be guilty of it. Hughes v. Percival[86].\nStoring the dynamite was an integral ,part of the work contracted for which was necessarily attended with danger, unless the precaution of providing a suitable place to keep it in was observed. The palpable recklessness of Moses in putting it in a building used as a tool-house and occupied as a forge involved the city in responsibility.\nDuff J.\u2014When the facts are understood, the question of law presents no difficulty.\nWe are not informed of the particular sources of the statutory power under which the work of excavating the bed of Newman\u2019s Brook was undertaken by the city, but it has been assumed throughout the case that the work was carried out in execution of some general or special statutory authority vested in the municipality. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Crockett says,\nIt was by virtue of the city corporation\u2019s authority, and its authority only, that the contractor could have exposed people improperly to such a danger.\nThe storing of the dynamite in the immediate vicinity of the work on which it was being used was an incident of the work which the corporation, as the proper public authority, was executing through the instrumentality of its contractor.\nAs the work was being carried on in the vicinity of dwelling houses and public streets, the duty of taking steps to protect the public against the risk of explosions was obviously dictated by the very character of the work itself. The failure to discharge this duty was no casual or collateral negligence: it was the breach of a duty resting upon the municipality, which, in exercise of its statutory powers, was causing the work to be done; a duty which it could not discharge by delegating it to the contractor, Hardaker v. Idle District Council[87]; Vancouver v. Hounsome[88]. It is on this ground that I should dismiss the appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014In view of the circumstances of this case and of the close proximity of the work to dwelling houses and to the travelled portion of the highway, I think a duty was imposed on the city to supervise the storage of explosives to be used in the blasting operations, which duty it could not discharge by delegating it to the contractor.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The city contracted with its co-defendant, George Moses, for the excavation of the channel of Newman\u2019s Brook by contract in writing of 24th March, 1921, and the contractor thereby engaged to provide all labour and materials of every description requisite for performing the work, subject at all times to the approval or rejection of the city engineer, also\nto supply and use in doing the work good, proper and requisite materials to the satisfaction of the engineer.\nBy the second of the specifications attached to the contract it was provided that the contractor was to furnish at his own cost all of the labour and material required; to erect the necessary fencing to protect the public; to erect a sufficient number of red lights warning the public of danger, and to conform with all of the city\u2019s by-laws in this respect. By clause 41 of the by-laws, relating to the fire department of the city, the storage of gun powder or other explosive substance in any building or place whatsoever within the limits of the city, in any quantity exceeding 25 pounds of gun powder or 10 pounds of any other explosive substance, at any one time, is forbidden under penalty of forfeiture and $40 for each offence. The contract provided prices for both rock, solid and loose, and earth excavation. It is common ground in the case that the excavation which the contractor undertook consisted largely of solid rock. Nothing is said expressly either in the contract or in the specification about explosives, but it must be taken that the city, according to the common understanding and having regard to the attendant conditions, impliedly authorized the use of explosives, and that these were included in the materials, if indeed they were not the only material, which the contractor would supply. The channel which was to be excavated extended for a distance of about 950 feet, including the stream below or to the westward of Adelaide street bridge as far as the pond. The contractor had been executing a contract for the city on Douglas avenue, which is distant a mile or thereabouts from the work now in question, and when he completed this work, perhaps on or about Saturday, 16th April, he removed his plant, tools and materials to Newman\u2019s Brook; the evidence as to the precise date is not satisfactory, but it certainly was not later than Monday morning, 18th April. Adelaide street approaching Newman s Brook is not built to the full width of its layout. It would appear that the ground included within the street limits at this point naturally slopes or falls away to the westward, and that it is only the eastern part of the roadway which had been built up or was used for purposes of travel. The road is said to be laid out to a width of 66 feet, but the travelled roadway consists only of the easterly portion, having a width of 45 feet 6 inches, upon which an embankment was formed supported on the westerly side by a retaining wall, several feet in height, which is nearly perpendicular, and protected by an iron rail. It was on the lower level or westerly side of the road allowance, within a short distance of the brook, that the contractor\u2019s teamster deposited the tools and materials which he brought from Douglas avenue, including lumber for the building of a shed, and a box containing a considerable quantity of dynamite, 50 pounds or less. Here on Monday the contractor built a temporary shed or lean-to, 20 feet by 10 feet, having a roof of one slope covered with tar paper, and in this shed were deposited the contractor\u2019s tools and appliances for use in the work, including a forge and also a box of dynamite. A stove pipe projected from one end of the shed from which smoke was seen to issue on several occasions, and the forge was set up in the shed and put into operation. On Tuesday the men began the work of excavating the channel, working with picks and shovels. The work had been laid out by or under the direction of the city engineer before the excavating began. The distance of the shed from the channel is variously estimated at from 60 feet to 75 feet. On Wednesday morning the men returned to their work, ditching. There was a fire lighted in the shed that morning, presumably for purposes of the forge, and at 11 o\u2019clock an explosion occurred which blew the shed to pieces, killed one of the contractor\u2019s men, who was the only occupant at the time, and caused considerable damage to the houses in the neighbourhood, including the plaintiff\u2019s house.\nThe following questions were put to the jury at the trial and their answers:\n1. To what extent was the plaintiff\u2019s house damaged by the explosion of April 20, 1921, apart from the destruction of the window glass and other damage which was made good immediately after the explosion?\nAns.: Nine hundred dollars ($900).\n2. Was the explosion caused by the negligence of the defendant Moses, or his servants?\nAns.: Yes.\n3. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\nAns.: In the storage of dynamite or other explosive in a shed used also as a storehouse for tools, instead of keeping it locked up in a separate structure used for explosives only.\nNo question was put involving the liability of the city, nor was the court requested by counsel on either side to submit any such question. It would appear to have been assumed that there was no dispute of fact affecting the city and that its obligation depended entirely upon considerations of law, having regard to admitted or undisputed facts.\nI should have liked to know from the jury whether in view of the facts and circumstances of the case the city authorized or approved the building and location of the shed, and whether it knew or had reason to know or to apprehend that dynamite was being stored there, but in view of the course of the trial, the submissions at the argument, and the considerations which I shall mention, I do not think it necessary to send the case back for any finding. By the New Brunswick Judicature Rules, Order 39, Rule 6; Order 40, Rule 10, and Order 58, Rule 4, which correspond to the English rules, the court has power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, and a new trial is not to be granted because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to them, unless in the opinion of the court some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been : thereby occasioned in the trial.\nIt is stated in the appellant\u2019s factum that the contractor built the shed\neither wholly within the bounds of Adelaide street or partly within the street and partly upon the adjacent property of a private owner,\nand counsel for the city stated at the hearing that the shed might, for the purposes of the case, be treated as wholly upon the highway. People living in the neighbourhood saw the construction of the shed going on and saw the shed in place a day or two before the accident. It was plainly visible from the street and from the brook where the work was going on. No witnesses were called on behalf of the city. The city engineer had been upon the work and laid it out, but there is no direct evidence to show whether or not he was there at any time during either of the two days previous to the explosion, or when he was there.\nIt being conceded that the contractor, immediately before beginning to execute his contract, erected his shed upon land belonging to the city, in a public place, in close proximity to one of the city streets and to the site which had been laid out, or was then being laid out, by the city engineer for the excavating which was to be done under the contract; that the shed was provided for the purposes of the work; that the contractor had already, probably on a previous day, deposited\u201d at the site of the shed his tools and materials, and that the shed was used by the contractor from the time of its construction until destroyed by the explosion for no purpose save that of the contract, I think we may assume, neither the city nor the contractor producing any evidence to the contrary, that these things were not done without the license or consent of the city authorities, and that the city permitted the contractor to occupy the land in the way he did occupy it; and if the natural consequence of the user for which the contractor was authorized or licensed was to cause a nuisance, the city cannot escape liability for this. I think it was the duty of the city both to the public using the highway and to the people living in the neighbourhood to see that the explosives, which were practically required for the doing of the work, if kept on the work, or on the property belonging to or under the control of the city, did not cause a nuisance. The execution of this duty was unprovided for by the contract and in fact the duty was unfulfilled, and it was, as against the city, in consequence of the neglect of this duty that the accident took place.\nIn the well known case of Laugher v. Pointer[89], which had reference to a very different cause of complaint, Little-dale J. at p. 560, says, referring to Bush v. Steinman[90], and Sly v. Edgley[91], that:\nThese cases appear to establish that in these particular instances the owner of the property was held liable, though the injury were occasioned by the negligence of contractors or their servants, and not by the immediate servants of the owner. But supposing these cases to be rightly decided, there is this material distinction, that there the injury was done upon or near and in respect of the property of the defendants, of which they were in possession at the time. And the rule of law may be that in all cases where a man is in possession of fixed property he must take care that his property is so used and managed that other persons are not injured, and that, whether his property be managed by his own immediate servants or by contractors or their servants. The injuries done upon land or buildings are in the nature of nuisances for which the occupier ought to be chargeable when occasioned by any acts of persons whom he brings upon the premises. The use of the premises is confined by the law to himself, and he should take care not to bring persons there who do any mischief to others.\nIn this case there was in the result an equal division of judicial opinion in the King\u2019s Bench, but in Quarman v. Burnett[92], it became necessary to decide the question, which had been left in difference, and Parke B., pronouncing the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, held that the weight of authority and legal principle was in favour of the view taken by Lord Tenterdon and Littledale J. In consequence it was held that where the owners of a carriage were in the habit of hiring horses to draw it for a day or for a drive, and the owners of the horses provided a driver through whose negligence an injury was done to a third party, the owners of the carriage were not liable to be sued for the injury. And, as to the passage which I have quoted, Parke B. observed: It is true that there are cases\u2014for instance, that of Bush v. Steinman[93]; Sly v. Edgley[94], and others, and perhaps amongst them may be classed the recent case of Randleson v. Murray\u2014in which the occupiers of land or buildings have been held responsible for acts of others than their servants, done upon, or near, or in respect of their property. But these cases are well distinguished by my Brother Littledale, in his very able judgment in Laugher v. Pointer[95]. The rule of law may be, that where a man is in possession of fixed property, he must take care that his property is so used or managed, that other persons are not injured; and that, whether his property be managed by his own immediate servants, or by contractors with them, or their servants. Such injuries are in the nature of nuisances.\nIn Reedie v. London and North Western Railway Co. and Hobbit v. London and North Western Railway Co.[96], the defendant company had contracted with certain persons for the construction of a portion of its railway, including a bridge over a public highway, and the contractor\u2019s workmen in constructing the bridge negligently allowed a stone to fall upon a person passing underneath along the highway. It was held that the company was not liable and Rolfe B., pronouncing the judgment, having referred to Quarman v. Burnett[97] and the cases following that decision, said:\nBy these authorities we must consider the law to have been settled; and the only question is, whether the law, so settled, is applicable to the facts of this case. To show it was not, it was argued by the counsel for the plaintiff, that there is a recognized distinction on this subject, between injuries arising from the careless or unskilful management of an animal, or other personal chattel, and an injury resulting from the negligent management of fixed real property. In the latter case, it was contended the owner is responsible for all injuries to passers by or others, howsoever they may have been occasioned; and here it was said the defendants were, at the time of the accident, the owners of the railway, and so are the parties responsible. This distinction as to fixed real property is adverted to by Mr. Justice Littledale, in his very able judgment in Laugher v. Pointer[98]; and it is also noticed in the judgment of this court, in Quarman v. Burnett97. But in neither of these cases was it necessary to decide whether such a distinction did or did not exist. The case of Bush v. Steinman (7), where the owner of a house was held liable for the act of a servant of a sub-contractor, acting under a builder employed by the owner, was a case of fixed real property. That case was strongly pressed in argument, in support of the liability of the defendants, both in Laugher v. Pointer98 and in Quarman v. Burnett97, and as the circumstances of those two cases were such as not to make it necessary to overrule Bush v. Steinman93, if any distinction in point of law did exist, in cases like the present, between fixed property and ordinary movable chattels, it was right to notice the point. But, on full consideration, we have come to the conclusion, that there is no such distinction, unless, perhaps, in cases where the act complained of is such as to amount to a nuisance; and in fact, that, according to the modern decisions, Bush v. Steinman[99] must be taken not to be law, or, at all events, that it cannot be supported on the ground on which the judgment of the court proceeded. It is not necessary to decide whether, in any case, the owner of real property, such as land or houses, may be responsible for nuisances occasioned by the mode in which his property is used by others not standing in the relation of servants to him, or part of his family. It may be, that in some cases he is so responsible. But then, his liability must be founded on the principle, that he has not taken due care to prevent the doing of acts which it was his duty to prevent, whether done by his servants or others. If, for instance, a person occupying a house or field should permit another to carry on there a noxious trade, so as to be a nuisance to his neighbours, it may be that he would be responsible, though the acts complained of were neither his acts nor the acts of his servants. He would have violated the rule of law: Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. This is referred to by Mr. Justice Cresswell, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Bench, in Rich v. Baster field[100], as the principle on which parties possessed of fixed property are responsible for acts of nuisance occasioned by the mode in which the property is enjoyed. And, possibly, on some such principle as this, the case of Bush v. Steinman99 may be supported.\nIn White v. Jameson[101], which was followed by Kekewich J. in Winter v. Baker[102], and in Jenkins v. Jackson[103], the plaintiff was the owner of cottages, and, on the oppoite side of the street, was a shipyard owned and occupied by the defendant Jameson, where a brick kiln was erected and lighted within 45 feet of the cottages. The action was brought against Jameson and Proffitt to restrain the burning of the bricks in a manner to cause a nuisance to the occupiers of the cottages. Jameson had contracted with Proffitt for the excavation of clay in the shipyard, and for the making of bricks. The case was heard before Jessel M.R., who held the defendant Jameson liable, and he said:\nThe land on which they (the acts complained of) were committed was his (Jameson\u2019s); and, independently of his having an interest in the profits, the defendant Proffitt did these acts by his license. The law on this subject is laid down in Laugher v. Pointer[104], a case which itself related to a very different matter. Mr. Justice Littledale there says: \u201cThe rule of law may be that in all cases where a man is in possession of fixed property he must take care that his property is so used and managed that other persons are not injured, and that, whether his property be managed by his own immediate servants or by contractors or their servants. The injuries done upon land and buildings are in the nature of nuisances, for which the occupier ought to be chargeable when occasioned by any acts of persons whom he brings upon the premises. The use of the premises is confined by the law to himself, and he should take care not to bring persons there who do any mischief to others.\u201d These observations are exactly in point, and have been cited with approbation in Quarman v. Burnett[105], and Rich v. Basterfield[106]. Now here Jameson was in possession of the property, for he did not demise it to Proffitt, he merely granted to him a revocable license to burn bricks on it. Consequently he has brought Proffitt on his land and allowed him to commit a nuisance, and for this I hold he is liable to be sued in equity as Well as at law.\nIn Attorney General v. Tod-Heatley[107], it was held by the Court of Appeal (Lindley L.J., A. L. Smith L.J., and Rigby L.J.) that it is the common law duty of the owner of vacant land to prevent it from being a public nuisance. That case had to do with the obligation of the owner of the land to prevent it from continuing to be a public nuisance by reason of the depositing thereon of offensive material to the annoyance of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\nIt is true that in Hardaker v. Idle District Council[108], where it was sought to charge the local authority with liability for damages caused by the negligence of its contractor in building a sewer upon a street under its statutory authority, A. L. Smith L.J., said, as to the principle which had been referred to or considered in the cases above quoted and in Rapson v. Cubitt[109]:\nIt was not contended at the bar that such a liability had any application to the present case, and indeed, if it had, it would impose a very onerous obligation upon local authorities, which, so far as I know, it has never before been attempted to impose upon them when executing works by their contractor in a public street.\nI do not think however that this observation was intended to apply, either to an occupation of the street permitted by the municipal corporation for unauthorized purposes, or to vacant lands in the possession and under the administration of a local authority, which, although laid out and appropriated for a street, have not been formed into a street or utilized by the local authority for any purpose, or, as in this case, cannot in their existing condition be used for street purposes. The site of the nuisance here was vacant, unimproved land of the city, as to which, although its ultimate destination may have been a street, the city would, without hardship, incur the obligation of an individual proprietor to see that the land was not in the meantime used in a manner to cause a nuisance.\nIn Harris v. James[110], the action was against the owner and tenant of a field by the occupier of adjoining land for injury caused to his land by the smoke from certain limekilns and by stones thrown upon it in the process of blasting the limestone in the field, which the owner had leased to the tenant for the purpose of its being worked as a lime quarry. The ordinary way of getting the limestone was by means of blasting, and the owner had authorized the quarrying of the stone and the erection of lime-kilns in the field. It was held by Blackburn J., upon demurrer, that the landlord was liable, although the nuisance was actually created by the act of his tenant, because the terms of the demise constituted an authority from him to the tenant to create the nuisance, which was therefore the necessary consequence of the mode of occupation contemplated in the demise.\nIn the present case, in like manner, the city, by its contract with Moses, authorized his occupation and use of the area laid out for excavation upon Newman\u2019s Brook, and the blasting and the bringing of the usual and necessary explosives upon the premises. The city was the owner or in occupation or had the control of that part of the road allowance set off and appropriated to Adelaide street, which was vacant and not built up for use and was not used or, in its unimproved state, capable of use as a highway. It was necessary that a reasonably safe and convenient place should be provided for the storing of the dynamite which was requisite for the blasting of the channel. No place of any sort had been provided by the city, and, when the work of excavation was about to commence, the contractor brought thither his tools and materials, including some dynamite, and deposited them upon this vacant land of the city, and constructed there a shed to receive them, in which he stored the tools and the dynamite. It is difficult to perceive how the contractor could reasonably have proceeded with his work without a magazine of some description located conveniently to the work. The contract contemplated that the contractor might be in possession of land other than that actually belonging to the site of the excavation. He contracted\nnot to use the land forming the site of or connected with the works for any other purpose whatsoever than the proper carrying on of the works; * * * from time to time to remove all surplus and objectionable materials, waste or rubbish from the works, and from any land or premises where any portion of the work may be carried on.\nThe city retained large powers of supervision and direction under the contract.\nI think it may be assumed that the shed was not built without the knowledge and approval of the city, and that it was a consequence, not improbable, of the location and building of the shed, which the city should have realized, that the explosives for the work would be kept there. It follows upon the authorities that the city cannot escape responsibility for the use which, for the purposes of the work, the contractor made of the shed, amounting to a public nuisance upon the property of the city. I come to this conclusion not because the contractor was the agent or servant of the city, nor because he was an independent contractor who had contracted with the city to execute for its benefit a dangerous work, but because the damage complained of ensued from a nuisance permitted or tolerated, if not authorized, upon its property which the city was by the common law bound to prevent.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John B.

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nPetrea Yorga (Defendant) Respondent.\n1926: February 8, 9; 1926: May 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nSale of goods\u2014Steam engine\u2014Purchaser unable to read English\u2014Farm Implement Act, Sask., R.S.S. 1920, c. 128\u2014Requirements of s. 18\u2014 Effect of non-compliance with s. 18\u2014Effect of taking, retention, and use, of engine by purchaser.\nSection 18 of The Farm Implement Act, Sask. (R.S.S. 1920, c. 128), implies a prohibition against taking a contract for the purchase of a \u201clarge implement\u201d from any person who cannot read in English, without first having such contract read over and explained to him in a language which he understands. A contract of purchase taken by the vendor without compliance with the section is not enforceable. On the sale of an engine the purchaser, a Roumanian, could not read English. The contract was read to him in English and some explanation given to him in. Roumanian of certain clauses which he said he was unable to understand when read to him in English.\nHeld (Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting) that, upon the evidence in the case, English was not a language which the purchaser \u201cunderstood\u201d within the meaning of s. 18; that the vendor\u2019s action on the contract could not be maintained; and that, in the circumstances, the vendor could not succeed on an implied contract to take and pay for the engine on a quantum meruit basis. The court did not interfere with the order below enjoining the purchaser, as incident to his obligation, to return the engine and to account for such benefits as had accrued to him from its possession.\nSemble, as the purchaser could not understand portions of the contract when read to him in English, the vendor was bound to have the entire contract read and explained to him in some other language (not necessarily this native tongue) which he understood sufficiently to enable him to appreciate the purport and effect of the contract to the extent to which an English-speaking person in his walk of life would be likely to appreciate them upon the contract being read over and explained to him in English.\nPer Duff and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting) : On the evidence and findings at trial it must be taken that the contract, previous to its being signed, was read over and explained to the purchaser in a language which he understood sufficiently to become aware thereby of the meaning of the contract, which is all the statute requires.\nPer Newcombe J. (dissenting) : If there were any defect in the explanation which the statute contemplates, the contract became thereby no worse than voidable at the purchaser\u2019s option, and, by his length of possession and extent of use of the engine, the purchaser had lost the right of avoidance.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] which reversed the judgment of Embury J. in favour of the appellant in an action to recover the first instalment of the purchase price of a steam engine sold by the appellant to the respondent under an agreement in writing in the form prescribed by s. 12 of The Farm Implement Act of Saskatchewan (R.S.S. 1920, c. 128). The main questions for the consideration of the court on this appeal were whether, on the facts, there had been compliance with the provisions of s. 18 of The Farm Implement Act (which section provides for what must be done in the event of the purchaser not being able to read in the English language, and is set out in full in the judgments) and what are the consequences of non-compliance with such provisions.\nBastedo for the appellant.\nGregory K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault and Rinfret JJ. was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff company carrying on business at Regina by an agreement in writing in the form prescribed by s. 12 of The Farm Implement Act (R.S.S., 1920, c. 128) purported to sell a Rumeley steam engine to the defendant for the sum of $3,000, payable in three instalments of $1,000 each with interest on the first of October, 1923, the first of October, 1924, and the first of October, 1925, the payments to be secured by lien notes. This action is brought to recover the first of such instalments and interest amounting to $1,028.25. Various defences were pleaded. At the trial, by amendment, the defendant was allowed to set up non-compliance with s. 18 of The Farm Implement Act as a further answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nThe learned trial judge found that the requirements of s. 18 had been sufficiently observed and gave judgment for the sum of $1,000 and costs. The Court of Appeal, holding the contrary, dismised the action with costs and ordered repayment of $66 advanced by the defendant for sales tax and delivery up to him of the lien notes, but directed that the defendant should account to the plaintiff for any benefit he may have received from the use of the engine, the amount thereof to be ascertained by the trial judge if the parties should be unable to agree. Special leave to appeal to this court was subsequently granted by the Court of Appeal.\nThe questions for determination here are the construction of s. 18; whether there has been compliance with its requirements; if not, the effect of non-compliance on the plaintiff\u2019s rights; and, if the contract should be held unenforceable, what rights the plaintiff has arising out of the taking, retention and use of the engine by the defendant. Section 18 reads as follows:\n18. (1) In the event of the purchaser not being able to read in the t English language the contract shall, before it is signed by him, be read over and explained to him in a language which he understands, and in such case the burden of proving that the said contract was so read over and explained to him, shall be on the vendor.\n(2) An affidavit to the effect that the deponent has, within eight days preceding the taking of the affidavit, read over and explained the contract to the purchaser prior to his signature thereto, in a language which the purchaser understood, shall, upon proof of the signature of the officer before whom such affidavit purports to be sworn and that he was an officer authorized to take such affidavit, be received in evidence in all courts as conclusive proof of all facts sworn to therein.\nIt is noteworthy that while the consequences of noncompliance with the directions of s. 18 are not stated, such provisions are found in ss. 12 and 28, the former of which declares invalid and ineffective any contract which is not in the form by it prescribed, while the latter declares void at the option of the purchaser any contract, order or security containing certain stipulations which it prohibits.\nNevertheless, when the object of s. 18 is considered and due attention is paid to its provision that the burden of proving compliance with it shall be upon the vendor, the implication of a prohibition against taking a contract for the purchase of \u201ca large implement\u201d from any person who cannot read in English, without first having such contract read over and explained to him in a language which he understands is, we think, indubitable. In the case of such a statutory enactment we doubt whether there is any sound distinction to be drawn between the implied negative requirement that there shall not be a contravention of a positive direction and a direct prohibition, Bensley v. Bignold[2]. The affirmative direction of the enactment now in question is so clearly mandatory and the attainment of its object\u2014the protection of buyers unable to read English \u2014makes the implication of negative words of prohibition so manifestly necessary that\nthe duty of the courts to try and get at the real intent of the legislature\nrequires that implication to be made. Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner[3]; Stevens v. Gourley[4]. Assuming for the moment that the contract sued upon was not read over and explained to the defendant (who admittedly could not read English) as the statute prescribed, we have here a contract to the enforcement of which by the vendor no court of justice should lend its aid. Cope v. Rowlands[5]; Forster v. Taylor[6]; Melliss v. Shirley Local Board[7]. In his esteemed work on the Principles of Contract, Sir Frederick Pollock says, 9th edition, at p. 361:\nWhen conditions are prescribed by statute for the conduct of any particular business or profession, and such conditions are not observed, agreements made in the course of such business or profession\u2014\n(e) are void if it appears by the context that the object of the legislature in imposing the condition was the maintenance of public order or safety or the protection of the persons dealing with those on whom the condition is imposed.\nMoreover, although the contract should not be avoided, it would almost seem to be an inevitable implication of the provision that\nthe burden of proving that the said contract was so read over and explained to him shall be on the vendor,\nthat in the event of his failing to discharge such burden any curial proceeding on his part based upon the contract must fail.\nBut was there non-compliance with s. 18? The contract was read to the defendant only in English. There is no suggestion that it was read in any other language. Some explanation was given to him in Roumanian (his native tongue) of certain clauses which he said he was unable to understand when read to him in English. The learned trial judge found that the defendant \u201cunderstood English to a considerable extent\u201d; that he \u201ccould understand it to some extent\u201d; and again that of English \u201che had some knowledge\u201d. In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Lamont\u2019s view was that the defendant \u201cunderstood (English) only to a slight extent\u201d. Our appreciation of the evidence on this point accords with that of Lamont, J. A. We think that English was not a language which the defendant understood within the meaning of s. 18. Furthermore, we incline to the view that the defendant being unable to understand portions of the contract when read to him in English, the vendor was bound to have the entire contract read to him and explained to him in some other language (not necessarily, however, his native tongue) which he understood at least sufficiently to enable him to appreciate the purport and effect of the contract to the extent to which an English-speaking person in his walk of life would be likely to appreciate them upon the contract being read over and explained to him in English. We find ourselves in accord with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Lamont on this aspect of the case, and we are of the opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s action on the contract cannot be maintained.\nUnder the circumstances of this case we think that the plaintiff cannot succeed on an implied contract to take and pay for the engine on a quantum meruit basis. The taking, retention of possession and use of the engine were attributable to the unenforceable contract sued upon. The defendant would appear not to have had any idea of his right to set up the invalidity of that contract for non-compliance with s. 18 of The Farm Implement Act until at or about the time of the trial of this action. Britain v. Rossiter[8], We are not disposed to interfere with the order enjoining, the defendant, as incident to his obligation to return the, engine, to account for such benefits as may have accrued to him from its possession. On this aspect of the case we accept the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J, (dissenting).\u2014I concur with the view of my brother Newcombe that the contract was adequately explained to the respondent and understood by him, and that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of the statute. As to the effect of non-compliance, I prefer, to express no decided opinion.\nNewcombe J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) sues to recover the amount of a lien note, $1,000, and $28.85 for interest, made by the respondent (defendant) to secure an installment of the price payable by him upon the purchase of a Rumely steam engine, evidenced by statutory agreement in writing, dated 21st July, 1923. The statement of claim was delivered on 30th November, 1923, and the action came to trial on 6th December, 1924. The question in controversy depends upon the facts and the effect of s. 18 of the Farm Implement Act, 1917, of Saskatchewan, consolidated as c. 128 of the Revised Statutes, 1920. This Act, as its title denotes, regulates the sale of farm implements in the province; the engine which was the subject of the sale is a machine of the class which is described as \u201clarge implements\u201d. The Act requires that, all vendors selling, or offering for sale, large implements in Saskatchewan shall file with the Minister of Agriculture in each year a description of the implements offered for sale, with the statutory particulars, including prices; also a list of all repairs required for the implements sold by them, stating the prices and places in Saskatchewan where they may be purchased, and a penalty is provided for neglect to file the list; also, by s. 11, it is enacted that no repairs shall, be sold at a higher price for cash than the price stated in the list, and that any person charging a higher price shall be guilty of an offence, and liable upon summary conviction to a fine of $25.\nSection 12 provides that no contract for the sale of any large implement shall be valid, and no action shall be taken in any court for the recovery of the whole or part of the purchase price of any such implement, unless the contract be in writing in form A in the schedule, and signed by the parties thereto. The contract was in the statutory form, There is another form, C, in the schedule which applies to the sale of second-hand implements; by s. 16, it is provided that the latter form shall not be used for the sale of new implements, and that,\nin case such form is so used, the contract shall be void at the option of the purchaser.\nIn form A, the vendor warrants that the machinery is well, made and of good materials; that it will work well; be durable; that all necessary repairs will be available for ten, years, etc. In form C, no warranties are set out, and it is expressly stipulated that the vendor gives no warranties other than those, if any, which are specially agreed for. By s. 17, it is provided that form A, shall not be used for second-hand or rebuilt implements,\nbut, in case such form is so used, then the same shall be conclusive evidence that the implement so sold is, or is warranted to be, a new one.\nSection 18 follows, and it is embraced in two subsections, the one for the benefit of the purchaser, and the other for the benefit of the seller. The section may conveniently be reproduced:\n18. (1) In the event of the purchaser not being able to read in the English language the contract ehall, before it is signed by him, be read over and explained to him in a language which he understands, and in such case the burden of proving that the said contract was so read over and explained to him shall be upon the vendor.\n(2) An affidavit to the effect that the deponent has, within eight days preceding the taking of the affidavit, read over and explained the contract to the purchaser prior to his signature thereto, in a language which the purchaser understood, shall, upon proof of the signature of the officer before whom such affidavit purports to be sworn and that he was an officer authorized to take such affidavit, be received in evidence in all courts as conclusive proof of all the facts sworn to therein.\nSection 19 provides that\nthe signing of such contract by the purchaser shall not bind him to purchase the implement * * *\nuntil the contract shall have been signed by the vendor or, his agent\nand a copy thereof is delivered to or deposited in a post office addressed to the purchaser, postage prepaid and registered.\nThis evidently refers to the contract mentioned in subs. 1 of s. 18 which the purchaser cannot read in English, and it will be observed that it applies to all such contracts; there is no express exception of those which have not been read over and explained.\nSection 28 is not without some relevancy; it provides that no contract made in connection with the sale of agricultural implements shall contain any statement to the effect that the vendor is not responsible for the representations of his agents, or any other language in anywise limiting or modifying the legal liability of the vendor as provided in the Act or the forms, and it is said that\nthe insertion of any such statement, or the use of any such language, shall be of no effect.\nThen follows subs. 2, whereby it is provided that\nany breach of the provisions of this section shall render the contract, order or security, void at the option of the purchaser.\nThe respondent by his defence denied the making of the agreement and the delivery of the engine, and he alleged that the engine delivered was not a new machine, and that, immediately upon discovering this, he advised the appellant, and asked for a return of the notes which he had given to accompany the contract. He alleged further that the respondent, at the time of making the contract, falsely and fraudulently represented to him that the engine was a new engine of the latest model, and that he executed the contract so believing, whereas the engine was not new, nor of the latest model; and he submitted to return the engine, and claimed the return of his notes. These issues were rightly determined against the respondent at the trial, and are not controverted at bar upon this appeal. The learned trial judge found that there were no misrepresentations; that the engine, although six years in stock had not been used; was not second-hand; that it was a good engine, and that\nthe results of its work showed that it performed the work it was called upon to do in a satisfactory manner, such as would be expected of a new engine.\nThe only other question is one raised by amendment at the trial, on 6th December, 1924, that the defendant,\nnot being able to read in the English language, the contract was not read over to him as required by s. 18 of the Farm Implement Act.\nIt becomes necessary to decide whether, having regard to the true interpretation of this section and the evidence and findings, the right of recovery is defeated by reason of the facts with relation to the reading and explanation of the contract before its signature.\nAs to this defence, the learned trial judge found that:\nThe evidence established that he (the respondent) carried on the ordinary small transactions in which he might be engaged, without the aid of an interpreter. He told the interpreter, who was present to explain the contract before it was signed, \u201che could understand but he could not talk back.\u201d As a fact in this case the defendant appears to have understood the meaning of the contract. True, he cannot read English, but he can understand it to some extent, and he received in another language of which he had a more complete understanding all the explanation that was necessary to give him a knowledge of the contents of the document; and he could have had an explanation in this last-mentioned language of every phrase in the contract, but as he said to the interpreter, he \u201cunderstood but could not talk back.\u201d In all the circumstances, the defendant apparently having in fact understood, and not having been deceived, and having received all the explanations he was desirous of having, and in the \u2018additional circumstances of his having had a considerable knowledge of the English language, it seems to me that there was a sufficient compliance with the provisions of section 18, subsection 1, of the Farm Implements Act above referred to\u2014certainly there was compliance with the spirit of the law.\nLearned counsel for the defence urged with some force that section 18, subsection 1, was enacted for the protection of men such as the defendant, and that it was designed to compel the interpreting and reading of this document to such persons in their own foreign native tongue; but in this case the document was read in English, of which he had some knowledge, and those parts of it which he understood after hearing them in English were not interpreted, but the other parts which he did not understand were explained to him in his own language, which in my opinion constitutes sufficient interpretation.\nThe Court of Appeal was however of the opinion that, the respondent being unable to read English, there had been in fact no compliance with the legislative requirement that the contract should be read over and explained in a language which the purchaser understood before it was signed by him, and that this\nprevented any contract from coming into existence or any property passing under the agreement signed.\nNow while the question of statutory intention is not free from difficulty, it appears to me that s. 18 of the Farm Implement Act is not designed to make utterly void a contract executed in the manner in which this one was executed. There is no penalty imposed for neglect to comply, neither is there any enactment as to what shall be the consequence of non-compliance. In order to ascertain the meaning, the other provisions of the Act may be considered, and, in ascertaining what is left to implications, s. 18 must be interpreted in the light of the inferences which may be legitimately drawn. We have seen that in other sections there are express declarations as to what the effect of noncompliance shall be. There is a pecuniary penalty, recoverable upon summary conviction, for neglect to file a list of implements, and another for overcharging for repairs. It is declared that no contract for the sale of a large implement shall be valid or enforcible unless the contract be in writing in the prescribed form and signed by the parties; that a contract for the sale of a new implement in the form prescribed for the sale of second-hand implements shall be void at the option of the purchaser; that if the form for sale of large implements be used for second-hand or rebuilt implements it shall be conclusive evidence that the implement so sold is, or is warranted to be, new; that, if any contract contain a statement to the effect that the vendor is not responsible for the representations of his agents, that shall have no effect, or render the contract void, at the option of the purchaser, and moreover, by s. 30, it is provided that certain explanatory words in the forms are merely directory.\nThus we have, in this short statute of thirty-one sections, a number of provisions, mandatory in form, affecting the substance or contents of the contract, and visited by a variety of consequences, expressly declared, which include a pecuniary penalty; some that may be fatal to the validity of the contract; others which may be insisted upon only at the purchaser\u2019s election, and others which do not affect the operation of the instrument; but, as to the particular enactment in question, which prescribes a requirement to be observed in the making of the contract in special cases, while there is no express penalty for neglect, it is declared that the burden to prove compliance is placed upon the vendor, and that the purchaser is not to be bound until the contract shall have been signed by the vendor, and a copy delivered or posted to the purchaser. The consequence of non-compliance should, in the absence of expression, be ascertained reasonably, having regard to the apparent object of the clause in this particular statute. Section 18, subs. 1, is obviously intended to furnish a direction as to the manner of making the contract when the purchaser is unable to read English, and the effect of it, so far as declared, is, in such a case, if the issue be raised, to impose a burden of proof upon the vendor to show that the contract was read over and explained to the purchaser in a language which he understood, and, together with s. 19, to postpone the obligation of the purchaser until the signing of the contract and delivery or posting of a copy by the vendor. The transaction itself is perfectly legal. It is not like a case of a contract declared to be illegal, as under the Gaming Acts or the Marine Insurance Act, where the court is bound to take notice and pronounce the illegality. The plaintiff may fail in his action if he do not, when the reading and explanation is denied, satisfy the burden of proof with which he is charged by the statute, but not because of any vice of the contract itself. Wetherell v. Jones[9]. Indeed, so far from evincing an intention that the contract shall be void for lack of reading and explanation, it is expressly provided, by subs. 2, that an affidavit to the effect that the deponent, within eight days previously, read over and explained the contract to the purchaser, prior to his signature, in a language which the latter understood, shall, upon proof of the signature and authority of the attesting officer, be received in evidence as conclusive proof of all the facts sworn to therein. The provisions of this section, taken as a whole, are thus in effect apt to operate for the benefit of the vendor at least as much as for that of the purchaser, since they include a very convenient and effectual means whereby the vendor may conclusively silence any controversy as to the reading of the instrument and the understanding of the purchaser of the language in which it was read and explained. The provision of subs. 2 seems inapt to accompany a clause making void for motives of public policy a contract which a purchaser is willing to accept.\nMoreover the provision which requires reading and explanation must be applied having regard to the facts of the particular case; the extent or character of the explanation must necessarily be affected by the needs or circumstances of the case. No public duty or claim of society is prejudiced by withholding explanation of what is already understood, and if, as is found, the purchaser, appearing to understand, received all the explanation which he desired, and which was necessary to enable him to understand the contract, it would seem to be unjust that he should, after taking the benefit of the contract, be permitted to avoid it for lack of explanation, and this I think is true apart from the application of the rule which is sanctioned by the maxim cuilibet licet renuntiare juri pro se introducto.\nNow, although no affidavit was introduced, facts are proved and found by the trial judge which satisfy the burden of proof as to the reading and explanation. I accept the findings upon the evidence; they are reasonably supported by the proof, and therefore ought not to be disturbed. I cannot agree that it is necessary, in order to satisfy the statute, that the contract should be read in the purchaser\u2019s native tongue, or in a language other than English, provided he have an adequate understanding of the latter. The purchasers who share in the benefit of the section are not of a class from which the legislature would expect anything better than an imperfect, though practical, knowledge of language; it applies as well to the illiterate Canadian or Englishman as to the foreigner, and it is utterly indifferent in what language the contract is read and explained if that language be sufficiently familiar in its reading to give the purchaser an understanding of the stipulations. The reading undoubtedly took place. There, was no attempt to defraud or to over-reach. The respondent, although he could not read English, was in the habit of transacting his business orally in that language, and it was the speech of the community in which he had lived for fifteen years. He had been for one year a pound-keeper. He had a large family of children, including some boys who had been at school and could read and speak English. One of these was a grown up son, who, I suppose, might -conveniently have accompanied his father, when he went to buy a steam engine, if the latter had considered himself in any difficulty about the language. At his examination for discovery, his son was his interpreter. At the trial the respondent pretended that he did not understand the meaning of simple questions in English, but the judge evidently considered that this was pretence; and, at the conclusion of the trial, he said he thought the respondent spoke English about as well as Bodgan, the Roumanian who was called in to interpret at the making of the contract, which, as he observed, was not very well. Bodgan, was a young Roumanian who had been brought up in Canada and lived here for twenty years. He was called in on the occasion of the making of the contract to assist in the negotiations. He was not a skilled interpreter, his knowledge of English was indeed somewhat meagre, but he appears to have had a practical working knowledge of both languages, and, when the contract was read, he did explain or interpret some of the passages, and would have given further explanations, but that the respondent appeared to understand and gave his assurance that he did so.\nIt is a fact moreover, not immaterial to the respondent\u2019s understanding of the contract, that he had previously signed similar contracts under the Farm Implement Act. He was a Roumanian immigrant who came to the country in 1908. He had previously purchased farm machinery, an American-Abell engine in 1912, a separator in 1916, and a gas tractor in 1920, and he was not unaccustomed to contracts and lien notes. Although he received copy of the contract for the engine in question early in August, 1923, and it has ever since been in his possession, he testified that he had never discussed the terms of it with anybody. Maloney, the appellant\u2019s agent, who negotiated the sale to the respondent, had conversed with the latter in English as long ago as 1913, and the preliminary conversation was, on the occasion of the present sale, carried on between the respondent and Maloney in English. It must be remembered also that the respondent\u2019s defence is not that he did not understand the contract, or the reading of it in English, but that the contract was not read to him in any language; there is however the evidence of three witnesses for the appellant that the contract was read; the trial judge finds that it was read; and he expressly rejects the testimony of, the respondent as to the condition of the engine, where it is contradicted by the witnesses for the appellant. There was considerable evidence adduced for the appellant, uncontradicted by the respondent, of the latter\u2019s understanding of English in reference to various transactions in which he had been concerned, and the learned judge, whose findings upon this branch of the case are I think of special weight, refers to his statement to Bogdan, which is not explicitly denied, that \u201che could understand but could not talk back\u201d.\nTherefore I think it must be taken that, previously to the signing of the contract, it was read over and explained to the respondent in a language which he understood sufficiently to become aware thereby of the meaning of the contract; and that I think is the object of the legislature, and all that the statute requires.\nIt was on 21st July that the contract was signed. It calls for delivery of one 16 H.P. D. C. Rumely steam engine, rear mounted, with standard equipment, and the purchase of an engine of that description is admitted by the respondent. There is no dispute about the terms of the contract, no charge that the respondent did not perfectly understand the transaction. His complaint is that the engine which was delivered was one which had been previously in use or second-hand, an objection which has nothing to do with, the terms of the contract, and that objection was communicated by the respondent to the appellant by telegram of 12th October, 1923, when the respondent, after having used the engine for his own harvest and for that of some of his neighbours, the season\u2019s work being then nearly completed, sent to the appellant company the following message:\nEngine sold this fall as new one send a man at once to settle up matter for this engine having been sold as new one and we found that she had been in use already look over before threshing done we can prove that it is a second-hand one.\nThe engine had been shipped in due course from Regina to the respondent at Limerick, where it arrived about 5th August. The respondent examined it for two hours on the flat car before unloading it. Then he paid the freight took it home and began his threshing on 6th September. The appellant company had sent him, by registered post on 8th August, a copy of the contract as required by s. 19 of the Farm Implement Act. Thus, not only is it found that the respondent understood, but he took possession of the machine, and, although he was furnished with copy of the contract as the statute requires, and is presumed to know, the law, he used the engine for the season, threshing 24,-500 bushels of grain, and gave no notice of intention to assert the alleged statutory invalidity of the contract until the trial of the action.\nI think there was a contract, and that the appellant satisfied the burden of proof. Moreover I think that, if, there were any defect in the explanation which the statute contemplates, the contract became thereby no worse than voidable at the purchaser\u2019s option, and that, after having possession of the engine for a year and more, and having used it to the extent to which he did use it, it is too late for the purchaser to exercise the right of avoidance.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackenzie, Thom, Bastedo and Jackson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

Welton & Saffery [1897] A.C. 299, at 321-322, explained.\nThe company in question was incorporated by special Act which contained no reference to The Sale of Shares Act. It contained many provisions, one of which, s. 26, provided that \u201cevery person who makes application in writing for an allotment of shares, to whom any share or shares is or are allotted in pursuance of such application, shall be deemed conclusively to have agreed to become a shareholder of the company in respect of the shares so allotted.\u201d\nHeld, that the Sale of Shares Act applied as to the matters in question, and s. 26 did not affect its operation or prevent the purchaser from disputing his liability as a shareholder.

R. 342; [1924] 2 W.W.R. 1145) ) overruled. Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirming an order of Dysart J. placing the appellant upon the list of contributories of The Northwestern Trust Company, which is being wound-up under the Winding-up Act R.S.C. 1906, c. 144, and amendments. The decision of the courts below was governed by a previous decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, in the matter of three shareholders of the same company. See In re Northwestern Trust Company; In re Moreau et al[1] reversing (Prendergast and Trueman J.J.A. dissenting) the judgment of Dysart J. who had refused to place the parties on the list of contributories[2]. An appeal in that case was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada but was quashed for want of jurisdiction. In the present case, as Dysart J. was bound by the decision in In re Moreau et al1, he placed the appellant on the list of contributories, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal from his order was dismissed. The appellant obtained leave to appeal to this court, the amount involved being sufficient under the Winding-up Act. The reasons for judgment to be considered on this appeal were those delivered in In re Moreau et al1 to which the learned judges of the Court of Appeal referred as the grounds of their decision in this case. The proceedings were brought upon a stated case agreed to toy the parties. In substance this stated case set out as follows: The Northwestern Trust Company was incorporated by c. 170 of the Statutes of 1920, Manitoba, and had its head office in Winnipeg. By order dated 17th March, 1924, the company was directed to be wound up, and the liquidator applied to have appellant placed on the list of contributories for the sums of $5,400 and $1,000 in respect of two subscriptions for stock for 50 and 10 shares respectively, of the par value of $100 each, at the price of $125 per share. On its incorporation the company had only a part of its capital stock subscribed, and it authorized two of its officers, McCabe and Maber, to procure subscribers for and sell, offer and attempt to sell all of the shares in the capital not then subscribed for. McCabe and Maber engaged one Shallott and one Brand to offer for sale, attempt to sell and sell the stock. Brand offered for sale and attempted to sell shares to various persons and on 21st September, 1922, offered 50 shares to appellant at Winnipeg and by his efforts induced him to sign an application for these shares and appellant paid therewith $550. On 20th November, 1922, Shallott offered 10 shares to appellant at Winnipeg and by his efforts induced him to sign an application for these shares and appellant paid therewith $250. These applications and payments were transmitted to the company, the stock allotted to appellant, and notice thereof given to him. The company made an application to the Public Utility Commissioners for Manitoba under The Sales of Shares Act, R.S.M., 1913, c. 175, and amending Acts, for permission and authority to offer and attempt to sell, and sell its shares, but the application was not granted and the company did not comply with the provisions of the said statute and never filed the papers required by the Act and never obtained a certificate under the Act nor a license for its agents. Neither McCabe, Maber, Shallott nor Brand had a license under The Sale of Shares Act as agents for the company. The appellant was not aware until after the winding-up order had issued that the company had not secured a certificate and its agents had not a license as aforesaid or that the provisions of the said Sale of Shares Act had not been complied with. The question submitted was \u201cIs the said Neil McAskill [appellant] liable in the absence of other defence for any sum under the alleged subscriptions * * * and to be settled on the list of contributories herein therefor\u201d? Further material facts, and a detailed reference to the provisions of the special Act incorporating the company will be found in the judgment of Mignault J. S. 26 of said special Act which, among other things, was relied upon by the liquidator, is set out in the headnote, which also indicates the other questions considered by the court.\nH. M. Hannesson and J. F. McCallum for the appellant.\nE. Lafleur K.C. and P. C. Locke for the respondent. Anglin C. J. C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for the province of Manitoba in a matter wherein a question was raised by the appellant as to his liability as a shareholder in said trust company to pay the balance due by him upon certain shares he had acquired as the result of two distinctly separate applications in writing to the board of directors of said trust company for stock in same, and in response to each of which he had been by said board duly allotted the shares so applied for.\nThe liquidator appointed under said Winding-up Act when seeking to enforce the rights of the creditors of said company took steps therefor against the appellant and many others to recover the respective balances due by each of such like subscribers as the appellant.\nThey each set up a rather remarkable defence under the provisions of the Manitoba Sale of Shares Act, and were successful before the judge hearing the applications and, in each of four such cases, an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba.\nThat court by a majority allowed the liquidator\u2019s appeal with costs.\nFrom said judgment as against appellant he now appeals herein.\nI so fully agree with the said view taken by said majority that, for the reasons respectively assigned by the Honourable Chief Justice Perdue, and the Honourable Justices Fullerton and Dennistoun, I am of the opinion that said appeal should be dismissed with costs against said appellant.\nI, therefore, do not see much to be gained by repeating herein their several reasons or extending the course of reason by making new points, or trying to do so.\nI only desire to point out that the said Sale of Shares Act was enacted some ten years or more before the special Act in question herein and had been radically amended several times, but had got into a settled form such as it had been for some years before the Manitoba legislature created said trust company by a special Act of said legislature, being chapter 170 of Manitoba Statutes, for 1920, at great length assigning the powers it desired to confer upon the said trust company. In course thereof there are so many provisions in conflict with those of the Sale of Shares Act and inconsistent therewith, when one looks at their respective purview and realizes such inconsistency and conflict that, as a matter of elementary law, full effect must be given to the later legislation whenever there is any such conflict or inconsistency.\nSection 26 of said special Act has been much relied upon as binding appellant.\nThe said Sale of Shares Act has given certain stringent powers to the commissioner appointed thereunder and requires returns to him, but in the 22nd section of said special Act returns are to be annually made to the department of the Provincial Secretary. I cannot imagine such a duplication being deemed necessary by any legislature. It is one of several analogous provisions which I find in said special Act as quite unlikely to be enacted therein if the legislature ever thought the Sale of Shares Act was to apply in the way appellant contends.\nLet anyone read the whole Act section by section and try to grasp the purview of the whole, and that of the Sale of Shares Act, and apply the law as set forth in the numerous decisions cited in Craie\u2019s 1901 Edition of Hardcastle\u2019s Statute Law, on pages 228, 344, 501 and 502, when dealing therein with the repugnancy between later and earlier statutes and, I submit, he will find it difficult to maintain appellant\u2019s pretensions herein.\nIt would be interesting to know something more anent the alleged application of the company in question, referred to in the eleventh paragraph of the stated case herein, than appears.\nThe bald facts in said eleventh paragraph without any date of the alleged application are not very satisfying and indeed such that I can attach no importance thereto, save that therein is the clear implication that nobody was ever given a licence under the Sale of Shares Act to sell shares in said company.\nIts bald presentation and circuitous expression suggest a suspicion that possibly the directors started out with the impression that possibly they should get for their agents, such like licences as in question, and were told, either by the commissioner, or some other good authority, that said company specially created as a trust company by the legislature, and the many sections in the Act doing so, which would conflict with such an obligation as the Sale of Shares Act had imposed upon other companies had rendered it absurd to appoint licensees to sell shares in its stock.\nThis suggestion of mine is not of the slightest consequence; save in looking at the said Sale of Shares Act and if at all applicable, when considering the consequences of its non-observance, and the bearing thereof herein upon the liability of such subscribers as in question upon their respective contracts and validity or invalidity of such shares as allotted them in said trust company\u2019s stock.\nIt is to be noted in this connection that there is nothing in said Act expressly rendering the stock void, and the inferences of law applicable might be very different when dealing with an obviously honest error and a brazen defiance of the law.\nDuff J.\u2014Speaking with the greatest respect, I cannot concur with the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, that s. 26 of the special statute of the Northwest Trust Company affects the operation, as concerns that company, of the Sale of Shares Act. The Sale of Shares Act is an enactment of general application, intended obviously to extend to all companies, whether incorporated under some statute providing generally for the incorporation of Companies, or brought into existence by a special Act. There is nothing in the Northwest Trust Company\u2019s Act to indicate that, speaking broadly, the Sale of Shares Act is not to be observed, and the special statute must be read as containing an implied provision that the company is empowered to do the things authorized, on compliance with the requirements of the earlier legislation. The books are not wanting in precedents for this manner of reading a special Act. The decision of this court in Canadian Niagara Power Co. v. Stamford[3] is one. In this case I thought the view of the majority was wrong, but that view was sustained by the Judicial Committee. Manifestly, s. 26 is not intended to validate an ultra vires agreement. Probably the true reading of it is that, in the circumstances mentioned, the applicant is deemed conclusively to have agreed in point of fact to take the shares allotted to him.\nI have no manner of doubt that the doctrine of ultra vires (if not the doctrine laid down by the House of Lords in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[4], at least the doctrine expounded by Lord Blackburn, then Blackburn J., in the Exchequer Chamber[5] in that case) governs the acts of the company. My reasons for that view are fully given in The Canadian Bank of Commerce v. The Cudworth Rural Telephone Company[6], inclusive, and I will not repeat them here. It is sufficient to say that, if the legislature, in the Sale of Shares Act, has manifested an intention that such a company as this shall not, in the given circumstances, enter into a contract such as the appellant\u2019s contract to take shares, then that contract, although concluded in fact, was an illegal contract, and wholly void, and the act of the company in placing the appellant\u2019s name on the register of shares was unauthorized, and, as concerns the appellant, vis-\u00e0-vis the company, in its legal effect inoperative.\nThe real question to be determined is that to which the majority of the learned judges of the court below addressed themselves, namely, Is the appellant, as a consequence of the winding-up proceedings intervening before any repudiation by him of his status as a shareholder, precluded from denying that status, as against the liquidator in the capacity in which he represents the creditors?\nIn point of law, the appellant never assented to having his name put on the register. There was not merely an assent voidable at the election of the appellant; there was no assent which in law would bind or affect either the company or the appellant. The responsibility of the appellant as contributory arises out of s. 51 of the Winding-up Act, which imposes the liability to contribute upon shareholders or members of a company being wound up. If, in contemplation of law, the appellant was not a shareholder or a member of the company, I do not understand on what principle he is brought within the sweep of that section. The case would, of course, be very different if the appellant were the holder of shares allotted to him pursuant to a contract capable of being rescinded on some proper legal ground, such as fraud, but valid and binding until so rescinded. Such a right may be lost by reason of some change in the circumstances making it unjust to permit the exercise of that right, and accordingly it has been held, and has long been settled law, that a registered shareholder, having a right to rescind his contract to take shares on the ground of misrepresentations contained in the company\u2019s prospectus, will lose that right if he fails to exercise it before the commencement of winding-up proceedings. The basis of this is that the winding-up order creates an entirely new situation, by altering the relations, not only between the creditors and the shareholders, but also among the shareholders inter se. This was the principle of the decision in Oakes v. Tur quand[7], a decision which has been applied many times since. But the rule in Oakes v. Turquand7 has no application where there has never been a concluded agreement to take shares, or where the agreement, though concluded in fact, is, in point of law, a nullity. The principle, in this aspect of it, is lucidly stated in a passage I shall quote from Buckley on Companies, on p. 103 of the tenth edition, a passage reproduced ipsissimis verbis, from the ninth edition, which we have the authority of Lord Wrenbury himself for saying was entirely the work of his own hands:\u2014\nIf the transaction in which a name has been entered on the register is not voidable but void, the decision in Oakes v. Turquand has no application. If the transaction be void, there can be no contract; under such circumstances the fact that a winding up has commenced is no ground for retaining the name on the list of contributories. For the liquidator for enforcing a contract stands only in the place of the company, and cannot enlarge the engagement of the alleged shareholder beyond that which he has entered into. If, therefore, it is shown that the alleged member has never agreed to become a shareholder, if, that is, there is no contract at all, it is immaterial that the name is found on the register at the commencement of the winding-up.\nThe principle has been applied in numerous cases, many of which are discussed in detail in the second volume of Lindley on Companies. It has been applied in cases in which the shares that the company has professed to allot have been such as the company had no power to issue\u2014 such, in other words, as could not in point of law be considered to have a legal existence. In re London and Northern Insurance Corporation; Stace and Worth\u2019s Case[8]. It has been applied where there was no concluded contract, by reason of the failure to notify the applicant of the allotment, by reason of the non-performance of a condition precedent\u2014In re Universal Banking Company; Rogers\u2019 Case[9], or because a condition of the application was not assented to, or was such that the company was incapable of assenting to it\u2014In re Richmond Hill Hotel Company; Pellatt\u2019s Case[10].\nIn particular, where the shareholder has agreed to take paid-up shares, and only paid-up shares, and the company in the circumstances has no power to allot such shares, the applicant will not be treated as a member in respect of the shares allotted to him unless, expressly or by his conduct, he has accepted them. In re Barangah Oil Refining Co; Arnot\u2019s Case[11]; in re Scottish Petroleum Co.[12]; in re Railway Time Tables Publishing Co.; Exparte Sandy[13]. There are no facts in the stated case to support a conclusion that there was a valid contract by conduct between the company and the appellant not falling within the prohibition of the Sale of Shares Act.\nThe view taken in the court below by Mr. Justice Denistoun, which seems also to have been the view of the Ap-lellate Division of Alberta, as expressed in the judgment of Harvey C. J., in in re Great North Insurance Co.[14], was that the failure on part of the appellant to have his name removed from the share register prior to the winding up has the effect of precluding him from disputing his status as a shareholder and contributory in the winding up proceedings. This view is founded chiefly on the passage in the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Welton v. Safferyt[15], and in argument on behalf of the liquidator, it was this passage which was pressed upon us most vigorously in support of the judgment of the court below. The passage is in these words:\nWhy then, I ask, is the appellant to be relieved from the obligation of contributing his proportionate share of the losses of the undertaking? It was said that there was a \u201csocial contract,\u201d to which effect ought to be given now that the rights of creditors are out of the way. There, as it seems to me lies the fallacy. How was the supposed contract made? Who gave the requisite authority for making it? Not the company, nor yet the shareholders. It is beyond the powers of a limited company to limit the liability of shareholders in a manner inconsistent with the conditions of the memorandum of association. The directors, therefore, had no authority from the Company to issue shares at a discount, or on any terms relieving the shareholder from liability to pay in full. The shareholders had no power to authorize the directors to do on behalf of the company that which the company itself could not authorize them to do. The articles of association no doubt empower the directors to issue shares on such terms as they think fit; but that must mean, of course, on such terms as they think fit consistently with the provisions of the Companies Acts. The articles in express terms purport to authorize the directors to issue shares at a discount. That provision, however, is in contravention of the statute of 1862, and simply void; neither the company nor the shareholders, even if they had been unanimous, could have empowered the directors to do anything of the kind. If the directors acted without authority, how can their action bind those who are supposed to have given them authority, but who, in fact, gave them none? The truth is, as it seems to me, that there never was a contract between the company or the shareholders, on the one hand, and the persons to whom these discount shares were offered, on the other. There was an offer by the directors purporting to act on behalf of the company, but it was an offer of that which the company could not give, because the law does not allow it. There was an acceptance by the discount shareholders of that offer. But that offer and acceptance could not constitute a contract. Both parties acted under a misconception of law, and the whole thing was void. The company, however, placed the names of the discount shareholders on the register; they allowed their names to remain there until their remedy against the company was gone; and now they cannot be heard to say that they were not shareholders.\nHere it is made quite clear, not only that it was Lord Macnaghten\u2019s own opinion, but that there was so much unanimity on the subject as to make discussion upon it superflous, that the original allotment, and the contract upon which the allotment was based, were both null; and that this was the view of the other Law Lords is sufficiently clear from the speeches of Lord Watson at pp. 310-11, and of Lord Davey, at pp. 331-2. If that had been the only contract expressed or implied, then, if I am right in what I have already said, Welton was not liable as a contributory, and we should certainly not have had the elaborate arguments and judgments delivered in that case, assuming as an indisputable and undisputed proposition that for the purpose of satisfying the demands of creditors and the costs of winding up, Welton was liable as a contributory. I can find nothing in any of the reports of the case indicating the facts upon which this accepted view rested. I am quite unable to entertain a doubt, however, that the shares had been dealt with, or that the shareholders had acted with respect to the shares in such a way as to create an agreement by conduct to accept them, an agreement not affected by the condition that the shares should be treated as fully paid up. Many considerations can be presented in support of this opinion\u2014considerations which appear to me to be quite conclusive. It is incredible, for one thing, to my mind, that, in the absence of such facts, Welton\u2019s liability, which in such circumstances would appear to have been conclusively negatived by the decision in in re Barangah Oil Refining Co.; Arnot\u2019s Case[16], would have been admitted by everybody, as it was. Then, Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment is not mentioned in Buckley on Companies, as containing anything inconsistent with the passage quoted above, or in the elaborate discussion of the whole subject in Lindley on Companies, as having any relevancy at all to the point now under discussion; or in the edition of 1901 of Rawlins & Macnaghten on Companies, at pp. 331 and 332, where the cases in which a shareholder is entitled to have his name removed from the register after the commencement of the winding up are carefully classified; or, again, in the discussion of the subject in Palmer on Companies. There appears to be abundant justification for thinking that Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment has not been considered to bear the interpretation ascribed to it in the argument of the appellant.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the question submitted answered in the negative.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal by leave of a judge of this court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, affirming an order of Mr. Justice Dysart placing the appellant upon the list of contributories of The Northwestern Trust Co., which is being wound-up under the provisions of the Dominion Winding-up Act. The decision of the courts below, in this case, was governed by a previous decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, in the matter of three shareholders of the same company, to wit, Alfred M. Moreau, Reginald Drayson and Lucy E. Vicary[17]. In those cases, Mr. Justice Dysart had refused to place the parties on the list of contributories, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal (Prendergast and Trueman JJ.A. dissenting). An appeal was then taken to this court, but was quashed for want of jurisdiction, no leave to appeal having been obtained and the amount in each case being under $2,000. In the matter of McAskill, however, a subscription for sixty shares was involved, amounting in nominal value to $6,000., and these shares had been sold to him at a premium, to wit, $125 per share of a nominal value of $100. As Mr. Justice Dysart was bound by the decision in In re Moreau et al., he placed McAskill on the list of contributors, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal from his order was dismissed. Thereupon McAskill obtained leave to appeal to this court, the amount involved being sufficient under the Winding-up Act. The reasons for judgment to be considered on this appeal are those delivered in the cases of Moreau, Drayson and Vicary, to which the learned judges refer as the grounds of their decision in this case.\nThe proceedings were brought upon a stated case agreed to by the parties. In substance, this stated case sets out that The Northwestern Trust Company was incorporated by a Manitoba statute, being chapter 170 of the Statutes of 1920, and had its head office in Winnipeg; that by order, dated the 17th of March, 1924, the company was directed to be wound-up and the liquidator applied to have McAskill placed on the list of contributories in respect of two subscriptions for stock, for 50 and 10 shares respectively, at the price of $125 per share, the balance unpaid thereon being $6,400; that on its incorporation the company had only a part of its capital stock subscribed, and it authorized two of its officers, McCabe and Maber, to procure subscribers for its capital stock not then subscribed for; that McCabe and Maber engaged one Shallott and one Brand to offer for sale and attempt to sell the stock; that Brand offered 50 shares of stock to McAskill at Winnipeg on the 21st of September, 1922, and by his efforts induced him to sign an application for these shares on which McAskill paid $550; that Shallott offered 10 shares of stock to McAskill at Winnipeg on the 20th of November, 1922, and by his efforts induced him to sign an application for these shares on which McAskill paid $250; that these applications were transmitted to the company, the stock allotted to McAskill, and notice thereof given to him; that the company made an application to the Public Utility Commissioners for Manitoba under The Sale of Shares Act, chapter 175 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, and amending Acts, for permission and authority to sell its shares, but the application was not granted, and the company did not comply with the provisions of the said statute and never filed the papers required by the Act and never obtained a certificate under the Act nor a license for its agents; that McCabe, Maber, Shallott and Brand did not at any time have a license under the Act when they offered the shares for sale to McAskill; that McAskill\nwas not aware until after the winding-up order herein had issued that said company had not secured a certificate and its agents had not a license as aforesaid, or that the provisions of the said Sale of Shares Act had not been complied with.\nThe following question is submitted by the stated case:\nIs the said Neil McAskill liable in the absence of other defence for any sum under the alleged subscription for stock marked exhibits 2 and 3, and to be settled on the list of contributories herein therefor?\nBefore making special reference to the charter of the Northwestern Trust Company, it will be convenient to set out as briefly as possible the material provisions of the Sale of Shares Act. This statute was first enacted by the Manitoba legislature in 1912, 2 Geo. V, c. 75, and is chapter 175 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba of 1913. As it stood at the time of the revision of 1913, it applied only to foreign companies, but in 1914, by chapter 105 of the statutes of that year, an important amendment was adopted, striking out the word \u201cforeign\u201d wherever it appeared in the statute, and defining the term \u201ccompany\u201d as including every company, corporation, syndicate of persons, incorporated or unincorporated. The language of section 4 hereinafter quoted was also changed.\nAs a good deal in this case turns on the language of sections 4 and 6, I will quote them in extenso.\nSection 4, as enacted by chapter 105 of the statutes of 1914:\u2014\nIt shall hereafter be unlawful for any person or persons, corporation or company, or any agent acting on his, their or its behalf, to sell or offer to sell, or to directly or indirectly attempt to sell, in the province of Manitoba, any shares, stocks, bonds or other securities of any corporation or company, syndicate or association of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, other than the securities hereinafter excepted, without first obtaining from the Public Utility Commissioner, hereinafter styled \u201cthe commissioner,\u201d a certificate to the effect hereinafter set forth and a license to such agent in the manner hereinafter provided for.\nThe words \u201cother than the securities hereinafter excepted\u201d are a reference to section 5 of the amending statute, the purport of which is stated below.\nSection 6:\u2014\nIt shall not be lawful for any person or any such company, either as principal or agent, to transact any business, in the form or character similar to that set forth in section 4, until such person or such company shall have filed the papers and documents hereinafter provided for. No amendment of the charter, articles of incorporation, constitution and by-laws of any such company shall become operative until a copy of the same has been filed with the commissioner as provided in regard to the original filing of charters, articles of incorporation, constitution and by-laws, nor shall it be lawful for any such company to transact business on any other plan than that set forth in the statement required to be filed by section 7, or to make any contracts other than those shown in the copy of the proposed contracts required to be filed by section 7, until a written statement, showing in full detail the proposed new plan of transacting business, and a copy of the proposed new contract shall have been filed with the commissioner, in like manner as provided in regard to the original plan of business and proposed contract, and the consent of the commissioner obtained as to making such proposed new plan of transacting business and proposed new contract.\nThe prohibition at first extended to all sales or attempted sales of stock however made. But while the scope of the statute was extended in 1914 as above mentioned, the prohibition was restricted by section 5 of the amending statute of that year to sales or attempts to sell made \u201cin the course of continued and successive acts.\u201d What the words just quoted mean is shewn by the rest of section 5 which states:\nThe printing, publication or advertisement in any newspaper, magazine or other periodical, or by any other means of display whatsoever, or the issue, putting forth or distribution of any advertisement, circular letter or other paper containing any offer to sell or solicitation to purchase or intimation of the fact of the issue of any of such shares, bonds, stocks or other securities, or solicitation by agents or employees, shall be evidence of an attempt to sell in the course of continued and successive acts in violation of this Act.\nThe other provisions of the Act, so far as they are pertinent, may be briefly summarized. A company or person desiring to sell any shares must file in the office of the Commissioner (i.e. the Public Utility Commissioner) a statement of the plan on which the company proposes to transact business, a copy of all contracts, bonds or instruments which it proposes to make with or sell to its contributors, an itemized account of its actual financial condition shewing its property and liabilities, and such other information touching its affairs as the commissioner may require (s. 7). These documents are examined by the commissioner who may make or have made a detailed investigation of the company\u2019s affairs; and if he finds that the company is solvent, that its articles of incorporation, its constitution and by-laws, its proposed plan of business and contracts provide a fair plan for the transaction of business and promise a fair return, he issues a certificate reciting that the company has complied with the Act and is permitted to do business in the province. If the Commissioner finds that the articles of incorporation, charter, constitution and by-laws, the plan of business or proposed contracts contain provisions that are unfair, unjust, inequitable or oppressive, or if he decides that the company is not solvent and does not intend to do a fair and honest business, or does not promise a fair return, he notifies it, or the person offering its shares for sale, of his findings, and it shall then be unlawful for the company or any agent on its behalf to sell or offer for sale its shares, bonds or other securities until the company shall change its constitution and by-laws, articles of incorporation, its plan of business and proposed contracts and its general financial condition in such a manner as to satisfy the Commissioner on all these points (s. 10).\nWhen the company has obtained the Commissioner\u2019s certificate, it may appoint one or more agents, but no such agent shall do any business for the company until he has registered with the Commissioner and received a licence from him, which licence shall be produced to every person with whom he proposes to transact business (s. 11). The company shall file with the Commissioner every twelve months, or oftener if required, a statement under oath of its financial condition and of its assets and liabilities. The Commissioner may revoke his certificate if he finds that the assets of the company are impaired and do not equal its liabilities, or that it is conducting business in an unsafe manner, or if the company refuses without satisfactory reasons to file any papers, statements or documents required by the Act or by any order of the Commissioner (s. 12).\nThe Commissioner is granted other powers of investigation of the company\u2019s affairs, and when his finding is adverse to the company on the points mentioned above, he reports the facts to the Attorney General, who may apply to the Court of King\u2019s Bench or to a judge thereof for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of and wind-up the affairs of the company (ss. 13 and 14).\nThe Act provides for a penalty of not less than fifty dollars nor more than five hundred dollars to be recovered from any person who shall do anything forbidden by the Act or declared unlawful by it (s. 15).\nWe now come to the incorporation of the Northwestern Trust Company by a special Act of the Manitoba legislature, chapter 170 of the statutes of 1920.\nIt will not be necessary to do more than refer briefly to some of the salient provisions of this charter which is very long and detailed. The capital stock is $1,000,000 in shares of $100 each, with power to increase it to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000. Stock to the amount of $100,000 must be subscribed and $35,000 paid thereon before the company goes into operation (s. 3). The objects of the company are stated in great detail in section 5 and following and are those generally of a trust company. It is also authorized to act as an executor, administrator, etc., without security when approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Its liability in fulfilling these offices is the same as that of a private person acting in a like capacity, and the whole of its capital stock together with its property and effects are security for the faithful performance of its duties, but no shareholder is liable for more than the amount unpaid on the stock held by him (s. 11). The powers of the directors are also stated in detail, and, inter alia, are to issue stock, make calls thereon and prescribe the terms of payment (s. 19). The persons mentioned in the preamble are named provisional directors and are empowered to open in the city of Winnipeg and elsewhere stock books in which are recorded the subscriptions of those who desire to become shareholders (s. 20). The company is directed to prepare and annually transmit to the Provincial Secretary a statement in duplicate under oath setting forth the capital stock of the company, the portion paid up, the assets and liabilities of the company, and stich other information as the department may require (s. 22).\nEvery person who makes application in writing for an allotment of shares, to whom any share or shares is or are allotted in pursuance of such application, shall be deemed conclusively to have agreed to become a shareholder of the company in respect of the shares so allotted.(s. 26).\nThe register of the shareholders is prima facie evidence of any matters by the Act directed or authorized to be inserted therein (s. 27).\nSections 29 and 30 of the charter are taken verbatim from sections 48 and 49 of the Manitoba Companies Act (R.S.M. c. 35), and render each shareholder, until his stock has been fully paid up, liable to the creditors of the company for the unpaid portion thereof, but relieve him otherwise from liability for the acts, defaults or liabilities of the company. The company is directed to keep a register of the shareholders containing their names, the number of shares held by them and the amount paid thereon (s. 33). The company is declared subject to the general laws of the province relating to loan and trust companies (s. 50). The powers granted by the Act cease and determine unless the company begins business and goes into operation within two years (s. 51). Finally sections 31, 34, 47 and 59 to 65 inclusive of the Manitoba Companies Act are made applicable to the company (s. 52).\nThe first question we have to decide is whether the Sale of Shares Act applies to this company, a point on which there was a difference of opinion in the court below. The charter of the company contains no reference to this Act. The majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal considered that s. 26, which I have quoted verbatim, prevented the appellant from disputing his liability as a shareholder.\nIt may well be that certain provisions of the company\u2019s charter override some of the enactments of the Sale of Shares Act. For instance, in so far as the charter expressly sets out the objects and defines the powers of the company, the Public Utility Commissioner, acting under the Sale of Shares Act, could not call on this company to change the plan of business mentioned in its Act of incorporation or to modify its charter powers. But because the charter authorizes the directors to issue stock and make calls thereon\u2014powers belonging to directors in joint stock companies generally under the Manitoba Companies Act \u2014it by no means follows that measures of supervision and control with respect to the sale of shares, such as those prescribed by the Sale of Shares Act, are inconsistent with or repugnant to this company\u2019s charter. In the absence of anything in the charter excluding these measures, which are undoubtedly of great public importance and designed to be of universal application, they should not be excluded by inference on account of the general power given to the directors to issue stock. Sect. 26 of the charter, which was specially relied on in the court below, can be given full scope without affecting any of the prohibitions of the Sale of Shares Act. It concerns a mere matter of evidence, authorizing the inference, from the fact of an allotment of shares pursuant to an application in writing therefor, that the applicant has agreed to become a shareholder in respect of the shares so allotted. Here there is no question that the appellant did consent to become a shareholder, but the point is whether such consent is binding on him in view of the prohibitions of the Sale of Shares Act. Section 26 presupposes a valid and binding application for the shares alloted. Nothing in that or any other section of the company\u2019s special Act excludes the applicability of the safeguarding provisions of the Sale of Shares Act to the appellant\u2019s purchase of shares in the Northwestern Trust Company.\nIt is common ground that this company did not obtain from the Public Utility Commissioner a certificate as required by the Act before selling shares to the appellant. It had applied for this certificate, which was not granted, and it had never filed the papers and documents required by sections 6 and 7 of the Act. It is also admitted that McCabe, Maber, Shallott and Brand, its agents, who offered the shares for sale, did not have or produce any license when offering them. The stated case further alleges that the appellant was not aware, until after the issue of the winding-up order, that the company had not secured a certificate, that its agents had no licenses, and that the provisions of the Act had not been complied with. Under these circumstances, is the appellant liable to be placed on the list of contributories of this company for the shares purchased by him?\nThe applications for stock and the allotments took place in the fall of 1922, and the winding-up order is dated the 17th of March, 1924. The stated case sets out no dealings by the appellant with the stock, no assisting at meetings or receipt of dividends by him. We have only the facts that the stock was subscribed for and allotted and that notice of the allotment was sent to the appellant. The appellant\u2019s repudiation of his purchase took place after the winding-up order issued, for at that time only did he become aware that the requirements of the Sale of Shares Act had not been complied with.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is contended that in view of the prohibitions of the Sale of Shares Act, his contract to purchase shares was void ab initio, and not merely voidable, and that he could, under the circumstances, successfully resist an application to place his name on the list of contributories.\nThe liquidator\u2019s submission is that, if the statute applies, the contract is not void but only voidable at the election of the shareholder, and that the latter\u2019s repudiation made after the beginning of the winding-up is too late. The liquidator also contends that the appellant having accepted the stock allotted to him and his name having been placed on the register of shareholders, he is now estopped from setting up against the creditors of the company, who are represented by the liquidator, that his purchase of shares is void and that he is not a contributory.\nTaking into consideration the character of the statute, its language and also the purpose for which it was enacted \u2014which was to protect the general public against schemes or campaigns to sell shares or securities of doubtful value to unwary investors through agents, and with the aid of advertisements, circulars or other methods of publicity\u2014 the conclusion seems inevitable that the Sales of Shares Act deals with a matter of public policy and that anything done in contravention of its prohibitions is void and not merely voidable. It is true that per se every sale of its shares by a company is not made unlawful (s. 5 of c. 105 of 1914). It is the sale effected \u201cin the course of continued and successive acts,\u201d as defined, which falls under the prohibitions of the statute. A sale so made, and all steps taken to carry it out, such as an allotment of shares, are void.\nThis case must be decided on the basis of the facts alleged in the stated case, and by them it is established that the requirements of the Sale of Shares Act were not complied with. The application for shares by the appellant and the allotment of these shares to him are consequently void, and there is no contract between him and the company. No dealings of the appellant with the stock are alleged, and there is nothing from which an independent agreement to keep the stock and pay for it can be implied.\nThe present case is therefore distinguishable from the cases on which the liquidator relies. The contract to take stock being void, such decisions as Oakes v. Turquand,[18]\u2014where the contract induced by fraud was merely voidable \u2014can have no application here. Nor can an independent contract to keep the shares and pay for them be implied as in In re Railway Time Tables Publishing Co.; ex parte Sandys[19], where the original contract to purchase shares at a discount was void, but the purchaser had dealt with the stock, had sold or attempted to sell a part of it, and had signed proxies as a shareholder for voting purposes. Neither is there such a circumstance as signing a blank form of transfer which, in In re Peruvian Railways Co.; Crawley\u2019s Case[20], was considered sufficient to imply acceptance of stock for the allotment of which a notice had not been sent to the shareholder.\nThe liquidator strongly relies however on the case of Welton v. Saffery[21]. But the only point determined there was that a purchaser under a void offer, at a discount, of stock purporting to have been issued as fully paid up, who had already admitted his liability to contribute to the payment of the company\u2019s creditors and the cost of the litigation (which was unquestionable in view of the previous decision of the House of Lords in Ooregum Gold Mining Co. of India v. Roper[22], was also liable to contribution in order to adjust the rights of the shareholders inter se. The liquidator invokes the following dictum of Lord Mac-naghten, at pp. 321-322:\u2014\nThe truth is, as it seems to me, that there never was a contract between the company or the shareholders, on the one hand, and the persons to whom these discount shares were offered, on the other. There was an offer by the directors purporting to act on behalf of the company, but it was an offer of that which the company could not give, because the law does not allow it. There was an acceptance by the discount shareholders of that offer. But that offer and acceptance could not constitute a contract. Both parties acted under a misconception of law, and the whole thing was void. The company, however, placed the names of the discount shareholders on the register; they allowed their names to remain there until their remedy against the company was gone; and now they cannot be heard to say that they were not shareholders.\nThis raises the question whether the appellant is estopped from denying that he is a shareholder of the company, as two of the learned judges (Perdue C.J.M., and Dennistoun, J.A.; Fullerton, J.A. contra on this point) thought in the court below.\nThis question must also be decided on the basis of the facts alleged in the stated case. It is not even set out there that the appellant\u2019s name was placed on the list of shareholders, but we may perhaps assume that it was. No dealing by the appellant with the stock is alleged as a basis of estoppel; the most that could possibly be said is that he allowed his name to go on the register, but for that the only authority given by him was his subscription for the stock. How then can it be asserted that he is estopped from setting up that his purchase of shares is void and his name wrongly on the register, when it is admitted that he was not aware until after the winding-up order issued that the requirements of the Sale of Shares Act had not been complied with, and then promptly repudiated? The liquidator cannot admit this lack of knowledge, and assert in the same breath that the appellant should have repudiated his purchase before the winding-up. In a much stronger case for estoppel than that with which we are concerned, the Court of Appeal for Ontario refused to hold an applicant for shares estopped from denying that he was a shareholder, and upheld a judgment striking his name from the list of contributories. Re Pakenham Pork Packing Co., Higginbotham\u2019s Case,[23]. There the applicant for shares had attended meetings of the company and had moved resolutions, but it was admitted that he had had no notice until after the liquidation of irregularities in the creation of the preference stock for which he had subscribed. This Ontario decision was followed by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Re Bankers\u2019 Trust and Barnsley.[24] See also Bower on Estoppel, s. 146, p. 129.\nNo difficulty arises from the fact that the name of the appellant was on the register of shareholders. It was illegally there, and the register is not conclusive either before or after the liquidation, but is only prima facie evidence (s. 27 of the company\u2019s charter), and names illegally thereon can be removed.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs throughout and the question submitted in the stated case answered in the negative, with the result that the name of the appellant should be struck from the list of contributories of the company. The costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCallum, Wilson and Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Philip C.

Smith, v. Goldie (9 Can. S.C.R. 46) disc.\nThe patent in question was dated 26th June, 1923. The Patent Act, 1923, c. 23, was assented to 13th June, 1923, but came into force, by proclamation, on 1st September, 1923.\nHeld, the rights of the patentee were governed by the former Act, and there was nothing in the new Act which had the effect of sustaining his patent against the objection raised against it, viz., user in the United States by another person before the patentee\u2019s invention.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada. The action was brought for alleged infringement by the defendant of letters patent belonging to the plaintiffs. The defendant pleaded non-infringement and also that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent was void. The action was first tried in December, 1924, judgment being reserved. Subsequently the defendant applied for leave to amend its particulars of objections, to the effect that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent, an improved brake band lining device, had been anticipated by one Cady of Canastota in the State of New York. Upon the issues tried in December, 1924, judgment was rendered on 24th February, 1925, sustaining the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 patent and their action for infringement against the defendant[1]. Leave having been granted to the defendant to amend its particulars for the purpose above stated, the judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered, limited to the specific issue raised in the defendant\u2019s amended particulars. At the further trial upon the amended particulars the defendant established to the satisfaction of the court that the said Cady late in the year 1918 constructed a brake band lining machine and had since used the same, with some slight modifications, in his garage at Canastota, and that this machine was the mechanical equivalent of the machine patented. The patent under which the plaintiffs claim was issued from the patent office of the Dominion of Canada and was dated 26th June, 1923. It was held that the plaintiffs\u2019 patent registered in Canada was anticipated by Cady, and it was therefore void and the plaintiffs\u2019 action for infringement failed. The plaintiffs appealed, limiting their appeal to the question of whether, upon the facts found by the trial judge, his decision was correct in law.\nR. S. Smart and J. L. McDougall for the appellants.\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclean, the President of the Exchequer Court, wherein the validity of a patent of invention granted under the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1906, c 69, was in question, and said learned trial judge upon the facts found by him, and his interpretation and construction of section 7 of said Act, as applied to said facts, adjudged said patent as void, and dismissed said appellants\u2019 action with costs of the second trial and subsequent to the filing of respondent\u2019s amended particulars.\nI do not think there is any doubt of the facts being correctly found by said learned judge, or indeed any serious contention herein to the contrary.\nThe only question is one of law and it turns upon the interpretation and construction of said section 7, which reads as follows:\u2014\n7. Any person who has invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, which was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof, and which has not been in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof, for more than one year previously to bis application for patent therefor in Canada, may, on a petition to that effect, presented to the Commissioner, and on compliance with the other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to such person an exclusive property in such invention.\n2. No patent shall issue for an invention which has an illicit object in view, or for any mere scientific principle or abstract theorem.\nI must say it seems to be very clear English and easily well understood if we read it as such. The counsel for the appellants, however, argued that we must read into it something analogous to what once was in the Patent Act of Canada, restricting and confining the words used therein, beginning at the fourth line thereof, as follows\u2014\nwhich was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof\nto mean only any other person in Canada.\nThe learned judge held, as I think quite rightly, that the words \u201cany other person\u201d means there just what they literally express; and apply to any person in the United States as well as in Canada, who may have previously known or used the alleged invention.\nIn doing so he follows the holding of the late Sir Walter Cassels in the case of The Barnett-McQueen Company, Limited v. The Canadian Stewart Company, Limited[2] which is the last case in point, and by a judge well versed in the Canadian patent law.\nI entertain a decided opinion that he was quite right and the learned trial judge on the facts herein also so in following that precedent.\nThe counsel for appellants seems to think the late Mr. Justice Burbridge had expressed in an earlier case a different opinion, and cites many patent enactments in Canada.\nI doubt if that case is in fact in point, but even if so, I prefer the later decision upon which the learned judge below proceeded.\nThe more I study that story and the changes in the law, the more I feel convinced that our legislators found it necessary to depart from the original conception of what was needed, and eliminated the narrow and dangerous character of the law, along such a length of adjoining territory much given to invention, if the word \u201cpersons\u201d was to be confined to Canada alone.\nThe person here in question was a Mr. Cady, in New York State, who, I strongly suspect, was the real inventor, though the learned trial judge does not expressly so find because it was not necessary. And I refer to it as a possible danger ahead if we reversed the judgment appealed from.\nI am of the opinion that his appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.:\u2014Mr. McDougall\u2019s ingenious argument has not convinced me that the rights of the parties to this appeal are governed by the statute of 1923. S. 7, R.S.C., c. 69, which is the relevant enactment, is in these words:\nAny person who has invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement in any art machine manufacture or composition of matter, which was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof, and which has not been in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof, for more than one year previously to his application for patent therefor in Canada, may, on a petition to that effect, presented to the Commissioner, and on compliance with the other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to such person an exclusive property in such invention;\nand the question is whether the words \u201cnot known or used\u201d in the clause,\nwhich was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof,\nare subject to the qualification expressed in the words \u201cin Canada.\u201d It seems difficult, without torturing the section, to read the words so.\nThe natural construction is to read them as governing the scope of the phrase \u201chis application for patent therefor,\u201d which immediately precedes them. A difficulty, no doubt, arises from Smith v. G oldie[3], a decision, the scope and effect of which it is necessary to examine. The decision is very elaborately discussed in the judgment of Cassels J. in Barnett-McQueen Co. v. Canadian Stewart Co.[4] at pp. 226 et seq. The facts, in outline, were these: Smith, the appellant, had a Canadian patent, applied for in January, 1873, and granted in the following April. Sherman and Lacroix each had also a Canadian patent, dated in 1872, under whom Goldie, the respondent, claimed. Smith\u2019s machine, invented by him, was in complete working order in the United States in April, 1871. His application for a patent there was in July of the same year. Mr. Justice Henry, in the course of an elaborate judgment in this court, with which Taschereau J. and Fournier J. concurred, states explicitly that Smith was the first and only inventor of the combination in question, and that the two contestants, under whom the respondent claimed, had become acquainted with the value of the combination by obtaining knowledge of Smith\u2019s discovery. The court held, Strong J. dissenting, that Smith\u2019s invention was a patentable one. There seems to be little doubt that Mr. Justice Cassels is right in the opinion expressed by him in the judgment already mentioned (Barnett-McQueen Co. v. Canadian Stewart Co.[5]) at p. 227 of the report, that the point mentioned as being decided in the headnote of Smith v. Goldie[6] was actually so decided, although not mentioned in the judgments, namely, that the words \u201cin Canada,\u201d in the sixth section of the Act of 1872, should be read as qualifying the words \u201cin public use or on sale,\u201d and not as qualifying the immediately preceding word, \u201capplication.\u201d As Smith\u2019s machine had been in public use and on sale in the United States for more than a year prior to his application in Canada (see per Patterson J.A.)[7], Smith\u2019s title to a patent in this country would have been lost if, on the true construction of that section, \u201cin public use or on sale\u201d meant in public use or on sale anywhere, and not in Canada merely. This point, then, may be taken as decided.\nIt is not necessary to decide, and I desire to express no opinion upon it, whether such a change has taken place in the Act as entitles us to say that the decision in Smith v. Goldie6 on this point no longer applies. That was the view of Cassels J., expressed in the case above mentioned. But beyond stating that his reasoning does not convince me, I leave the point without observation. Assuming that (Smith v. Goldie[8] upon this point is applicable, it is, of course, binding upon us, but although there is necessarily involved in it the proposition that the words \u201cin Canada\u201d do not limit the word \u201capplication,\u201d it does not necessarily follow that they do qualify the earlier words\u2014the words in the preceding clause\u2014\u201cnot known or used by others\u201d; and, in point of fact, as will presently appear more particularly, Patterson J.\u2019s view, as expressed in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, was that they do not.\nThe view expressed by Cassels J. is, that this court actually decided the point in Smith v. Goldie8, in the sense of Patterson J.\u2019s opinion, as it is reported to have done, in the headnote. Burbridge J. observes, however, in The Queen v. LaForce[9], that three of the learned judges at least, who were concerned in the decision of Smith v. Goldie8, found the facts in such a way as necessarily to defeat the defence advanced by the respondents, neither of whom was (in his opinion), according to these findings, entitled to a patent as an inventor. They had neither invented nor discovered anything; they had merely pirated Smiths invention; and it may, in view of this difference of opinion, be doubted whether, on the question of law now before us, Smith v. Goldie8 is decisive. But an examination of the statute of 1869, when its provisions are contrasted with those of the legislation of 1872, 1886 and 1906, convinces me that Patterson J. is right in his opinion that a change in policy is manifested by the statute of 1872. The point is stated in his judgment at pp. 640 and 641, and I quote his words:\nMr. Cassels for the defendants, when discussing the question of want of novelty, called particular attention to the language of the sixth section of the Act of 1872, 35 Vict., c. 26, which is now in force, and the corresponding section of the Act of 1869, 32-33 Vict., c. 11, s. 6, which differs from that of the Act which had been in force in the province of Canada, Cons. S.C., c. 34, s. 3.\nThe last-named Act authorized the granting of a patent to the inventor of a new and useful art, &c: \u201cThe same not being known or used in this province by others before his discovery or invention thereof.\u201d While that Act was in force, no one was entitled to a patent under it except a subject of Her Majesty.\nThe Act of 1869 extended the privilege to any person who had been a resident of Canada for one year before his application, and that of 1872 removed the restriction as to residence, thus in all respects placing foreigners on the same footing with subjects; but at the same time, and as a complement of this extension of the privilege, requiring absolute novelty, and not merely novelty within the Dominion, in the invention. The language is, therefore, more general, as used in the two later statutes, \u201cthe same not being known or used by others before his invention thereof\u201d\nIt only remains to note that neither in the revision of 1886 nor in that of 1906 was any change pertinent to this point effected in the words of s. 6 of the Act of 1872, which Patterson J. was here considering, and it may not unreasonably be assumed that this weighty expression of opinion was before the legislature when these revisions took place. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nNewcombe J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nRinfret J.\u2014The appellants, Wright and Corson, are both residents of Bridgeport, in the State of Connecticut, United States of America. The appellant company is their assignee. Brake Service Limited, the respondent, is a body politic and corporate of the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario and Dominion of Canada.\nBy letters patent numbered 232159, dated 26th June, 1923, under the seal of the Patent Office of the Dominion of Canada, there was duly granted to the appellants for a period of eighteen years the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using and vending to others to be used in the Dominion of Canada, an invention consisting of improvements in methods and mechanism for drilling and applying brake band linings. The appellants are the owners of this patent; and they claim that, for some time past, without their license, permission or assent, the respondent has infringed and is still infringing these letters patent. They pray for a declaration that the letters patent are valid, for an injunction restraining the wrongful acts of infringement and for accessory remedies, such as payment of damages, account of profits, inquiries and costs.\nThe defence was that the patent sued upon is and always has been void for several reasons contained in the particulars of objections of which the following alone need be retained and are stated thus:\u2014\nA machine anticipating in every particular the machine described in the plaintiff\u2019s patent sued on herein was in public use in the city of Canastota, in the State of New York, one of the United States of America, in the public garage of one George B. Cady, for more than one year prior to the 25th day of August, A.D. 1922, the date upon which the plaintiffs filed their application for a patent in the Canadian Patent Office, to wit, continuously from the month of October in the year 1918 until the 25th day of August, A.D. 1922, and thereafter continuously until the present time, and the method of attaching brake linings to brake bands, described in the plaintiff\u2019s said patent, has been in constant use in connection with the said machine of the said George B. Cady from the said month of October, A.D. 1918, until the present time.\nUpon that issue, the President of the Exchequer Court in his judgment delivered on the 18th day of April, 1925, expressed himself in the following way:\u2014\nI am entirely satisfied that Cady produced the machine referred to in the defendant\u2019s amended particulars, in the manner and at the time related by him. His evidence has been confirmed in too many particulars by other evidence, oral and documentary, to cause me to doubt his veracity. In regard to the other witnesses who gave evidence at the trial on behalf of the defendant, my conclusion is that they were reliable, and their evidence is to be believed. On the whole, I have no doubt whatever that Cady produced the brake-band lining machine in question late in 1918, and that he has since used the same with some slight modifications, in his garage at Canastota.\nThere can be no doubt that Wright and Corson is the mechanical equivalent of Cady. One need only to see the two machines to be entirely satisfied of this, and I think no useful purpose is to be served by any lengthy consideration of this point.\nThese findings of fact were not disputed before this court; and the sole question in this appeal therefore is whether knowledge or user in another country, previous to the invention of the applicant in Canada, renders void a patent granted, by the Patent Office of Canada.\nThe learned President of the Court held that it did. Referring to Barnett-McQueen Co. v. Canadian Stewart Co.[10], and to Smith v. Goldie[11], he decided that the Canadian Patent Act clearly implied\nthat the inventor must be the inventor as to all the world, in order to be entitled to a patent.\nThe question at issue is as to whether the learned judge was right in so holding.\nThe patent having issued on the 26th June, 1923, this question must be decided according to the law in force at that date. This was the Patent Act, c. 69, R.S.C. 1906.\nA new act came into force in 1923 (c. 23 of 13-14 Geo. V). On account of the peculiar wording of its 68th and 66th sections, it was contended, on behalf of the appellants, that the new act applied to this litigation. It was pointed out that, by s. 68, patents issued prior to the coming into force of this Act cease to be subject to the provisions of the Patent Act, c. 69 of R.S.C. 1906, and\nbecome subject to the provisions of this Act, but except as hereinbefore expressly provided, nothing in this Act contained shall be construed * * * to avoid any patent that was valid at such time.\nThe exception referred to and \u201cexpressly provided,\u201d so the appellants say, is s. 66, whereby c. 69 of R.S.C. 1906, is repealed (barring section 5A thereof),\nProvided, however, that any patent issued prior to the passing of this Act which could successfully have been impeached for violation of or non-compliance with any provision of the Acts heretofore in force may with like effect be so impeached after the passing of this Act, and in any action for the infringement of any such patent any such violation or non-compliance which could have been set up as a defence may with like effect be so set up after the passing of this Act.\nThe new Patent Act was assented to on the 13th June, 1923; but it came into force (s. 70) only upon a day to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor in Council. This was published on the 7th July and made the Act effective on the 1st September, 1923. The appellante patent issued on the 26th June, 1923, or on a date between the assent and the day on which the Act came into operation.\nIt was submitted that the Act \u201cpassed\u201d when it received the Royal assent; and, for that reason, the appellants argued that the patent could be successfully impeached only for violation of or non-compliance with a provision of the new Act.\nWe do not think that such is the purport of s. 66 of the Act of 1923. By force of its wording, the repeal of c. 69 R.S.C. 1906 became effective only upon the day when the Act of 1923 came into operation. There was no intervening Act between the \u201cpassing\u201d of the new Act and the date of its commencement. The appellants\u2019 patent therefor could only be issued under and subject to the provisions of the only Act then in force and that was c. 69 of R.S.C. 1906. The object of the proviso in s. 66 was to preserve, after the repeal of the old law took effect, any defence which could have been set up under that law, in an action for infringement of a patent issued under it. S. 68 adds that\nnothing in the new Act contained shall be construed to revive or restore any patent that was void when it came into force nor to avoid any patent that was valid at such time. The question before us is precisely whether the appellants\u2019 patent was valid (under the law in force when it was issued) at the time when the new Patent Act came into operation on the 1st September, 1923.\nThe relevant section in c. 69 of R.S.C. 1906 reads as follows:\u2014\nSection 7.\u2014Any person who has invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement in any art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter, which was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof, and which has not been in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof, for more than one year previously to his application for patent therefor in Canada, may, on a petition to that effect, presented to the Commissioner, and on compliance with the other requirements of this Act, obtain a patent granting to such a person an exclusive property in such invention.\n2. No patent shall issue for an invention which has an illicit object in view, or for any mere scientific principle or abstract theorem.\nThis section enacts that the art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or the improvement thereof must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d The first requirement is novelty. If there is no novelty, there is no invention. The wording contains no limitation as to locality. It is plain and unrestricted. Before a patent can be obtained, every inventor must present a petition to the Commissioner stating his invention to be of something new and he must make oath that this statement is \u201ctrue and correct\u201d (s. 10). The Commissioner may object to grant the patent\nwhen it appears to him that there is no novelty in the invention (s. 17c);\nand, even if granted, the patent is void\nif any material allegation in the petition or declaration of the applicant * * * in respect of such patent is untrue (s. 29).\nIt must be an art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter or a useful improvement thereof which was not known or used by any other person before his invention.\nThese words and those immediately following them in section 7 are not cumulative. They contain two totally different requirements altogether. The first one relates to the date of the invention; the second, only to the date of the application. There must have been no knowledge or use by another person prior to the invention; there must not have been public use or sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor for more than one year previously to the application for the patent in Canada. Those are two distinct conditions, both of which are essentially required. The words\nnot known or used by any other (person before his invention thereof\nare to be read alone, as they are, without any qualification attached to them. To construe them as excluding knowledge or user in another country, it would be necessary to import in the wording the qualification \u201cin Canada,\u201d which is not there and which appears elsewhere in the section in a totally different connection. According to the grammatical construction of the section, therefore, the person entitled to a patent is one who has invented something (art, machine, manufacture, composition of matter or improvement thereof)\n1. new and useful;\n2. which was not known or used by any other person before his invention;\n3. which has not been in public use or on sale with his consent or allowance for more than one year previously to his application for patent therefor in Canada.\nThis agrees with the historical construction of the anterior statutes.\nIn an Act respecting patents for inventions, being chapter 34 of Consolidated Statutes of Canada, 22 Vict. 1859, the protection of the law was restricted to \u201ca subject of Her Majesty and resident in this province.\u201d The condition was that the art etc. invented should be new and useful,\nthe same not being known or used in this province by others before his discovery or invention thereof, and not being at the time of the application for a patent in public use or on sale in this province with his consent or allowance as the inventor or discoverer thereof (s. 3).\nSection 25 of this Act read as follows:\nSection 25.\u2014Whenever it satisfactorily appears that the Patentee at the time of making his application for the Patent, believed himself to be the first inventor or discoverer of the thing patented, the Patent shall not be held to be void on account of the invention or discovery or part thereof, having been before known or used in a foreign country, if it does not appear that the same or any material or substantial part thereof, had before been patented or described in any printed publication.\nThese were substantially the reproduction of similar enactments in the earlier statutes (1848-49\u2014Statutes of Canada, 12 Vict., c. 24; 1829, 9 Geo. IV, c. 47).\nIn 1869, however, when the Patent Office was constituted and the office of Commissioner of Patents was created by the statute of Canada 32 & 33 Vict. c. 11, the words in s. 25 of 22 Vict. c. 34:\nthe Patent shall not be held to be void on account of the invention or discovery or part thereof having been before known or used in a foreign country\ndisappeared and they have never since reappeared in the subsequent statutory enactments.\nAs for the material words in s. 3 of the statute of 1859, they have undergone the following modifications:\n1859-22 V.-C. 34-S.3.-:\nthe same not being known or used in this province by others before his discovery or invention thereof, and not being at the time of the application for a patent in public use or on sale in this province with his consent or allowance as the inventor or discoverer thereof.\n1869-32 & 33 V. c.11, s. 6:\nnot known or used by others before his invention or discovery thereof, or not being at the time of his application for a patent in public use or on sale in any of the provinces of the Dominion with the consent or allowance of the inventor or discoverer thereof.\n1872-35 V.-C. 26-s. 6:\nnot known or used by others before his invention thereof, and not being in public use or on sale for more than one year previous to his application, in Canada with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof.\n1886-R.S.C-c. 61-s. 71:\nwhich was not known or used by any other person before his invention thereof, and which has not been in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor thereof, for more than one year previously to his application for patent therefor in Canada.\nAs will be perceived, there was no change in the wording of 1886 when section 7 of R.S.C. 1906, c. 69 (already quoted) was enacted. But the disappearance, in 1869, of the words \u201cin this province,\u201d after the words \u201cnot being known or used,\u201d (particularly when it is remembered that section 25 of the Act of 1859, excluding as it did knowledge or user in a foreign country, was completely struck out) tends to show in Parliament a change of policy and of sentiment and adds a great deal of force to the conclusion already derived from the grammatical construction of the statute of 1906.\nWe should now examine how far this conclusion is supported by the judgment of this court in Smith v. Goldie[12]. This decision was given in 1883. In the report, one of the head notes reads:\nTo be entitled to a patent in Canada, the patentee must be the first inventor in Canada or elsewhere. A prior patent to a person who is not the true inventor is no defence against an action by the true inventor under a patent issued to him subsequently, and does not require to be cancelled or repealed by scire facias, whether it is vested in the defendant or in a person not a party to the suit.\nThe appellants submitted that an examination of the reasons for judgment of the judges who composed the Supreme Court shows that the question was not so decided. Cassels J. in The Barnett-McQueen Co. v. The Canadian Stewart Co.[13] affirms that the point \u201cwas in fact decided in the manner stated.\u201d\nNo doubt, a perusal of the written opinions would fail to disclose the fact that this important proposition of law had been passed upon by the court. The Court of Appeal of Ontario had dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal on the ground that his invention was not patentable. The judges of this court, in reversing this decision, naturally directed their reasons towards establishing that the invention was a proper subject of patent, it being the essential point upon which they differed from the court below. But Patterson J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, had pointed out that the Acts of 1869 and of 1872, when removing the restriction as to residence and extending the privilege of the patent to foreigners,\nat the same time, and as a complement of this extension of the privilege, required absolute novelty, and not merely novelty within the Dominion, of the invention[14].\nNo exception to this language was taken in the judgment of this court. On the contrary, it would appear that such was truly the effect of the decision and that otherwise it could not have been what it was, as a consideration of the relevant dates will show. Smith\u2019s machine was in complete working order in the United States in April, 1871. He applied for a patent in the United States in July of that year, and the patent was issued to him in December, 1872. His application for a Canadian patent was made on the 11th January 1873. It was granted and the patent was issued on the 18th April 1873. Sherman and Lacroix, the rival inventors, obtained their Canadian patents in 1872, and their United States patent prior to Smith\u2019s United States patents, although subsequently to his application therefor. The dates of the alleged invention by Sherman and Lacroix are not given in the report; but the judgment of the Appeal Court \u201csubstantially admitted,\u201d says Henry J.[15],\nand I think properly, that Smith was the real inventor of the art or process.\nIt will be seen therefore that Sherman and Lacroix\u2019 patents were earlier than Smith both in the United States and in Canada, and apparently he could not succeed unless upon the ground that his invention in United States was prior to Sherman and Lacroix\u2019 invention and that the fact of the art or process having been known or used by Smith in United States before Sherman and Lacroix\u2019 invention rendered void the Canadian patents issued to the latter.\nThe logical conclusion would be that Smith v. Goldie[16] distinctly laid down the law that\nthe patentee must be the first inventor in Canada or elsewhere.\nThis was the interpretation unequivocably given to it in The Barnett-McQueen Company, Limited v. The Canadian Stewart Company, Limited[17] by Mr, Justice Cassels, who was counsel in the case and very familiar with the facts.\nIt would also be our own view of the judgment, were it not for the fact that, at page 60, Mr. Justice Henry (with whom Fournier and Taschereau JJ. concurred) says:\nThe evidence leaves no doubt on my mind that Smith was the first and only inventor of the combination he claims in his specification; and I feel as little doubt that the other parties who obtained the two other contesting patents became acquainted with the value of the combination by obtaining the knowledge of his discovery. * * * Setting out, then, with the affirmative proposition that Smith was the bona fide inventor of the combination in question, the only important remaining question is, was the discovery and invention in question the proper subject for protection by letters patent.\nThis, however, does not appear to have been the view of the facts taken by the learned Chancellor who tried the case, nor by the Court of Appeal or the other judges of the Supreme Court who completed the majority and delivered separate notes. As to whether, in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cassels, the holding expressed in the above head note of the report in Smith v. Goldie[18] was a correct statement of the law, his judgment in Barnett-McQueen Co. v. Canadian Stewart Co.[19] leaves no room for doubt. After having gone into the history of the legislation most exhaustively and having made a careful study of the several statutory enactments, Mr. Justice Cassels, construing section 7, c. 61, R.S.C. 1886, quite independently of the decision in Smith v. Goldie18, reached the conclusion that, under that Act, no person could obtain a valid patent granting to him an exclusive property in an invention unless he was the first inventor in Canada or elsewhere.\nThere was no change in the law on that point between the Act of 1872, which this court had to apply in Smith v. Goldie18, and chapter 69 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1906, governing the present case. Or, at least, any change that has taken place in another part of the section would, prima facie, make the respondent\u2019s position more favourable. But it is unnecessary, for the purposes of this case, to consider the alleged difference between the provisions of the Revised Statutes of 1886 or of 1906 and the statute of 1872. The ground upon which this case was decided below, is not that the invention had\nbeen in public use or on sale with the consent or allowance of the inventor for more than one year previously to the (appellants\u2019) application for patent therefor in Canada,\nbut merely that it was known and used by one Cady, in Canastota, in the State of New York, before the invention by the appellants.\nIn our view, that was a reason sufficient in law to warrant the conclusion of the learned President of the Exchequer Court.\nWe thought it well to clear up the question, lest the above quoted passage in the notes of Mr. Justice Henry might be interpreted as an indication that Smith v. Goldie18 was not a case between two independent inventors, but that Smith succeeded because he was the first and only discoverer of an invention which Sherman and Lacroix had surreptitiously obtained. Reference ought to foe made, before concluding, to Queen v. La Force[20], put forward on behalf of the appellants in support of their case. In so far as it may be contended that the decision therein was in conflict with that of the Exchequer Court in the present case, it need only be said that, in such a case, we could not agree with it. But we do not so understand Mr, Justice Burbidge\u2019s judgment. The principal consideration, the underlying idea upon which his judgment was based, is well expressed in the head note:\u2014\nHeld, that the fact that prior to the invention of anything by an independent Canadian inventor to whom a patent therefor is subsequently granted in Canada a foreign inventor had conceived the same thing but had not used it or in any way disclosed it to the public is not sufficient under the patent laws of Canada to defeat the Canadian patent.\nThe judgment begins by stating:\u2014\nThe main question to be determined in this case is whether, under the patent law of Canada, a prior foreign invention of which the public had no means of knowledge is sufficient to defeat a patent issued to an independent Canadian inventor (p. 33).\nResuming the facts, the learned judge writes (p. 38):\u2014\nThe improvement had not been used in public\u2014had not in fact been used at all, and any knowledge there was of it was not in any way open or accessible to the public.\nThe trend of his reasoning (see pp. 38, 39, 42, 44, 52, 61) is the development of the principle that practical employment of the art or skill, not theoretical conception or abstract ideas, may within the meaning of the law constitute an invention and form the subject of a patent. He finds that Jeffery, the alleged inventor in the case, never reduced the invention to practical form, so that the public had no knowledge or means of knowledge of it. This, according to his view, was not invention, but mere conception, and\nnot sufficient to defeat a patent issued to an independent Canadian inventor (p. 61).\nHowever, in the course of his very elaborate and considered judgment, Mr. Justice Burbidge does say (p. 44):\u2014\nOne can understand how the Parliament of Canada, going farther, it is true, in that direction than the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the Congress of the United States has as yet gone, has, in What it deemed to be the interests of the general public of the Dominion, made prior public knowledge or use of an invention anywhere, a bar to a Canadian patent therefor. But one fails, I think, to apprehend why it should in favour of a foreigner, on the ground only of his earlier conception of the invention, make void a patent issued for good cause and consideration to an independent Canadian inventor, for an invention that prior thereto had not been used in public anywhere, and of which the public in no part of the world had any means of knowledge. If that be the law it ought not to concern the judge whose duty it is to declare, obey and enforce it, that in its enforcement great wrongs will be done.\nThis means that, had the facts in Queen v. La Force (1) been similar to those found, and indeed accepted, in the present case, the decision there would have been the same as that now confirmed by us.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Russel S.

L.R. 15) aff. APPEAL by the city of Windsor and by the Attorney-General for Ontario (intervenant) from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the County Court of the County of Essex, Coughlin J., which affirmed the decision of the Court of Revision of the city of Windsor, which had confirmed an assessment by the Assessment Commissioner of the city assessing the respondent in respect of certain income of the estate of John Curry, deceased.\nThe appeal to the Appellate Division was upon a case stated by the County Court judge. John Curry died on 11th May, 1912, domiciled at and a resident of the city of Windsor, Ontario. Under the provisions of his will, all the income derivable from his estate, after payment of his debts, etc., and certain legacies and annuities, was to be accumulated by his trustees for a period of twenty-one years from the date of his death, and on the expiration of that period, which will not be until 10th May, 1933, the whole residuary trust fund, including the accumulations of income, is to be divided one-third share to each of his three children (named) and in case any of his children shall have died before the expiration of the said twenty-one years, the one-third share of each or any of his children so dying shall vest in the trustees to divide the same amongst his grandchildren, if any, as the trustees may think best. One of the deceased\u2019s children died in 1920, leaving no children. Another, living in Windsor, Ontario, is married and has three children, and the other is unmarried and is living in the State of New York. The assessment in question was made in 1923 in respect of the net income of the estate for the year 1922, after deducting disbursements made in the ordinary course of administration, and was made under the provisions of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 195, as amended. S. 5 provides that (subject to certain exemptions) all real property in Ontario and all income derived either within or out of Ontario by any person resident therein, or received in Ontario by or on behalf of any person resident out of the same shall be liable to taxation. S. 13 (3), enacted in 1922, c. 78, s. 12, provides that \u201c* * * every agent, administrator, trustee, executor or person who collects or receives or is in any way in possession or control of income for or on behalf of an estate and which income is not wholly distributed annually shall be assessed in respect of the income not so distributed, on behalf of the estate in the municipality wherein the testator was domiciled at the time of his death.\u201d S. 13 (4) (also enacted in 1922) provides that \u201cincome which has been assessed against any agent, administrator, trustee, executor or other person on behalf of an estate under the foregoing subsection 3 shall not be again assessed, when received by the beneficiary or person entitled thereto\u201d. The main question for consideration by this court on this appeal was whether or not the tax sought to be imposed on the respondent was an indirect tax and, therefore, ultra vires.\nF.D. Davis for the appellant, the city of Windsor.\nNesbitt K.C. and O.W. Rogers for the appellant, the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nA.C. MacMaster K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The question presented for determination in this appeal is whether the municipal tax to be levied upon the respondent trustee in respect of \u201cincome not wholly distributed annually,\u201d as a basis for which assessment in respect of such income is provided for by subs. 3 of s. 13 of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 195, as enacted in 1922 (c. 78, s. 12), is direct or indirect\u2014is valid or ultra vires under s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act. The answer to this question would seem to depend on whether the liability of the person to be assessed under subs. 3 is unqualified, or is imposed only \u201cto such extent as he has property\u201d of the estate on behalf of which he is assessed \u201cavailable for payment of such taxes,\u201d the restriction expressly enacted in regard to lands held by trustees, agents, executors, or administrators by s. 37 (12) of the Ontario Assessment Act. If the liability is personal and unrestricted, the right of the respondent to re-imbursement out of the trust property or by the beneficiaries renders the tax distinctly indirect.\nThe material facts in regard to the character of the income in respect of which the question arises are fully stated in the judgment appealed from[2], and in the report of the former appeal to this court in McLeod v. City of Windsor[3]. That case had to do with an assessment for the year 1920 and involved consideration of the Assessment Act as it stood prior to the insertion of subs. 3 of s. 13 made in 1922. The applicability of that amendment to the present case, which involves a similar assessment for 1923, may be assumed.\nThis court held in the former appeal that the Assessment Act, as it then stood, did not provide for assessment of income which was to be accumulated for a period of years by the trustee whom it was sought to assess in respect of it and was to be distributed ultimately amongst a class unascertained and then unascertainable. But the judgment proceeded on the footing that every person assessable in respect of income, upon assessment therefor, incurred personal liability for the tax to be imposed. In the case of a trustee for a non-resident beneficiary (s. 13 (1)) that liability was not restricted to trust funds available to pay such tax.\nThe majority of the court thought it unnecessary in that case to pass upon the question of the validity of such taxation. But Mr. Justice Duff, after indicating the definition of a direct tax within the legislative jurisdiction conferred by s. 92 (2) of the British North America Act, as authoritatively stated in Cotton v. The King[4], and discussing the provisions of s. 11 (2) of the Assessment Act as it then stood, expressed his views upon the validity of s. 13 (1), which reads as follows:\nEvery agent, trustee or person who collects or receives or is in anyway in possession or control of income for or on behalf of a person who is resident out of Ontario shall be assessed in respect of such income.\nHe said, at p. 706:\nThe effect of this section, then, is that a trustee in receipt of an income for a non\u2011resident beneficiary may be liable to pay income tax in respect of an income of an estimated amount which he may only in part have received or not received at all. It is past question not intended that he shall ultimately bear the tax. Normally he will indemnify himself, no doubt from moneys in his hands, but his liability is in no way conditioned upon the existence in his hands of a fund out of which the tax can be paid. The tax is not a lien upon the trust property, and the municipality has no recourse against such property. If he resorts to funds in his hands for payment, it is not pursuant to any duty laid upon him by the taxing authority so to apply the funds, but as a means of indemnifying himself against the personal liability which the statute imposes upon him directly.\nWhere personal liability is imposed upon a trustee or agent in respect of income received by him as such and the tax is not charged upon the income and there is no recourse against it by the taxing authority and the trustee is under no duty to the taxing authority to retain the income in his hands and apply it in payment of the tax, we should appear to have a case in which the trustee is the very person from whom the taxing authority demands the tax it being left to him to secure his indemnity from those who are ultimately intended to sustain the burden.\nThe case, of course, is quite different where no personal liability is imposed, where, for example, the liability of the trustee or agent is limited to the amount in his hands for his beneficiary, as in the case of Burland v. The King[5].\nWhere, too, trust property is charged with the payment of the tax, it is conceivable that the proper inference as to the legislative intent would be that the primary source of payment should be the trust fund, and the personal liability designed only as security for the proper application of the fund, but this is not a point of view with which we are concerned on this appeal.\nThe reasoning above was foreshadowed in the judgment of Lord Selborne in Attorney General v. Reed[6], and is that upon which the judgment of Lord Moulton proceeds in Cotton\u2019s Case[7], and was expressly approved.\nDoes the amendment of 1922\u2014subs. 3 of s. 13\u2014so restrict the liability of the trustee to property of the estate in his hands that it may be upheld as providing for direct taxation? That subsection is in these terms:\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section or any other section of this Act, every agent, administrator, trustee, executor or person who collects or receives or is in any way in possession or control of income for or on behalf of an estate and which income is not wholly distributed annually shall be assessed, in respect of the income not so distributed, on behalf of the estate in the municipality wherein the testator was domiciled at the time of his death.\nSubsection 4, likewise added in 1922, is as follows:\n(4) Income which has been assessed against any agent, administrator, trustee, executor or other person on behalf of an estate under the foregoing sub-section 3 shall not be again assessed, when received by the beneficiary or person entitled thereto.\nAlthough incorporated in s. 13, subs. 3 deals with a distinct subject-matter. Subsection 1 applies only to income received for a beneficiary who is a non-resident. Subsection 3 deals with all income which is not wholly distributed annually, regardless of the residence of the beneficiary. It may, therefore, be argued with some force that the construction of subs. 3 is not affected by the view taken as to the effect of subs. 1. Nevertheless it is significant that in both subsections alike the qualification of the person made liable to be assessed is the same\u2014\u201cthe agent, trustee, etc.,\u201d save that the additional words \u201cadministrator\u201d and \u201cexecutor\u201d are inserted in subs. 3, probably unnecessarily as the comprehensive phrase\nevery person who collects or receives or is in any way in possession or control of income for or on behalf of an estate\nwould include these personal representatives.\nThe manifest purpose of introducing this amendment was to cover the case of \u201cincome not wholly distributed annually,\u201d which it was contended in the earlier McLeod Case[8] was a casus omissus: and that view ultimately prevailed.\nThe difficulty of ascertaining the amount for which the appellant should be assessed proved to be formidable in McLeod v. Windsor8. Having regard to the provisions of subs. 20 of s. 5 as to the partial exemption of income derived from investments, etc., this feature of the assessment now in question might require further consideration before its validity could be upheld. But it was not adverted to in the discussion at bar which was confined to the constitutional question. We, therefore, deal only with this latter aspect of the case.\nSection 11 (1) declares every person not subject to business tax to be assessable in respect of income. Subsection 3 of s. 13 designates the \u201cagent, administrator, trustee, etc.,\u201d as the person to be assessed in respect of the income here in question. Section 95 makes the tax to be imposed recoverable as a debt. The intent to impose personal liability on the respondent would, therefore, seem to be clear. Indeed, subject to the question as to its extent, the respondent\u2019s personal liability was not seriously contested. In the court below, Mr. Justice Ferguson says,\nThe Deputy Attorney General * * * argued that * * * the tax was to be demanded from the trustee and ultimately paid and borne by him.\nIt is equally clear that no attempt has been made to fasten the tax as a lien or charge on the income. The section does not enjoin retention of it, or of any part of it, to meet the tax. This omission is most significant in the case of an agent, one of whose primary duties is the prompt remittance of moneys collected to his principal: yet the mere agent is made liable for the tax equally with the trustee, etc. The municipality is not given the right to attach or impound or otherwise reach the income directly. Its only recourse is personal against the trustee. Nor is there any clear expression of the restriction of the liability of the trustee to funds of the estate in his hands, such as is found in s. 37 (12) already adverted to.\nBut it is contended that this restriction is implied in the direction of subs. 3 of s. 13 that the assessment of the agent, administrator, trustee, etc. shall be \u201con behalf of the estate\u201d. We are, however, unable to find in this equivocal phrase evidence of an intent on the part of the legislature to depart in this instance from the general scheme of the Assessment Act, so clearly manifested in the sections above alluded to, that the liability of the person assessed shall be as for a debt due to the municipality and, therefore, unrestricted. The office of the words directing that the assessment shall be \u201con behalf of the estate\u201d would rather seem to be to make clear\u2014perhaps quite unnecessarily\u2014the right of the person so assessed to recoupment out of the funds of the estate (R.S.O., 1914, c. 121, s. 35), or as put by Mr. Justice Ferguson, \u201cto pass the tax on to the beneficiary.\u201d\nAn example of language apt to convey the intention to relieve the person to be assessed from personal liability beyond the estate property in his hands is found in a provision of the Quebec Succession Duty Act (4 Geo., V, c. 10) dealt with in Alleyn-Sharples v. Barthe[9]:\nNo notary, executor, trustee or administrator shall be personally liable for the duties imposed by this section. Nevertheless the executor, the trustee or the administrator may be required to pay such duties out of the property or money in his possession belonging or owing to the beneficiaries, and if he fails so to do may be sued for the amount thereof, but only in his representative capacity, and any judgment rendered against him in such capacity shall be executed against such property or money only.\nThe suggestion that all this was present to the minds of the Ontario legislators and was meant to be covered and intended to be enacted by the phrase \u201cassessed * * * on behalf of the estate,\u201d imposes too great a strain on curial credulity. Although always anxious to uphold impugned legislation by giving to it any construction of which it reasonably admits that will make for its validity, we feel that the implication contended for in order to support the taxation here in question would not be justified.\nWith the Appellate Divisional Court, we are of the opinion that the whole structure of the scheme for the imposition of taxes on income or in respect of income in the hands of persons in possession or control for the benefit of others depends on a system designed to make the trustee pay taxes which he is not intended to bear, but to obtain from other persons, and that consequently the tax sought to be imposed upon or collected from McLeod is an indirect tax, ultra vires of the province, and illegal.

A dispute arose between the Dominion taxing authorities and the sole surviving trustee (the appellant) as to the return of income for 1921 under The Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments, the former contending (as was sustained by the Exchequer Court) that the income accumulating in trust for the benefit of those who will be entitled to receive it at the expiration of the 21 years is taxable in the hands of the trustee as \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests\u201d within the second part of subs. 6 of s. 3 (as enacted 1920, c. 49, s. 4) of the said Act, and the trustee contending that such income, if taxable at all, is taxable only under the first part of the subsection as income accruing to the credit of the different beneficiaries though not received by the beneficiary during the taxation period. It was agreed that any income to which the child living in the State of New York was entitled or which was vested in her was mot taxable.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Idington and Mignault JJ.\u2014On the construction of the will, the vesting of the shares in the testator\u2019s children took place at the testator\u2019s death; and on the death of any of them before the expiration of the 21 years his share was divested and became vested in the trustees for distribution among the grandchildren at the time of the division of the estate as the trustees might think best. The words \u201ccontingent interests\u201d in the Act should be given their legal meaning and do not include the case of a share vested subject to be divested. The share of each of the living children in the accumulating fund was not taxable against the trustee as \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests,\u201d but (in the case of the child living in Canada) was taxable against the child herself. But the grandchildren were \u201cunascertained persons\u201d and the share of the fund which would have gone to the deceased child had he lived was taxable against the appellant as trustee.\nPer, Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ. (sustaining in the result, on equal division of the court, the judgment of the Exchequer Court).\u2014 Whether or not there are interests vested subject to be divested, the persons who are to enjoy the income are nevertheless, throughout the period of 21 years, uncertain and unknown, and therefore \u201cunascertained\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The Act, having regard to the time when the right to possession or enjoyment shall arrive, intends that the trustees shall pay the tax so long as it is uncertain who the persons may be who will then be entitled to receive the accumulated fund.\nThe trustee in his return claimed as a deduction a sum included in the net revenue, being the interest on Dominion of Canada tax-free bonds, and also claimed as a deduction from income subject to the normal tax a sum received as dividends from Canadian companies liable to income tax. The question arose whether (as between the trustee and the Crown) the income accumulating in trust should be deemed to contain the whole of the tax-free bond income or only a proportionate part thereof, a proportionate part being passed on for each of the annuitants in respect of the annuities paid from the income of the estate. It was agreed that what was decided as to the income received from the tax-free bonds applied to the dividends received from Canadian companies liable to income tax.\nHeld that the trustee was entitled to deduct the income derived from the tax-free bonds from the net amount of income in respect of which he was taxable.\nAPPEAL by the appellant executor and trustee on behalf of the estate of John Curry, late of Windsor, Ontario, deceased, from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J.[1], in so far as it held that the fund accumulating in the hands of the trustee under the deceased\u2019s will was income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests within the meaning of s. 3, subs. 6, of The Income War Tax Act, 1917, as enacted 1920, c. 49, s. 4, and as such liable to taxation; and a cross-appeal by the Minister of Customs and Excise from the said judgment in so far as it held that the appellant is entitled to retain for the benefit of the trust fund the full amount of income received from tax-free Dominion Government bonds. As to the right to retain for the advantage of the trust fund dividends from companies which had paid the tax on earnings, the parties agreed that the same principles apply as in respect of tax-free Dominion Government bonds. The material provisions of the deceased\u2019s will are set out or described, and the material facts given, in the judgments of Mignault and Newcombe JJ., and the questions dealt with by the court are indicated in the headnote.\nA. C. McMaster K.C. for the appellant.\nC. F. Elliott for the respondent.\nAnglin C. J. C.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault. Duff J.\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of my brother Newcombe, and I concur in his reasons, as well as in his conclusion. I desire merely to emphasize the fact that no opinion is expressed upon the question whether or not the children took a vested interest in the fund at the death of the testator. Upon that question it is quite unnecessary to pass. The fund was to accumulate for the benefit of the persons among whom it was to be distributed when the time of distribution arrived. It is impossible to affirm that these must include any of the children, nor is it possible to say with regard to the fund or with regard to any ascertained or ascertainable part of the fund, that the persons who were ultimately to share in it\u2014 the ultimate beneficiaries, in a word\u2014are now ascertained or ascertainable. The fund, in other words, is to accumulate for the benefit of persons who, for the relevant period, are not ascertained, and such a fund is, within the ordinary meaning of the words, it seems abundantly clear to me, a fund held for the benefit of \u201cunascertained persons\u201d.\nMignault J.\u2014John Curry, in his lifetime of the city of Windsor, province of Ontario, banker, died on the 11th of May, 1912, leaving a large estate comprising, inter alia, land in and about Windsor and in and about the city of Detroit, U.S. His wife, Frances Arabella Curry, and his three children, one son, Charles Francis Curry, and two daughters, Verene May McLeod, the wife of the appellant, and Gladys Alma Curry, survived him.\nBy his last will, after payment of his debts and testamentary and funeral expenses, he devised and bequeathed all his real and personal property wherever situate to his wife, Frances Arabella Curry, his son, Charles F. Curry, and his son-in-law, James Barber McLeod, whom he appointed executors and trustees of his will, their heirs, executors and administrators, in trust for sale and to convert into money. The time at which the properties would be sold and the conditions of the sale, either for cash or on credit, were left to the discretion of the trustees, who were empowered to lease the real estate for a term not exceeding ten years, with right to renew the leases for a like term. And out of the fund so formed, he directed his trustees to pay, free from legacy or succession duties, certain legacies and annuities, inter alia, during twenty-one years, $2,000, per year to Verene May McLeod, $1,000 per year to Gladys Alma Curry, with power to increase the annuity to $2,000 in the event of her marriage, and $2,000 to Charles Francis Curry. The will also left an annuity and certain bequests j to the testator\u2019s widow, with the free use of his house during her lifetime.\nBy the terms of the will, any surplus revenue not required for the payment of the legacies, annuities and expenses was to be invested and accumulated during twenty-one years from the testator\u2019s death, and as to the disposal of the accumulated fund at the end of that period, the testator ordered as follows:\nAt the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years from my death, i direct my Trustees after setting apart an amount sufficient to produce at three and one-half per cent per annum the annual payments hereinbefore directed to my beloved wife and the rates and charges on said house, to divide the balance of my estate in three parts and i direct that each of the said shares shall be conveyed or transferred to my children, Charles Francis Curry, Verene May Curry McLeod and Gladys Alma Curry. i further direct that as and when the capital which shall have been set apart at three and one-half per cent to produce the yearly sum to be paid to my beloved wife shall fall in and not be further required by reason of the death of my said wife, it shall be included in the division of the fund into three shares, or if it fall in after such division, it shall be divided in the same manner and amongst the same persons.\nAt the expiration of twenty-one years after my death and at the time of the division of my estate, i direct that in case any of my children shall have died in the meantime, that the one-third share of each or any of my children that shall die before the expiration of said twenty-one years, shall vest in my Trustees to divide the same amongst my grandchildren, if any, as they may think best.\nThe testator\u2019s wife survived him only a few months and died on the 31st of October, 1912. Charles Francis Curry, his son, also died on the 24th of March, 1920, and left no children. Verene May McLeod has three children, John C McLeod, Frances V. McLeod and Gladys E. McLeod, all minors. Gladys Alma Curry is, since 1915, a resident of the city of New York, U.S. She is unmarried. Both daughters of the testator now receive as annuities under the will $8,000 per year, to which sum the annuities were increased by order of the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nThe litigation has arisen over the return of income for 1921 made by the sole surviving trustee, James B. McLeod, the appellant, under the provisions of The Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments. This return shewed a gross income of $161,478.02, from which Mr. McLeod deducted $84,298.85 for interest on borrowed money, real estate expenses, payment of annuities and other costs, leaving as net income $77,179.17. The appellant also caused a return to be made for Verene May McLeod of one-third of the net revenue, and for each of her three children of one-ninth of the net revenue (being a third of the third share bequeathed to Charles Francis Curry). The trustee in his own return claimed as a deduction $1,650 included in the net revenue, being the interest on Dominion of Canada Bonds (referred to hereafter as tax-free bonds) issued exempt from income tax, and also claimed as a deduction from income subject to the normal tax $68,531.25 received as dividends from Canadian companies liable to income tax.\nThe trustee paid income tax on the basis of his returns, but in May, 1924, the Commissioner of Taxation claimed from him $16,285.15, after crediting the payments made. The trustee having appealed from this assessment, it was affirmed by the Minister of Finance, and the appellant then served a notice of dissatisfaction under section 15 of the Act, thus bringing the matter of the assessment before the Exchequer Court.\nIn the latter court, three questions were submitted as stated by the formal judgment:\u2014\n1. Whether the fund accumulating in the hands of the trustee under the will is \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests\u201d within the meaning of section 3, subsection 6, of The Income War Tax Act, 1917, as enacted by 10-11 Geo. V, c. 49, s. 4 (1920), and as such liable to taxation?\n2. Whether the estate as such was carrying on a business within the meaning of the Act, resulting in taxable profit?\n3. Whether the income accumulating in trust should be deemed to contain the whole of the tax-free bond income or only a portion thereof, the balance being passed on as tax-free income to the annuitants?\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court, Mr. Justice MacLean, answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative. The answer to the third question was that the appellant was entitled to retain for the benefit of the trust fund the full amount of the income received from the tax-free bonds. And in the event of the parties being unable to agree upon the remaining points raised in the appeal, right was reserved to apply for further directions in regard thereto. The decision of the Exchequer Court on the second question is not impugned by either party on this appeal. Th\u00e8 appellant appeals against the answer of the Exchequer Court to the first question, and by a cross-appeal the respondent asks that the judgment be set aside with respect to the determination it gave to the third question. Both parties take the position that what is decided as to the income derived from the tax-free bonds applies to the dividends received from Canadian companies liable to income tax. It will therefore not be necessary to deal separately with these dividends, the exemption as to which is only in respect of the normal tax. The parties also agree that any income to which Miss Gladys A. Curry is entitled or which is vested in her is not taxable under the Act, inasmuch as she does not reside in Canada.\nTaking up first the main appeal, which involves the answer given in the court below to the first question, although the question as framed would not appear to involve more than measuring the facts of this case by the rule contained in the second part of subsection 6, the learned President, in his reasons for judgment, considered himself free to refer to any other provision of the Act which could help in solving the problem submitted to him. In the argument before us, the parties also discussed other sections of the Act, and it may be well to do likewise in so far as these other provisions can be of any assistance.\nIt is obvious however that the whole of subsection 6 must be considered, and not merely its second part. This subsection, as first enacted by chapter 55 of the statutes of 1919, stated that the\nincome of a beneficiary of an estate shall be deemed to include the amount accruing during each taxation year to which he, his heirs or assigns are entitled from the income of an estate whether distributed or not.\nThe 1920 amendment changed this language, and added the provision concerning income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests. As the subsection now stands, it reads as follows:\n6. The income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period. Income accumulating in trust for the bene-21559\u20145\u00bd fit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\nTaken as a whole, subsection 6 seems designed to cover every case of income derived from an estate or trust. The first sentence provides for the taxation of the beneficiary on\nall income accruing to the credit of the tax-payer (in the French version, \u201cl\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du revenu accumul\u00e9 au credit du contribuable\u201d) whether received by him or not during such taxation period.\nThis of course supposes that there is an ascertained beneficiary presently or ultimately entitled to the income, even though this income may be accumulated and not paid over to him during the taxation period. The second sentence of subsection 6 deals with another situation, namely where it cannot be said that the income is presently appropriated to any certain beneficiary, for this income is\naccumulated in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests (\u201cin the French text, \u201cs\u2019accumulant au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de personnes inconnues ou de personnes ayant des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9ventuels\u201d).\nand then the income is taxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\nAll this is in accord with the general policy of the Act which imposes the income tax on the person and not on the property. In other words, it is the person who is assessed in respect of his income. We were referred to the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in subsection I of section 3. In so far as this definition can be of any help, it considers as income annual gains or profits \u201cwhether such gains or profits are divided, or distributed or not\u201d; but here we are dealing with something which, as received and accumulated by the trustee, is undoubtedly income. Our attention was also called to the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in section 2. And as \u201cperson\u201d means any \u201ctrust\u201d, it was argued that any \u201ctrust\u201d receiving income was taxable as a person. Still the Act having specifically provided by subsection 6 of section 3 for the case where income is derived from any estate or trust, we must, in the last analysis, come back to that subsection to determine the liability of the appellant under the Act. We were also referred to subsection 11 of section 7, which requires any trustee receiving income on behalf of a person who is resident outside of Canada to make a return of such income. But this subsection evidently contemplates the case where a non-resident is liable for income tax, and Miss Gladys A. Curry, the parties agree, does not come within the class of non-residents so liable (subsection 1 of section 4), and consequently subsection 11 of section 7 is of no assistance. Subsection 6 of section 3 therefore governs the matter under controversy.\nMr. McMaster contended on behalf of the appellant that the beneficiaries under the Curry will are not unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests, that their interests in the legacy are vested subject to being divested in a certain contingency, and that consequently the accumulating revenue is not taxable against the trustee, but can only be taxed against the beneficiary if the latter is subject to taxation under the Act.\nThis of course involves consideration of the terms of the will, and in this connection we were referred to a large number of decided cases, some of them dealing with devises of real estate or of money charged on real estate, others with legacies of personal property, but obviously each decision depended on the language of the devise or legacy under consideration.\nThe Curry will ordered the formation of a fund by the sale of the testator\u2019s property real and personal and its conversion into money, and after payment out of the income of the fund of the special legacies, annuities and expenses, the surplus revenue was to be accumulated in the hands of the trustees, and at the expiration of twenty-one years from the testator\u2019s death the trustees were directed to divide the estate into three parts and to convey and transfer each of such shares to the testators children, Charles Francis Curry, Verene May Curry McLeod and Gladys Alma Curry. So far, there would appear to be nothing of a contingent character, and it certainly cannot be claimed that these children are unascertained persons. It sufficiently appears from the provisions of the will, and especially from articles 3, 4 and 5\u2014which give the trustees a discretion as to the time when they shall sell the properties of the estate, and authorize them to sell for cash or on credit and to make leases of the real estate\u2014that the setting apart as well as the payment and distribution of the shares of the fund belonging to the children was postponed for the convenience of the fund, and for no reason personal to the legatees. Under these circumstances, and although the gift here is contained in the direction to pay or distribute the shares at a future time, I think that the vesting of the shares in the children is not deferred to the time of payment or distribution of the shares, but took place at the death of the testator (Jarman on Wills, 6th ed., vol. 2, p. 1404. See also Theobald on Wills, 7th ed. p. 585). The time when the legacy must be paid is certain, and the rule dies incertus conditionem in testamento facit is thus excluded.\nThis is also indicated by the direction in the will that at the expiration of the twenty-one years, and at the time of the division of the estate, in case any of the children shall have died in the meantime, the one-third share of each or any of the children that shall die before the expiration of the twenty-one years shall vest in the trustees to divide the same amongst the grandchildren, if any, as they may think best. This language shews that the children were vested with their shares in the fund to be formed after the death of the testator, and on the death of one of them before the expiration of the twenty-one years his share was divested and became vested in the trustees for distribution among the grandchildren at the time of the division of the estate, as they may think best.\nIn construing subsection 6, the terms \u201ccontingent interests\u201d should be given their legal meaning. It is argued that a construction should be placed on this expression that can be applied in all the provinces, including the civil law province of Quebec, and for this reason it is urged that the popular rather than the technical meaning should be given to the terms. In the province of Quebec, there can be no doubt as to the interpretation of the words \u201ccontingent interests\u201d or their equivalent in the French version of the Act \u201cint\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9ventuels.\u201d They mean there what I find they mean in the language of the common law. Were this not so, in construing these terms, effect should be given to the rule of construction laid down in Commissioners for Income Tax v. Pensel[2]. See also Chest er man v. Federal Commissioners of Taxation[3].\nThe appellant\u2019s contention that the second part of subsection 6 only applies when the income is accumulated wholly for persons with contingent interests or wholly for j unascertained beneficiaries cannot be supported. It may be accumulated partly for one class and partly for the other, and the trustee may administer a fund as to a portion of which ascertained beneficiaries have vested interests, while another portion of the fund may be left to persons with contingent interests, or to persons who are as yet unascertained. The subsection as a whole covers all these cases, and its first part may be well applied to one class and the second part to another under the same will.\nMy opinion therefore is that each of the testator\u2019s children had a vested interest in the gift of a third share of the fund. There is however more difficulty as to the vesting of the gift over in favour of the grandchildren. Charles Francis Curry died in 1920 and by his death was divested of the share that had vested in him. The title of the grandchildren to any portion of the fund was contingent on the death of one or more of the children before the expiration of the twenty-one years. By virtue of the will, on the death of Charles Francis Curry, his share became vested in the trustees to divide it among the grandchildren as they may think best. This division is to take place at the expiration of the twenty-one years, that is to say in 1933. There are now three grandchildren and there may be others, or none at all, at the latter date. Moreover, the share which any surviving grandchild may receive, should there be more than one, rests wholly in the discretion of the trustees. It seems at least doubtful, under all the circumstances, whether the grandchildren were vested in 1921 with any interest in Charles Francis Curry\u2019s share of the fund, but it is not necessary to decide the point because the grandchildren, during the period of assessment in question, were unascertained persons within the meaning of subsection 6. It is said that the class was ascertained, but the statute refers to the persons and not to the class, and no persons of the class were ascertained as beneficiaries when the assessment was made. On the main appeal therefore the judgment should be varied so as to declare that the share in the accumulating fund of Mrs. McLeod and Miss Curry is not taxable against the appellant. Mrs. McLeod\u2019s share is taxable against herself. The share of the fund, however, which would have gone to Charles Francis Curry, had he lived, should be declared taxable, for the 1921 period of taxation, against the appellant as trustee. As the appellant\u2019s appeal is successful in respect of a material part of the assessment, he should have his costs here and in the court below.\nWith respect to the cross-appeal of the respondent, there appears to be no reason for disturbing the judgment. The income derived from the tax-free bonds was part of the income received by the appellant as trustee, and he is entitled to deduct it from the net amount of income in respect of which he is taxable. The reasons given by the learned President for so deciding are satisfactory. The cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe case should be remitted to the Exchequer Court as some questions, which may be involved in the appeal from the assessment, and as to which the parties were to be at liberty to apply for further directions, were not determined.\nNewcombe J.\u2014The question in controversy depends upon the interpretation, in its application to the facts of the case, of s. 3, subs. 6, of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, as amended. This subsection provides that:\n(6) The income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period. Income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting: in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\nThe testator died on 11th May, 1912, leaving his wife and three children surviving, one son and two daughters. By his will, he left his property to his wife, his son, and his son-in-law, James B. McLeod, the appellant\nin trust for sale and to convert into money and to hold, invest, accumulate and dispose of the same, trust and subject to the provisiona hereinafter set out.\nHe directed that the proceeds should be invested by his trustees in securities of the various descriptions which he mentioned; that the income of the fund should be added to the principal and follow its destination, and that the accumulations should be made for and during the period of twenty-one years from his death. He directed that out of the income of the fund certain annuities and legacies should be paid, including a specified annuity to each of his children, to be paid quarterly during the period; also an annuity to his wife of $3,000, to be paid quarterly during her natural life, and that she should have the free use of his house. Then followed .two clauses providing that:\nAt the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years from my death, I direct my trustees after setting apart an amount sufficient to produce at three and one-half per cent per annum the annual payments hereinbefore directed to my beloved wife and the rates and charges on said house, to divide the balance of my estate in three parts and I direct that each of the said shares shall be conveyed or transferred to my children, Charles Francis Curry, Verene May Curry McLeod and Gladys Alma Curry. I further direct that as and when the capital which shall have been set apart at three and one-half per cent to produce the yearly sum to be paid to my beloved wife shall fall in and not be further required by reason of the death of my said wife, it shall be included in the division of the fund into three shares, or if it fall in after such division, it shall be divided in the same manner and amongst the same persons. At the expiration of twenty-one years after my death and at the time of the division of my estate, I direct that in case any of my children shall have died in the meantime that the one-third share of each or any of my children that shall die before the expiration of said twenty-one years, shall vest in my trustees to divide the same amongst my grandchildren, if any, as they may think best.\nThe testator\u2019s widow died on 31st October, 1912, and his son died on 24th March, 1920. The latter left no children. One of the testator\u2019s daughters is married to the appellant, and has three children; the other is unmarried.\nIt is held that the income accumulating in trust for the benefit of those who will be entitled to receive it at the expiration of the period of twenty-one years is taxable in the hands of the trustees. The appellant questions this decision, and principally upon the ground that, according to his contention, the respective interests of the testator\u2019s children and grandchildren, as defined by the will, are vested in them and not contingent.\nI shall not enter upon the enquiry as to whether the interests of the children and grandchildren, or any of them, are vested or not. In my view of the case, in either event, the beneficiaries are equally ascertained or unascertained. The testator gave practically his whole estate to his trustees to convert into money and to invest, the proceeds to be accumulated at interest for twenty-one years, subject to the payment of the legacies and annuities. There has been no severance or separation into parts. At the expiry of the twenty-one years, the dispositions were made subject to contingent events; the trustees were to set apart an amount sufficient to produce the annual payments provided for the testator\u2019s widow, and to divide the balance of his estate into three parts; one of these shares to be conveyed or transferred to each of his children who survived; and he directed that if, as the event happened, his widow should die during the period, the fund set apart to produce her annuity should fall into and become part of the residue, and be divided accordingly. Now I think it could have added nothing to the solution of the question in hand if the will had expressly declared, what is said to be its effect, that the testator\u2019s children shall each take a vested interest in the accumulated fund in the interval, subject to be divested as to any of them who shall die during the period; the persons who are to enjoy the income would nevertheless, at every moment of the period, be uncertain and unknown, and therefore unascertained in the only sense in which it is reasonable to suppose that the word is used in the statute.\nIf the income be accruing to the credit of an ascertained person who is the beneficiary of an estate or trust, the taxation of it is provided for by the first sentence of the section; but, whatever may be the meaning of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in the context, income which by the terms of the trust he may never receive cannot be said to be accruing to his credit, and therefore such income is not that of the testator\u2019s children or grandchildren within the intent of that clause. Presumably the concluding sentence of subs. 6 was intended to reach income accumulating in trust which is not accruing to the credit of a beneficiary because he is unascertained\u2014unknown, uncertain; or because his interest is contingent. It is uncertain at present who is to have or enjoy the income, and it is for that very state of uncertainty that I think the clause, in its application to this case, is intended and apt to provide. There is income acmulating in trust for the benefit of some person. Let it be assumed that the interests of the children are vested; nevertheless there are or may be other persons interested who may be solely entitled at the expiry of the period, and who do not derive their interests from the children; and the persons for whose benefit the income is accumulating, that is, those who will ultimately receive it, are therefore unascertained.\nThe express mention of \u201cpersons with contingent interests\u201d serves to indicate that \u201cunascertained persons\u201d do not include or are not limited to these, and therefore, if or in so far as an interest in personality must be either vested or contingent, persons with vested interests may, within the intent of the subsection, be unascertained. The truth is that the enquiry as to the character of an interest\u2014 whether vested or contingent\u2014is not conclusive for the determination of a question as to whether the persons possessing the interest are ascertained or not. In a sense of course all beneficiaries of a trust are ascertained when the trust is created, because it is essential that they shall be capable of ascertainment from the provisions of the trust; but, where the income is to accumulate and become payable in the future, and the ascertainment of the beneficiaries is subject to events which may happen in the interval, the beneficiaries are, nevertheless for the purposes of the statute, unascertained. In my view, the statute, having regard to the time when the right to possession or enjoyment shall arrive, intends that the trustees shall pay the tax so long as it is uncertain who the persons are, or may be, who will then be entitled to receive the accumulated income.\nI should imagine that if the trustees were asked at the present time to say who are the persons for whom they are, in the administration of the trust, accumulating the income, they could, if disposed to answer, only truthfully say that it is for the two daughters of the testator, if they survive the period; and, as to the one-third which each of the testator\u2019s children who has died or may die during the period would otherwise receive, for division among the testator\u2019s grandchildren, if any, as the trustees in charge of the trust at the time of distribution may think best; and, if there be no grandchildren at the end of the period, then for those who may be entitled by law according to the happening of the uncertain events. This answer would, I should think, be truly descriptive of persons who are unascertained, or who have contingent interests, within the meaning of the statute.\nBut it is said that at least, the testators\u2019 grandchildren now living are ascertained, that they have a vested interest under the will in that part of the fund which would have gone to the testator\u2019s son had he survived, and that they must receive that share at the expiry of the period; that therefore there are ascertained persons for whom the income is accumulating in trust, and consequently that the persons for whom the income is so accumulating are not unascertained. I am not however willing to accept either the premises or conclusion of this argument. If I be right in the view which I have expressed that the testamentary disposition of the income accumulating in trust as an undivided! whole is for the benefit of persons who at present are not, and cannot be, ascertained, that condition would not I think be affected by the fact, if it be a fact, that there are some individuals ascertained who, if they survive the period, will be entitled to an uncertain share in one-third of the entire fund.\nRinfret J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Newcombe.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nCross appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

Neither inspection of the sample nor of the bulk, so far as concerns defects not discoverable on reasonable inspection, excludes such implied warranty.\nThe court, applying above principle, reversed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (56 Ont. L.R. 418) and restored the judgment of Middleton J.,\nHeld that the appellant, purchaser of goods from the respondent, was entitled to damages for defect in the goods.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Middleton J. in favour of the appellant in an action for damages claimed on the ground that certain cloth sold and delivered by the respondent (which was not itself the manufacturer thereof) to the appellant and paid for, was so defective that it was not of merchantable quality. The transaction took place before the Sale of Goods Act of Ontario came into operation.\nG.W. Mason K.C. and R.L. Kellock for the appellant.\nG.L. Smith for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014John Macdonald and Company Limited, wholesale dry goods merchants, purchased on or about the 29th April 1920, from The Princess Manufacturing Company Limited, manufacturer of ladies garments, sixty-six webs of black Italian cloth.\nThe Princess company were not themselves the manufacturers of these goods. They had bought them for use in their business, but finding that they had a surplus of them, they were willing to dispose of it.\nNothing was said as to the purpose for which the Macdonald Company purchased the cloth. However it is used chiefly as a \u201ccoat lining\u2014either men\u2019s or women\u2019s wear\u201d; and Mr. Carson, factory manager of the Princess Company, stated in his evidence that it\nis a well-known description of goods on the market * * * in trade it means black cotton lining suitable for garments. There was contradictory evidence as to how the sale was made. Brown for the appellant deposed that he concluded the purchase with Mr. Gibson, president of the Princess Company, after having examined a whole piece (or web) brought in by Mr. Gibson. The latter wanted $1.10 per yard, Brown offered $1; they compromised at $1.05. Gibson left the web with Brown after he bought the goods. The other 65 webs were delivered later.\nGibson at first testified that he was in Macdonald\u2019s warehouse and was asked if they could dispose of any black Italian. He telephoned to Mr. Carson and asked him. Carson answered he would look into the matter and get in touch with Mr. Brown. He added: \u201cI did not make any bargain for the goods at all\u201d. Carson \u201ctransacted the rest of the transaction\u201d. But when re\u2011examined, Mr. Gibson is put the following question:\nAnd Mr. Brown says the bargain was made with you for the goods\u2014would you agree with him, on that interview a bargain was made?\nHe replies: \u201cYes\u201d.\nThe importance of this answer is that it comes from the president of the Princess company, and admittedly the interview referred to is the only one where the price was discussed and agreed upon. According to Mr. Gibson, this interview took place before the piece of cloth was sent over to the Macdonald Company, and his story is inconsistent with his having himself taken the web to the latter\u2019s warehouse and shown it to Brown.\nIn this he is corroborated by Mr. Carson, who says that, after having received the telephone from Mr. Gibson, he requested the shipper of the Princess company to take down a sample piece and leave it for Mr. Brown. The next day, Carson \u201cwent down to see Mr. Brown\u201d. He goes on to say:\nI asked Mr. Brown if he had looked at the material sent in and he said he had. I asked him if he cared to have it, and he asked me if they were in good condition. I said they were new goods in from Pullan\u2019s of Bradford, and that we could send them down to him to see. He told me to send them in, and we sent them in that same day, that is the remaining 64 pieces.\nQ. And you have a receipt for them?\u2014A. We have a receipt for them.\nQ. Did you see Mr. Brown again about the matter?\u2014A. No, I did not see Mr. Brown again.\nQ. What happened after that?\u2014A. The goods were accepted and paid for in due course. Q. When were they\u2014have you a memorandum when they were paid for?\u2014A. I have.\nQ. And the price Mr. Brown has told us was $1.05?\u2014A. They were paid by John Macdonald cheque on May 4th, 1920.\nThe shipper, F.W. Green, gave evidence that he delivered the sample piece of cloth to Mr. Brown on April 28, 1920, and he produced a book showing the receipt for it. This accords with the invoice sent on the 29th April by the Princess Company to the Macdonald Company.\nOn this evidence, the trial judge found that \u201cthe sale was both by description and by sample\u201d.\nAs the transaction took place before the Sale of Goods Act of Ontario came into operation, our decision must rest upon the common law.\nHowever, before we come to the consideration of the state of the common law as applied to the particular circumstances of this litigation, a further set of facts, as to which there is no dispute, must be adverted to.\nBrown says he made the ordinary inspection of the sample by feeling the cloth and examining it ocularly, to estimate from the appearance the quality of the goods in respect of weight, fineness of texture and colour. He did not \u201cunroll the piece so as to try it for tenderness\u201d nor \u201cpull it apart for strength\u201d. He apparently made the test customary in ordinary commercial practice. (See Lord Macnaghten at p. 297 in Drummond v. Van Ingen[2]. He was not expected to send the piece to a tester and have it shrunk \u201cunless he had doubt of the goods,\u201d and he had none; he found them \u201cperfect goods\u201d.\nWhen the sixty-five remaining webs were delivered, Brown merely opened one piece, \u201cto see if it compared with the sample piece,\u201d and was satisfied that it did. He \u201cdid not test it for strength\u201d. He did not unroll the goods. His reason was that\nit is rather a difficult matter to open up a roll of Italian cloth,\nand\nyou would never get them back into the same condition again.\nHe admits \u201cit could be done\u201d; but (to use the words of Mr. Almas, manager of a department in the Macdonald Company)\nit is not customary for wholesalers to examine linings when they receive them from the mill because you cannot\nput them in the same shape as before they were opened and the customers think the bundles were tampered with.\nThe Macdonald Company began to resell the cloth. They got complaints from their customers that the goods were so inferior as not to be merchantable. Upon investigation, they came to the conclusion that this was the fact and that the cloth lacked in tensile strength, because, as they assumed,\nthe fabric was rotted by the dyes used in the course of the manufacture.\nAt the trial, the experts first heard disagreed; but the parties afterwards collaborated on certain tests, as a result of which the goods were found utterly inadequate in strength, the defect being \u201cattributed to the unduly short fibre\u201d. The presiding judge accordingly held it to be established \u201cthat the goods were not in fact merchantable\u201d and that their defect would not be \u201cdiscernible on ordinary examination\u201d or \u201capparent upon reasonable examination of the samples. * * * or of the goods\u201d.\nMr. Justice Smith delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division. Commenting upon this feature of the case, he said:\nThere was some discussion on the argument as to whether the very superficial examination that Mr. Brown says he gave the sample was sufficient. It was urged that, if he had availed himself of the opportunity of a fuller examination which he had, the lack of strength would have been disclosed. Mr. Carson, the appellant\u2019s manager, testified that when the goods arrived from England he opened and unrolled two webs, and examined them by all ordinary means, including testing for strength by pulling with his fingers and found no defect, and accepted the goods. In face of this evidence the appellant cannot complain that respondents did not discover the defect because of lack of proper inspection, and the learned judge\u2019s finding on that point is quite warranted.\nThe action is for damage due to the fact that the material sold, delivered and paid for, was so defective that it was not of merchantable quality.\nThe trial judge stated that\nthroughout both parties acted in perfect good faith, and the question is where the loss is to be borne, neither of the parties litigant being in any way at fault from the moral standpoint.\nHe was of opinion that the case was governed by the decision in Mody v. Gregson[3], and awarded judgment for the recovery of the amount claimed. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, but, in reaching this result, appears to have been to no slight extent influenced by the impression, no doubt unwittingly left upon their minds, that, after the long adjournment to have an examination made of the goods by another expert, judgment had been given on the report of the latter without any further hearing. Due to \u201clack of any argument,\u201d the court thought that, on the question as to how the sale was made, counsel before the trial judge had no opportunity of pointing to Brown\u2019s \u201clapse of memory\u201d and \u201cthe evidence the other way\u201d. Mr. Justice Smith, in fact, expressly states:\nIt is because I think that matter was not before his mind and was not considered that I venture to think, on the evidence, that there was a sale of specific goods after inspection by Brown. * * * If the learned trial judge had reached his conclusions on a consideration of the evidence on that point, and the conduct of the witnesses, I would accept his finding without question.\nWhile the trial centred on the question whether the goods were merchantable and was adjourned to permit of the supplementary examination already mentioned, the case was fully argued by counsel for both parties before the learned trial judge after completion of the further tests; and, under the circumstances, we see no reason, and none was pointed out to us at bar, why his findings that the sale was by description and by sample should not be accepted. The question is therefore: Upon that finding in an ordinary commercial transaction, how would the common law deal with the case?\nAs early as Gardiner v. Gray[4], where twelve bags of waste silk had been sold, after inspection of samples, but were later discovered to be unmerchantable under the description of waste silk and could not be used for any of the usual purposes for which waste silk was used, Lord Ellenborough (p. 145) laid down the rule of law as follows:\nI am of opinion, however, that under such circumstances, the purchaser has a right to expect a saleable article answering the description in the contract. Without any particular warranty, this is an implied term in every such contract. Where there is no opportunity to inspect the commodity, the maxim of caveat emptor does not apply. He cannot without a warranty insist that it shall be of any particular quality of fineness, but the intention of both parties must be taken to be that it shall be saleable in the market under the denomination mentioned in the contract between them. The purchaser cannot be supposed to buy goods to lay them on a dunghill. The question then is whether the commodity purchased by the plaintiff be of such a quality as can be reason- ably brought into the market to be sold as waste silk? The witnesses describe it as unfit for the purposes of waste silk and of such a quality that it cannot be sold under that denomination.\nIn a later case, on a sale of oxalic acid, where the defendant was not the manufacturer, but had purchased it from the manufacturers, and, after delivery, the acid was found to contain sulphate of magnesia which was not discoverable even by experienced persons, except by analysis, the court (Willes J. delivering the judgment) held that:\nWhere goods are sold under a certain denomination, the buyer is entitled to have such goods delivered to him as are commercially known under this denomination, though he may have bought after inspection of the bulk, and without warranty. (Josling v. Kingsford)[5].\nIt was after having referred to the above rule laid down by Lord Ellenborough in Gardiner v. Gray4, and having mentioned incidentally that it was \u201celaborately commented upon in the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, delivered by Mellor J. in Jones v. Just\u201d[6], that Willes J., in Mody v. Gregson[7], expressed himself in the following way:\nThis rule of law entitling the purchaser in an ordinary commercial bargain for the supply of goods, not specified or agreed upon at the time but described generally as of a designated sort, to receive merchantable goods of that sort, is founded upon an obvious inference from the character of the transaction, that the parties are dealing not for the mere semblance or shadow of the thing designated, but for the thing itself as commonly understood in commerce, with the essential qualities which make it worth buying to a person who wants an article of that designation; in other words, that the buyer and seller, in the absence of anything to show an intention to the contrary, must be taken as intending to buy and sell respectively a merchantable article of the designated kind.\nWilles J. afterwards refers to the fact that Gregson and others were manufacturers of the goods, but only as one of the \u201cspecial reasons for applying\u201d what he expressly calls \u201cthe general rule in favour of the buyers\u201d.\nHe then proceeds to examine whether the fact of the sale being by sample negatives the implied term that the goods should be merchantable and points out (p. 53) that there are cases where the sample is given under circumstances which make it the only description of the thing to be supplied, and so to constitute the only touchstone of the contract,\nand there are other cases where goods are\nbought under a specified commercial description, either by sample or even after inspection of the bulk.\nHe goes on to say that, in the latter class of cases,\nit is an implied term, notwithstanding the sample or inspection, that the goods shall reasonably answer the specified description in its commercial sense. The sample in such cases is looked upon as a mere expression of the quality of the article, not of its essential character, and notwithstanding the bulk be fairly shown, or agree with the sample, yet if from adulteration or other causes not appearing by the inspection or sample, though not known to the seller, the bulk does not reasonably answer the description in a commercial sense, the seller is liable.\nAnd he cites Josling v. Kingsford[8] where, he says, \u201cfor like reasons,\u201d the seller, although he knew nothing of the adulteration, was held liable by the Court of Common Pleas.\nMody v. Gregson[9] was approved by the House of Lords in Drummond v. Van Ingen[10]. Lord Herschell, in his speech, refers to it thus:\nIn the case of Mody v. Gregson10 in the Exchequer Chamber, the decision in Jones v. Just[11] was approved of and acted upon, and it was further held that the implied warranty that the goods supplied are merchantable was not absolutely excluded by the fact that the goods were sold by sample, and that the bulk precisely corresponded with it, but was only excluded as regards those matters which the purchaser might, by due diligence in the use of all ordinary and usual means, have ascertained from an examination of the sample. I think that the law enunciated in these cases is sound and not open to doubt.\nThe summary of the common law then resolves itself into this that\nif the subject-matter (of the sale) be merely the commercial article or commodity, the undertaking is that the thing offered or delivered shall answer that description, that is to say shall be that article or commodity saleable or merchantable. If the subject-matter be an article or commodity to be used for a particular purpose, the thing offered or delivered must answer that description, that is to say, it must be that article or commodity, and reasonably fit for the particular purpose. (Brett J.A. in Randall v. Newson[12], approving Best C.J. in Jones v. Bright[13]. It is put thus in Benjamin on Sale, 6th ed., at p. 715:\nIf the buyer\u2019s purpose be communicated to the seller, the seller\u2019s obligation is to supply goods fit for that purpose; if the goods are bought under a commercial description, his duty is to supply merchantable goods.\nUnder a contract of sale of an article, such as black Italian cloth, the ordinary use of which is well established and which is a \u201cwell-known description in the trade,\u201d although there is no evidence that the purpose for which it was being bought was communicated to the vendors, there was an implied warranty that the cloth would be merchantable \u201cblack cotton lining suitable for garment,\u201d this being the ordinary and usual purpose for which it was used. Neither inspection of the sample nor of the bulk, so far as concerned defects not discoverable on reasonable inspection, excluded the implied warranty that the cloth must answer its usual commercial description and be merchantable and saleable under that description. Here it was not.\nWe think therefore the trial judge was right and his judgment must be restored. The appeal is allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Donald, Mason, White and Foulds.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smith, Rae and Grier.\n[1] 56 Ont.

Held that, in view of the terms of the agreement and the wording of its clauses, the relationship of the parties did not differ essentially from that of mortgagor and mortgagee, with an obligation for payment by the former, and therefore the surplus proceeds of the resale belonged to the buyer; that there was nothing in the B.C.

The plaintiff made default in payment of some of the instalments of the purchase money and the defendant took possession of the automobile and resold it. The proceeds of the resale exceeded the balance unpaid by the plaintiff and the action was to recover the excess from the defendant\nC.W. Craig K.C. for the appellant.\nD.Donaghy for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The plaintiff agreed for the purchase of an automobile from the defendant upon terms of cash and credit, as set out in a written agreement between the parties. He made default in payment of some of the instalments of the purchase money, and the defendant took possession of the vehicle and sold it under provisions of the agreement, realizing a sum in excess of the unpaid instalments. The plaintiff thereupon brought this action in the County Court to recover the excess. The County Court judge gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant company appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the excess belonged to it, and not to the plaintiff. The amount, $532.78, is not in dispute. The appeal was dis- missed, but Martin J. A. and M. A. MacDonald J. A. dissented. The case comes before this court by special leave of the Court of Appeal.\nThe question depends upon the interpretation and effect of the agreement of sale between the parties. It is dated 1st April, 1924. The vendor (the appellant) agrees to sell, and the purchaser (the respondent) agrees to purchase, the automobile upon the terms and conditions therein set forth, and the purchaser acknowledges receipt of the automobile in good order and condition. The price is $3,103.60, of which $950 was paid at the time of executing the agreement, and it was stipulated that the balance should be paid in twelve monthly instalments of varying amounts. The instalments were to bear interest at 8 per cent, and the purchaser gave to the vendor his promissory note for each of the instalments. Then \"the terms and conditions of this contract of conditional sale\" are enumerated and set out; there is a description of the automobile \"together with the conditions surrounding the purchase of the same\". By these it is provided that the vendor has and shall continue to have the absolute property \"until after full and complete payment of the purchase price therefor\"; that \"on full payment of said promissory notes (or renewals), principal and interest, according to their terms, the titles of said property shall vest in said purchaser\"; it is declared that the automobile is to be used as a taxicab, and that, while it is in possession of the purchaser, he shall have the right to use it for that purpose; that he shall take proper care of it, and that, if it be injured or require repairs, the purchaser shall immediately have it repaired at his own expense, and that the purchaser shall not sell or dispose of it, or remove it from British Columbia, except upon the written permission of the vendor. I quote in full the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th enumerations:\u2014\n9. The purchaser covenants that the automobile covered by this agreement will not be used for the transportation of liquor or drugs or any unlawful purpose during the life of this agreement, and in case of any such contingency, the entire debt hereby secured shall, at the vendor's option, become immediately due and payable, and the vendor shall have the same right of seizure and sale as if default had been made in payment of principal or interest.\n10.If by reason of failure of the purchaser to pay an instalment of principal or interest or any part of the same or to observe any of the covenants, provisos or conditions herein contained, the vendor shall deem it advisable to take any proceedings either judicial or extra judicial to protect itself or enforce the security, all costs and expenses incurred by the vendor of or incidental to such proceedings shall be payable by the purchaser and shall be deemed to be a payment of principal due and in arrears hereunder, and shall bear interest at the rate herein above set forth.\n11. That time shall be material and of the essence hereof, and that if default be made in the payment of said principal sum or interest, or any part thereof, at the time the same shall become due, or if default be made by said purchaser in any other respect hereunder, or if said purchaser fails to make payment for any labour, repairs, improvement or equipment placed upon said automobile by authority of said purchaser (in which case said vendor may, at its option, make such payment), then the said principal sum and all accrued interest, including expenses (if any) and including such payment (if any) made by said vendor thereon, shall thereupon immediately become wholly due and payable at the option of said vendor (notice of said option being hereby waived), the said vendor may at once take possession of said automobile and said parts, devices, tools, and equipment wherever the same may be, and sell said automobile and said parts, devices, tools and equipment and the whole thereof, as provided by law.\n12. The purchaser agrees to pay any deficiency that may remain after the application of the proceeds of any sale hereunder to the payment of said indebtedness or any judgment obtained thereon.\nThere remains a clause by which the purchaser agrees to keep the automobile insured for an amount equal to or exceeding the principal sum payable under the agreement,\nloss, if any, payable to vendor or assigns as interest may appear, and deliver the policy therefor to said vendor,\nor that the vendor may procure insurance,\nand all sums expended in so doing, with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum, shall be added to the purchase price, and shall be secured hereby.\nIt will be observed that, by the express provisions of three of the clauses to which I have referred, it is a term or condition of or \" surrounding the purchase of\" the automobile that the agreement shall operate as a security to the vendor for the principal and interest of the debt, and that, if and when any of the payments provided for shall become overdue, the vendor may take possession of the automobile and sell it, applying the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the indebtedness, from which it would seem to follow that the agreement is intended to operate as a legal mortgage, incident to which, of course, is the purchaser's right to redeem.\nWhile the transaction may constitute a conditional sale within the definition of the Conditional Sales Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 44, I do not find any provision in that Act which denies the respondent's right to the surplus proceeds of the sale.\nIt is enacted by section 10 that when the seller retakes possession of the goods pursuant to a condition in the contract, he shall retain them for twenty days, and that the buyer may redeem them within that period by paying the balance of the contract price with the actual costs and expenses of taking and keeping possession; that, if the price of the goods exceed $30, and the seller intend to look to the buyer for any deficiency upon resale, the goods shall not be resold until after notice in writing of the intended sale shall have been given to the buyer, which notice is to contain a description of the goods; a statement of the balance due and the actual costs and expenses; a demand of payment on or before the day mentioned, and a statement that, unless the amount be paid within the time mentioned, the goods will be sold. It is further provided that, when the goods are not redeemed within the twenty days, and subject to the giving of the notice of sale prescribed, the seller may sell the goods, either by private sale or at public auction, at any time after the expiration of that period[2]. There is nothing in these provisions however to suggest an intention to diminish or to prejudice the rights which the purchaser has under the terms of the instrument, or which are by law incidental to the transaction; they are intended rather for the protection of the purchaser; the disposition of the proceeds of the sale is not expressly regulated by the statute, and remains subject to the provisions expressly or impliedly contracted.\nThe dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal relied principally upon the case of Sawyer v. Pringle[3]. But it is to be observed that the provisions of the agreement in that case differed from those now under consideration, and the question involved was also different. There was a contract which is described as an executory agreement of future sale on performance of certain named conditions by the defendant.\nThere are two clauses from the agreement extracted in the report, and from one of these it appears that the property in the machine which was the subject of the agreement was not to pass to the proposed purchaser until full payment of the price and any obligations given therefor, although he was to have the possession and right of use in the interval; but, upon any default in payment, the whole price or obligation was to become due and payable, and it was provided that the vendor might then resume possession. There was no provision for resale; but, upon default, the vendor did resume possession and resell for less than the price stipulated by the agreement, and it was held that the balance was not recoverable from the purchaser, because the vendor, by reselling the machine to another, had disabled himself from completing the sale for which he had previously agreed, and that the consideration for the payment of the price therefore failed. Such a question could not arise in this case because by the twelfth clause of the contract the purchaser explicitly agrees to pay any amount by which the proceeds of sale are deficient to meet the indebtedness.\nBurton J. A., who was one of the majority of the court, said:\u2014\nIf I could bring myself to the conclusion arrived at by one of my learned brothers (MacLennan J.A.) that the relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee existed between these parties, I should probably have no difficulty in arriving at the same result as he has, but that, as it appears to me, is what they have studiously avoided. They have on the contrary refrained from making any absolute contract of sale, reserving possession merely till payment, but have entered into a peculiar contract under which no sale is to be considered as made until full payment of the price.\nOsler, J. A. considered that the case must be looked at as if the possession had always remained with the vendor, and he said it\nis one where there is an express contract which governs the right of the parties, and in which the plaintiffs have been careful to exclude the possibility of the goods being treated for any purpose as the goods of the defendant, until the price shall have been paid.\nOn the other hand, Maclennan J. A. found that the relationship of mortgagor and mortgagee existed between the parties, and that their legal and equitable rights must be determined by the principles applicable to that relation. While in the present case the contract does not amount to a bargain and sale of the automobile, and is executory in the sense that the property is not to pass to the purchaser until payment of the price, it is nevertheless a concluded agreement for sale by which the possession passes to the purchaser, and the property is also to pass upon compliance with the stipulated conditions, the vendor in the meantime, by the express provisions, retaining the property as security. The debt is secured upon the property, the legal ownership remaining with the creditor, but the equitable ownership being that of the debtor, subject to the security afforded to the creditor for the debt; the vendor is given the right to take possession and sell, if the purchaser fail to make payment; the proceeds of the sale are to be applied to the payment of the indebtedness, and the purchaser is to pay any deficiency which may remain; therefore the relationship between the parties does not differessentially from that of mortgagor and mortgagee with an obligation for payment by the former; and if, as I conclude, that be the meaning and effect of the instrument, there can be no doubt that the surplus proceeds of the sale belong to the purchaser. It is true that the property was not transferred to the purchaser and reconveyed to the vendor in order to effect the security for the indebtedness which, by the stipulations of the agreement, the latter was to have; but equity looks to the intent of the transaction rather than to the form, and the intent is made clear by the terms of the instrument.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McLellan & White.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. A. Jackson.\n[1] [1926] 1 W.W.R. 508.\n[2] Reporter\u2019s Note:- The chattel in question was not resold until after the expiration of the twenty days. The notice (referred to in the judgement) required by the Act to be given if the seller intends to look to the buyer for any deficiency on a resale was not given in this case.\n[3] 18 Ont.

Donaghy contra.\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014In this case a dying declaration of the murdered woman was admitted at the trial. The accused was tried at Vancouver and found guilty. He appealed from his conviction to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia upon two grounds, which are stated in the notice of appeal as follows:\u2014\n(a) the said conviction cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. (b) the learned judge of Assize wrongfully admitted an alleged dying declaration or ante-mortem statement of one Pearl Prosser (also known as Pearl Travesey), and evidence thereof.\nThe appeal was dismissed unanimously by the learned justices of appeal who heard the case. Application is now made on behalf of the prisoner for leave to appeal to this court under s. 1024A of the Criminal Code, on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, dismissing the prisoner's appeal to that court, conflicts with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Allen v. The King[1].\nIt appears that the woman was taken to the hospital in a taxi-cab on 27th November, 1925, suffering from a severe wound from which she died on 16th January, 1926. On 8th January she had made a declaration, which was taken down, and which she signed, and in which she declared that the wound was inflicted by a knife in the hand of the prisoner. But at that time she had not that settled hopeless expectation of death which is requisite to the admissibility of a dying declaration. Her condition became worse, and when, on 15th January, she was asked to make the statement which was used at the trial, and about the admissibility of which the question arises, what occurred is stated by Roderick McLeod, a detective of the Vancouver police force, who gave the following evidence before the jury:\u2014\nThe doctor reported to me her condition. I then turned to Earl Robinson (the magistrate who had taken down her statement on the 8th) who was at the table and addressed the woman. I said this was the man who had taken a statement from her on a previous occasion and I said: \"This gentleman is going to read to you Pearl the statement that we got from you before, and I am going to ask you if it is correct. You will tell me if it is or not.\" So Earl Robinson proceeded to read the statement that he had in his book * * * The statement he read was the statement that she gave to us the week previously.\nThen follows Mr. McLeod's account of the reading of the previous statement, question and answer, and of the woman's assent. When the writing was finished she tried to sign, but was too weak, and she made her mark.\nIt is urged that according to the principle of the decision of this court in Allen v. The King[2], the statement so obtained, which was admitted and read at the trial, and subsequently held admissible by the Court of Appeal, was inadmissible because of the evidence which identifies the woman's narrative of what took place when the fatal blow was struck with her account as given a week previously, when she still entertained hope of recovery.\nIn Allen v. The King[3] a witness had testified at the preliminary investigation who was not produced at the trial, and the requirements for the admission of his deposition under s. 999 of the Criminal Code were not established. When the prisoner came to give his evidence however he was cross-examined with regard to some of the statements which this witness had made and which were taken down at the preliminary inquiry, and it was held by a majority of this court that the result of this was that a material portion of the deposition taken before the police magistrate had been given to the jury without the conditions of the Act being complied with, and that the evidence was therefore inadmissible.\nThe Court of Appeal of British Columbia has determined that the declaration now in question was admissible, and of course it is not for me to review that decision. The question I think is whether that court should have held otherwise upon the proper interpretation and application of the decision in Allen v. The King[4].\nThe evidence produced before the jury shews that the declaration in proof was elicited by a communication to the deceased that the statement about to be read to her was that which she had signed on 8th January, followed by the reading to her of that statement, and that her declaration of 15th January was identical in its description of the facts of the tragedy with the one made by her on the previous occasion, when she did not realize that she was going to die. It may be that these facts affect only the weight or credibility, not the admissibility, of the declaration, that is not for me to decide, but if that were the view of the Court of Appeal, I find nothing to conflict with it in the judgment of this court in the Allen Case[5]. Indeed, after the most careful consideration, I have reached the conclusion that ingenuity cannot suggest anything involved in the judgment in Allen's Case[6] with which the judgment of the Court of Appeal upholding the admission of the declaration of 15th January is necessarily in conflict.\nI must therefore dismiss the application.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1911] 44 Can.

Some months later, the respondent signed another instrument transferring the brick property to the new company which assumed liability for the payment of the mortgage, but the instrument expressly released the appellant company from its obligation to pay off the mortgage. In an action for specific performance of the first agreement,\nHeld, that the basic fact on which the respondent's case must rest is that he executed the instrument containing the release clause in ignorance of its presence and effect and the burden of proving such ignorance rested on him; and that his evidence, which alone was offered to substantiate it, did not discharge that onus.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1925] 2 W.W.R. 267) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Gregory J. at the trial and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent brought action for a declaration that he is entitled to be indemnified by the appellant company against his liability on a mortgage to one Braun, which appellant had agreed to assume and pay off, and for specific performance of such agreement. The respondent was a brickmaker and the appellant was a company carrying on coal mining operations near Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island. In the spring of 1921, the appellant entered into an agreement with the respondent by which he was to have the right to take certain shale which was found contiguous to the company's coal and use the same for making brick, and on the same date, March 12th, a lease of a three-acre portion of the company's property was made to the respondent for the purpose of using the same as a brick yard. At this time J. M. Braun was a director of the appellant company and just about the time these agreements were entered into, was appointed one of a committee of two directors to attend at the mine and assist or supervise the management thereof and did so attend and reside at the mine. Braun and the respondent then entered into an arrangement under which the respondent, at the instance of Braun, went about and bought some second-hand brick machinery and had the same installed on the leased premises. The respondent put into the proposition about $900 of his own money, while Braun apparently furnished the balance, which amounted from $14,000 to $18,000. At the end of June, Braun took from the respondent a chattel mortgage to secure advances of $23,000 and future advances to be made by Braun to the respondent and covering the brick plant and equipment. At the annual general meeting of the company on August 11th, 1921, it was decided that the company should purchase from the respondent the brick plant and this was accordingly done by an agreement of the same date. This agreement provided for the incorporation of a company to take over and carry on the brickmaking business in which company the respondent was to have a 5% interest. The respondent was also to be paid the sum of $5,000 in cash which was actually paid to him. As one of the terms of taking over the brick plant the appellant company agreed to pay certain of the respondent's liabilities which were set out, among them the liability for any money due under the chattel mortgage. Pursuant to the agreement a new company was formed within the ninety days specified in the agreement and after its formation the respondent was given his 5% interest in shares. The brick plant and assets which the appellant company had received from the respondent were conveyed and transferred to the new company and upon receiving the assets the new company likewise assumed that liability which remained unpaid, the chattel mortgage. The deed of transfer signed by the respondent released the appellant company from its own obligation in the August agree- ment. The transfer was carried out by two agreements of the 22nd December, 1921. These agreements were drawn by Mr. Speer, of the law firm of Davis & Co., on instructions from Mr. Coleman, managing director of the appellant. Two years later, the respondent commenced this action against the appellant company only and setting up in answer to the release pleaded by the company first a plea of \"non est factum\" which later was abandoned and replaced by a plea of fraud. The claim for damages was abandoned at the trial and the trial judge dismissed the action. An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal which reversed the judgment of the trial judge and declared that the respondent was entitled to be indemnified by the appellant.\nJ. A. Ritchie K. C. and E. F. Newcombe for the appellant.\nR. Cassidy K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This record, in our opinion, does not disclose any such cogent facts or circumstances as would warrant a reversal of the finding of the learned trial judge that the plaintiff was \"wholly unreliable\" as a witness. That finding is abundantly warranted by the inconsistencies and contradictions of the plaintiff's own testimony and its conflict in material facts with that of such an admittedly upright and trustworthy witness as Mr. Speer, the solicitor who prepared and attended upon the execution of the documents in the obtaining of which the fraud alleged is said to have been committed.\nIn the case as made by the plaintiff in his evidence at the trial misconduct and misrepresentation on the part of Mr. Speer formed a notable feature. That the execution of the document containing the release was procured by a scheme carefully prepared by Coleman, the defendant company's manager, as a result of which the plaintiff was kept in ignorance of the presence in it of the release, being assured by Mr. Speer that it was \"just a usual transfer,\"\u2014 such was the case the defendant was called upon to meet. On appeal, and again in this court, every imputation against Mr. Speer was unqualifiedly withdrawn and the plaintiff's case was rested wholly on his failure to realize the presence of a release clause in one of two documents which he was induced to sign in Mr. Speer's office, or on his in- ability to appreciate its significance\u2014a situation, for which, it is charged, Coleman, deliberately prepared and on which he successfully relied. That case was not put forward at the trial and neither the defendant company nor the witness Coleman had any fair opportunity to meet it. With the utmost respect we are of the opinion that, under these circumstances, such a charge of fraudulent conduct by Coleman as that now insisted upon should not have been held by the Court of Appeal to have been established.\nA basic fact on which the plaintiff's case must rest is that he executed the document containing the release clause in ignorance of its presence and effect. The burden of proving such ignorance rested on him. His evidence, which alone was offered to substantiate it, does not discharge that onus.\nIt is quite conceivable that the plaintiff, without any fraudulent intent or manoeuvre on the part of Coleman, such as is now suggested in support of his claim, may have executed the release with full realization of its import, because he was mistakenly optimistic as to the prospects of the brickmaking venture in which he had been engaged and of the company incorporated to carry it on. But however that may be, and without casting the slightest doubt on the right of the Court of Appeal in a proper case to find fraud established notwithstanding the contrary view taken by the trial judge (Annable v. Coventry)[2], we are all very clearly of the opinion that, under the circumstances of this case, the explicit findings of the trial judge, which obviously rested largely on his appreciation of the respective credibility of the three witnesses who testified before him\u2014the plaintiff, Mr. Speer and Coleman\u2014should not have been disturbed.

C. By s. 501 (f) of the Criminal Code everyone is guilty of an offence who \"wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain * * * besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be.\"\nThe conviction of defendant thereunder for conduct in the \"picketing\" of coal mining premises in the course of a strike by certain mine workers, which conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (Clarke J.A. dissenting), was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, which held that there was evidence at the trial that the besetting and watching in which defendant was engaged was \"wrongful and without lawful authority\" within the meaning of the section.\nDefendant's acts were wrongful and unlawful if the besetting and watching in which he, in common with his comrades or associates, was engaged, amounted to a nuisance or a trespass, or if the men who were besetting and watching constituted an unlawful assembly, and the conduct in question (discussed in the judgments) afforded evidence of each of these particulars.\nWhile apparently the hill occupied by the party to which the defendant belonged was somewhat outside the mining property, the hills surrounding the mine in other directions belonged to the mine owners and the groups stationed there were trespassers, and since the picketing was carried on in pursuance of a common design or project to which all the strikers including defendant were parties, he must be held responsible for the trespasses equally with those who actually occupied the mine owners' property.\nPer Idington J.: The section clearly forbids anyone from besetting another's house or place of business with a view to compel him to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do. Such an act, which at common law might be the basis of a civil action, was always at common law wrongful, and is in itself \"wrongful and without lawful authority\" within the meaning of the section unless some lawful authority (e.g., as often there might be with a sheriff, etc.) exists. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming (Clarke J. A. dissenting) the conviction of defendant under s. 501 (f) of the Criminal Code on a charge of wrongfully and without lawful authority besetting and watching the mine of a certain coal mining company with a view to compel the company to abstain from engaging or employing or continuing in its employment miners and employees other than those belonging to a certain trade union to which the defendant belonged. The charge is set out in full in the judgment of Idington J.\nC. C. Robinson, K.C. and H. A. F. Boyde for the appellant.\nW. S. Gray and J. J. Frawley for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The appellant, with five others, was charged in two counts, under section 501 (f) of the Criminal Code, with the offence of wrongfully and without lawful authority besetting and watching the mine of the Alberta Block Coal Company, Limited, where the company carried on its business, with a view to compel the company to abstain from engaging or employing, or continuing in its employ, miners or employees other than those belonging to a trade union, known as the Red Deer Valley Miners' Union, to which the accused belonged. It will be convenient to set out the material part of the section, which is as follows:\u2014\nS. 501 (f): Every one is guilty of an offence punishable, at the option of the accused, on indictment or on summary conviction before two justices, and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or to three months' imprisonment with or without hard labour, who, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain\n****\n(f) besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be. The case has been tried twice. At the first trial there was a jury, and all the accused were convicted, but upon appeal the conviction was set aside upon purely legal grounds, as we are informed, and, at the new trial, the accused, other than the appellant, pleaded guilty, and the latter, electing to be tried without a jury, was tried before McCarthy J., and again convicted. From this conviction he appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, where the appeal was heard and the conviction upheld by the judgment of the court, pronounced by the Chief Justice. Clarke J. however dissented, the court considering it convenient that his judgment should be pronounced separately, and it is the question of law involved in his dissent that is now presented upon the appeal to this court.\nThe Alberta Block Coal Company of Drumheller, in the Province of Alberta, belonged to an association of coal operators which negotiated an agreement with the executive of the United Mine Workers of America regulating working conditions, including the rate of wages to be paid to the miners. This agreement went into operation, but was subsequently amended by the parties in a manner to effect a reduction of 15% in the rates stipulated. The reduced rates were not acceptable to the majority of the Company's employees, and became the cause or occasion for a strike. The striking miners belonged to the Union of the United Mine Workers of America; they were dissatisfied with the reduction of the rates to which the executive of their union had agreed, and in consequence they decided to withdraw from it, and to set up a new union, which is known in the case as the Red Deer Valley Miners Union. Some of the company's employees however did not join in the agitation, but continued to work for the company as formerly, and the strikers established what they call pickets at the mine with a view, as they say, peacefully to persuade the miners who adhered to the company's service to cease work.\nThe locality of the mine is not as clearly described by the transcript of the evidence produced as might be desired, but there is in proof a plan of a limited area, and some of the witnesses give descriptions from which it would appear that the mine is situated in a narrow valley or coulee bordered by hills of considerable height, about 100 ft. to 150 ft. above the level. The shaft is sunk on the property of the company, and in the neighbourhood is a power house, machine shop, wash house, offices, some dwelling houses and outbuildings, and, a few hundred feet distant, a store house and powder house. These buildings are all upon the property of the company, which is approached from the north by a waggon road, and by a railway spur or siding from the line of the Canadian National Railways. The disturbances began on 23rd June, 1925, and the offence is charged to have been committed between the 22nd and 27th days of June. The evidence is however directed particularly to the occurrences on the night of the 25th and the early morning of the 26th. On the 23rd a large delegation of the strikers went to the mine and there was some discussion. McDonald, who was one of them, says that they found men there wearing their working clothes and carrying their lunch buckets and he talked with several of these men about quitting work, but that they were not prepared to quit and went down to the mine. The following information is elicited from him:\nA. I spoke to about ten or eleven, they were in line. Thomson and Fernet, I think I remember them all right, I don't remember the others.\nQ. These men apparently were not on the 23rd prepared to quit work and join your union, is that right?\nA. On the 23rd, they went down to the mine on the 23rd.\nQ. They listened to your representations and then they decided to work, is not that the situation, or rather continue work?\nA. Oh yes, they did, because, naturally enough, their boss, Jesse Gouge, who was standing there over them, and he tried to drive me away and I insisted I wanted to speak to the men and talk to them.\nQ. You had the opportunity to speak to them?\nA. Yes, I spoke to them.\nThe pickets were divided into groups and took their positions at places convenient for their purpose about the mine, from whence they continued to watch and beset the premises for several days. At night they occupied the hills surrounding the mine and overlooking the avenues of approach. Here they lighted wood fires which were kept burning throughout the night, and about which the men gathered, and where they were relieved at intervals. Inspector Nicholson of the provincial police, who was stationed at Drumheller, says:\nQ. You have told us that these men had a smudge or fire there?\nA. Yes. Q. And that there were other smudges or fires on neighbouring hills around?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Were these hills around the A.B.C. Mine?\nA. They practically surrounded it, yes.\nHe says, moreover, that:\nA. These men were on the different hills in bunches of individuals and each bunch or crowd on each hill had a fire, a little bonfire or smudge. One of these hills was immediately behind the buildings at the A.B.C. premises, that would be immediately north. On account of a complaint received earlier on the 25th and on account of noises which I had heard in the vicinity of a powder house belonging to the A.B.C. Mine on the night of the 25th, I decided to remove the men on this particular hill that I speak of.\nAsked whether there was any means of communication between the various parties on the hills, the witness answers that\nthey continued to shout to one another from one hill to another. One party would shout to one hill and it would be answered, and the call would go practically round all of the crowd.\nInspector Nicholson sent three of his constables at about, or shortly after, midnight of the 25th, to occupy separate positions along the roadway at the foot of the hill immediately to the north. When these constables, or two of them, were perceived by the men on the top, they were greeted with insult, curses and threats. They made no response, but remained in their respective positions, and immediately afterwards five of those on the top were taken into custody by Inspector Nicholson and other constables who had approached under cover of the darkness from the rear. The appellant however ran down the hill where he stoned one of the constables stationed below, who pursued him calling upon him to stand, and was arrested after he had been wounded by a shot from the constable. During the night previous to the coming of the police, there had been ten or fifteen men upon this particular hill, but apparently the six men charged were the only ones there at the time of the arrest.\nThe trial judge, in convicting the appellant, delivered a somewhat lengthy judgment. He referred to the cases of Reg. v. Hibbert[2], and Reg. v. Bauld[3]. He said that in his view the conduct of the accused and the men with whom he was associated went far beyond the conduct of the men concerned in these cases, and that\nI cannot look on his conduct as peaceful picketing, having regard to all the surrounding circumstances and certainly the conduct was such as to operate in the mind of the men who were going to work and to operate on the mind of the operators as to whether or not to carry on the work in the mine.\nThe learned Chief Justice, pronouncing the judgment of the Appellate Division, relied upon J. Lyons & Sons v. Wilkins[4], and the same case, as reported upon appeal after the trial[5], and he considered the case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative Printers' Assistants' Society[6], which, it had been argued, was not in complete accord with the Lyons Case. In conclusion, however, he said that\na picketing effected in the way this was\u2014to constitute a menace and practical compulsion by moral force, even if no physical force were contemplated, as to which one might have doubts, would not be such a picketing as would be warranted and, therefore, would be wrongful.\nHe quoted the finding of the learned trial judge and he said\nwith this finding, which in my opinion, is quite justified, the case does not seem to fall within the qualifications suggested in the Ward, Lock Case (3).\nClarke J., the dissenting judge, agreed\nthat the defendant should be held responsible as one of the watching and besetting party, engaged in what is commonly called picketing, and that he, with the others charged, did, with a view to compel another person to abstain from doing something which he had a lawful right to do, or to do something from which he had a lawful right to abstain, beset or watch the place where such other person works or carries on business within the meaning of s. 501 (f).\nBut he found difficulty in saying that such picketing was wrongful or without lawful authority; or, as he puts it, \"in other words that peaceful picketing is wrongful\". He reviewed the evidence, as to which he appears to take a view more favourable to the appellant than that which seems to be held by the majority of the court. He said that the Ward, Lock Case (3) as applied in the later case of Fowler v. Kibble[7], seems to cast considerable doubt upon the correctness of the decision in the Lyons Case (2) and therefore he concluded, adopting what he takes to be the result of the Ward, Lock Case (3), that the element of wrongfulness is lacking in the present case, and he would therefore allow the appeal. In view of the nature of the dissent and seeing that the jurisdiction of this court in criminal appeals is limited to questions of law, which are the subject of difference below, the point which this court has now to determine is in reality whether there was evidence at the trial that the watching and besetting in which the appellant was engaged was wrongful and without lawful authority. Upon this point I entertain no doubt.\nIn the Lyons Case [8] the Court of Appeal upon both occasions considered the interpretation of s. 7, subs. 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, c. 86 of 1875, which corresponds, with unimportant variations, with s. 501 (f) of the Criminal Code, upon which the present charge is laid. It is explained by the concluding clause of s. 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act that\nattending at or near the house or place where a person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place, in order merely to obtain or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.\nBut this clause is not embodied in the Criminal Code, and for that reason, as well as because of the facts in proof, it has no application to the case now under review.\nThe Master of the Rolls (Lord Justice Lindley) considered that to watch and beset in order to compel caused a nuisance, and he found upon the evidence that there was a nuisance. But in the Ward, Lock Case [9] Moulton L.J. was of the opinion that there might be a sort of compulsion which would not be wrongful or illegal and therefore that the conclusion of the Master of the Rolls was too broad; he did not however deny its application to the particular case which the Master of the Rolls had in hand, and these great judges were in perfect agreement that it was necessary to establish, in one way or another, that the watching and besetting was done wrongfully and without legal authority.\nIn the Ward Lock Case (2) the defendant had stationed pickets to watch the plaintiffs' printing works for the purpose of inducing the workmen employed by the plaintiffs to join the union, and then to determine their employment by proper notices, the object being thereby to compel the plaintiffs to become employers of union men, and to ab- stain from employing non-union men; the report states that this was carried out without causing, by violence, obstruction or otherwise, a common law nuisance. Moulton L.J. said, as reported:\u2014\nIn my view that which decides the question is that there is no evidence of any improper or illegal acts, or, indeed, of any acts whatever, by any of the pickets sent by the defendants * * *. I wish to add that, in my opinion, there is throughout a complete absence of evidence of anything in the nature of picketing or besetting which could constitute a nuisance. It appears that the discharged workmen loitered about for a day or two after leaving work, a thing which is not unlikely to happen, and that they were at times joined by others, but there is no suggestion even by the plaintiffs' witnesses that any annoyance or molestation took place, and the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.\nHe referred to the fact that, at the request of the plaintiffs, the police had placed special patrols outside their premises during the period of the dispute, but that none of the police had been called as witnesses by the plaintiffs, and that the inspector and a sergeant, called by the defendants, had shown that there was nothing which could give any ground for complaint. This decision is referred to and followed as an important one in Fowler v. Kibble[10], but, for the purposes of the present case it decides no more than I think was decided by the Master of the Rolls in the Lyons Case[11]. The judgments concur in the view that watching or besetting, if carried on in a manner to create a nuisance, is at common law wrongful and without legal authority. In the Lyons Case (2) the Court of Appeal found the essential facts to constitute a common law nuisance. In the Ward Lock Case [12] they found that the sort of picketing there in proof afforded no evidence of a nuisance, and these cases do not really assist in the determination of the present question, which depends upon its own facts, except in so far as they affirm, what is evident by the statute itself, that if picketing foe carried on in a manner to create a nuisance, or otherwise unlawfully, it constitutes an offence within the meaning of the statute.\nComing now again to the facts in the present case, the acts with which the appellant is charged were wrongful and unlawful if the watching and besetting in which he, in common with his comrades or associates, was engaged amounted to a nuisance or to a trespass, or if the men who were watching and besetting constituted an unlawful assembly, and there is evidence as to each of these particulars which ought not to be overlooked.\nThere was a large number of men engaged; a crowd was assembled at the Atlas crossing to the north of the company's works; pickets in considerable numbers were stationed at every avenue of approach; they remained in position with reliefs uninterruptedly by night as well as by day; they lighted fires on hilltops surrounding the mine, shouting back and forth from one group to another. On one occasion at the very entrance to the mine one of these men, according to his own testimony, insisted upon his endeavour to persuade workmen, who were there in their working clothes and with their lunch baskets, from going into the mine, notwithstanding that their foreman was present and tried to drive him away.\nTo the southeast of the shaft and the power house at a distance of about 800 feet is the powder house, situated in a narrow spur or offshoot of the coulee to the southward of the railway. This building is at the base of one of the surrounding hills, and if, as Inspector Nicholson testifies, the hills on which the fires were lighted practically surrounded the mine, some of them must have been very near to the powder house. He tells us that crowds of men continued on these hills throughout the whole of the 25th from seven o'clock in the morning, and that it was because of a complaint and noises which he heard in the vicinity of the powder house that he decided to remove the men from the hilltops. He says he intended to remove \"all these different crowds of men,\" but to begin at the particular hill where he found the appellant. It will, of course, be realized that, as these hills were at considerable distances, the shouting from one hill to another must have been vociferous, and moreover the danger of open wood fires in the neighbourhood of the powder house and other buildings of the company was in itself a cause for apprehension.\nNow while apparently the hill which was occupied by the party to which the appellant belonged was somewhat to the northward of the northern limit of the company's property, the hills surrounding the mine in other directions belonged to the company and the groups stationed there were trespassers, and, since the picketing was so carried on in pursuance of a common design or project to which all the strikers including the appellant were parties, he must be held responsible for the trespasses equally with those who actually occupied the company's property.\nMoreover, while it is explained, with remarkable agreement on the part of the striking miners, that the purpose of their assembly at and about the mine was peacefully to endeavour to persuade the miners who continued to work to quit the service of the company and to join the new union, in order, as it is said, to maintain the standard of living, the character and purpose of this assembly is, I think, better evidenced by its acts and course of conduct than by the statements of its members as to what their intention was; and the numbers of men who assembled, their distribution about the premises, including the company's property, their attendance there by day and by night, the fires, the shouting, their reception of the police, their threats and conduct when the police approached, afford cogent evidence, not only of a nuisance, but also of an unlawful assembly, Hawkins Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed., Bk. 1, c. 28, ss. 4, 5 and 9; Reg. v. Vincent[13]; Reg. v. Neale[14].\nIt is not for this court to judge the evidence, except to determine whether there be any. The appellants case fails if evidence be found which the trial judge was bound to consider tending to shew that the watching and besetting, which is conclusively found to have taken place, was wrongful and without lawful authority, and I think there is such evidence in each of the aspects to which I have referred.\nIt was suggested also that the pickets were endeavouring to induce the company's workmen to break their contracts of service, but the evidence does not, in my opinion, go far enough to justify a finding that there were such contracts.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta maintaining the conviction of the appellant who was tried before Mr. Justice McCarthy without a jury and found guilty of the following charges laid against him and five others, that is to say that they did at Newcastle in the Judicial District of Calgary between the 22nd and the 27th days of June, 1925, wrongfully and without lawful authority with a view to compelling another person, The Alberta Block Coal Company Limited, a body corporate, to abstain in the carrying on of its business from engaging or employing or continuing in its employment miners and employees other than those belonging to the Red Deer Valley Miners Union, or to such union as the defendants themselves belonged. The Alberta Block Coal Company Limited then having a lawful right to engage or employ or continue in its employment miners or employees without restriction as to their membership in the union or unions aforesaid, or to compel the said company to engage and employ and continue in its employment only such miners and employees as belonged to said union, which members the said company had a lawful right to abstain from employing, did beset and watch the place where the said company carries on business, to wit: the mining premises of the said company.\nAnd further stand charged that they at the same time and place wrongfully and without lawful authority with a view to compel Tom Fernet, William Hopkins, Joseph Thompson, Robert Brownell, and others, to abstain from doing what they had a lawful right to do, to wit: to work for the Alberta Block Coal Company Limited, did beset and watch the place where the said Tom Fernet, William Hopkins, Joseph Thompson, Robert Brownell and others worked, to wit: the premises of the Alberta Block Coal Company Limited's mine.\nThe accused parties had been tried before Mr. Justice Boyle with a jury and found guilty but for some reason or other a new trial was directed.\nThe others then pleaded guilty but the present appellant elected to be tried before Mr. Justice McCarthy without a jury.\nThe said charges were laid under section 501, subs. (f) of the Criminal Code.\nThe said section 501 reads as follows:\u2014\n501. Every one is guilty of an offence punishable, at the option of the accused, on indictment or on summary conviction before two justices and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or to three months imprisonment with or without hard labour, who, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain,\n(a) uses violence to such other person, or his wife or children, or injures his property; or\n(b) intimidates such other person, or his wife or children, by threats of using violence to him, her or any of them, or of injuring his property; or,\n(c) persistently follows such other person about from place to place; or,\n(d) hides any tools, clothes or other property owned or used by such other person, or deprives him of, or hinders him in, the use thereof; or,\n(e) with one or more other persons, follows such other person, in a disorderly manner, in or through any street or road; or, (f) besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be. 55-56 V, c. 29. s. 523; 4-5 Ed VII, c. 9,s. 3.\nThe essential parts thereof to be considered herein are the following lines:\u2014\nwho, wrongfully and without lawful authority, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything from which he has a lawful right to abstain, * * *\n(f) besets or watches the house or other place where such other person resides or works, or carries on business or happens to be.\nThis seems to me a clear and explicit expression in plain English forbidding anyone from besetting another's house or place of business with a view to compel him to abstain from doing anything which he has a lawful right to do.\nEach of the preceding subsections from (a) to (e) inclusive, implies violence or improper conduct towards another of some kind for which the party so doing might be punishable otherwise in law. But there is no such necessary implication in simply watching a house.\nThese men were, clearly as noon-day, doing what the subsection (f) forbids, unless in the case of one having lawful authority to beset or watch. For example, the sheriff or his officers often have lawful authority to go very far in discharging their duty\u2014even to the extent of besetting or watching a house. No pretence of authority is shewn here. None existed. Indeed the accused were in fact trespassers, I imagine, on the property of the coal company. And surely the company in question carrying on business in and on the premises in question, had a perfect right to refuse to employ men belonging to the Red Deer Valley Miners' Union.\nAnd can there be a shadow of doubt that the men taking part in the besetting and watching complained of were doing so with a view to compel said company to abstain from pursuing their business without the aid of workmen belonging to the said Red Deer Union.\nCompel is a word of various shades of meaning, for example, the Century Dictionary gives some five different shades, but let us select no. 1, which read's as follows:\u2014\n1. To drive or urge with force or irresistibly; constrain; oblige; coerce, by either physical or moral force: as, circumstances compel us to practise economy. Or, let us turn to Murray's New English Dictionary, and we find a different application of it and select no. 2 b, which reads as follows:\u2014\nb. To constrain (an action); to bring about by force, constraint or moral necessity; to exact by rightful claim; to demand.\nSurely either one or other of these expressions can be acted upon herein, and was intended to be acted upon and applied in cases such as herein presented if we leave aside all other features than the proof of besetting and watching.\nIt does not in either necessarily imply physical violence as the means of compulsion.\nEver since the effect of said section as it appeared in the R.S.C. 1886, was changed by dropping subs. 2 of s. 12 of c. 173, in which the words were as follows:\u2014\n2. Attending at or near or approaching to such house or other place as aforesaid, in order merely to obtain or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section.\nthe law has been simplified and I respectfully submit made clear.\nOn the other hand in the English Act from which in its original state our Act was first taken there was a provision very similar to the said section 2, almost identical, which continued part of the English Act and hence renders English cases turning thereon (save and except Lyons v. Wilkins[15], I am about to refer to) of very little service to any Canadian case since our Criminal Code of 1892 was framed and, as already stated, the above quoted section dropped out.\nIn 1906 the English Trades Disputes Act was passed and distinctly enacted as follows, in the second section thereof:\u2014\nIt shall be lawful for one or more persons, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.\nOther provisions of the same Act tended still more to render it impossible to make any English case such as herein in question of any helpful service. I must also say that a criminal intent and object might well be suspected in much presented to us in the evidence but as I understand the ground of Mr. Justice Clarke's dissent, which is the ambit of our jurisdiction herein, it is quite unnecessary to enter into that feature of this case to which I have just referred.\nIn the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke, so far as dissenting, he makes clear what he means as follows:\u2014\nI think the real difficulty in this case consists in the interpretation of the words in s. 501 \"wrongfully and without lawful authority.\"\nI agree that the defendant should be held responsible as one of the watching and besetting party engaged in what is commonly called picketing and that he with the others charged did with a view to compel another person to abstain from doing something which he had a lawful right to do or to do something from which he had a lawful right to abstain, beset or watch the place where such other person works or carries on business within the meaning of s. 501 (f) but my difficulty is in saying that such picketing is wrongful and without lawful authority, or in other words that peaceful picketing is wrongful.\nIf it is not wrongful then, in my opinion, the conviction cannot be supported upon the evidence. There is no evidence that during the night when the conduct of the defendant is complained of there was any interference with either the mining company or its workmen, or any violence, intimidation or threats; Lewis McDonald was called as a Crown witness and the trial judge states the situation upon which he apparently bases his judgment as follows: \"Lewis McDonald in his evidence tells us that the so-called Canadian Union proposed to picket the A.B.C. Mine to tell the miners it was their duty to try to persuade the mine workers not to go to work so as to not reduce the standard of living. He testifies that during the time the accused and others were picketing the A.B.C. Mine he was on the picket during the 23rd and on the morning of the 24th of June, 1925. The purpose of the picket was to interview the men employed in the A.B.C. Mine and persuade them not to go to work. He admitted interviewing some of them himself. Cecil Terris, in his evidence, says they were supposed to go down to the mine and if they met anybody going down to work to ask them to join the new union. * * * So that apparently the accused were there to persuade the miners not to go to work or to prevent the A.B.C. Company from employing men who did not belong to the new union and to prevent them from hiring men who belonged to the United Mine Workers of America.\"\nIf the picketing itself, that is, the watching or besetting was not unlawful I cannot see that the fact of the picketers being distributed in different places and having bonfires on a dark night can make the watching wrongful. In Rex ex rel Barron v. Blachsawl; Rex ex rel Barron v. Hangsjaa[16], where the conviction of the appellant on a similar charge was affirmed by this court, Lyons & Sons v. Wilkins[17], was strongly relied upon. I understand the court there held that watching and besetting, however peaceable, was a common law nuisance and, therefore, wrongful and that the qualifying words in s. 7 as to obtaining and communicating information alone rendered it rightful. If that decision stood unchallenged I would not hesitate to say it was conclusive of the present appeal in favour of the Crown not only by reason of the absence of the qualifying words in our section 501 but because if they were still in the Act they do not extend to persuading which was part of the plan here.\nThe later case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative Printers' Assistants' Society, February, 1906[18], applied in Fowler v. Kibble[19], seems to me to cast considerable doubt on the correctness of the decision in Lyons v. Wilkins (2). It was not referred to in the Blachsawl Case (1), and it is said that it was not brought to the attention of the court which I think is correct. I gather from that case that peaceable picketing was not considered to be wrongful at common law and was not made illegal by section 7 of the Imperial Act and if that be correct it can scarcely be wrongful under our s. 501. But for the fact that owing to the general importance of the question the defendant is desirous of obtaining the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, I would say that the question is determined by our former decision but considering it a proper case for an appeal I have decided to dissent from the judgment of the majority and adopting what I take to be the result of the Ward, Lock Case (3) would hold that the element of wrongfulness is lacking in this case and would, therefore, allow the appeal and quash the conviction.\nThe foregoing quotation from his judgment shows that all involved in this appeal, by reason of the dissent of Mr. Justice Clarke, is the doubt he has as to the meaning of the words \"wrongfully and without lawful authority\" in the part of section 501 which I have quoted above.\nHe suggests, as had been suggested long ago by others, that \"besetting and watching\" a house or premises is not in law wrongful, and hence the basis of the said subsection (f) renders it absolutely inoperative.\nThe answer to such an objection is that we must, if possible, give it some efficacy, and to do that we must ask ourselves if it is correct that the act of so besetting and watching never was, in law, wrongful.\nI answer that such a course of conduct always was at common law wrongful, and might be the basis of a civil action, and hence clearly wrongful. Such was the holding of the court in the case of J. Lyons & Sons v. Wilkins[20], and the judgment of Lord Justice Lindley, M.R., at pages 266 and 267, deals with exactly what has troubled Mr. Justice Clarke herein and, I submit, the passage therefrom on page 267, which reads as follows:\u2014\nBut it is not necessary to shew the illegality of the overt acts complained of by other evidence than that which proves the acts themselves, if no justification or excuse for them is reasonably consistent with the facts proved. This is the principle always applied in criminal prosecutions in which the words \"feloniously,\" \"wrongfully,\" or \"maliciously\" are introduced into the charge, and have to be proved before the person accused can be properly convicted: see Archbold's Criminal Pleadings and Evidence, 19th ed. pp. 64-7. That this is the correct method of construing and dealing with the words \"wrongfully and without lawful authority\" in s. 7 is, in my opinion, perfectly plain if attention is paid to sub-heads 1, 2, 3, and 5, to which those words are as applicable as they are to sub-head 4. If the overt acts mentioned in sub-head 1, for example, i.e., using violence or intimidation, are proved, and it is proved that they were done with a view to compel, etc., and there is no reasonable ground for justifying them, it is unnecessary to give further evidence to prove that they were committed \"wrongfully and without legal authority\"; see Reg. v. McKenzie[21]. If this be true of all the subheads except 4 (watching and besetting), I can discover no justification for giving the words \"wrongfully and without lawful authority\" any different meaning or effect when applied to 4\u2014namely, \"watching or besetting.\"\nOthers in like manner in same case and in a further appeal refer to this and express analogous opinions, and such was taken to-be the law until the case of Ward, Lock & Co. v. The Operative Printers' Assistants' Society et al[22], in 1906, 26th February. Even in that Stirling J. expresses himself as if the court were in accord with what Lord Justice Lindley had said in the Lyons Case (1). It was the provision of exception that created the difficulty.\nBy our Canadian courts, cases were decided in Manitoba and Alberta adopting the law as settled by Lyons v. Wilkins (1) and other cases.\nThis I accept as good law yet, and more especially so when the subsequent paragraph above referred to had been eliminated in framing our Criminal Code in 1892.\nIt became increasingly more difficult to do so in England by reason of the Trades Disputes Act, to which I refer above. Indeed that rendered it almost quite impos- sible for us to follow the later English decisions. I imagine said Act was a result of the Ward, Lock Case (1).\nI need not elaborate further but submit the foregoing considerations remove all doubts such as in question, and therefore am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI may add, however, that having read the entire case I find there is evidence of actual violence, trespass and abusive and vile language, even in the presence of policemen keeping guard, which removes all doubt in law and in fact of the guilt of the appellant, who ran away on hearing someone approach. Why, if innocent, do so?\nI have out of respect to the learned judge below, dissenting, tried to confine the expression of my opinion above to the point in which he expresses doubt, but, if others think we should go beyond, I think it as well to state concisely my conclusions if needed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 22 Alta.

The subjects of the taxation were gas mains or pipes located in the public streets, a system of electric poles and wires, almost entirely upon the public streets and meters placed in the houses of the consumers in the municipality. In the valuation roll for the years 1920-21 and 1921-22 all the electric property of the appellant company, including the meters, which were of substantial value, was embraced in a single gross valuation and was the subject of but one assessment. In the exercise of their powers of taxation, instead of using the term \u201cimmovable\u201d as found in art. 5730, R.S.Q. 1909, the municipal corporation substituted in its by-laws the term \u201ctaxable real estate\u201d and the Board of School Commissioners in its resolutions the term \u201ctaxable real property.\u201d\nHeld that the pipes, poles, wires and transformers are immovables within the meaning of that term as used in art. 5730 of the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q., 1909, and are subject to taxation as such. B\u00e9lair v. Ste. Rose (63 Can. S.C.R. 526) foll.\nHeld, also, that the meters, being movables within art. 384 C.C., do not lose that character by reason of the mode or purpose of their being placed by the company upon immovables not belonging to it, to which they are, when in use, temporarily affixed; and they are not therefore taxable immovables. Idington J. dissenting.\nHeld, also, that the assessments of the electric system for the years 1920-21 and 1921-22 must be invalidated in toto as being, to an extent not apportionable, made upon movables, i.e., electric meters; and no part of the taxes sued in respect of them are recoverable. Idington J. dissenting.\nHeld, also, that, although the words \u201cimmovable\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d are not in practice interchangeable, the terms \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d should be taken, for the purposes of the taxation by-laws and resolutions, to include property which is held to be \u201cimmovable\u201d by nature as the pipes, poles, wires and transformers.\nHeld, further, that a defence to a claim for taxes that the taxed property is non-assessable, if otherwise maintainable, is not precluded by the failure of the assessed party to invoke any special machinery afforded for appeals from assessments or any summary proceedings available to have valuation rolls annulled for irregularity. Donohue v. St. Etienne de la Malbaie ([1924] S.C.R. 511) foil. Idington J. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 38, K.B. 406) rev. in part, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing in part the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining in part the respondent\u2019s action for taxes.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Lafleur K.C. and Montgomery K.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. and Weldon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014This action is brought to recover municipal taxes amounting to $8,626.86 and school taxes amounting to $4,831.05 for the years 1920-21, 1921-22, 1922-23 claimed, with interest, by the city of Westmount from the appellant company. For the school taxes the city sues as assignee of the Board of School Commissioners. The subjects of the taxation, of which complaint is made, are gas mains, located in the public streets, a system of electric poles, wires and transformers, almost entirely upon the public streets, and meters placed in the houses of the consumers in the municipality. The appellant company owns neither land in the municipality nor other property than that so described and whatever interest it may have in the land occupied by its poles, pipes, wires and transformers by reason of the exercise of its statutory right to such occupation. (Compare Gas Consumers Co. v. City of Toronto[2], and Ahearn & Soper v. New York Trust Co.[3], per Duff J.\nThe preliminary question has arisen in the consideration of this appeal whether it sufficiently appears that the electric and gas meters of the appellant are included in the assessments in question. The total assessment in respect of the electric system is, for each of the three years, identical in amount, viz., $85,000. For the first two years electric meters are expressly included as subjects of assessment and for the third year, while these meters do not appear in the roll nominatim, the continuance of the same total in the valuation is said to indicate that it covers the same items as in the two previous years. In the case of the gas system the assessment for each of the three years is likewise the same, viz., $130,000, and the items are given as \u201cgas mains and equipment,\u201d in the first two years and as \u201cpipes, lines, etc.,\u201d for the third year. The parol evidence as to the inclusion of both gas and electric meters for each of the three years as items of the property assessed is not as full and definite as might have been expected had this matter been regarded as of serious moment at the trial. Such allusions as we find in the testimony rather point to these meters having been treated as part of the properties assessed. Their inclusion is specifically averred in the defendant\u2019s plea; but the plaintiff in its answer denies this with other allegations. The learned trial judge says nothing which would lead one to suppose that he intended to pass upon the question of the inclusion of the gas and electric meters in the property assessed in any of the three years. While he makes no specific allusion to meters he may have intended to deal with them in the comprehensive phrase: \u201cautres appareils destin\u00e9s \u00e0 la distribution.\u201d In the Court of King\u2019s Bench, however, from the judgment of Mr. Justice Tellier, which was concurred in by Allard, Howard and Letourneau, JJ.A., it would seem probable that the meters, both gas and electric, were there regarded as items included in the several assessments. That learned judge said:\u2014\nLes biens dont il s\u2019agit * * * comprennent * * * les compteurs \u00e9lectriques qui tiennent aux fils et qui enregistrent la somme de courant consomm\u00e9e * * * et les compteurs auxquelles les tuyaux de gaz aboutissent.\nWe are, however, of the opinion that in regard to the construction of such public documents as assessment and valuation rolls it is eminently fitting that the rule embodied in the maxim ut res magis valent quam pereat should be applied. The assessments of the gas system are obviously open to the construction that the \u201cequipment\u201d included in each of the assessments for the first two years was equipment appertaining to the \u201cgas mains,\u201d such as valves and connections, and that the \u201cet cetera\u201d of the assessment for the third year included only things eiusdem generis with or appurtenant to \u201cpipes and lines.\u201d The assessment of the electric system for the third year is in terms restricted to \u201cpoles, transformers and wires\u201d and this change may well have been made in order to exclude the meters which had been expressly included in the two earlier assessments. The mere similarity in the amount of each of the three assessments of the electric system is scarcely sufficient to justify the court in treating as still included in the third year an item that had apparently been designedly dropped, especially if to do so would invalidate the entire assessment.\nFor these reasons we think the assessments for the three years of the gas system and the assessment for the third year of the electric system must be treated as not including meters in any of them. But the inclusion of electric meters in the assessments for the years 1920-21 and 1921-22 being explicit does not admit of any controversy.\nThe appellant maintains that the property in respect of which the right of taxation is asserted was non-assessable. This defence to the claim for taxes, if otherwise maintainable, is not precluded by the failure of the appellant to invoke the special machinery afforded for appeals from assessments or any summary proceedings available to have valuation rolls annulled for irregularity. Donohue Bros. v. St. Etienne de la Malbaie[4].\nTo the valid imposition of a municipal or school tax there are always two requisites\u2014statutory power to impose the tax and the due exercise of such power by the municipality or school corporation, as the case may be. Both the existence of the power and its efficient exercise must be clearly established, the taxpayer being entitled to the construction most beneficial, to him in the case of reasonable doubt. Partington v. Attorney-General[5]. The appellant maintains that both requisites are lacking in regard to the taxes sued for.\nSection 2 of the charter of the city of Westmount, 3 Edw. VII, c. 89, reads as follows:\u2014\nThe city of Westmount shall be subject to the provisions of the Cities and Towns\u2019 Act, 1903, except in so far as is inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\nThe Cities and Towns\u2019 Act of 1903 (3 Edw. VII, c. 38) was embodied in the R.S.Q., 1909, as arts. 5256-5884 and was subsequently re-enacted as c. 65 of the statutes of 1922 (2nd session) 13 Geo. V. Section 474 of the Act of 1903 (art. 5730 of the R.S.Q., 1909; s. 510 of the Act of 1922) reads as follows:\nThe council may impose and levy, annually, on every immovable in the municipality a tax not exceeding two per cent of the real value as shewn in the valuation roll. Nothing in the city charter excludes or qualifies the application of this provision.\nBy art. 2731 of the R.S.Q., 1909, Boards of School Commissioners are empowered to impose assessments \u201cupon all taxable property in the municipality.\u201d Taxable property, is, by art. 2521 (16) declared to mean \u201cthe real estate liable for school taxes,\u201d and by art. 2521 (15), as amended by 4 Geo. V, c. 22, s. 1 (1914), real estate is defined as\nincluding everything that is immovable by virtue of the municipal laws governing the territory of school municipalities.\nThe sole question with regard to the statutory power to impose the taxes sued for\u2014municipal and school alike\u2014is whether the subjects of taxation in this instance are immovables within the meaning of that term as used in art. 5730 of the R.S.Q., 1909. That question formed the principal matter of discussion at bar; but, while not free from difficulty, it would seem to be concluded adversely to the appellant by the decision of this court in B\u00e9lair v. Ste. Rose[6], as to the gas mains and electric poles and wires, which, for the reasons there stated, must be regarded as \u201cbuildings (b\u00e2timents)\u201d within the meaning of art. 376 C.C. and, therefore, \u201cimmovable by their nature.\u201d In that case three things were distinctly held: (a) that the scope of the word \u201cimmovable\u201d in art. 5730 (R.S.Q., 1909) is to be ascertained by reference to the provisions of the Civil Code, arts. 376 et seq: (b) that the word \u201cbuildings\u201d (b\u00e2timents) in art. 376 C.C. is used in the sense of \u201cconstructions\u201d; (c) that it is immaterial to its taxability under art. 5730 that a construction is erected on land which does not belong to the person who owns the construction. There is no distinction in principle which would justify the taxation of the bridge in that case under art. 5730 as an immovable and warrant the exemption of the appellant\u2019s gas mains, and electric poles and wires in the present case as movables. The materials of which the structures\u2014bridge and distribution systems alike\u2014were comprised were all movables before being placed in situ and made part of such structures. Once incorporated in the structures, however, the materials lost that character; and the structures themselves took on the character of immovables.\nNor does it appear to matter for the present purpose whether the immobilization of the pipes, poles and wires be attributed to their physical connection with the land in or upon which they are placed, or with the buildings from which they radiate as parts of a distribution system. In either view they are immovables actually (in the sense of physically) situated in the municipality and thus \u201ccome within the letter of the law\u201d which confers the power to tax. Partington\u2019s Case[7]. The immobilization of the transformers may not be so clear. But they are usually attached to the company\u2019s poles and form an integral part of the system quite as much as the wires strung on the poles to carry the current.\nFor these reasons, as well as those stated by Mr. Justice De Lorimier and Mr. Justice Tellier, and upon the authorities cited by those learned judges, the pipes, poles, wires and transformers must be regarded as taxable immovables. Particular reference may be made to art. 445 of the charter of the city of Westmount, 8 Edw. VII, c. 89, s. 39.\nTo the electric meters, however, different considerations apply. In se these appliances or pieces of mechanism, are movables within art. 384, C.C., and they would not appear to lose that character by reason of the mode or purpose of their being placed by the company upon immovables not belonging to it, to which they are, when in use, temporarily affixed. Moreover, the wires to which the meters are attached belong not to the company but to the householders.\nThe meters are put in the premises of consumers for temporary purposes and are so fastened if at all, that they can be replaced without difficulty. They are frequently changed, either because they must be tested and re-certified from time to time, or because of breaks in the tenancy of the property in which they are used. They are not \u201cattached for a permanency.\u201d Their removal involves no breakage, destruction or deterioration of the interior wires to which they are attached, or of the walls against which they are placed. (Art. 380 C.C.). They would, therefore, seem to fall within the category of movables and not to be taxable as immovables within art. 5730 of the R.S.Q., 1909. Liquidation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Papeterie c. Delor[8], cited by the appellants is closely in point; see vol. 4, Hue, p. 24.\nHad the valuation of the poles, wires and transformers been made separately from that of the meters the assessments of the electric system for the years 1920-21 and 1921-22 could have been maintained as to all except the last mentioned. Donohue v. St. Etienne de la Malbaie[9]. But, in each of these two years, all the electric property of the appellant is embraced in a single gross valuation and is the subject of but one assessment. That the electric meters are of substantial value and form a not unimportant item in each of the total assessments of $85,000 seems clear. It is not within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to apportion the amount of these assessments between the taxable and non-taxable property included in them. Being, to an extent not indicated, made upon movables, the entire assessments of the electric system for the two earlier years are thereby invalidated and no part of the taxes sued for in respect of them is recoverable.\nThe exercise in the present case of the powers of taxation, conferred as above indicated, is evidenced by three municipal by-laws and three resolutions of the Board of School Commissioners. Each of the three by-laws provides for the imposition and levy of taxes \u201con the taxable real estate situate within the limits of the city;\u201d each of the resolutions provides for imposing a tax on \u201call taxable real property liable therefor in the school municipality of the city of Westmount.\u201d\nTo employ the very term by which the property made taxable is designated in the Act which confers the power to tax was obviously the certain method of subjecting to the taxation everything which the municipal corporation and the Board of School Commissioners are given the right to tax. That certain and safe method has been departed from by both governing bodies. For \u201cevery immovable,\u201d the term found in art. 5730 (R.S.Q., 1909), the municipal corporation has substituted \u201cthe taxable real estate,\u201d and the school commissioners \u201call taxable real property.\u201d We are thus confronted with two questions: Is everything comprised in the terms \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d an \u201cimmovable\u201d within the purview of art. 5730? And do these terms cover such immovables as the gas mains, poles, wires and transformers in question?\nNeither in the Cities and Towns\u2019 Act, in the General Interpretation Act (R.S.Q., 1909, art. 36), nor in the Civil Code is there any definition either of \u201creal estate\u201d or of \u201creal property.\u201d These terms must, therefore, be given their ordinary and natural meaning. While not technical terms known to the civil law, they are such in English law and their connotation is well established. The two terms are practically synonymous. (Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dict., 2nd ed., p. 1660). Without acceding to the view that the words \u201cimmovables,\u201d \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d are in practice interchangeable, we are satisfied that the term \u201cimmovables\u201d comprises everything which could be regarded as real estate for the purposes of the taxation by-laws and resolutions before us; and while it may not be so clear that such immovables as the pipes, poles, wires and transformers in question are real estate and real property, the weight of authority certainly favours that view.\nThe civil law divides all property into movable and immovable; English law divides all property into real and personal. While the real property of English law is not entirely co-extensive with the immovables of the civil law, speaking generally it may be so regarded for purposes such as those with which we are now concerned. Black-stone says:\nThings real are such as are permanent, fixed, and immovable, which cannot be carried out of their place, as lands and tenements; things personal are goods, money and all other movables which may attend the owner\u2019s person wherever he thinks proper to go. (2 Bl. Com., c. 2).\nReal estate comprises all hereditaments. That the pipes, poles, wires and transformers here in question would be hereditaments in English law seems clear. Metropolitan Ry. v. Fowler[10]. If used, as they probably are, in the sense attributed to them by English law, the terms \u201creal estate\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d of the by-laws and resolutions now before us comprise such property as the gas mains, poles, wires and transformers. In the case of the school commissioners\u2019 resolutions this scarcely admits of doubt, since \u201ctaxable property\u201d means \u201cthe real estate liable for school taxes\u201d (Art, 2521 (16) ) and \u201creal estate,\u201d the synonym of \u201creal property,\u201d is declared in the Public Instruction Law, to include everything that is immovable under the municipal law governing the territory. Art. 2521 (15) R.S.Q., 1909. But, without the aid of any such definition, \u201creal estate,\u201d having regard to its complement in the classification of property and things, viz., \u201cpersonal estate,\u201d must, in the absence of some clear indication of its being employed in a more restricted sense, be taken to include property which is held to be immovable by nature, as are the pipes, poles, wires and transformers under consideration.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed as to the taxes based on the assessments of the electric system for the years 1920-21 and 1921-22 and the appellant is entitled to its costs in this court and the Court of King\u2019s Bench. As to the taxes in respect of the assessments of the gas system for the three years and the assessment of the electric system for the year 1922-23, the judgment appealed from will be maintained; and the respondent will have the costs of the action.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, in an action to recover the taxes imposed for three years upon appellant\u2019s property in respondent city.\nI agree with the reasoning of Mr. Justice DeLorimier of the Superior Court who tried the case and gave judgment for the respondent, and that of Mr. Justice Tellier in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, with whom the other judges of that court agreed, with the exception of Mr. Justice Green-shields who dissented.\nI do not feel, when I so fully agree with their said reasoning, that I should merely repeat it herein, and I therefore hold that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I may, however, refer to some features of the case (which is certainly a most remarkable one) to which no attention was paid or at least pressed on the attention of the said courts, or either of them.\nThe assessment was made upon the plant of the appellant in said city, found to be immovable by said courts, and hence a proper basis upon which to rest the several assessments and the imposition of proper taxes thereon.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel started in this court by relying not only upon the grounds they had taken in the courts below, but also, for the first time, upon two further rather curious grounds; that parts of the erection of the appellant, which consisted of their electric plant, were \u201ctransformers\u201d and described as such in the assessment in question; and \u201cmetres\u201d for electric supplies and gas supplies respectively, also so described, and hence must be held movable, and therefore could not be assessed as immovables.\nAs to these transformers, they were firmly tied by wires and metal braces to the posts supporting the electric wires and were certainly part and parcel of the immovable part of the property, much more so than the posts were in the ground or the majority of frame houses resting on a wall are, and easily moved.\nBut occasions might arise, if they happened to be burnt out, for their being replaced.\nSo is any house so liable, and the Cities and Towns Act, which governs the whole question in this case involved, provides for the burning, in whole or in part, of buildings and relief being given, and, I submit, covers the cases of burning out.\nAgain it is said the transformers provided for changing the wire or pressure thereon and thus the increasing or the reduction of the power. I am surprised at such a contention in face of the facts that all our houses have windows so fitted as to move up or down to let in fresh air, or shut out cold air; and in this climate there are storm windows used in winter and moved in summer, and Venetian blinds used in summer and removed in winter; and all these things are of great value and form part of the value of the house so equipped and are assessed accordingly therewith, as part thereof, and still held to be immovable. Can we hope to escape our taxes on any such pretext? It seems to me a desperate suggestion that because of such like characteristics the whole assessment is to be declared null and void.\nI will not argue such a question but merely state it and hold that such a feature herein is of no consequence.\nTo rely on the absolutely literal reading of art. 384 C.C., and declare such to be the law applicable herein and thus exempt movable houses from taxation, would be something I cannot assent to, especially when that is immediately preceded by the elaborate definition of \u201cimmovables.\u201d\nI may add that there are manifold other illustrations conceivable as shewing the absurdity of such a pretension.\nThe metres are something a trifle more arguable for I can conceive of them being loosely hung on to any part of the main property, but that is evidently not the case with those in question or we would have heard of it. The pretext made as to them is that those used for the electric current have to be changed every six years. So have the shingles on our roofs, only not quite so frequently.\nI am, with due respect, very sceptical as to the alleged facts and as to the alleged value or cost of such changes.\nIt is a resealing or stamp on the instrument imposed by some Federal legislation that has to be met. These are so trifling in that regard that, forming as they do part of the appellant\u2019s plant even though situate on other people\u2019s ground (as, in the case of electric metres, they may be) I cannot hold such large assessments as in question are to be held as rendered null and void by reason of their being mentioned.\nThe gas metres, if I understand the evidence, are not necessarily in the houses of other people but may be outside where the owner\u2019s pipe meets that of the appellant; probably on the line of the street allowance. Did anyone ever hear of those alleged movables, so situated, being carried away? The witness is, after telling how the gas pipes meet outside, talking of gas metres as though they had been named under equipment, of which there is no evidence. But it is clear that they are not mentioned in the copies of the assessment rolls in evidence and as to the electric appliances also for the last year, yet they are all, even for that year, treated by the appellant as nullifying the whole assessment.\nThen it was pointed out to counsel that in the recent case Shannon Realties, Limited v. Ville de St. Michel[11], the Privy Council held that if the party assessed failed to appeal from the assessment, then unless in the case of fraud, no relief could be given. I cannot agree with the contention that in principle this case does not apply. That contention is not what I take from reading the judgment of their Lordships in the court above.\nIt was much more ultra vires to assess the land in question therein at its full value when the line was so clearly drawn in law at a fractional part thereof, than in this case where incidental to description of an immovable he mentions parts of it just as if an assessor of a house had happened to name the windows.\nIf a clear cut case of ultra vires were presented, I think something might be said for the contention set up in the case of The Toronto Railway Company v. Toronto[12], where the whole amount called in question was personal property for which assessment had been imposed, and no possibility of confusion existed. Personal property was as a whole assessable under the Ontario law, and named distinctly as such. I infer that was how they were enabled to identify the item there in dispute, as the report shews in above respect. There was no report of that case as dealt with in the court below in the Ontario reports. I am driven therefore to infer something not made clear.\nThis is not that case nor is the law, that is to be considered herein, the same as in question therein.\nAnd the Ontario law on which said Toronto case turns was amended to meet such emergency, as is shewn in R.S.O., 1914, c. 195.\nSection 498 of the Cities and Towns Act, 13 Geo. V, c. 65, s. 487, now s. 498, R.S.Q., 1925, vol. II, are identical and read as follows:\u2014 After all the complaints filed have been decided, the council shall declare the roll homologated; and the roll so homologated shall remain in force, until the coming into force of a new roll.\nI think that covers the case of the last assessment for the year 1922-1923 in question herein for said Act of 13 Geo. V, c. 65, came into force on 1st July, 1923. But if I am in error then the previous statutes to same effect will apply to it as well as to the previous ones.\nThe following articles 5706, 5707, 5708 and 5709 of the R.S.Q., 1909, are respectively applicable to the prior assessments in the two earlier years in question herein.\n5706. During such time, any person who, personally or as representing another person, deems himself aggrieved by the roll as drawn up, may appeal therefrom to the council, by giving for that purpose a written notice to the clerk stating the grounds for his complaint.\n5707. The council, at its first general session after the expiration of the thirty days mentioned in article 5705, shall take into consideration and decide all the complaints made under article 5706.\nAfter having heard the parties and their witnesses, under oath administered by its presiding officer, as also the assessors if they wish to be heard and the witnesses produced on behalf of the municipality, the council shall maintain or alter the roll, as it may think fit.\n5708. In all cases, the council shall proceed, at such session or at any adjournment thereof, to revise and homologate the roll, whether it be complained of or not. It may also correct the form of the language used.\n5709. At such session, or so soon thereafter as all the complaints filed have been decided, the council shall declare the roll homologated; and the roll so homologated shall remain in force, until the coming into force of a new roll.\nand the articles 4507, 4508, and 4509, from the supplement to said revision, are as follows:\u2014\n4507. The council at its first general session, after the expiration of the thirty days mentioned in article 4505, takes into consideration and decides all the complaints made under the preceding article.\nAfter having heard the parties and their witnesses, under oath, administered by its presiding officer, as also the valuators if they wish to be heard, the council maintains or alters the roll, as to it seems meet.\n4508. In all cases, it is the duty of the council to proceed at such session, to the revision and homologation of the roll, whether it be complained of or not.\nIt may also make any correction in the style of the drawing up thereof.\n4509. At such session, or so soon thereafter as all the complaints filed have been decided, the council declares the roll homologated; and the roll so homologated shall be in force, until the entry into force of a new roll.\nThe article 4546 of said 1909 revision deals with the collection of school rates. And then practically the law remained the same until the statute of 13 Geo. V, quoted above.\nThere was an appeal given by art, 5715 of said Revised Statutes of 1909 to the Circuit Court, and so continued until said 13 Geo. V, when continued by section 493 thereof, as follows:\u2014\n493. An appeal shall lie to the Circuit Court of the county or of the district, or to the District Magistrates Court:\n1. From any decision of the council under sections 485, 486, 488, 489 or 491, within thirty days from such decision, whether the council rendered same of its own accord or upon a complaint or petition filed in virtue of such sections;\n2. Whenever the council has neglected or refused to take cognizance of any written complaint made in virtue of section 484, or of a petition presented in virtue of sections 489 or 491, within thirty days after the sitting at which it should have taken cognizance thereof.\nSections 499, 500, 501 and 502 thereof are as follows:\u2014\n499. The court, may, by its judgment, confirm the decision appealed from, annul or amend the same, or render such decision as the council ought to have rendered, or order it to exercise the functions respecting which recourse is had.\n500. The decision may be set aside only when a substantial injustice has been committed, and never by reason of any trifling variance or informality.\n501. The court, in adjudicating upon the appeal, may condemn either party to costs; and, if the decision appealed from be modified, it may order its judgment to be served upon the municipality, and such judgment shall be final and executory. After the judgment upon the appeal, all original documents transmitted by the municipality in consequence of the appeal shall be returned to the latter.\n502. Every appellant who neglects to prosecute effectually the appeal, shall be deemed to have abandoned the same, and the court, on application by the respondent, may declare all the rights and claims founded on the said appeal forfeited, with costs in favour of the respondent, and order the transmission of the record to the municipality.\nSuch were the clear ways open to the appellant for relief against the said items of the transformers and metres in question, and it never appealed. Why? I cannot believe that it ever was thought by those acting for it that, if liable at all, they could hope for relief by anything rested solely on the said trifles.\nI can conceive that they felt encouraged as their predecessors had been by the judgment of Mr. Justice Green-shields in the belief that none of the properties in question could be held liable and the whole assessment be held void as ultra vires, just as many others had been in Ontario or Quebec, before the law was made clear by legislation, when the assessments had possibly in some such apparent like cases been held void.\nI can find no settled jurisprudence holding in such like cases as where only a fractional part or item of the subject matter assessed had been illegal on any ground, that therefore the whole assessment was void, and hence no need to resort to the mode of relief provided in such manifold ways as were open to appellant herein.\nThe case of Donohue Brothers v. St. Etienne de la Malbaie[13], decided by this court, is the first of the kind upheld. And that proceeded upon the assumption that the Toronto Railway Case[14] was of the same nature. I have shewn above that the ultimate decision therein was where one item of a very large assessment was singled out to test the matter, and that single item being wholly nonassessable, it was held appellant was not obliged to resort to applying for relief to courts of revision, etc.\nMany like cases had preceded this one as will appear from a perusal of the case of Nickle v. Douglas[15], where the item in dispute was wholly for property held thereby, to be owned in Montreal and not in Kingston, where appellant was assessed, and hence beyond the jurisdiction of the Kingston authorities to deal with.\nIn that and such like cases where nothing else was involved than the one or more items non-assessable, hence clearly ultra vires, those concerned in escaping taxes in respect thereof had no need to pursue any of the means of appeal such as were open to the appellant herein.\nThat Toronto Case14 was to my mind clearly not in point.\nThe Donohue Brothers Case13 did not pursue the same course as this appellant, but resorted to an action under article 50 C.C.P., and for that reason alone is clearly distinguishable from that involved herein.\nMoreover it was supported by a bare majority of this court and the respondent therein got leave from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to appeal there, and thus cast a doubt on the said decision, though that appeal was not argued but settled by the parties and, with their consent, dismissed.\nFor these and many other reasons I think it is clearly distinguishable and, therefore, not binding upon me. And I am not able to escape the onerous burden of labour cast upon me by reason of the facts which do not prove the case, and, in law, seem to have no substantial merits, if: any at all.\nI do not think it is necessary for me to trace out and demonstrate the correct interpretation of the legislation laying the foundation for the imposition of taxation in such like cases as this.\nI am sorry that the framer of the Acts involved did not consistently adhere throughout to the absolutely right expressions so as to avoid needless argument, but the meaning is on the whole clear.\nI may add that the school authorities no doubt had the right to the taxes it has assigned to respondent and sued for by it herein.\nI think the sections of the Acts above quoted make clear the respondent\u2019s right to recover the several sums respectively claimed, with interest from and after the respective due dates of each homologation of the assessments, which by the council and by virtue of the several Acts respectively relevant to each assessment had the effect of declaring said respective assessments valid.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Directors of a company guaranteed payment of its liabilities to a bank. The company went into bankruptcy and the bank, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act, proved its claim and valued its security consisting of an hypothecation of collateral notes. The bank was allowed to retain its security at the valuation placed upon it. The bank subsequently sued the guarantors for the balance unpaid of the company's debt.\nHeld, that s. 46 (6) of the Bankruptcy Act did not have the effect of vesting in the bank the complete ownership of the collateral notes and of reducing the company's debt for all purposes by the amount at which the notes were valued; and the guarantors were not relieved from liability on their guarantee to the extent of such assessed value.\nCanadian Bank of Commerce v. Martin ([1918] 1 W.W.R. 395), distinguished. Bank of Hamilton v. Atkins ([1924] 1 W.W.R. 92), overruled.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (21 Alta. L.R. 553) aff.\nAPPEAL by certain of the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which (Beck and Hyndman JJ.A. dissenting) dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Ives J. [2]in favour of the plaintiff.\nIn consideration of the plaintiff agreeing or continuing to deal with Progressive Farmers' Co., Ltd., in the way of its business as a bank, the defendants jointly and severally guaranteed (to a certain limit) payment to the plaintiff of the liabilities which the company had incurred or was under or might incur or be under to the plaintiff. The guarantee was dated September 9, 1920. The company made an assignment in bankruptcy in April, 1921, and on May 21, 1921, the plaintiff filed a claim showing an indebtedness by the company to the plaintiff of $3,857 as of the date of the assignment in bankruptcy. The plaintiff held as security an hypothecation, dated September 9, 1919, of collateral notes amounting, according to its proof of claim, to $4,408.55 and interest, and in its proof of claim it assessed the value of the notes at $2,290. It was allowed to retain its security at the said valuation. It subsequently sued the guarantors for the full unpaid amount of its claim, and recovered judgment therefor. The appeal was limited to the amount of $2,290, at which the plaintiff valued its security, the appellants contending that they were relieved from liability on their guarantee to the extent of such assessed value.\nN. D. McLean K.C. for the appellants.\nHon. R. B. Bennett K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014In consideration of the Royal Bank of Canada agreeing or continuing to deal with Progressive Farmers' Co., Limited, \"in the way of its business as a bank,\" the appellants jointly and severally guaranteed payment to the bank of the liabilities which the company had incurred or was under or may incur or be under to the bank. The guarantee was in writing and dated the 9th September, 1920.\nThe bank accordingly did business with the company and the latter became indebted to the bank in the sum of $3,866.10, for which a note was made by the company and remitted to the bank. The bank now seeks to recover from the guarantors the sum remaining overdue and unpaid in respect of such note. But, some time after having incurred this debt, the company went into bankruptcy. The bank, as required by sections 45 and 46 of the Bankruptcy Act, filed with the trustees a statutory declaration verifying its debt, stating that it held, as security therefor, an hypothecation of collateral notes amounting to $4,408.55 and assessing the value of those notes at $2,290. At a subsequent meeting of the inspectors of the bankrupt estate, the bank was allowed to retain its security at the valuation thus placed upon it.\nThe guarantors now contend that, by force of subsection (6) of section 46, of the Act, this had the effect of vesting in the bank the complete ownership of the collateral notes, and of reducing the company's debt for all purposes by the amount at which these notes were valued, and that they are accordingly relieved from liability on their guarantee to the extent of such assessed value.\nThis, in effect, would mean that the notes are to be treated no longer as security, but as if they had been collected by and paid to the bank for the total amount of their valuation and quite irrespective of what they may eventually realize.\nSuch is not, in our view, the purport of section 46 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Act deals with the relations between the bankrupt and his creditors. The particular subsection declares what will happen, as between the secured creditor and the bankrupt or his trustee, if the creditor retains his security at \"the value at which he assesses it.\" For purposes of dividend, the value so assessed must be deducted and \"the amount of the debt shall be reduced\" accordingly.\nAs was said by Lord Watson in Deering v. Bank of Ireland[3]:\u2014\nSo far as concerns the proceedings in bankruptcy, the security is dealt with as having been realized and paid to the creditor, and his debt to the extent of its valuation or actual proceeds is extinguished, the balance unpaid being then treated as unsecured, and therefore admitted to proof.\nBut this is only \"so far as concerns the proceedings in bankruptcy.\" These proceedings do not affect the agreement between the creditor and the sureties or guarantors. No mention, nor reference is made to the latter in section 46. The bank merely fulfilled the requirements of the Act in filing and proving its claim, and in assessing the value of the security it held. No mistake or fraud in the valuation is even suggested. There is not the slightest evidence of improper appraisal. The assessment is not the voluntary act of the bank, but was done in compliance with the statute. This is not a case where the creditor becomes party to a composition or a deed whereby the principal debtor is discharged and the position of the surety is altered. Such was the situation in Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Martin et al.[4], where, upon the voluntary winding-up of a company under the Companies' Act of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 39), a creditor, making his claim as such, valued his securities at a certain sum and accepted for that sum certain book debts of the company, the price thereof being deducted from the creditor's claim. This transaction was regarded as a purchase of the book debts and as being \"in substance a contract between the assignee and the plaintiff.\" There was no provision in the Companies' Act of British Columbia for valuing securities. The composition with the principal debtor was therefore unaffected by statute and it was there held that the portion of the company's debt represented by the price of the book debts was satisfied and that the sureties thereon were released.\nUnder section 46 of the Bankruptcy Act, however, the debt is, for the purpose of the Act, restricted to the unsecured portion of the creditor's claim not by the voluntary deed or agreement of the creditor, but by operation of law. In re Jacob's[5]; In re London Chartered Bank of Australasia[6]; Stacey v. Hill[7]; and, in the words of Bramwell L.J. in Rainbow v. Juggins[8].\nWhere a man enters into a contract of suretyship, he, it is true, bargains that he shall not be prejudiced by any improper dealing with securities to the benefit of which he as surety is entitled; but he makes that bargain with reference to the law of the land, and if the law of the land says that under such and such circumstances certain things must take place in order to enable the creditor to do the best he can for his own protection, then the contract of suretyship must be taken to be made subject to the liability of those things taking place. For that reason, the principle of the decision in Canadian Bank of Commerce v. Martin[9], should not be extended to the case where, as here, a company having gone into liquidation and made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, a creditor, in putting in his claim, values his securities and the valuation is accepted, by operation of the Act.\nWith great respect, we cannot, in such a case, accept the view of the law laid down in Bank of Hamilton v. Atkins et al.[10], that the creditor has thereafter no claim pro tanto against the sureties who had guaranteed the debt. The Bankruptcy Act, as it stands, does not deal with the obligations of the guarantors., On the contrary, it may well be said that the possibility of a loss through the bankruptcy of the debtor and the operation of the Bankruptcy Act is precisely one of the contingencies against which the agreement of guarantee was meant to provide.\nIt is therefore to the agreement itself that we must turn to find out whether, in the event, the sureties have been relieved as they claim. It clearly appears by the terms of the document that not only is it not so, but that, quite independently of the Bankruptcy Act, the bank would have had ample authority to act as it did. The bank could\nrefuse credit, grant extensions, take and give up securities, accept compositions, grant releases and discharges, and otherwise deal with the customer and with other parties and securities as the bank may see fit, and may apply all moneys received from the customer or others, or from any securities upon such part of the customer's indebtedness as it may think best, without prejudice to or in any way limiting or lessening the liability of the (sureties) under this guarantee.\nAnd this guarantee shall not be considered as wholly or partially satisfied by the payment or liquidation at any time or times of any sum or sums of money for the time being due to the bank, and all dividends, compositions and payments received by the bank from the customer or any other person or estate shall be applied as payments in gross without any right on the part of the undersigned to claim the benefit of any such dividends, compositions or payments or any securities held by the bank until payment to the bank of the amount hereby guaranteed, and this guarantee shall apply to and secure any ultimate balance due to the bank, and the bank shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse against the customer or other parties or the securities it may hold before being entitled to payment from the undersigned of the amount hereby guaranteed.\nAnother clause says that the guarantors \"specially waive and renounce any benefits of discussion and division.\" In the premises, we cannot see how the appellants can escape their liability and we think the judgment maintaining the action of the bank ought to be confirmed.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [11] dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the learned trial judge hereinafter referred to.\nThe four appellants being directors of a joint stock company doing business with the respondent, all, together with the three other parties referred to above, as defendants, gave a guarantee to the said respondent assuring it the payment of all the indebtedness due, or to become due, by said company, but limited to $4,000. Collateral securities had been given the respondent from time to time for said indebtedness, or parts thereof.\nThe said company having become bankrupt, prior to May, 1922, and passed under the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association, Limited, became the trustees of its estate under said Act.\nThe respondent proved its claim, as one of the creditors, against said company, and, in accordance with the requirements of said Act, valued the collateral securities it held in accordance with the provisions of said Act at $2,290.\nBeyond that nothing more was done by respondent, in that connection, than comply with the requirements of section 45 in that regard.\nThe respondent having sued the appellants and others on their said guarantee, the said appellants set up a curious contention: that under section 46, subsection (6) of said Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\n(6) Notwithstanding subsections four and five of this section the creditor may at any time, by notice in writing, require the trustee to elect whether he will or will not exercise his power of redeeming the security or requiring it to be realized, and if the trustee does not, within one month after receiving the notice or such further time or times as the court may allow, signify in writing to the creditor his election to exercise the power, he shall not be entitled to exercise it; and the equity of redemption, or any other interest in the property comprised in the security which is vested in the trustee, shall vest in the creditor, and the amount of his debt shall be reduced by the amount at which the security has been valued. the indebtedness due by said company under and by virtue of said guarantee to the respondent, could not be recovered from them as guarantors, save and except for the excess of the same beyond the value of the said collateral securities, declared in and by the proof of respondent, in making its claim filed with the trustee.\nThe learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Ives, dealt in his judgment with that pretension, as follows:\u2014\nUnder s. 46 the valuation made by the creditor when the claim is filed is not final. There may be a revaluation before or after the security is realized.\nAlso the section provides that if certain formalities, which are conditions precedent are complied with by the creditor and the trustee the former may become the owner of his security at a valuation which thereupon is applied as payment of the debt to that extent. But this surely is not the effect of a bare compliance with that requirement of the Act which calls upon the creditor to file and prove his claim in the first instance.

Idington J. dubitante.\nWhen the evidence against a prisoner is the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, it is wrong for the judge to tell the jury that, if they are quite certain that the accomplice is telling the truth, they have not only the right to convict the prisoner but that it is their duty to do so. Rex v. Beebe (41 T.L.R. 635; 19 Cr. App. Cas. 22) foll. Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\u2014In such a case, the judge should follow the rule laid down in Baskerville\u2019s Case (12 Cr. App. Cas. 81): the judge should warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and, in his discretion, may advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but he should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, criminal side, which had found the appellant guilty of manslaughter upon the verdict of a jury.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nLucien Gendron for the appellant.\nErnest Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by RINFRET J.\u2014The appellant has, by the verdict of a jury, been found guilty of manslaughter upon an indictment for murder; i.e. for having, unlawfully and with intent to procure abortion, done on the person of a girl acts which have caused her death, and which he knew to be likely to have such result.\nAgainst his conviction he appealed, on grounds which involved questions of law alone, to the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the province of Quebec, where his appeal was dismissed and the conviction entered against him was confirmed in all respects.\nThe law is that\nunless the court of appeal directs to the contrary in cases where, in the opinion of that court, the question is a question of law on which it would be convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court, the judgment of the court shall be pronounced by the president of the court or such other member of the court hearing the case as the president of the court directs, and no judgment with respect to the determination of any question shall be separately pronounced by any other member of the court. (Criminal Code, s. 1013, subs. 5).\nIn Davis v. The King[1], it was held that an appeal lies to this court, under s. 1024 of the Criminal Code read with s. 1013, only where a dissenting opinion has been expressed upon a question which the court of appeal deems a question of law and pursuant to its direction.\nThis direction must be evidenced by the order of the court and should be plainly expressed. The formal judgment here contains the entry that\nMr. Justice Allard and Mr. Justice L\u00e9tourneau entered a dissent from the present judgment for the reasons in law stated in their respective notes.\nThis entry, which is signed by the president of the court, is, in our opinion, consistent only with the view that the court considered it in the interests of justice that separate judgments should be pronounced by the dissenting members of the court, and therefore, sufficient to found jurisdiction for appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the questions of law which are in difference between the learned judges of the court of appeal.\nBy force of s. 1024 of the Criminal Code as enacted by s. 27 of c 38 of 15 and 16 Geo. V, the right of appeal is limited to\nany question of law on which there has been dissent in the court of appeal. In this case, the points of difference were four in number; but, in the view we take, it will only be necessary to consider the first of them, as to which both dissenting judges have expressed their disagreement from the majority of the court. It has reference to a certain passage of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nThe learned judge, after having explained the law concerning parties to offences (the principals, the accomplices, the actual perpetrators of the crime and the accessories before or after the fact) discussed the weight which ought to be given to the evidence of an accomplice and the necessity for its corroboration. He described what amounts to corroboration in law; and then he advised the jury as follows:\nLa Cour d\u2019Appel a decide que le juge ne doit pas demander aux jur\u00e9s de mettre de cot\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un complice, mais il doit leur indiquer le danger qu\u2019il peut y avoir \u00e0 condamner une personne sur le seul t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un complice. Cependant, m\u00eame si ce t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 de quelque corroboration, non-seulement vous avez le droit de le faire, mais c\u2019est votre devoir de le faire, si vous croyez que le complice qui rend t\u00e9moignage dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nThe learned judge was there advising the jury on a question of law and we must therefor, for the moment, quite independently of the facts of this case, consider whether in law his direction on that point was adequate and proper.\nAn accomplice is a competent witness. Rex v. Baskerville[2].\nThere are cases in which the evidence of one witness must be corroborated (Cr. C. s. 1002). Murder arising out of abortion is not one of them. But, in the King v. Baskerville2, the Court of Criminal Appeal in England undertook to state \u201cthe law to be applied in future cases\u201d and added:\nWe trust that it will be unnecessary again to refer to the earlier decisions of this court.\nLord Reading C.J., when delivering the judgment said (p. 663):\u2014\nIt has long been a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence. Reg. v. Stubbs[3]; In re Meunier[4]. This rule of practice has become virtually equivalent to a rule of law, and since the Court of Criminal Appeal Act came into operation this court has held that, in the absence of such a warning by the judge, the conviction must be quashed.\nThe judgment in the Baskerville Case[5] as laying down \u201cthe law that should be followed by this court\u201d was expressly adopted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench (appeal side) of the province of Quebec in The King v. Boycal and Ballan[6].\nSince then, the Court of Criminal Appeal has decided The King v. Beebe[7], which was a case of abortion. This decision was delivered only on the 6th July 1925 and therefore after the learned trial judge in the present case was called upon to give his direction to the jury, so that, in justice to him, it should be said that he lacked the advantage of having before him what may be called an authoritative interpretation of the Baskerville judgment.\nIn the Beebe Case7, Lord Hewart C.J. refers to King v. Baskerville5 and asks: \u201cWhat does that judgment say?\u201d His answer is:\nA clear distinction is drawn, although it is drawn in very few words and without elaboration or explanation, between three things: one, is to tell the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence; the second is, and this is a rule of universal application in such cases, not a rule to be neglected in some cases and observed in others, but a rule of universal application, it is a duty to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a person on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices; the third thing is, that the learned judge in the exercise of his discretion may advise them not to convict upon such evidence. One reads that passage side by side with the passages in the cases referred to, where it appears that so far as Baron Park was concerned he always advised a jury in such circumstances not to find a person guilty. But however that may be, there is a distinction drawn between the three different things the jury are to be told; that it is within their legal province to convict; they are to be warned in all such cases that it is dangerous to convict; and they may be advised not to convict.\nIt is quite clear when one looks at that enumeration of the various courses, that nowhere is to be found directly or indirectly any reference to a case in which it may be the duty of the learned judge to advise the jury in such a case that they ought to convict.\nThe decision in the Baskerville Case5 cannot be put in clearer and more powerful language, and it would be idle to add anything to it. Now let us see how far the direction here complained of compares with the warning in the Beebe Case[8]. Here, the learned judge said:\nCependant, m\u00eame si ce t\u00e9moignage (that of an accomplice) n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 de quelque corroboration, non-seulement vous avez le droit de le faire (i.e. to convict), mais c\u2019est votre devoir de le faire, si vous croyez que le complice qui rend t\u00e9moignage dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nIn the Beebe Case8, the judge presiding the Assizes had said:\nIf you are quite certain that that girl (an accomplice) is telling the truth and nothing but the truth so that you are satisfied in your heart and conscience, although it is uncorroborated, you ought to act upon it. If you are not satisfied up to the very hilt then do not do it.\nAs will be seen, in both passages the language is almost identical; but, if anything, the direction in the Beebe Case8 was less open to objection. Yet, it elicited the following criticism from the Lord Chief Justice of England:\nThose words are not only not a warning of the danger of so acting, and not only are they not a refraining from advising the jury so to act, but they are quite clearly an affirmative and express direction to the jury that in that event they ought so to act. In the opinion of this court, that direction is not such a direction as should, according to the law laid down in Baskerville Case[9], be given.\nAnd the conviction was quashed.\nIt is true that in the Beebe Case8 there was no corroboration of the evidence of the accomplice. But the direction of the learned trial judge in this case, at the point complained of, proceeds on the same assumption (\u201cm\u00eame si ce t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas appuy\u00e9 de quelque corroboration\u201d). It may very well have led the jury to understand that he was in effect advising them that, under the particular circumstances of this case, it was not necessary for them to look for corroboration, but if they were satisfied that the accomplice told the truth, not only was it within their province to convict the accused on the sole evidence of such accomplice, but it was their duty to do so. Now, in such a case, while a jury may convict, the rule is not that it is their duty to convict.\nIn our opinion, this is conclusive of the appeal. When once a case of misdirection is made out, the burden is upon the Crown to show that, as a result, there has been no miscarriage of justice, (s. 1014 Cr. C). Here, the Crown has failed to convince us that, but for the direction above referred to, the verdict would necessarily have been the same.\nNo doubt it is the settled rule in England that the appeal may be dismissed, although the point raised should be decided in favour of the appellant, if the court considers that no substantial wrong has occurred. The rule is embodied in s. 1014 subs. 2 of our Criminal Code; and only a short time ago this court made an application of it in Baker v. The King[10].\nBut, as was said by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. in Allen v. The King[11]:\nI cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae.\nIn the Allen\u2019s Case11, all the judges below had found that there was ample evidence that the prisoner killed Captain Elliston and, as would appear from the report, all the judges of this court concurred in that opinion. Nevertheless, because some evidence had been improperly admitted or something not according to law had been done which might have operated prejudicially to the accused upon a material issue, although it had not been and could not be shown that it did, in fact, so operate, and although the evidence properly admitted warranted the conviction, a new trial was ordered.\nIn the circumstances of this case we cannot come to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been influenced by the improper direction and therefore the conviction cannot stand.\nSince the case must go before another jury, we purposely refrain from discussing the evidence tendered in corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice; and we should not in the slightest be understood to mean that there is not in the record ample corroboration to justify a conviction under proper direction. We think however, the jury may have been led to disregard this issue and to think that they might well reach their verdict without considering whether or not such corroboration was sufficient to warrant a conviction. Were this court now to decide that it was, it would transfer to itself the determination of a question which the accused has the right to have tried by a jury, Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[12].\nWe are therefore of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014Before receiving a copy of my brother Rinfret\u2019s opinion herein, I had read the entire appeal book in this case, as well as the factums, and considered same, and had arrived at the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. I may say that the Beebe Case[13], where there was no corroborating evidence, yet so much relied upon by counsel for appellant, does not seem to me to have much resemblance to this case.\nIndeed the expression of the learned trial judge herein complained of, seemed to me as if he had simply, in a very long charge, made a slip in failing to add a word or two such as under the circumstances set forth in other evidence adduced in the case; and not likely to have influenced the jury unduly.\nAnd I may say as to the decision in the Court of Criminal Appeal in England, constituted under the Act of 1907, we have not the same powers as that, and hence must be on our guard, in that respect, in the disposition we make of cases presented to us within our restricted jurisdiction over criminal cases.\nAs there is to be a new trial I must content myself with saying that for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Green-shields, concurred in by Mr. Justice Dorion, with which in the main I agree, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed:\n[1] [1924] S.C.R. 522, at p. 525.\n[2] [1916] 2 K.B. 658, at p. 669.\n2 [1916] 2 K.B. 658, at p. 669.\n[3] 1 Dears. 555.\n[4] [1894] 2 Q.B. 415.\n[5] [19161 2 K.B. 658.\n[6] [1920] Q.R. 31 K.B. 391, at p. 396.\n[7] 19 Cr.

The respondents signed such a contract for the benefit of one C, who fraudulently represented to them that it was merely a letter of reference. Later on C. went into bankruptcy and the appellant sued the respondents for the amount then owing by C. At the trial the respondents testified that C. induced them to sign the documents on these representations and also that they had signed it in error as to the nature of the contract. It was proved that they signed the contract without reading it.\nHeld that, error as to the nature of a contract being a cause of nullity (art. 992 C.C.), although the fraud of C. was not a valid defence as to the appellant company which had not participated in it (art. 993 C.C.), the contract was nevertheless void by reason of this error, and in the circumstances of the case no fin de non-recevoir against the respondents resulted from the fact that they had signed the contract without reading it.\nFins de non-recevoir discussed. r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 que Bostwick lui avait consenti, est \u00e9galement intim\u00e9 sur le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au proc\u00e8s peuvent se relater bri\u00e8vement.\nLe 15 janvier, 1921, par acte devant Aubin, notaire, Bostwick a vendu \u00e0 Fernet, avec la garantie de droit, une terre situ\u00e9e partie en la paroisse de Berthier et partie en la paroisse de Lanoraie avec toutes constructions y \u00e9rig\u00e9es pour le prix de $2,000, et \u00e0 charge de payer \u00e0 l\u2019acquit du vendeur les sommes emprunt\u00e9es par ce dernier et dont le paiement \u00e9tait garanti par hypoth\u00e8que sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. Le vendeur s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 15 janvier, 1924, le droit de racheter la terre et d\u00e9pendances en remboursant \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur la somme de $2,000, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de 7% payable annuellement au 1er juillet, et toutes sommes que l\u2019acheteur aurait pu payer sur les emprunts sus mentionn\u00e9s, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 6%.\nL\u2019acte ajoutait qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le vendeur de rembourser \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur la somme de $2,000 dans le d\u00e9lai susdit, ou d\u2019en payer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat aux \u00e9poques fix\u00e9es, comme \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le vendeur de payer annuellement et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les taxes et autres impositions fonci\u00e8res auxquelles serait assujettie la dite terre, ou encore \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le vendeur de maintenir les constructions et travaux \u00e9rig\u00e9s sur la terre, il serait forclos, d\u00e8s tel d\u00e9faut, d\u2019exercer le droit de rachat, et l\u2019acheteur ou repr\u00e9sentants demeureraient propri\u00e9taires incommutables de la terre et d\u00e9pendances.\nBostwick, du consentement de Fernet, est rest\u00e9 en possession de cette terre et la poss\u00e9dait encore lors de l\u2019institution de cette action. Avant l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, il a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Fernet, quelquefois en retard, certains versements d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les $2,000. On ne se plaint pas qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas pay\u00e9 les taxes.\nBostwick esp\u00e9rait toujours pouvoir racheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait vendue \u00e0 Fernet, mais il n\u2019avait pas les fonds n\u00e9cessaires. Il a eu, pendant le d\u00e9lai pour exercer le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, diverses conversations avec Fernet qui apparemment ne demandait pas mieux que de rentrer dans ses fonds. Pour effectuer le rachat, Bostwick comptait emprunter le montant requis de sa s\u0153ur qui demeure \u00e0 Ottawa, et le jour m\u00eame de l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai du r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, 15 janvier, 1924, il \u00e9crivait \u00e0 Fernet que sa s\u0153ur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e par suite de maladie de retarder son voyage \u00e0 Lanoraie pour quelques jours, et qu\u2019il esp\u00e9rait que le d\u00e9lai ne serait pas long. Le terme pour le rachat \u00e9tant expir\u00e9, Fernet vendit la terre \u00e0 Beaudoin le 18 mars, 1924, sous la garantie de ses faits personnels seulement, pour la m\u00eame somme de $2,000, et \u00e0 la charge des hypoth\u00e8ques. C\u2019est alors que Bostwick, qui pr\u00e9tend avoir vainement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Beaudoin de ne pas acheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais de la lui laisser racheter de Fernet, adressa un prot\u00eat notari\u00e9, le 10 avril, 1924, \u00e0 Beaudoin, lui offrant $2,108.93 pour capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats, pr\u00e9tendant par l\u00e0 exercer le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, et il le somma de signer un acte de r\u00e9trocession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ce que Beaudoin refusa de faire. Bostwick n\u2019ayant pas voulu livrer \u00e0 Beaudoin la possession de la terre, celui-ci intenta contre lui l\u2019action p\u00e9titoire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par le jugement dont est appel.\nLa d\u00e9fense de l\u2019appelant Bostwick consiste principalement en une attaque contre l\u2019acte pass\u00e9 devant le notaire Aubin par lequel il avait vendu la terre \u00e0 Fernet avec r\u00e9serve du droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Le notaire, dit-il, ne lui a pas lu un acte de vente, mais un contrat de pr\u00eat, et si l\u2019acte comportait une vente, il l\u2019a sign\u00e9 par erreur. Il aurait inform\u00e9 Fernet, dans l\u2019automme de 1923, qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de rembourser le pr\u00eat. Le demandeur, en se portant acqu\u00e9reur de la terre, ajoute-t-il, a agi de mauvaise foi en achetant un droit litigieux, et le d\u00e9fendeur lui a offert, le 10 avril, 1924, la somme de $2,108.93 pour capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019il consigne. Ses conclusions sont que ses offres soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es bonnes et suffisantes et que le demandeur soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui signer un acte de r\u00e9trocession de la terre, le jugement, au cas de refus du demandeur de signer cet acte, devant en tenir lieu. Il demande aussi l\u2019annulation de la vente de Fernet \u00e0 Beaudoin.\nL\u2019appelant Bostwick fit suivre cette d\u00e9fense d\u2019une inscription en faux \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019acte de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 du 15 janvier, 1921, pr\u00e9tendant que la d\u00e9claration du notaire Aubin qu\u2019il avait, lu cet acte \u00e9tait fausse. La cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite tant sur le m\u00e9rite de l\u2019action et de la d\u00e9fense, que sur l\u2019inscription en faux, les deux instances ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies. L\u2019inscription en faux fut rejet\u00e9e par la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Sans nous occuper des motifs de ce rejet, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s par la cour du Banc du Roi, il suffit de dire que cette derni\u00e8re cour renvoya l\u2019inscription en faux pour la raison que la preuve offerte par Bostwick par sa propre d\u00e9position n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour \u00e9tablir que le notaire ne lui avait pas lu l\u2019acte. Le notaire Aubin est mort avant l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et il n\u2019y a au dossier que l\u2019affirmation sous serment de Bostwick. Le juge Greenshields a fait une analyse compl\u00e8te du t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier, et, avec le savant juge, nous croyons que les dires de Bostwick ne suffisent pas pour d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019acte ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 lu. Il ne sera donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de nous occuper davantage de l\u2019inscription en faux qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit. L\u2019action p\u00e9titoire de Beaudoin a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, et la cour du Banc du Roi rejeta l\u2019appel de Bostwick contre ce jugement.\nA l\u2019audition, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant Bostwick a soutenu qu\u2019il y avait dans sa d\u00e9fense et dans le prot\u00eat contenant ses offres r\u00e9elles tout ce qu\u2019il faut pour l\u2019exercice du retrait de droit litigieux contre le demandeur. Nous sommes d\u2019opinion que ce n\u2019est pas ce retrait que l\u2019appelant a exerc\u00e9 dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer sur sa pr\u00e9tention que le droit acquis par Beaudoin \u00e9tait litigieux. Le plus qu\u2019on puisse dire, en interpr\u00e9tant avec quelque bonne volont\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019appelant, c\u2019est que ce dernier pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019ayant, dans le d\u00e9lai voulu, exprim\u00e9 l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 que ses offres r\u00e9elles n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du terme et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 Beaudoin et non \u00e0 Fernet\u2014l\u2019appelant peut maintenant repousser l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Beaudoin.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant est qu\u2019il suffit que le vendeur d\u00e9clare \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, dans le d\u00e9lai du r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, son intention d\u2019exercer ce r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9; qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019accompagner cette d\u00e9claration de l\u2019offre du prix de vente, mais qu\u2019ayant exprim\u00e9 cette intention \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, il lui serait loisible, pendant trente ans, qui est le terme de la prescription de droit commun, de racheter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. Il appuie cette pr\u00e9tention sur la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans Johnson v. Laflamme[1].\nDans cette cause le vendeur avait offert \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, dans le d\u00e9lai convenu, la somme pour laquelle la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. Son action bas\u00e9 sur ces offres avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du terme, et cette cour d\u00e9cida qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de prendre l\u2019action dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9 pour le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, et que les offres faites avant son expiration \u00e9taient valables. C\u2019est toute la port\u00e9e de ce jugement comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent judiciaire, et on ne peut s\u2019en autoriser, malgr\u00e9 le sommaire r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eatiste et qui va trop loin, pour pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il suffit d\u2019intimer \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur dans le d\u00e9lai l\u2019intention d\u2019exercer le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, sans accompagner cette d\u00e9claration de l\u2019offre du prix. La pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant conduirait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9trange r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai qui est de rigueur (art. 1549 C.C.), et qui ne peut \u00eatre stipul\u00e9 pour un terme exc\u00e9dant dix ans (art. 1548 C.C.) durerait virtuellement trente ans apr\u00e8s son expiration, et cela sans que le prix de vente ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur. Les autorit\u00e9e fran\u00e7aises cit\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant ne peuvent l\u2019emporter sur le texte bien pr\u00e9cis des articles du code. Voyez aussi l\u2019article 1550 C.C. tel que modifi\u00e9 en 1919 par 9 Geo. V., c. 74.\nD\u2019ailleurs l\u2019acte de vente sign\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant le condamne. Le remboursement du prix de vente, aux termes de cet acte, devait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9, et faute de ce remboursement, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait forclos, d\u00e8s ce d\u00e9faut, d\u2019exercer le droit de rachat, et l\u2019acheteur demeurait propri\u00e9taire incommutable de la terre vendue. M\u00eame si le code ne condamnait pas la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant, cette pr\u00e9tention serait insoutenable en pr\u00e9sence de la convention expresse des parties.\nNous sommes \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant est mal fond\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 cet acte par erreur. L\u2019acte de vente lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu par le notaire, la d\u00e9claration de ce dernier en fait pleine foi et ne saurait \u00eatre contredite vu le rejet de l\u2019inscription en faux, et l\u2019appelant ne peut pas soutenir qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas la nature de l\u2019acte tr\u00e8s clairement r\u00e9dig\u00e9 qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 \u201clecture faite\u201d.\nPour ces raisons, nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nIdington J.\u2014At the argument of this appeal the only hope I had for appellant was that it might be found possible to impute to Fernet the intention of extending, as he had habitually done in regard to the interest, the time for payment of the principal; but I can find no solid basis to rest such a waiver upon.

E. Desrochers, \u00e0 la demande d\u2019un nomm\u00e9 S. Charland, sign\u00e8rent un contrat de cautionnement par lequel ils garantissaient conjointement et solidairement, en faveur de la compagnie appelante,\nunconditionally the payment in full of the balance due or owing said seller (la compagnie appelante) on account, as shown by its books at the date of the acceptance of this contract of guarantee by the seller, and the full and complete payment of all moneys due or owing, or that may become due or owing said seller, and all indebtedness incurred by the buyer (le nomm\u00e9 Charland) under the terms of the above and foregoing instrument by the buyer named as such therein.\nCe cautionnement faisait partie d\u2019un contrat de vente intitul\u00e9 \u201crenewal contract,\u201d par lequel l\u2019appelante consentait \u00e0 vendre \u00e0 Charland au prix du gros certains produits fabriqu\u00e9s par elle et que Charland revendait \u00e0 son compte. Ces contrats se renouvelaient d\u2019ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e et \u00e0 chaque renouvellement l\u2019acheteur \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de fournir un semblable cautionnement. Il fallait \u00e9galement un certificat par des hommes d\u2019affaires que l\u2019acheteur, \u00e0 leur connaissance, \u00e9tait sobre et digne de confiance. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le premier contrat de ce genre que Charland faisait avec l\u2019appelante, et \u00e0 la date de l\u2019acceptation par cette derni\u00e8re du contrat en question, le 9 f\u00e9vrier, 1922, il lui devait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tat au dossier, $3,169.23. Depuis cette date jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fermeture du compte, en juillet, 1922, les cr\u00e9dits d\u00e9pass\u00e8rent le montant des achats faits par Charland, de sorte que son d\u00e9bit final s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $2,993.88, et c\u2019est cette somme que l\u2019appelante r\u00e9clame des cautions de Charland, les intim\u00e9s, en vertu de leur cautionnement.\nIl faut ajouter qu\u2019au verso de la feuille du contrat qui porte la signature des intim\u00e9s, il y a, sous le titre de \u201cR\u00e9f\u00e9rences,\u201d imprim\u00e9 en lettres majuscules, une d\u00e9claration par un g\u00e9rant de banque et par un charretier qu\u2019ils connaissaient l\u2019acheteur et qu\u2019ils le recommandaient comme \u00e9tant sobre et digne de confiance.\nPeu de temps apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils eussent sign\u00e9 le contrat de cautionnement, les intim\u00e9s, pr\u00e9tendant n\u2019avoir donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une lettre testimoniale \u00e0 Charland, et craignant qu\u2019il n\u2019en r\u00e9sult\u00e2t pour eux quelque responsabilit\u00e9 pour les dettes de celui-ci, essay\u00e8rent d\u2019en obtenir une d\u00e9charge de l\u2019appelante, mais cette derni\u00e8re refusa d\u2019y consentir.\nCharland tomba bient\u00f4t en faillite, et les intim\u00e9s furent poursuivis pour le d\u00e9bit restant \u00e0 sa charge \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture du compte. Leur d\u00e9fense est: 1\u00b0. qu\u2019ils ont sign\u00e9 le contrat par suite du dol de Charland qui leur a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait une simple recommandation ou \u201clettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\u201d 2\u00b0. qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont sign\u00e9 par erreur quant \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019acte auquel ils appos\u00e8rent leurs signatures croyant que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019une \u201cr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\u201d\nA ce sujet, Desrochers t\u00e9moigne que Charland est venu le trouver afin de lui demander de signer pour lui (Charland) une \u201clettre de reference\u201d adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, afin qu\u2019il p\u00fbt renouveler son contrat avec celle-ci, lui disant que cela ne l\u2019engageait \u00e0 rien. Desrochers ajoute qu\u2019il ne comprend et ne lit pas l\u2019anglais, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a remarqu\u00e9 que le seul mot \u201cR\u00e9f\u00e9rences\u201d sur le contrat. Le t\u00e9moignage de Dumoulin est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au m\u00eame effet. Il dit que Charland lui a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait obtenir des \u201cr\u00e9f\u00e9rences\u201d afin de renouveler son contrat, et qu\u2019il lui a demand\u00e9 de signer un \u00e9crit \u201ccomme quoi tu me connais pour un bon vendeur, un homme sobre.\u201d Dumoulin lui a r\u00e9pondu: \u201cton papier est en anglais, je ne le comprends pas.\u201d Il dit qu\u2019alors Charland \u201cme l\u2019a traduit en r\u00e9f\u00e9rences,\u201d et il signe l'\u00e9crit. IL a produit un t\u00e9moins, le nomme Martin, son employ\u00e9, qui le corrobore. Plus tard, Dumoulin a eu des doutes quant l'honorabilit\u00e9 de Charland, et il a fait \u00e9crire \u00e0 l\u2019appelante pour savoir s'il avait sign\u00e9 autre chose que des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences.\nAjoutons que Charland ne fut pas interrog\u00e9 par l'appelante en contre-preuve et nous n'avons que les t\u00e9moignages non contredits des intimes et de Martin sur ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 lors de la signature du contrat. Le moyen r\u00e9sultant du dol de Charland a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 par les deux cours, et avec raison, car l'appelante n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dol. La cour sup\u00e9rieure (M. le juge Duclos) a aussi \u00e9carte la d\u00e9fense des intimes qu'ils avaient sign\u00e9 le contrat par erreur, et que partant ce contrat \u00e9tait nul. Ce dernier moyen fut cependant accueilli par la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel (le juge-en-chef Lafontaine, et les juges Howard et Rivard), les juges Dorion et Hall \u00e9tant dissidents. L'appelante, dont l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e, nous demande d'infirmer le jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi et de r\u00e9tablir celui de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nIl ne s'agit donc maintenant que de cette question d'erreur, le dol de. Charland \u00e9tant \u00e9carte comme moyen de rescision du contrat.\nLe premier juge a motive le renvoi de la defense des intimes comme suit:\nThe defendants cannot urge their own fault and negligence in avoidance of a contract quoad an innocent third party who has acted on the faith of the said contract.\nEt le savant juge ajoute:\nIt is urged that the defendants never consented to sign the bonds; but this is arguing in a vicious circle. They did sign the bonds under pretenses which the slightest inquiry would have shown them to be false.\nEt il cite Lemerle, Fins de non-recevoir, p. 144, ainsi qu'un court passage de mon Droit Civil Canadien, tome 5, p. 218. Il me sera peut-\u00eatre permis de dire que ce dernier passage, comme les signer typographiques l'indiquent, est r\u00e9ellement tire de Mourlon, R\u00e9p\u00e9titions &rites sur le code civil, t. 2, n\u00b0 1049bis. Il aurait fallu reproduire ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et suit l'extrait que l'honorable juge cite pour se rendre compte de toute la pens\u00e9e de l'auteur.\nL'esp\u00e8ce que nous avons a juger est la suivante. Par suite du dol de Charland, qui affirmait qu'il ne s'agissait que d\u2019une \" lettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence\" les intim\u00e9s ont sign\u00e9 un contrat de cautionnement en faveur de l'appelante. Cette derni\u00e8re n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dol qui partant -ne peut lui \u00eatre oppose comme moyen de rescision du contrat (art. 993 v. C.C.). Cependant les intimes ont prouv\u00e9 par leur serment, Dumoulin \u00e9tant corrobor\u00e9 par un de ses employ\u00e9s, qu\u2019ils ont sign\u00e9 ont ce contrat par erreur quant \u00e0 sa nature, croyant ne signer qu'une simple recommandation. Si dans ces circonstances l'erreur est prouv\u00e9e, et la cour du Banc du Roi accepte la preuve qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, peut-on starter la d\u00e9fense des intimes en leur opposant une fin de non-recevoir r\u00e9sultant du fait admis par eux qu'ils ont sign\u00e9 ce contrat sans le lire? J'ajoute que le contrat en question est clairement r\u00e9dige, et que la bonne foi de l'appelante ne souffre aucun doute.\nL'erreur quant a la nature m\u00eame du contrat est une cause de nullit\u00e9 aux termes de l\u2019article 992 C.C., car alors il n'y a pas eu de consentement, et l'erreur d'une seule des parties, ou l'erreur unilat\u00e9rale, suffit (Aubry et Rau, 5e ed., ---4, tome 4, p. 496 et renvois).\nCela \u00e9tant, la cause de l\u2019erreur est indiff\u00e9rente. Le droit \u20141 romain n'accordait pas la rescision dans le cas de l'erreur grossi\u00e8re, car on disait nec stultis solere succurri, sed errantibus. L'article 992 C.C. n'admet pas cette distinction; il envisage l'erreur subjectivement, et des qu'elle existe, et sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 sa cause, il annule le contrat (Voir dans le m\u00eame sens Laurent, tome 15, n\u00b0 509, et lire dans Mourlon, \u00e0 l'endroit cite plus haut, ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de et suit le passage reproduit dans le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure).\nCe qu'on enseigne toutefois, .c'est que lorsqu'une partie fait rescinder un contrat par suite d'une erreur qu'elle aurait pu \u00e9viter si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus prudente, elle devra oi indemniser l'autre partie, qui \u00e9tait de bonne foi, du pr\u00e9judice que celle-ci en \u00e9prouve. (Aubry et Rau, 5e ed.; tome 4, p. 497 et renvois). Dans le passage de Mourlon que reproduit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, cet auteur, comme le contexte le d\u00e9montre, suppose que l'avantage que le demandeur retirerait de la rescision serait \u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qu'il aurait a payer. Je puis ajouter d'ailleurs que je n'ai trouv\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise aucun cas o\u00f9 on ait renvoy\u00e9 l'action en rescision pour erreur a cause de l'imprudence ou de la n\u00e9gligence du demandeur. Ce que le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure oppose aux d\u00e9fendeurs, c\u2019est une fin de non-recevoir tir\u00e9e du fait qu\u2019ils ont sign\u00e9 le contrat sans le lire.\nThe defendants (dit le savant juge) cannot urge their own fault and negligence in avoidance of a contract quoad an innocent third party who has acted upon the said contract.\nOn trouve la m\u00eame id\u00e9e dans le jugement de l\u2019honorable juge Dorion. Qu\u2019il me soit permis de r\u00e9pondre, avec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement pas un tiers, mais une partie au contrat de cautionnement fait en sa faveur. Du reste, outre la citation de Lemerle, dont l\u2019ouvrage publi\u00e9 en 1819 ne fait qu\u2019\u00e9noncer un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et le passage de Mourlon qui, je l\u2019ai dit, s\u2019explique par son contexte, je n\u2019ai pu trouver, apr\u00e8s des recherches minutieuses, aucune autorit\u00e9 qui admette une telle fin de non-recevoir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une action ou d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019erreur.\nIl est indiscutable qu\u2019il y a dans le droit civil des fins de non-recevoir (on appelle cela estoppel dans le droit anglais) qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une action en justice ou d\u2019une d\u00e9fense. Pothier (Obligations, n\u00b0 676), visant le cas des cr\u00e9ances, d\u00e9finit les fins de non-recevoir, comme \u00e9tant\ncertaines causes qui emp\u00eachent le cr\u00e9ancier d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9cout\u00e9 en justice pour exiger sa cr\u00e9ance.\nIl signale la chose jug\u00e9e, le serment d\u00e9cisoire (qui n\u2019existe plus dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, 60 Vict., c. 50, s. 21), et la prescription. On peut dire en th\u00e8se g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu\u2019aucune fin de non-recevoir n\u2019est accueillie en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de droit qui l\u2019admette. Ainsi certaines actions en nullit\u00e9 de mariage ne pouvent plus \u00eatre re\u00e7ues apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration d\u2019un d\u00e9lai plus ou moins long qui fait pr\u00e9sumer l\u2019acquiescement au mariage (arts. 149, 151 C.C.). Apr\u00e8s ce d\u00e9lai, une fin de non-recevoir fait \u00e9carter l\u2019action. (Voy., dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, un arr\u00eat int\u00e9ressant de la cour de cassation du 4 juin 1845, Dalloz, 1845 1.307). La fin de non-recevoir dont il s\u2019agit ici n\u2019est pas reconnue, mais au contraire est implicitement exclue, par le code civil.\nA titre de droit compar\u00e9, il serait int\u00e9ressant de constater que sous l\u2019empire du droit anglais il n\u2019y aurait pas estoppel dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe. Dans la cause de Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Company v. Bragg[2], la cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Angleterre a refus\u00e9 d\u2019admettre L\u2019estoppel dans une esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 le d\u00e9fendeur avait sign\u00e9 sans le lire un contrat de garantie qu\u2019on lui a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00eatre un document se rapportant \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019assurance dans laquelle il avait des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nJe crois qu\u2019on peut disposer de cette cause en disant que les intim\u00e9s ayant sign\u00e9, par erreur quant \u00e0 la nature m\u00eame du contrat, le contrat de cautionnement invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante, celle-ci ne peut les faire condamner \u00e0 payer la dette de Charland. Cette erreur pouvait se prouver par le t\u00e9moignage des intim\u00e9s. A l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le code civil est entr\u00e9 en vigueur, la partie n\u2019aurait pu offrir son serment pour prouver l\u2019erreur, mais maintenant les parties sont admises \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en leur faveur. Il peut sans doute y avoir danger qu\u2019une personne peu scrupuleuse \u00e9chappe \u00e0 son obligation en pr\u00eatant un serment qu\u2019il est souvent difficile de contredire. Mais c\u2019est l\u00e0 une consid\u00e9ration pour le l\u00e9gislateur plut\u00f4t que pour le tribunal, et le juge du proc\u00e8s peut toujours appr\u00e9cier la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage rendu devant lui et l\u2019\u00e9carter s\u2019il lui para\u00eet peu digne de foi. Du reste, si l\u2019appelante souffre un pr\u00e9judice par suite de la n\u00e9gligence des intim\u00e9s, l\u2019existence de ce pr\u00e9judice ne serait pas une raison de maintenir une action bas\u00e9e uniquement sur un contrat frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9. L\u2019appelante, je l\u2019ai dit, n\u2019est pas responsable du dol de Charland. Cependant ce dol a eu pour r\u00e9sultat l\u2019erreur des intim\u00e9s, et cette erreur suffit pour rendre le contrat non avenu. (Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Obligations, tome 1er, n\u00b0 114). Il y a une d\u00e9cision en sens contraire de feu le juge C. A. Pelletier dans Imperial Life Assurance Co. v. Lalibert\u00e9[3], mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l\u2019opinion de Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde \u00e0 laquelle je viens de renvoyer. Cette opinion est d\u2019ailleurs partag\u00e9e par Planiol, 6e. \u00e9d., tome 2, n\u00b0 1064.\nIl convient d\u2019ajouter qu\u2019il y a trois autres d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec que je n\u2019ai pu suivre, car elles me paraissent d\u00e9passer la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 992 C.C. tel que je l\u2019interpr\u00e8te: Gosselin v. The Independent Order of Foresters, cour de circuit, Charbonneau J.[4]; Similingis v. Provincial Fire Insurance Co. of Canada, cour de revision[5]; Tranquil v. Gagnon, cour de revision[6]. Dans la premi\u00e8re cause on a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que pour \u00eatre une cause d\u2019annulation d\u2019un contrat, l\u2019erreur doit \u00eatre invincible, incontr\u00f4lable et involontaire. Dans la seconde, on a refus\u00e9 de tenir compte d\u2019une erreur qui, en la supposant prouv\u00e9e, r\u00e9sultait de la n\u00e9ghgence de la personne qui s\u2019en plaignait. Enfin, dans la troisi\u00e8me, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019erreur doit \u00eatre telle qu\u2019une personne d\u2019exp\u00e9rience aurait pu s\u2019y tromper. Ces d\u00e9cisions ne sont appuy\u00e9es sur aucune autorit\u00e9 dans la jurisprudence ou la doctrine, et, \u00e0 mon avis, elles ajoutent r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 la loi.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles Champoux.\nSolicitors for the respondent A.

A condemnation for the payment of a value in money can only be obtained as a sanction, in case the property itself can no longer be returned. Where a party is evicted from the thing he has received in exchange, he has the option of demanding damages (Art. 1598 C.C.).\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 41 K.B. 375) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant was the owner of a farm in the township of Sutton and was desirous of selling it for $12,500. He requested a real estate agent to find him a purchaser and was informed by the latter that the respondent might be interested in purchasing the farm if the appellant would be interested himself in acquiring ownership of a business and tenement block respondent had in the town of Thetford Mines and for which the latter wanted $20,000. The respondent\u2019s property consisted of a three-story building which was leased for stores and residential purposes. The respondent had also rented for a period of years an adjoining lot on which he erected a shed which was united to his building by stairs. The appellant went to Thetford Mines to examine the respondent\u2019s property and he finally agreed to purchase it for $18,000 provided the latter took his farm for $12,500. A writing was then drawn by the real estate agent containing the various conditions of the transaction and was signed by both appellant and respondent. On the 27th July, 1923, a notary prepared two separate deeds of sale, one for the town property from respondent to appellant at $18,000, and one for the farm property from appellant to respondent at $12,500. There was a mortgage of $4,900 on the farm property and respondent assumed it, leaving a balance of $7,600 to be paid by him to the appellant. Both deeds were signed at the same time and appellant acknowledged receipt from respondent of $7,600 and respondent acknowledged having been paid $7,600 on the purchase price of $18,000. One month later the appellant took the present action against the respondent in order to set aside the deed of sale by the respondent to him of the town property and also asked that the respondent be condemned to reimburse him the sum of $7,600 which was declared in the deed to have been paid in cash, on the ground that the respondent had falsely represented to him that the shed adjoining the main building was situated on the property sold. The respondent denied that any misrepresentations had been made by him; but added that, if the appellant had any complaint about the transaction which was really a contract of exchange, he ought to have asked that it be entirely set aside in order to place both parties in the same position as they were before the passing of the two deeds. The appellant\u2019s action was maintained by the trial judge; but on appeal this judgment was reversed.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Perrault K.C. and J. E. Perrault K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C., and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Pour assurer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des conventions, les tribunaux ont le pouvoir et le devoir de les interpr\u00e9ter et de d\u00e9terminer leur v\u00e9ritable nature. La d\u00e9nomination qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 un contrat ne change rien \u00e0 son caract\u00e8re. Ce qu\u2019il faut rechercher, avant tout, c\u2019est l\u2019intention des parties. (Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d., vol. 12, n\u00b0 334; Planiol, 5e \u00e9d., vol. 2, nos 973, 1182, 1200).\nCe sont l\u00e0 des principes que cette cour a eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019affirmer entre autres dans son arr\u00eat re Salvas v. Vassal[2], o\u00f9 elle dut examiner la port\u00e9e d\u2019un acte de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans lequel la Cour du Banc de la Reine[3] n\u2019avait voulu voir qu\u2019un contrat de gage ou de nantissement et auquel, par d\u00e9faut de tradition des biens, elle avait refus\u00e9 de donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des tiers.\nSir Henry Strong, juge-en-chef, dit (p. 77):\nIt appears to me free from doubt that the parties intended just what they have said in the two notarial deeds and that these deeds were not intended to disguise any other or different contracts from those expressed in them. This being sufficient for the decision of the appeal, I need not say anything further.\nEt le juge Girouard (p. 81):\nPour d\u00e9cider la question, m\u00eame vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers, il s\u2019agit de rechercher non pas les motifs, ou le but imm\u00e9diat ou ult\u00e9rieur, ou les r\u00e9sultats possibles ou probables que les parties avaient en vue, mais la nature de la convention qu\u2019elles avaient l\u2019intention de faire, et qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 elles ont faite.\nOr, dans cette cause de Salvas v. Vassal (1) la cour \u00e9tant d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9 et m\u00eame admis que, dans le but de mieux assurer le remboursement des avances de l\u2019appelant, les parties avaient r\u00e9ellement eu l\u2019intention de consentir une vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, donna effet \u00e0 cette intention et, le d\u00e9lai de rachat \u00e9tant expir\u00e9 sans remboursement, d\u00e9clara l\u2019appelant propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de l\u2019immeuble vendu, m\u00eame vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers.\nIci, en recherchant, dans les actes consentis par eux, la v\u00e9ritable intention de Gouin et de Latreille, la cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a donc pas, suivant l\u2019habile argumentation du savant procureur de l\u2019appelant, refus\u00e9 de suivre la doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de Salvas v. Vassal (1). Nous croyons, au contraire, qu\u2019elle en a fait une application juste et pr\u00e9cise.\nNon seulement toute la preuve, sans aucune contradiction, mais l\u2019admission positive de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tablissent que, en donnant \u00e0 leur transaction la forme de deux actes de vente, les parties n\u2019ont jamais eu en vue autre chose que l\u2019\u00e9change de leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Ils ne voulaient pas qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt, de part et d\u2019autre, le paiement d\u2019un \u201cprix en argent\u201d (art. 1472 C.C.), et de fait il n\u2019y en a pas eu; mais ils entendaient se donner respectivement une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour une autre (art. 1596 C.C.). Et c\u2019est l\u00e0 la distinction essentielle et caract\u00e9ristique entre la vente et l\u2019\u00e9change. (3 Pothier, ed. Bugnet, p. 9, art. 17 et p. 13, art. 30; 19 Baudry-Lacan-tinerie, De la vente et de l\u2019\u00e9change, 3e \u00e9d., nos 127 et 128; 4 Aubry & Rau, Droit Civil, p. 336; Guillouard, De la vente et de l\u2019\u00e9change, p. 100, n\u00b0 92). Et le fait qu\u2019il existait une soulte ne modifie pas la situation (19 Baudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d. n\u00b0 975; 2 Planiol, 6e \u00e9dit. n\u00b0 1662).\nSans doute, chacun des deux actes mentionne un montant en argent; mais ce n\u2019est l\u00e0 que renonciation des valeurs respectives des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par les parties pour servir de base \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change. Ni Gouin, ni Latreille n\u2019avaient l\u2019intention de donner ou de recevoir de l\u2019argent (sauf la soulte). D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qui est acquis au dossier, la convention n\u2019aurait pas permis \u00e0 l\u2019un de poursuivre l\u2019autre pour un prix en argent, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait autoris\u00e9 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des contrats par la remise d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent. Chacun des contractants ne pouvait satisfaire \u00e0 son obligation que par la d\u00e9livrance de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame.\nC\u2019est donc, comme d\u2019ailleurs l\u2019a fait la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d\u2019appel, et contrairement \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, du point de vue d\u2019un \u00e9change qu\u2019il faut envisager la transaction des parties en date du 27 juillet 1923; et c\u2019est dans les r\u00e8gles du droit applicables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change qu\u2019il faut chercher la solution de cette cause.\nDans ces circonstances, Latreille, all\u00e9guant d\u2019abord fausses repr\u00e9sentations, et uniquement pour cette raison, a conclu \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de cette partie de la convention par laquelle il avait re\u00e7u la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gouin et a demand\u00e9 que ce dernier f\u00fbt contraint de reprendre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de lui rembourser la somme de $7,000 (erreur pour $7,600) pr\u00e9tendue pay\u00e9e comptant lors de la signature du contrat. (On a vu qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi et que cette somme d\u2019argent n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 et ne devait pas \u00eatre pay\u00e9e en vertu de la convention). En outre, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 se r\u00e9server tous recours en dommages.\nPlus tard, par voie d\u2019amendement mais sans modifier ses conclusions, Latreille a invoqu\u00e9 en plus que Gouin n\u2019\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui avait livr\u00e9e. (De fait, il semblerait \u00eatre seulement l\u2019emphyt\u00e9ote du terrain, bien que propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2timents).\nD\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, Gouin a plaid\u00e9: Les deux actes que nous avons sign\u00e9s ne sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu\u2019un \u00e9change de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Vous ne pouvez demander la r\u00e9siliation d\u2019une partie seulement de cet \u00e9change. Si vous voulez me contraindre \u00e0 reprendre ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9, il faut, en m\u00eame temps, que vous vous d\u00e9clariez pr\u00eat \u00e0 reprendre la v\u00f4tre. S\u2019il doit y avoir rescision, il faut que ce soit de la convention toute enti\u00e8re.\nEn d\u2019autres termes, un copermutant ne peut demander la r\u00e9siliation de l\u2019\u00e9change sans que les parties soient remises autant que possible dans la m\u00eame position qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient auparavant.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que, \u00e0 raison de la forme des actes, il se trouvait, au moment de poursuivre, dans une situation embarrassante au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019il devait attribuer \u00e0 la transaction. Il lui faut bien admettre cependant que cette difficult\u00e9 a cess\u00e9 d\u00e8s la production du plaidoyer. L\u00e0, le d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9clarait clairement (ce qui, d\u2019ailleurs, \u00e9tait exact) qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait la convention comme un \u00e9change. Il \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors facile pour l\u2019appelant de prendre acte de cette d\u00e9claration et de se diriger en cons\u00e9quence.\nMais l\u2019appelant, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, part au contraire du point de vue que l\u2019autre acte ne peut \u00eatre rescind\u00e9; il n\u2019offre pas de le r\u00e9silier; et il a conserv\u00e9 cette attitude pendant tout le reste du proc\u00e8s.\nDans ces conditions, le rejet de l\u2019action telle qu\u2019intent\u00e9e nous para\u00eet in\u00e9vitable.\nL\u2019appelant ne demande pas la r\u00e9siliation de l\u2019\u00e9change. Il demande que l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit tenu de reprendre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et de lui rembourser $7,000 qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue avoir pay\u00e9s. Or, il admet lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019a rien pay\u00e9. Si toutefois il avait droit \u00e0 la restitution du prix en vertu de l\u2019art. 1511 C.C., le prix, dans le cas actuel, ce n\u2019est pas une somme d\u2019argent (ou le montant de $7,000), mais c\u2019est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9e en \u00e9change. Or, il ne demande pas autre chose que $7,000; et il n\u2019a aucun droit de se faire rembourser cette somme qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais d\u00e9bours\u00e9e.\nGouin n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 acheter la ferme de Latreille, mais seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9changer contre sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne peut \u00eatre contraint maintenant \u00e0 donner de l\u2019argent \u00e0 la place de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nNous ne pouvons pas, comme il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par deux des juges de la cour d\u2019appel, lui accorder la somme demand\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, car ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 ce titre qu\u2019il la r\u00e9clame. En outre, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve de dommages au dossier. Le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 une contestation de ce genre; et il ne serait pas juste, ni \u00e9quitable, apr\u00e8s coup, de transformer ce litige en une action en dommages. (California Associated Raisin Co. v. Radovsky[4]. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs le demandeur lui-m\u00eame qui s\u2019est charg\u00e9, dans les conclusions de sa d\u00e9claration, d\u2019affirmer au d\u00e9fendeur qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9clame pas de dommages, et qu\u2019il se r\u00e9serve tout recours \u00e0 ce sujet, s\u2019il y a lieu.\nL\u2019article 1598 C.C. donne \u00e0\nla partie qui est \u00e9vinc\u00e9e de la chose qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u en \u00e9change * * * le choix de r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats ou r\u00e9p\u00e9ter celle qu\u2019elle a donn\u00e9e.\nSans se demander si, au moment de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, Latreille pouvait \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 comme \u201cune partie qui est evince\u201d, il suffit de constater que cet article du code lui laissait le choix entre: 1, une action pour faire r\u00e9silier rechange et \u201cr\u00e9p\u00e9ter la chose\u201d qu\u2019il avait donn\u00e9e; ou 2, une action pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nIl a opt\u00e9 pour l\u2019action en r\u00e9siliation (bien qu\u2019il l\u2019ait fait imparfaitement), en indiquant de plus qu\u2019il ne demandait pas alors des dommages, mais que, au contraire, il se r\u00e9servait le droit de les r\u00e9clamer plus tard, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire dans une autre action.\nIl est impossible, dans ces conditions, de changer maintenant cette option et de traiter l\u2019action comme si, d\u00e8s l\u2019origine, elle eut exerc\u00e9 un recours en dommages. Tout au plus peut-on faire comme le demandeur lui-m\u00eame et lui donner acte de sa d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il se r\u00e9serve son \u201crecours en dommages, s\u2019il y a lieu\u201d.\nNous rejetons donc l\u2019appel uniquement parce qu\u2019il y a eu, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un \u00e9change et que l\u2019appelant ne demande pas, par son action, et ne veut pas demander la r\u00e9solution de l\u2019\u00e9change en entier, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 remettre les deux parties dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient avant la formation du contrat. Le jugement de la cour est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette unique raison, afin qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait entre les parties chose jug\u00e9e sur aucun autre point et que r\u00e9serve soit accord\u00e9e de tous les autres recours auxquels les parties, peuvent encore avoir droit.\nL\u2019appelant devra payer les frais du pr\u00e9sent appel.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises from a bargain, between appellant and respondent for an exchange of properties, which was reduced to writing and signed and that writing drawn up by a broker who had brought it about was taken to a notary public to have the bargain so arrived at duly carried out by the preparation of the necessary deed or deeds.\nThe respondent entered into the possession of the farm he thus became entitled to, and the appellant into the possession of the property in the town of Thetford Mines which he thus became entitled to.\nAbout a month thereafter the appellant brought this action against the respondent alleging that he had not got the title to the said Thetford Mines property which he had expected as the result of said bargain. Instead of making an attack thereby on the whole exchange and seeking to have that cancelled and the parties put back where they respectively were before the said bargain, he sought only to rescind the conveyance to him by the respondent, and to be repaid-some $7,000 he alleged he had paid.\nThe learned trial judge granted him what he asked although both parties agreed in evidence that there had been an exchange and nothing else.\nHe refused to admit in evidence the writing above referred to containing the bargain and refused to look at anything else than the deed to the appellant and declared by his judgment that respondent had not the right to sell the land described in his deed to the appellant and set aside the sale as set forth in said deed, and condemned the respondent to repay to the appellant $7,000 with costs.\nFrom that judgment respondent appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side.\nThe court allowed his appeal with costs of the appeal and of the proceedings up to and of the trial, and dismissed the action.\nI am, with great respect, surprised at the diversity of opinion expressed in the court below, for it seems to me that if we ever can do justice, we must get seized of the actual nature of the transaction between the parties which, I submit, certainly was a clear case of exchange.\nThere was no $7,000 paid and that can only be arrived at by a consideration of the terms of the exchange. And everyone possessed of knowledge of how men act in making an exchange and arriving at the basis of such a bargain, must know how dangerous it would be to assess damages on any such basis as the estimates of valuation expressed therein.\nMoreover the action was not one for damages but for rescision and an attempt to get recision of only a part of the bargain and thereby if possible get an unduly advantageous sale for his farm.\nI agree with the opinion of Justices Guerin and Tellier \u2014and as expressing my own more clearly than that of Justice Flynn, though he certainly presents a strong argument, and sheds light on the case. For the reasons so assigned in support of the judgment appealed from I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L. U.

(R.S.A., 1922, c. 133)\u2014 Sale of goods\u2014Bulk Sales Act, Alta., 1913, c. 10, as amended 1919, c. 38 (present Act, in different form, R.S.A., 1922, c, 148). T. bought from S. his store premises and stock-in-trade, transferring to S., as part consideration, T.'s ranch stock, which was to be applied, first on the purchase price of the land sold by S. to T., and then on the price of the merchandise. S. was to apply the proceeds of T.'s ranch stock transferred to S., in settlement of the debts of S. pro rata. G. was president of a bank to which S. was indebted. G. knew of the proposed transaction between S. and T. and desired it to go through. As found by this court, G. told T. that S. was not indebted to the bank, and concealed from T. certain securities taken to secure the bank, including a mortgage on the store premises which he registered; G. also procured the proceeds of T.'s ranch stock transferred to S. to be applied on the debt of S. to the bank. The wholesale creditors of S. seized the stock-in-trade under writs of execution, the seizure being based on an alleged violation of the Alberta Bulk Sales Act on the sale from S. to T. T. at first contested the seizure but abandoned the proceedings. T. recovered a judgment against S. for $5,500, and was declared to have a lien therefor on the store premises purchased from S., and that lien was given priority over G.'s mortgage. On this latter point a new trial was ordered by the Appellate Division, and it was this question of the priority of T.'s lien over G.'s mortgage (and the facts as to G.'s conduct, which were in dispute) which ultimately came to be decided by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld that, even assuming (as was held by certain judges of the Appellate Division, but not decided by the Supreme Court of Canada) that the transaction between S. and T. was not a sale \"for cash or on credit\" within s. 2 of The Bulk Sales Act of Alberta, 1913, c. 10, as amended 1919, c. 38 (as being the Act applicable and not the later Act of 1922) and therefore did not violate that Act, so that T. might successfully have contested the seizure by the creditors of S., yet T.'s abandonment of his contest of the seizure did not afford an answer to his equitable claim against G.; G. was estopped from invoking his mortgage to the prejudice of T.'s lien; and the Alberta Land Titles Act has not denuded the courts of their equitable jurisdiction to compel persons unconscientiously asserting legal rights to do equity.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (21 Alta. L.R. 408) reversed, and judgment of Boyle J. ([1925] 2 D.L.R. 270), declaring the priority of T.'s lien, restored with a certain modification.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which by a majority reversed the judgment of the trial judge, Boyle J.[2], declaring that the plaintiff (appellant) was entitled, in respect to a charge for a judgment against the defendant Schwartz for the sum of $5,500, to priority over the mortgage of the defendant Guerin against certain land which had been sold by Schwartz to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff and the defendant Schwartz entered into an agreement by which Schwartz was to sell to the plaintiff certain land and buildings thereon in Milk River, Alberta, and a stock of merchandise belonging to the business which Schwartz had carried on on the said premises. As part of the consideration the plaintiff was to transfer to Schwartz certain land and certain live stock and other chattels on his ranch. The property conveyed and payments made by the plaintiff to Schwartz were to be applied, first on the purchase price of the real property to be conveyed by Schwartz to the plaintiff, and then on the price of the merchandise. Schwartz was to apply the proceeds of all chattels got by him from the plaintiff in settlement of his debts pro rata. The defendant (respondent) Guerin was the president and cashier of the defendant (respondent) bank at Sweet Grass, Montana, near the international boundary, which did some business in Canada. According to the findings made or sustained by the judgment now reported the following facts (on which there was conflicting evidence and certain difference of opinion in the Appellate Division) appear. Schwartz was indebted to the said bank. Guerin knew of the proposed transaction between the plaintiff and Schwartz and (believing, as he said, that Schwartz could do better in live stock than in a mercantile business), desired it to go through. Guerin told the plaintiff that Schwartz owed the bank nothing. Guerin undertook to act as trustee for distribution pro rata amongst the wholesale creditors of Schwartz of all moneys to be received from the sale by Schwartz of the plaintiff's ranch stock transferred to him. Unknown to the plaintiff Guerin took from Schwartz a bill of sale of the said ranch stock. He applied the proceeds of sale thereof towards Schwartz' indebtedness to the bank. He also, as security to the bank, took and caused to be registered a mortgage from Schwartz (he had previously held as security an unregistered transfer in favour of Schwartz) on property which included the land and buildings that Schwartz was transferring to the plaintiff, and disclosed this mortgage to the plaintiff only after the plaintiff had taken possession of the Schwartz property and the plaintiff's ranch stock transferred to Schwartz had been sold by Schwartz and its proceeds were already with Guerin's bank.\nThe wholesale creditors of Schwartz caused a seizure under writs of execution to be made of the stock-in-trade which had been sold by Schwartz to the plaintiff, the seizure being based on an alleged violation of the Bulk Sales Act. The plaintiff at first contested the said seizure but subsequently discontinued the proceedings.\nOn the first trial of the action, before Walsh J., the plaintiff was given judgment for $5,500 against Schwartz and was declared to have a lien for it upon the land in Milk River which Schwartz had agreed to sell to him and in part payment for which the plaintiff had transferred his ranch stock to Schwartz; and that lien was given priority over the mortgage held by Guerin. In so far as this judgment gave priority to the plaintiff's lien over Guerin's mortgage it was set aside by the Appellate Division [3] and a new trial ordered. The second trial was before Boyle J. [4]who upheld the priority of the plaintiff's lien over Guerin's mortgage. This judgment was set aside by the Appellate Division and the plaintiff's action dismissed, Stuart and Clarke J.J.A. dissenting[5]. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\nA. L. Smith K.C. and E. V. Robertson for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The history of the transactions out of which this litigation arose and of the litigation itself is fully recorded in the judgments of the provincial courts. A careful study of the entire record discloses that the learned trial judge was abundantly justified in accepting the evidence of the plaintiff Tolley and his corroborating witnesses and in discrediting and rejecting entirely the conflicting testimony of the defendant Guerin. The findings of fact made by the learned judge (2) are fully sustained and warrant his conclusion that the plaintiff was the victim of a gross and palpable fraud in the perpetration of which the defendant Guerin not only actively participated but would appear to have been the instigating and controlling spirit.\nOnly one of the learned appellate judges has taken a contrary view of the evidence[6], and, with great respect, his reversal of the explicit findings of the trial judge as to the respective credibility of the witnesses who appeared before him cannot be supported. Nocton v. Ashburton[7]. To the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge the evidence appears to warrant the addition of further findings that the defendant Guerin not only undertook to act as trustee for distribution pro rata amongst the wholesale creditors of Schwartz of all moneys to be received from the sale by the latter of the Tolley stock transferred to him, but that he actually obtained $5,000 of such proceeds from the Canadian Bank of Commerce on a representation that he required this money to enable him to carry out the trust for such distribution, a bill of sale from Schwartz enabling him as holder of the legal title to the stock to compel the handing over of the proceeds of its sale to himself. Guerin's undertaking of the trust for distribution is sworn to by Tolley, corroborated by Schwartz, Berkinshaw and Moffat, and to a considerable extent by admissions forced from Guerin himself on cross-examination. He also admitted that he knew that the money in question formed \"part of the realization of the first money from this deal with Tolley\" and \"was to be applied as payment on that real estate,\" i.e., the Milk River lots and buildings. Guerin, therefore, received these moneys earmarked to his knowledge with the trust impressed upon them by the agreement between Tolley and Schwartz of the 26th of August and, as to the $5,000, by asserting his purpose to carry out that trust. In direct violation of the confidence reposed in him he applied this $5,000 and other moneys received by him, which were likewise so earmarked to his knowledge, amounting in all to upwards of $6,000, to pay off in part the indebtedness of Schwartz to the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of which he (Guerin) was the president and cashier\u2014an indebtedness which he had not merely concealed from, but the existence of which he had more than once explicitly denied to Tolley in the course of the negotiations leading up to his agreement with Schwartz.\nConcealing this indebtedness to the bank, Guerin, of course, also concealed from Tolley the existence of two securities which he held for it\u2014one, the bill of sale of the Tolley stock already mentioned which he took from Schwartz on the day immediately following the completion of the agreement by which Schwartz acquired ownership of it, and the other a mortgage from Schwartz for $8,500 on his property at Milk River, which included the lots and buildings that Schwartz was, to Guerin's knowledge, transferring to Tolley as free from all encumbrances. While Guerin had probably held an equitable charge on Schwartz's Mill River property for several weeks before Tolley entered into negotiations with Schwartz, his mortgage on it was perfected and registered only after Tolley had agreed to buy from Schwartz and with full knowledge by Guerin of the terms and conditions of their agreement. Guerin disclosed this mortgage to Tolley only after Tolley had taken possession of the Schwartz property and his (Tolley's) stock had been sold by Schwartz and its proceeds were already with Guerin's bank.\nAs a direct consequence of the fraud and breach of trust committed by Guerin in appropriating to his bank the proceeds of the Tolley stock, which the wholesale creditors of Schwartz should have received, the latter caused a seizure to be made of the stock-in-trade at Milk River, which had been sold by Schwartz to Tolley and they subsequently disposed of it. This seizure was based on an alleged violation of the Bulk Sales Act in the sale by Schwartz to Tolley and until the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal on the second appeal everybody\u2014 courts, counsel and parties alike\u2014had proceeded upon the assumption that the transaction between Schwartz and Tolley contravened the provisions of that statute and that the seizure and sale by Schwartz's creditors were unimpeachable. Tolley had at first contested the seizure but subsequently withdrew his application for interpleader, no doubt upon advice to that effect.\nThere have been two trials of this action. At the first trial before Mr. Justice Walsh Tolley's loss resulting from the fraud and breach of trust by Guerin was found to be $5,500; he was given judgment for this amount against Schwartz and was declared to have a lien for it upon the Milk River property of Schwartz in part payment for which he had transferred the ranch stock to Schwartz; and that lien was given priority over the $8,500 mortgage held by Guerin. In so far as that judgment established Tolley's claim against Schwartz and his lien for the amount thereof on the Milk River lots and buildings which Schwartz had agreed to sell to him, this judgment was not disturbed by the Appellate Division and is, therefore, res judicata. In so far as it gave priority to Tolley's lien over Guerin's mortgage, it was set aside, chiefly because Guerin had not given evidence at the trial before Walsh J., under a mistaken idea as to the question to be decided, and a new trial was directed solely to determine this issue[8]. The formal judgment of the Appellate Division contains this paragraph:\nThat there be a new trial before a judge without a jury to determine whether the respondent herein is entitled to priority over the mortgage of the appellant herein in respect of a charge for his judgment against the defendant Schwartz herein, for $5,500 against the following lands and premises registered in the name of the appellant, namely: All of Block 9 in the townsite of Milk River, according to a map or plan of record in the Land Titles Office for the South Alberta Land Registration District as Number 2227 Y, reserving unto the Crown all coal and unto the Alberta Irrigation Company all other minerals.\nAt the second trial[9], upon findings already sufficiently adverted to, Boyle J. upheld the priority of Tolley's lien over Guerin's mortgage but, no doubt inadvertently, included in it\nthe costs of this trial to be taxed under column 5, rule 27 not to apply; and the costs of the appeal to the Appelate Division of this Honourable Court, together with the costs awarded by the Honourable Mr. Justice Walsh at the former trial, as varied by the Appellate Division on the appeal.\nOn the second appeal this judgment was set aside by the Appellate Division, and the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs throughout, Mr. Justice Stuart and Mr. Justice Clarke dissenting[10]. Harvey C.J.A., with whom Hyndman J.A. concurred, without at all suggesting that the findings of the learned judge were open to question, allowed Guerin's appeal solely on the ground that when the transaction between Schwartz and Tolley had taken place The Bulk Sales Act in force was the statute of 1913, c. 10, as amended by c. 38, s. 1, of the statutes of 1919, whereas it had up to that time been erroneously assumed throughout that it was the statute of 1922 (R.S.A., 1922, c. 148) which governed. In the opinion of the learned Chief Justice the transaction between Schwartz and Tolley was not \"a sale for cash or on credit\" within the meaning of s. 2 of the statute of 1913, c. 10, He therefore concluded that the transaction involved no violation of that Act, that the seizure by Schwartz's creditors of the stock-in-trade which he had transferred to Tolley was indefensible and that Tolley's failure to prosecute his interpleader proceedings was the real cause of the loss suffered by him through being deprived of the Schwartz stock-in-trade. Beck J.A. wholly disagreed with the learned trial judge's findings of fact. The other members of the court, Stuart and Clarke JJ.A., as already stated, would have affirmed the judgment of Mr. Justice Boyle.\nAs the matter presents itself to us, it will not be necessary to express an opinion upon the application and effect of The Bulk Sales Act of 1913. Assuming, but without at all so deciding, that the view taken on these questions by the learned Chief Justice was correct, it is difficult to understand how Tolley's abandonment of his contest of the seizure by Schwartz's creditors affords any answer to his equitable claim against Guerin now under consideration. It may be that his failure to prosecute the contest of the seizure, if it were invalid, would have been so much the proximate cause of Tolley's loss that he would have had difficulty in maintaining an action for deceit. But different considerations govern the court when dealing as a court of equity with Tolley's equitable rights (Nocton v. Ashburton[11]), in regard to his purchaser's lien, (Rose v. Watson[12]), arising out of Guerin's fraud and breach of trust.\nThat Tolley had a purchaser's lien on the Milk River lots was established by the judgment at the first trial before Mr. Justice Walsh as against Guerin as well as against Schwartz. The only question left open on the new trial directed by the Appellate Division was Tolley's right to priority for that lien over Guerin's mortgage. It is unques- tionable in our opinion that Tolley was induced to enter into the transaction with Schwartz largely on the strength of Guerin's false statements that Schwartz was not indebted to the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank and by his consequent concealment of the charge or mortgage which he held on Schwartz's Milk River property as security for the indebtedness to the bank which actually existed. Had Guerin's statements been true Tolley would have found himself, when deprived of the greater part of the consideration he was to receive for the transfer of his property to Schwartz as a result of the seizure by Schwartz's creditors of the stock-in-trade, with a lien for the amount of his loss on the Milk River lots and buildings unencumbered by any prior charge. In fact, when he comes to assert his lien he finds registered against the property a mortgage for $8,500 in favour of Guerin. That, under such circumstances, whatever may have been the rights of Schwartz's creditors under The Bulk Sales Act, a court of equity should hold Guerin estopped from invoking his mortgage to the prejudice of Tolley's lien in our opinion admits of no question. Nor does the Land Titles Act enable Guerin to reap the benefit of his fraud and breach of trust. That statute has not denuded the courts of their equitable jurisdiction to compel persons unconscientiously asserting legal rights to do equity.\nOn this short ground we are of the opinion that the judgment of the trial judge declaring the priority of Tolley's lien must be restored. In view however of the terms of the judgment directing the new trial, the addition to the $5,500, for which the lien had been established by the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh, of the costs of the proceedings would appear to have been a mistake, which must now be rectified. With this modification the judgment of the learned trial judge (Boyle J.) will be restored.\nThe plaintiff should have his costs in this court and of the second appeal to the Appellate Division as well as the costs ordered by Mr. Justice Boyle to be paid by the defendants.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal arises out of a cause of action finally established by a judgment in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and out of a direction of that court, when so determining, to have an issue tried as therein directed, to determine the extent of relief to be granted as result thereof.\nI have considered the judgment of the Chief Justice herein and in the main agree therewith, and absolutely as to the conclusions he has reached.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 21 Alta.

It collided with a taxicab driven by W. Plaintiffs sued A. and W. At trial Meredith C.J.C.P., on the evidence held W. alone to blame. The Appellate Divisional Court, Ont., apparently without intending to disturb his findings of fact, took the view that on those findings, as they understood them, A. had also been guilty of negligence which contributed to the collision and should be held jointly liable with W. On appeal by A. to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, the Appellate Divisional Court appeared to have misapprehended the findings at the trial in certain important particulars; the evidence supported the trial judge\u2019s findings, and did not disclose negligence in A.\u2019s conduct. It might be that in an emergency he did not exercise the best possible judgment, but even that was doubtful; if there was any error on his part, it amounted, at the most, to an excusable mistake in judgment and did not involve any breach of duty owing to his passengers such as would predicate a failure to take that care which would have been \u201creasonable under all the circumstances,\u201d which is the test of the responsibility of one who undertakes the carriage of another gratuitously (Karavias v. Callinicos [1917] W.N. 323; Harris v. Perry & Co. [1903] 2 K.B. 219; the contention for some lower standard, argued as being implied in Nightingale v. Union Colliery Co., 35 Can. S.C.R. 65, rejected); and A.\u2019s appeal should be allowed. Idington J. dissented, holding that the evidence established such negligence in A.\u2019s conduct as made him jointly liable with W. for the damages suffered by plaintiffs.\nOn the question of this court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the appeal as against one of the plaintiffs (respondents), it was held that, if he had a cause of action it would be complete in itself and entirely distinct from that of his co-plaintiff; and in such a case the value of the matter in controversy on the appeal to this court, with regard to each individual respondent, must exceed the sum of $2,000 in order to give a right of appeal against him de plano. (\u201cL\u2019Autorit\u00e9\u201d Limit\u00e9e v. Ibbotson, 57 Can. S.C.R. 340).\nAPPEAL by the defendant Armand from the judgment of the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Meredith C.J., C.P., held said defendant jointly liable with the defendant Wilcox for damages suffered by the plaintiffs through an automobile collision. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nA.C. Heighington for the appellant.\nD.O. Cameron for the respondents Carr.\nC.R. Widdifield for the respondent Wilcox.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiffs were gratuitous passengers in an automobile owned and driven by the defendant Armand. While travelling easterly on the Toronto-Hamilton highway this automobile collided with a taxicab being driven westerly by the defendant Wilcox. The collision occurred at about 7.50 o\u2019clock on the evening of the 29th of October, 1924, at a point approximately three miles east of the town of Oakville. The plaintiffs, who were seriously injured, sued both Armand and Wilcox. The learned trial judge (Meredith C.J., C.P.) held that Wilcox was alone to blame for the collision and he assessed the damages of the plaintiff Fred Carr at $1,500 and those of the plaintiff Kitty Carr at $3,000. The Second Appellate Divisional Court (apparently without intending to disturb the findings of the trial judge) took the view that on those findings, as they understood them, the defendant Armand had also been guilty of negligence which contributed to the collision and therefore should be held jointly liable with Wilcox[2]. From this judgment Armand appeals. There is no appeal by Wilcox.\nThe view of the trial judge may be best appreciated; by reading the following extract from his judgment:\nI have now to determine whether either of these drivers was guilty of that negligence which gives a right of action. I am quite unable to see how Armand was guilty of negligence of that character. He was driving his car in a careful manner, not at an excessive rate of speed. Why should he be doing otherwise? He was in no great haste. He had a load that he would not desire to hurt, or run any risk of hurting. He is said to have been a careful driver, and he looks like a very intelligent, careful man.\nThe story is: That he was driving carefully along the road until the lights on Wilcox\u2019s car disturbed him. Those who drive cars know that such things do happen, and are very likely to happen. Then he did that which it seems to me a careful driver would do; he kept well on his own side of the road, so much so that he ran off the pavement on that side in doing so. That caused some bumping and occasioned an outcry of one of the occupants of the car, and then he did that which was quite proper in all the circumstances of the case; he came back upon the paved portion of the highway gradually. He seems to have come back in a careful way; he did not make a sudden turn so as to bring him on the road abruptly, but he came carefully along. It is evident if he had turned on the road abruptly and run across his half of it he might put those who might be coming along the other side of the road in danger. On coming back wholly upon the pavement he seems to have gone as far as the middle of the road; he probably crossed the middle line of the pavement a foot or so. That was what would ordinarily happen with a man proceeding as carefully as he was. When that was accomplished he proceeded towards his right and he was then driven that way more so by Wilcox\u2019s approach. He and the man with him\u2014Carr\u2014saw Wilcox\u2019s car bearing down upon him; and he was well over off Wilcox\u2019s side of the road when Wilcox\u2019s car ran into his. That is what happened. How can Armand be blamed for anything in that? That story is what one would naturally expect; there is nothing unusual about it; and that story is in exact accord with the testimony of the gentleman who saw the cars immediately after the accident, a man who is connected with some Collegiate Institute in Toronto, a very competent and trustworthy-witness, whose testimony is altogether in favour of Armand, and against Wilcox.\nWhat is there on the other side? Several witnesses who swear that from their first view of Armand\u2019s car Armand was driving in what I may describe as a wild manner, going from one side of the road to the other. Is that believable? If it is, let those believe it who may; I cannot. Unless the man had lost his memory and mind some time before this accident, it could not have happened; and if he had he would not be to blame for it. But it did not happen, and the only wobbling, the only turn, was that to which I referred, and which in no way interfered with Wilcox\u2019s rights on the road.\nWhat about Wilcox? It is manifest he was proceeding at an excessive rate of speed. It does not seem to be unusual with some taxi drivers, especially at that time of night, anxious to get back home. He passed the schoolmaster\u2019s car, and got out of sight of it in a very short time\u2014the schoolmaster\u2019s car going at about twenty-one miles an hour. That was negligent, but would not give a right of action unless it caused an injury. It casts more doubt upon the testimony of the witnesses for Wilcox and Wilcox (sic), and it tends to make it plain to my mind that the accident happened as described by Armand and his witnesses. Armand gave some testimony upon his examination for discovery and that all seemed to me to be quite in accord with the view of the case which I have taken. At one time it seemed as if there might be a conflict of testimony between the two women who gave testimony on behalf of Armand; though one indeed was formally making a claim against him; but it may all be quite consistent. The young woman, Mrs. Grinham, does not remember having shouted, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d but no doubt she said that when Armand was partly off the pavement on his own side. I see nothing inconsistent in the testimony of these two women. And Carr, although suing Armand as well as Wilcox, gave his testimony in a fair way, and was in a position to see, and did know, just what did happen. What did happen was this: Wilcox bore down on Armand at a great rate of speed and was over the centre line of the road. He had abundance of room to pass upon his own side at any rate of speed. A great weight of the credible evidence proves that as also does the position of the cars after the accident.\nI was unfavourably impressed, as to credibility, by Wilcox and his witnesses. His own story, indeed, seemed to be so improbable as to reach the impossible; his speed was about five miles an hour, and he could have stopped in a distance of three or four feet. Armand\u2019s car did not run into his, but slued\u2014on a dry pavement and struck broadside, and yet his car was so smashed as to need about $1,000 worth of repairs, including a new chassis-frame and a new axle; and Armand\u2019s car was almost destroyed\u2014four persons almost killed\u2014two crippled badly for life.\nI am therefore obliged to find that Wilcox is answerable for all damages that were sustained.\nThe opinion of the Appellate Divisional Court was delivered by Mr. Justice Fisher. The grounds on which the reversal of the judgment in favour of Armand was based cannot be better stated than by quoting them from his opinion: * * * The learned Chief Justice found Wilcox who was driving the car guilty of negligence and added that \u201cI was unfavourably impressed as to credibility by Wilcox and his witnesses.\u201d\nUpon a careful perusal of the evidence I am of the opinion these findings were fully warranted and should not be disturbed. The learned trial judge found Armand was driving carefully, not at an excessive rate of speed, but because the lights of Wilcox\u2019s car disturbed or confused him, he first ran part of his car off the pavement to the south and then returned to the pavement and proceeded as far as a foot beyond the middle of the pavement, and that whilst he was attempting to turn again to the south, Wilcox ran into him on that side of the highway and did the damage complained of. The result of all the evidence as I View it, is: had Armand kept his car in the position he had it off the pavement and not attempted to turn against and on to the pavement which was about four inches high, and that if Wilcox had been travelling at a moderate rate of speed instead of at an excessive rate of speed, as found by the learned trial judge, the accident would not have happened. If it was the speed and lights of Wilcox\u2019s car that caused Armand to turn off the pavement, then the question to be asked is, why did he return again to and beyond the middle of the pavement before Wilcox had passed? Had he remained off the pavement the accident would not have happened. He turned off the pavement so as to avoid what appeared to him danger and then almost immediately again turned into the path of that danger. These acts of Armand, in my opinion, constituted negligence on his part and that negligence entered into and cooperated with the negligence of Wilcox.\nWith the greatest respect to the learned Chief Justice that (sic), these acts of Armand, which he seemed to think were proper, were in my opinion clearly improper and negligent acts, and but for their commission the accident would not have happened. Both Wilcox and Armand were therefore guilty of negligence.\nIn my opinion, a driver of an automobile, going at the rate of eighteen to twenty miles per hour, with the wheels on one side off the pavement and sunken four inches below it, with confusing headlights from an approaching automobile, turns his car out of the sunken running rut at that rate of speed on the pavement and in the direction and path of an oncoming car, is guilty of a degree of negligence which disentitles him, if an accident occurs and action follows, to the recovery of damages. The driver in such circumstances should either have continued with his right wheels off the pavement (in this case he could have without danger or difficulty) or, if that appeared to him dangerous or impracticable, his plain duty was then to have stopped.\nThe learned appellate judge would appear to have misapprehended the findings at the trial in three important particulars. He says that \u201che (Armand) turned off the pavement so as to avoid what appeared to him to be danger\u201d (i.e., presumably purposely). A few sentences earlier, more in accord with the view taken by the trial judge, he had said: \u201cBecause the lights of Wilcox\u2019s car disturbed or confused him, he first ran part of his car off the pavement to the south\u201d (i.e., probably unintention- ally). The learned Chief Justice had found that \u201cthe lights on Wilcox\u2019s car disturbed him (Armand) * * * he kept well on his own side of the road, so much so that he ran off the pavement on that side in doing so\u201d (i.e., accidentally).\nAgain the learned appellate judge says that Armand\u2019s car was struck \u201cwhilst he was attempting to turn again to the south,\u201d i.e., before he had regained his own side of the pavement. The learned trial judge found expressly that Armand \u201cwas well over off Wilcox\u2019s side of the road when Wilcox\u2019s car ran into his. That is what happened.\u201d\nMr. Justice Fisher also expressed the view that Armand in turning back on to the pavement passed \u201cinto the direction and path of an oncoming car\u201d (Wilcox\u2019s). The learned trial judge found that \u201cthe only turn\u201d made by Armand \u201cin no way interfered with Wilcox\u2019s rights on the road.\u201d\nWhile the stories told by the passengers in Wilcox\u2019s car as to Armand\u2019s course and Wilcox\u2019s position on the road no doubt point to a different conclusion, the testimony of the two plaintiffs and the corroboration of it afforded by the actual situs and relative position of the two cars as they were found by the two witnesses Reid and Charington, who were wholly disinterested, fully supports the findings made by the learned trial judge in all particulars. Indeed, as already stated, we do not understand that Mr. Justice Fisher meant to differ from Mr. Chief Justice Meredith upon any question of fact.\nWhen confronted with the glare of the headlights of the Wilcox car, Armand, although he was then on his own side of the road, did a prudent thing in turning still farther to the right. That in doing so he accidentally allowed his right wheels to slip over the edge of the pavement is not at all surprising when the blinding and confusing effect of the approaching glaring headlights is taken into account. It certainly does not bespeak negligence. Armand then found himself in a very difficult position. His right wheels were on the gravelled sideway about four inches below the level of the road and so rough that one of the two women passengers cried out in alarm. To his right, and quite close, was a ditch guarded by a fence. Having regard to what subsequently occurred Armand would no doubt have been well advised had he tried to stop his car even at the risk of crashing into the fence and possibly of landing it in the ditch. What he did, as found by the learned trial judge, was to slow down somewhat and come\nback on the paved portion of the highway gradually. He seems to have come back in a careful way. He did not make a sudden turn so as to bring him on to the road abruptly, but he came carefully along.\nWhether in executing this manoeuvre any part of Armand\u2019s car ever crossed the centre line of the road is extremely doubtful. The learned trial judge says it \u201cprobably did a foot or so.\u201d The plaintiff Fred Carr, who deposes to this fact, says \u201che (Armand) came to about the centre of the road\u2014it might have been a foot over, never more than a foot\u201d and \u201che swerved back again to his own side,\u201d so much so that Fred Carr feared he would certainly collide head on with the fence which ran along the right hand side of the road at this point.\nWith the utmost respect we do not discern any negligence or fault in what Armand did. It may be that in an emergency he did not exercise the best possible judgment in returning to the pavement; but even that is at least doubtful. If there was any error on his part, it certainly amounted, at the most, to nothing more than an excusable mistake in judgment and did not involve any breach of duty owing to his passengers such as would predicate a failure to take that care which would have been \u201creasonable under all the circumstances.\u201d We regard this as the test of the responsibility of one who undertakes the carriage of another gratuitously\u2014Karavias v. Callinicos[3]; Harris v. Perry & Co.[4]\u2014rather than some lower standard, which counsel for the appellant argued is implied in the decision of this court in Nightingale v. Union Colliery Co.[5].\nFor these reasons we think the judgment of the trial judge should not have been disturbed. The appeal as against Kitty Carr will accordingly be allowed with costs.\nThe defendant Wilcox, although but slightly interested, was made a respondent to this appeal. He did not file a factum but appeared by counsel and supported the judgment against Armand. The costs of Armand, however, were not thereby increased and the costs awarded him should be payable only by any respondent whose judgment against him is set aside.\nThe question of the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the appeal so far as concerns the claim of Fred Carr, who was awarded $1,500 damages, was brought to the attention of counsel at the conclusion of the argument and they were heard upon it. It is perfectly clear that if Fred Carr has a cause of action it is complete in itself and entirely distinct from that of his co-plaintiff Kitty Carr, and it is equally clear that in such a case the value of the matter in controversy on the appeal with regard to each individual respondent must exceed the sum of $2,000 in order to give a right of appeal against him de plano. \u201cL\u2019Autorit\u00e9\u201d Limit\u00e9e v. Ibbotson[6].\nOn Friday last, the 11th of June, however, the Appellate Divisional Court on the application of Armand made an order extending the time for an appeal by him as against Fred Carr and granting special leave for that appeal. The order of the court has been duly filed and we may treat this appeal as properly before us.\nNo distinction can be made between the cases of Kitty Carr and Fred Carr and the appeal from the judgment in favour of Fred Carr will therefore also be allowed.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is one of three actions arising cut of a collision between two automobiles on the highway from Toronto to Hamilton, running through Oakville.\nThis action was brought by the plaintiffs, now respondents, Fred Carr and Kitty Carr, against the respective drivers of each automobile.\nThe learned trial judge directed them to be tried together before him without a jury. The counsel for respondents\u2014the Carrs\u2014who were plaintiffs in this case, wished the jury to be retained, but some other counsel in the other cases preferred dispensing with the jury. They were by no means unanimously in favour of trying them together.\nI respectfully submit the doing so has been, I imagine, the source of much confusion and omissions as will appear later to clear up several points. The other actions are, so far as appears, disposed of either by the learned trial judge or the Second Divisional Court for Ontario.\nThe appellant Armand owned a Dodge sedan and offered the Carrs (now respondents herein) and other friends a free ride from Oakville to Toronto on the night of the 29th of October, 1924.\nThe respondent Wilcox was a taxi driver, living in Galt, who owned a Studebaker Special, and drove it from Galt to Toronto by way of other highways connecting with above-mentioned highway at Bronte, and thence to Toronto, having, on the occasion in question, a number of ladies resident in Galt, as paying passengers, and, on said night they were returning home with him in said car.\nThe plaintiffs, the said Fred and Kitty Carr, now respondents, are husband and wife but had seperate claims for their personal damages which each had respectively suffered in said collision.\nThe appellant Armand started with his passengers from Oakville between seven and eight o\u2019clock on said evening, to attend a concert to take place in Toronto at nine o\u2019clock on said evening. And when, according to some witnesses, three or four miles from Oakville, they saw the other respondent\u2019s car with his passengers, coming westerly and carrying a bright light as usual when darkness had come on. All seem agreed it was a dark night. Some one of the passengers in Armand\u2019s car cried out: \u201cSee that car coming,\u201d or words to that effect, referring to Wilcox\u2019s car. Armand was driving his own car and simply said thereupon \u201cThat damned light,\u201d evidently disturbed by its brilliance. He immediately turned, from being near the centre of the concrete paved part of the highway, to the right hand and got his car over, not only the said concrete-paved part but also a strip three feet wide which runs alongside of the concrete pavement and is made of macadam or gravel, and is solid and travellable so far as so constructed, till it meets the grass or ordinary soil, and his two right hand side wheels sank some four inches into the said soil. And then, apparently because one of his lady passengers called out \u201cGus, where are you going,\u201d he turned back again across the said strip and the concrete-paved part of the highway till he had got a foot beyond the centre line of the concrete pavement, and then turned back to the right, and the respondent Wilcox, driving his car, struck it against the rear part of Armand\u2019s car. I shall presently deal more at length with the actual situation thus created. Meantime I wish to say that the result was a considerable damage to each car and very serious damage to Armand and to all the passengers in his car, to which I am about to refer more in detail.\nAmongst those so injured are the respondents Fred and Kitty Carr, who have sued herein the appellant, and respondent Wilcox. The appellant Armand was thrown from his seat on to the highway and was so injured as to become unconscious and to remain so for a week. His memory has so failed him that he cannot remember anything that so transpired and can give no explanation of his pursuing such an erratic course of conduct in driving his car, when facing a very obvious danger.\nThe appellant, Fred Carr, who was sitting in the front seat with Armand and was, I assume (using common knowledge as well as having regard to what he says) on the right hand side of the car, testifies that he was reading the speedometer and it shewed they were running at a twenty-one mile rate of speed until after the slumping over the solid strip which I have referred to, with the two right side wheels sinking four inches, and then, on turning back across the pavement, Armand lowered his rate of speed to eighteen miles an hour, until the collision took place, or a possible stoppage I am about to refer to.\nThe other car driven by Wilcox, when first seen was a distance of some two hundred yards ahead according to some witnesses, and according to others, about one hundred yards. And, it is practically admitted, it had been, when first seen, travelling at, probably, a twenty-five mile rate of speed, if not more.\nThe question raised herein is whether appellant in pursuing such a course of conduct as I have outlined was so negligent as to be held jointly liable with Wilcox for the damages suffered by the plaintiffs, the Carrs, now two of the respondents, by reason of the collision, or for part thereof.\nThe evidence of Fred Carr, to which I wish to call special attention, is as follows: Q. You are one of the plaintiffs?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You were in the car the night of the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You remember the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Tell us what happened just before the accident?\u2014A. Well, we saw some bright lights approaching over the brow of the hill about two hundred yards ahead. Mr. Armand said, \u201cDamn those lights, they are bright,\u201d and pulled over to the side of the road and he dropped off the pavement.\nQ. How much of his car was off the pavement?\u2014A. Both wheels were off.\nQ. Both right hand wheels?\u2014A. Both outside wheels.\nQ. Prior to getting off the pavement at what rate was he driving?\u2014A. Twenty-one miles.\nQ. How do you know?\u2014A. I was watching the speedometer.\nQ. You were sitting with him, and that is the rate he was driving?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When he went off the pavement?\u2014A. 21 miles.\nQ. When he went off the pavement what happened?\u2014A. We ran along for a few yards off the pavement.\nQ. Was it rough there?\u2014A. Fairly rough.\nQ. What speed was he going at while running with the two right hand wheels off the pavement?\u2014A. 21, but he slowed down to 18 as we came on again.\nQ. Did it have any effect on the car?\u2014A. Yes, caused us to bump up and down some.\nQ. Did he get on to the pavement again?\u2014A. Yes, he came right over on the pavement.\nQ. How far did he get over?\u2014A. A little over the centre.\nQ. What happened then?\u2014A. He swerved back again to his own side.\nQ. What happened next?\u2014A. Well, I saw another car approaching, the same car that had bright lights, it seemed to come on us, and I spoke to Mr. Armand and he turned out. I was afraid we were going to have a collision with the fence, and put up my feet to avoid it.\nQ. A white fence?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What did Armand do?\u2014A. He shut off his engine and put on his brakes at the same time.\nA. At the moment of the collision in what position was Armand\u2019s car?\u2014A. Heading a little towards our own side.\nQ. What angle with the edge of the pavement?\u2014A. I couldn\u2019t quite tell you the angle.\nQ. If it is half way it is 45?\u2014A. About 45.\nQ. Facing what way?\u2014A. Towards the lake.\nQ. And?\u2014A. He shut off his engine.\nQ. Facing in an easterly or westerly direction?\u2014A. Easterly direction.\nQ. About 45 degrees at an angle facing easterly?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What happened then?\u2014A. I don\u2019t remember anything that happened.\nQ. Did you hear a crash?\u2014A. No.\n* * *\nQ. When you were running off the pavement was there anybody said or did anything?\u2014A. Well, Mrs. Grinham certainly screamed at that time. Mr. HEIGHINGTON: Is that evidence?\nHis LORDSHIP: Evidence that she screamed.\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. HEIGHINGTON\nQ. When did she scream?\u2014A. Screamed about the time we swerved, or about that time.\nQ. Did she say anything?\u2014A. Yes, she called out, \u201cGus, Gus, what are you doing.\u201d\n* * *\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. BRACKEN\nQ. Do I understand at the time of the accident the Armand car, the front of it, was facing toward the lake?\u2014A. East and toward the lake. Easterly direction and towards the lake.\nQ. It was the rear that was struck?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you spoke about him swerving a moment ago. Was that swerve off the pavement to the south?\u2014A. On to the pavement and back to the south.\nQ. After he got off he swerved on to the pavement?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And he went over the centre line?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When he would go off to the south he would have to swerve back again?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. It was just when he swerved up on to the pavement and got over the centre line, it was then he saw the other car?\u2014A. I say the other car seemed\u2014\nQ. Let me read you a question from the examination for discovery. Question 13: \u201cWill you just tell me as briefly as you can what took place that night in reference to the accident in your own words?\u2014A. Well, we travelled about to the Gooderham farm\u2014I don\u2019t know how far that is from Oakville\u2014it might be five miles\u2014I never measured the distance\u2014when we approached the Gooderham farm there was a car on the brow of the hill with very bright lights, and Mr. Armand made the remark to me that the lights were bright, and they were bright\u2014he said, \u2018Damn the lights,\u2019 that is exactly what he said, and he pulled over to his own side of the road, and he ran off the pavement.\n\u201c14. Q. One side of the car?\u2014A. Yes, one side was right off the pavement\u2014he turned over on to the pavement\u2014he came up to about the centre of the road\u2014it might have been a foot over\u2014never more than a foot, and then he turned his head a little that way (indicating), getting squared up again, and I instantly said, \u2018Christ, the man is coming right at us,\u2019 and he turned further over towards the fence, and I put my foot off to avoid the collision with the fence\u2014I thought we were going to have a head-on collision with the fence, and I braced myself, and I don\u2019t remember anything more after that.\u201d\u2014A. In my examination I told the stenographer that he shut his engine off and put on his brakes.\nQ. The point I want to get at is this: What happened, as I understand your story, is that he got off the pavement and swerved on over the centre and then when he looked out you called out about the car and the car was coming right down the road?\u2014A. No, when I called out about the car it appeared to be coming straight on us.\nQ. Any reason why he should come straight on you?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Anything you saw?\u2014A. No.\nQ. When that situation arose Mr. Armand\u2019s car would be pointing east and north when he got it over the centre?\u2014A. That I couldn\u2019t say. Q. He went about a foot over the centre?\u2014A. He would not be a foot east and north.\nQ. Which way?\u2014A. East.\nQ. Then at any rate whether it was north and east or where it was, it was over the centre, and when you spoke of the lights of the oncoming car\u2014. A. I said in a monotone under my breath\u2014I would not excite anybody driving.\nHis LORDSHIP: Don\u2019t you mean south and east?\u2014A. He swerved to the right.\nHis LORDSHIP: He went south and east after that?\nMr. BRACKEN: And he turned further over towards the fence.\nQ. He swerved the car to his right?\u2014A. To his own side of the road.\nQ. The front of the car would be pointing towards the lake?\u2014A. Lake and east.\nQ. At that moment the other car struck you in the rear?\u2014A. Yes.\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. HEIGHINGTON\nQ. I believe you said in your examination for discovery, Mr. Carr, that if Mr. Armand went at all over the centre of the road after he turned off the concrete it was very slightly he went over.\nHis LORDSHIP: He said if at all. The witness I understood to say he came well back on to his own side before he was struck?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. HEIGHINGTON: Q. Do you remember my asking you this question: \u201cHow do you know Mr. Armand went over the centre of the road?\u2014A. In watching things you can see very quickly when there is about two feet of pavement this side\u2014you know very well that you are travelling here (indicating with hand), you know that you are\u2014when you see about two feet of pavement from my side of the car.\u201d That is the right hand side?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You could see two feet of pavement, is that right?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Which side did you see it?\u2014A. My right hand side.\nThe concrete pavement on the said highway is only eighteen feet wide. The strip on each side, macadam or gravel, is three feet, thus making the entire width of the travellable part twenty-four feet.\nWhen the appellant for the first time and before his zigzagging turned to the right side, apparently to get out of the way of the respondent Wilcox coming at such a rate about two hundred yards distant, he did a prudent thing, and, as the Appellate Division held in reversing the judgment of the learned trial judge, had he remained there, to the plaintiffs, now respondents herein.\nBut by returning back and across the centre line of the concrete pavement, he did, in my opinion, a most reckless and unjustifiable thing and thereby rendered himself liable to the plaintics, now respondents herein.\nAnd assuming that he immediately turned with a view to go back to his own side of the highway, can anyone understand why he shut off his engine and put on his brakes at the same time, instead of moving out of the way of the oncoming Wilcox car?\nSome people imagine that if they get on to their own side of the centre line, they can allow any wild driver to run them down, and smash their car, and the passengers therein, without being liable in any way.\nThat, I submit, is not the law; in law the driver is bound to use all reasonable care to protect his passengers against the possibilities of injury at the hands of clearly approaching danger, whether of a wild, reckless driver, or other similar source of danger.\nMr. Carr says he cannot remember anything after Armand shut off his engine and put on his brakes. He seems net to have been asked whether the car he was in moved, or instantly stopped. I suspect it is quite possible that appellant Armand\u2019s sudden halting stop helped, and probably was the entire cause of himself and others being thrown out of the car, as they were. I shall presently refer further to this peculiar feature of this case.\nI cannot understand why, in all these movements, no warning was given by appellant, such as usually is given when such signs of approaching danger appear. I assume there was none or we should have heard of it.\nI must say that a perusal of the entire evidence in this case does not convince me that the appellant\u2019s car only crossed the centre line of the highway by a foot, as Mr. Carr testifies to. I certainly do not think or suspect for an instant that he knowingly errs, but the best of mankind make grave mistakes in their estimates under even less favourable circumstances than here. The night was dark. There is no evidence of any painted line such as sometimes is put in the centre of the road to indicate to travellers just where they are. If this concrete pavement had no such mark, such as I refer to, I fail to see how it was possible to form an accurate sort of judgment of measurement.\nI have read many times the quotation from his examination for discovery presented to him by counsel for appellant, and copied in the foregoing part I have quoted, but cannot satisfactorily understand how \u201cseeing about two feet of pavement from my side of the car\u201d helps to accuracy. I shall presently advert to that situation but wish first to present my view of the result of the evidence given by the respondent Fred Carr as to the shutting off by Armand of the engine and applying the brakes thereto.\nThe probabilities of such abrupt action are, that the car suddenly stopped, and in consequence thereof, when going at eighteen miles an hour, the shock therefrom was such\u2014quite independently of the collision\u2014as to throw, as I submit it did, everyone therein, out on to the highway, and hence their very serious injuries, except in the case of Mrs. Grinham.\nOn the other hand nobody was thrown out of the Studebaker Special, driven by respondent Wilcox which carried the same number of passengers as appellant\u2019s car and struck with its left front spring and penetrated the left hind wheel of the Armand car.\nTo demonstrate what I thus submit, I must quote from the respective witnesses each car carried, so far as able to speak thereto. Taking those in appellant\u2019s car first, I may point to what I have already said, that Armand, the appellant, was thrown out on to the highway, and so seriously injured as to be unable at the trial to recall anything that happened for some time before the accident.\nHis wife was thrown out on to the highway and so seriously injured that she could not be a witness at the trial, and we were told by counsel at the hearing hereof that she had since died. Dr. Wilson, who had attended her, told such a story of her injuries that anyone hearing it should not be surprised at such a result.\nMr. Fred Carr, one of the respondents quoted above, was thrown from the car on to the highway and seriously injured.\nMrs. Carr, his wife, who was also thrown from the car and seriously injured, tells, amongst other things, the following:\nQ. Where were you sitting?\u2014A. In the centre of the back seat.\nQ. Who was sitting with you?\u2014A. Mrs. Armand on my left and Mrs. Grinham on my right.\nQ. Who was in front?\u2014A. Mr. Carr and Mr. Armand.\nQ. Who was driving?\u2014A. Mr. Armand.\nQ. What kind of car is it?\u2014A. It was a Dodge car.\nQ. Dodge Sedan?\u2014A. I think so.\nQ. What do you remember just prior to the accident happening? Where did the accident happen?\u2014A. I think we had been driving about ten minutes, then the car lurched about apparently and there was a crash.\nQ. What car?\u2014A. Ours.\nQ. The car you were in?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What happened after that?\u2014A. Then there was a crash.\nQ. What do you mean by lurching about?\u2014A. It seemed to pitch from side to side, I think, for a second or so.\nQ. Then came the crash?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did you know any more?\u2014A. The next I remember I was lying on the road with Mrs. Armand.\nHis LORDSHIP: I did not get how long this pitch lasted?\u2014A. A few seconds.\nMr. CAMERON: And then you say shortly afterward the crash came?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Do you know anything about that, how it was caused or anything?\u2014A. I could not say at all. I was sitting in the centre of the back; I was not looking at the road.\nHis LORDSHIP: Did you observe anything extraordinary or out of the way before you felt this pitch?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Seemed to be running smooth for ten or fifteen minutes?\u2014A. Yes, perfectly all right.\nMr. CAMERON: Were there any exclamations made by anybody at the time?\u2014A. Yes, Mrs. Grinham screamed.\nQ. She was sitting in the back seat with you?\u2014A. On my right.\nQ. When this lurching started she exclaimed something?\u2014A. She said \u201cGus, where are you going?\u201d\n* * *\nMr. CAMERON: What did she say?\u2014A. \u201cGus, where are you going?\u201d\nQ. Who was Gus?\u2014A. Mr. Armand.\nQ. Then the crash came. After the crash you found yourself where?\u2014A. Lying on the road with Mrs. Armand between the cars.\nQ. You and Mrs. Armand?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In what position were you?\u2014A. I was lying with my head and shoulders on Mrs. Armand.\nHis LORDSHIP: Is it at all material?\nThen Mrs. Grinham testifies as follows:\nMr. HEIGHINGTON: You are one of the fortunate ones?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You were sitting on the right hand side of the car?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. The impact took place on the left?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Now just before the accident can you tell us how Mr. Armand was proceeding in this car and what side of the road he was on?\u2014A. We were on our proper side and seemed to be going perfectly, I think, and I mind, I thought I asked Mr. Armand to go a little faster and he refused to do so. I said, \u201cHow are you feeling to-night?\u201d and he said \u201cFine,\u201d and just then a car came along, and I said \u201cWhat awful headlights,\u201d and Mr. Armand said \u201cYes.\u201d I don\u2019t remember any more after that.\n* * *\nMr. HEIGHINGTON: Did anything else happen?\u2014A. Nothing else happened. We seemed to be going along perfectly, I think, but I was unconscious for about five minutes after the accident, and it seemed to me everything was perfectly safe.\n* * * Q. Now after the accident you were the only one that was\u2014A. Conscious.\nQ. Did you observe yourself the position of the two motor cars on the road?\u2014A. I did.\nQ. Will you tell His Lordship how you found them?\u2014A. Our car was going straight for Toronto, and it looked as if it had been stopped there.\nQ. How close to the north side, the south side of the concrete road, the right hand side?\u2014A. When I got out?\nQ. You were sitting on the road?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You got out of the door?\u2014A. I was thrown.\nQ. From the back into the front?\u2014A. Yes, Mr. Carr was on top of me.\nQ. You had been sitting on the right hand side of the rear seat?\u2014A. Yes.\nSuch are the stories of what happened those in the appellant\u2019s car.\nWilcox in his Studebaker Special had four passengers. Let us turn to the stories given respectively by these passengers.\nJeannette Graham says:\nQ. On what side of the road was Mr. Wilcox\u2019s car at the time?\u2014A. Right side.\nQ. Did you get out of the car?\u2014A. After Mrs. Pollock got out. Q. Which side did you get out of?\u2014A. Left hand side.\nEvidently she was not thrown out.\nMrs. Margaret Pollock, another of said passengers in the Wilcox car, says:\nQ. By reason of something your daughter said you looked?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. When you looked ahead what did you see?\u2014A. I saw a car coming along zigzagging on the highway. The last turn it gave it came straight down, and I seen it make one turn.\nQ. Zigzagging and one straight turn?\u2014A. Yes, and came right straight on to us, as if it was coming straight on to us.\nQ. When it seemed it was coming straight on to you what side of the road was Mr. Wilcox\u2019s car on?\u2014A. On his right side.\nQ. What happened?\u2014A. The care before it came on to us, gave a turn in from the road facing us, and they switched around.\nQ. Then what happened?\u2014A. The two cars knocked together.\nQ. Did you get out of the car afterwards?\u2014A. I was the first one to get out.\nQ. Did you notice how the rear of Mr. Wilcox\u2019s car stood with reference to the side of the road, the right hand side of the pavement when you got out?\u2014A. Yes, sir. I got out the right hand door. I couldn\u2019t get out the left hand door, as Mr. Armand was lying opposite the left door, and I had to get out the other side.\nQ. The right hand side, close to the ditch?\u2014A. Yes, I had to go around. The right hand wheel of his car was not very many inches from the grass.\nHis LORDSHIP: Front or hind?\u2014A. Right hand back wheel.\nMr. BRACKEN: Did you go over to the Armand car?\u2014A. Yes, sir. Q. Did you pass around it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Back or front?\u2014A. The front. It was straight across, practically straight across the highway.\nQ. Facing the lake?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You went around the front?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In going around the front was it necessary to go off the pavement to get around the front?\u2014A. No, they had about three feet from that side. You could get about three feet to go around.\nQ. Then whom did you see first? Did you see Mr. Carr there?\u2014A. I saw Mr. Carr.\nQ. Did you speak to Mr. Carr?\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. What did you say to Mr. Carr?\u2014A. I asked if he was the one who was driving the car, and he said \u201cNo.\u201d I asked him\u2014I said that was an awful thing what happened, and he said he guessed the man lost his head.\nHis LORDSHIP: He did not say which man?\u2014A. He told me the man\u2014I mean\u2014\nQ. Tell me his words?\u2014A. He said, \u201cI suppose he lost his head.\u201d\nQ. You took it to be the other man?\u2014A. He said, \u201cThe man on the ground.\u201d\nMr. BRACKEN: You did not tell us that before. Tell us again what words he said exactly.\u2014A. I asked Mr. Carr if you are the man who was driving the car. He said, \u201cNo, it was this man here,\u201d pointing to Mr. Armand, and Mr. Armand was there, and I said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d and he said, \u201cI suppose he lost his head.\u201d\nQ. You took that to mean Mr. Armand?\u2014A. Yes, I knew it was. That is what he said, and he pointed to him.\nQ. Why did you not tell us that the first time. You are not impressing His Lordship very favourably.\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. CAMERON\nQ. Did you say you passed on the pavement around the Armand car without going off on the grass?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. How far from the front to the south side of the pavement?\u2014A. About three feet.\nQ. You are sure you spoke to Carr?\u2014A. Quite sure.\nQ. He said Armand lost his head?\u2014A. Yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: Was anyone in the car you were in hurt?\u2014A. I had my hand hurt and a rib broken.\nQ. Still you were able to get out and walk around the car and hear what was said?\u2014A. I was always going around; I was never in bed. My eye was just blackened.\nMiss Margaret Pollock says:\nMr. BRACKEN: Prior to the accident did anything unusual attract your attention.\u2014A. Yes, sir.\nQ. Where was it?\u2014A. The lights of a car coming and going on the opposite side of the road, and then he turned back to his own side and came back again to our side, and it looked like a head-on collision, and he swerved around.\nQ. It looked like a head-on collision?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And then what did he do?\u2014A. The car swerved around, and the back left of his car hit the front left of our car.\nQ. Were you injured at all?\u2014A. I was bruised. Q. Did you get out of the car after the accident?\u2014A. Yes. Q. You saw the situation as it was then?\u2014A. Yes.\nMrs. Walker, the only other passenger in said Wilcox car, testifies as follows:\nQ. When Miss Pollock called out and you looked ahead, can you give me any idea at that time how fast Wilcox\u2019s car was going?\u2014A. I know he had slowed down when she said that.\nQ. What happened to you?\u2014A. I don\u2019t know. I was in the back seat. When I woke up I was lying in the bottom of the car. I didn\u2019t know any more.\nQ. What injuries did you suffer?\u2014A. One wrist broken and one badly sprained.\nEvidently nothing more serious than a broken wrist and the other sprained, for her doctor\u2019s bill was only $9.50.\nCompare this recital of the injuries those in the Wilcox car suffered, with those suffered by the occupants of the appellant\u2019s car, and I submit that, though these circumstances (thus truthfully portrayed and not contradicted or otherwise explained) were lost sight of at the trial, I am fully justified in, with great respect, coming to the conclusion that the learned trial judge seriously erred in his appreciation of the facts in overlooking what I have called attention to.\nI submit that the driver and passengers thrown from appellant\u2019s car and so most seriously injured, as they were, could not have resulted only and alone from the shock received from the blow of the Wilcox car.\nIt was, again with all due respect, too hastily assumed by the learned trial judge that the Wilcox car, coming with such an excessive rate of speed, could alone produce the results that followed to those in appellant\u2019s car.\nI am quite free to admit that at the argument herein I had, from reading the judgment of the learned trial judge and briefly glancing at the judgments on behalf of the Second Appellate Division, come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons assigned below, yet that it was highly probable Wilcox had been travelling at such an excessive rate of speed as possibly to account for the force of the collision alone producing such lamentable results. No other cause was suggested.\nAnother thing I felt was that Wilcox\u2019s story of having slowed down to a five-mile rate and being able to stop within a few feet could not be true. Hence, although decidedly of opinion that the Second Appellate Division was right for the reasons assigned by it, yet I felt, from what had happened, the majority of the court likely to take the other view and I must read, as usual when dissenting on mere matter of fact, the entire relevant evidence, and read, accordingly, the whole evidence. And in doing so I was startled to find that abrupt stoppage by appellant of his car at the critical moment in question, and that in all probability Wilcox, as sworn to by himself and others, had, on seeing the zigzag motion, slowed down to a comparatively slow rate, else he and his passengers, or some of them, would have been thrown out. I still think he cannot have got down to a five-mile rate. But certainly there are actual grave reasons, arising from the comparison of results, for rejecting the theory accepted at the hearing hereof that any such high rate of speed as suggested then, had been kept up to the time of the collision. For my part I was partly led to believe it by reason of the remarks of the learned trial judge discrediting not only Wilcox but also his four passengers.\nA perusal of the evidence of the latter leads me to say I can find no reason for doing so, when they, or some of them, say what is doubted, I think they are quite right in describing the movements of Armand\u2019s car as \u201czigzag\u201d and that Wilcox\u2019s attention was drawn to it and his rate slowed down as result.\nBut when it comes to describing the actual collision there is some doubt as to their accuracy; not from any desire to excuse Wilcox but from mental excitement rendering it impossible to observe accurately all that happened.\nFor example Mrs. Grinham is led by counsel thus\u2014after telling of seeing the headlight, and hearing that someone said something answered by Armand thus:\nAnd Mr. Armand said \u201cYes.\u201d I don\u2019t remember any more after that.\nThen counsel says:\nQ. What headlights were those?\u2014A. Coming towards us.\nQ. Was there a crash?\u2014A. Yes, almost instantly.\nEvidently incorrect if we bear in mind what others, such as Mr. Fred Carr, tell us as quoted above. There is too much of that sort of thing in this case. I therefore submit we must try if we can and get seized of such salient predominating facts, such as I have, in trying to ascertain the reason for the widely different results I have just referred to, arising from the shock of the collision.\nI submit it is quite clear that the Wilcox car, hitting the other as described, could not alone have brought such diverse results, and that there is no doubt it was by reason of Armand\u2019s sudden stoppage. The shock therefrom immediately before, but almost concurrently with the Wilcox car getting locked with the other produced the injuries the Carr respondents have suffered, and are suing for. Hence both Armand and Wilcox, I hold, are liable jointly on that ground alone.\nAlso, I agree with the Second Appellate Division, for the reasons therein assigned, that Armand is jointly liable for not staying on the south side where he had gone to get rid of the danger.\nAnd I further hold that there was on Armand\u2019s part quite enough, in the extraordinary zigzagging course he pursued as above detailed by Fred Carr, as well as expressed by several other witnesses, to render him liable herein for the misleading Wilcox as to where it would land him.\nThere is another feature of this remarkable case and that is the conflicting versions of the actual situation at the time of the collision and exactly where and how it happened. In view of what I have just set forth I am not much concerned in regard thereto, but seeing the prominence given to this feature by each party to this case, and other cases that were tried together therewith, I may point out the pith of the substance of each such contention on behalf of each of those concerned herein.\nWilcox swears he was on his own side of the road, meaning north of the centre line of the concrete pavement. And he presents a photograph copy of a sketch he made. A number of witnesses corroborate him to the extent of saying he was on the north side of the line.\nCarr says Armand had certainly crossed the line a foot. As already remarked I cannot find that on as dark a night as it was, it was not possible for even an honest man to be mistaken. The blinding light from the car, or either of them, could help little for such a calculation.\nAnd those witnesses such as Reid, who came along later, evidently found no very safe passageway to get on or pass at either side past these locked cars after the collision\u2014until after they got separated.\nReid sums the thing up thus:\u2014\nQ. The rear portion of the Studebaker was where with regard to the centre line of the road?\u2014A. On the left side.\nQ. The rear portion would be on the left side?\u2014A. Yes, there wasn\u2019t room to pass hardly between it and the fence.\nQ. The whole of the pavement was taken up by the cars?\u2014A. Yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: They could have passed by by going on the grass. You could have passed on the right hand side by going off the pavement on the grass?\u2014A. There would hardly be room. It would be pretty close.\nQ. Whatever the position of the cars were they occupied the whole of the pavement?\u2014A. Yes.\nThis version could be well corroborated by taking the stories of others. And indeed it would agree with Wilcox\u2019s picture already referred to and leave him clear of being on the wrong side of the line.\nI only cite this evidence to shew, in face of a mass of evidence clearly demonstrating how both drivers can, or ought to be, jointly held liable, why we should not waste time over the task of trying to decide conclusively on which side of the centre each car was and thereby alone solve the issues joined herein. For that evidence is most conflicting and the net result as expressed by Reid demonstrates that the two cars stretched across the travelled road in such a way as to indicate appellant was likely to have his left hind wheel across the centre.\nMoreover let anyone turn back and read the evidence I have quoted from Mrs. Carr where she speaks of the appellant\u2019s car lurching about, and then a crash, and then that it seemed to pitch from side to side for a second or so, and then came the crash.\nI submit this evidence is worth considering in connection with my suggestion herein that the sudden stoppage by appellant caused first, and accounts for, the pitching, and a second or so later the collision.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge, I submit with every respect, was clearly in error in holding that a driver passing in quick succession, at a rate of from twenty-one to eighteen miles an hour, from one side to the other in zigzagging fashion, of his own side of the road, as some express it, was driving carefully, and hence, for the many foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nNo one on the night in question pretends to have made any measurements or marks whereby measurements could later on have been made, yet the counsel for respondents, the Carrs, asked, when appealing to the court below, to be given, if the appeal not allowed, a new trial, as he had discovered since the trial new evidence that would conclusively determine the question in issue. Of course as their appeal was granted below, no new trial was needed.\nHe repeated that herein, but upon my asking him if he had cross-appealed herein, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nNotwithstanding that, I would much prefer a new trial to the inevitable consequences of establishing as law that a man may act as appellant did and run no risk as a driver for the results of his doing so. In short may, with impunity, produce the shocking result appellant has produced, or helped to produce, and in question.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIf a majority would agree to a new trial I would assent thereto on usual terms.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Symons, Heighington & Shaver.\nSolicitor for the respondents, Fred Carr and Kitty Carr: D.O.

V, c. 54.\nRespondent, as widow of a deceased, claimed to recover from the Crown under a policy of insurance taken out by deceased under The Returned Soldiers\u2019 Insurance Act , D. 1920, 10-11 Geo. V, c. 54. Against her claim it was urged that satisfactory evidence of marriage had not been produced.\nHeld, that as she had lived with deceased openly as his wife, was evidently regarded by deceased as his wife, had children by him acknowledged by him to be legitimate, and was accepted by people of repute as his wife, a prima facie case arose in her flavour; and the findings of the trial judge, who had accepted her statement of the fact of a marriage ceremony, should be affirmed, under all the circumstances, notwithstanding her failure to recollect details of such ceremony.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1926] Ex. C.R. 1) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1]. The suppliant (now respondent) in her petition of right claimed to recover from the Crown under a policy of insurance issued upon the life of P. E. Proud under the provisions of The Returned Soldiers\u2019 Insurance Act , Statutes of Canada, 1920, c. 54, the beneficiary thereunder being named as \u201cElsie Proud, wife of the insured.\u201d\nThe insured died in Edmonton, Alberta, in February, 1924. The respondent applied to the department of Government administering the Act, for payment of the amount payable under the policy, but this apparently was refused upon the ground that no certificate of marriage, or satisfactory evidence of marriage, had been produced.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nO. F. Howe for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C, and Duff, Mignault and Newcombe J.J.) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The petitioner claims as the wife of the deceased Proud. The evidence of marriage might be more convincing, but the petitioner lived with Proud as his wife, openly, in Edmonton, had children by him acknowledged by him as legitimate, and was accepted by people of repute as his wife. Dr. Geggie\u2019s evidence is conclusive upon this point, namely, that Proud considered himself the husbands\u2014that is to say, the lawful husband\u2014of the petitioner. When the doctor, on the day of his death, suggested a will, his answer was that his wife, with whom, admittedly, he was living on the most affectionate terms, would \u201cget everything, anyway.\u201d\nAt least a prima facie case in her favour arises on these facts. A serious point is presented by the absence on her part of all recollection of the details of the marriage ceremony. On the whole it would appear, however, when the state of her health is considered, that there is no real ground for disagreeing with the finding of the learned trial judge, who accepted her statement that somewhere in New York she went through a marriage ceremony with Proud.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], in an action brought by the widow, formerly the wife, of a deceased soldier who, for her benefit, had taken a policy of insurance upon his life issued by the Dominion Government under the provisions of the Returned Soldiers\u2019 Insurance Act , 10-11 Geo. V, c. 54, for one thousand dollars.\nThe learned trial judge, who tried the case in Edmonton where the late Mr. Proud and his wife lived at the time of his death, and for some year or two previous thereto, after the evidence for her was all heard and none adduced by appellant, on the application of defendant, now appellant, allowed the case to stand over for a couple of months, at the urgent request of appellant\u2019s counsel, who pretended to doubt respondent\u2019s story in the witness box, as to the validity of the marriage with her late husband, and possibly might ask for a commission to take evidence. No such commission ever was asked for and if the respondent\u2019s story was false an investigation would certainly have enabled its falsity to have been demonstrated.\nSuch is the conclusion I have reached after reading the entire evidence.\nShe had been examined for discovery a week before the trial and I imagine at some length, for the appellant\u2019s counsel insinuated time and again it would contradict her story at the trial.\nAlthough in the printed case herein it was put down apparently as one of the exhibits that reference thereto is cancelled.\nIt never was put in or used and all references thereto would seem to have been bluff, and, I suspect, the whole of that was inspired by slandering on the part of her deceased husband\u2019s relatives who expected to recover, if verified, said policy for themselves.\nThey evidently (if counsel before us for appellant right) dared not face the court.\nThe probability is that inquiry demonstrated no such case as pretended for defendant (now appellant) could be established or the commission would have issued.\nI am, from a perusal of the evidence, quite clear that the judgment of the said judge was right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe story is a melancholy illustration of how often the poor returned soldier and his family have been improperly made to suffer.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McDonald, Weaver & Steer.\n[1] [1926] Ex. C.R. 1.\n[2] [1926] Ex. C.R. 1.\n"

(R.S.A., 1922, c. 114)\u2014Irrigation Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 61)\u2014Railway Act (D. 1919, c. 68; R.S.C. 1906, c. 37). Defendant, a body corporate by virtue of The Irrigation Districts Act, Alta. (R.S.A. 1922, c. 114), and administering an irrigation district formed under that Act, applied under The Irrigation Act (R.S.C., 1906, c. 61, and amendments) for the water required and for authority to construct the necessary works for utilization thereof, and, having obtained this authority, constructed and maintained a main irrigation canal. At some point of the canal, not discovered, a seepage occurred, and by underground channels the water found its way to and flooded plaintiffs' ranch (which was not contiguous to the canal). Plaintiffs sued for damages.\nHeld, having regard to the provisions of The Irrigation Act, and of The Railway Act thereby made applicable, the defendant could not justify its flooding of plaintiffs' lands without compensation by claiming to have merely exercised its statutory rights without negligence; by the flooding the defendant had interfered with plaintiffs' rights over their lands, had exercised in respect thereof a veritable easement, which, as well as the right of interference, it could acquire only by following the course prescribed under The Railway Act, viz., a notice to treat and expropriation proceedings with the payment of proper compensation; no notice to treat having been given the defendant was in the position of a trespasser; the principle relied on in Hanley v. Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Ry. Co., (11 Ont. L.R., 91), should be applied, and plaintiffs were entitled to recover damages in an action at law; they were not restricted to having the damages determined by arbitration under The Railway Act; it was for defendant to initiate proceedings thereunder. The damages awarded were restricted to those accrued at the date of the trial, reserving the right to claim subsequent damages if the seepage continued.\nIdington J., dissenting, held that, defendant having acted under statutory powers, its duty as water supplier having become imperative, and not being guilty of negligence, it was under no duty to do more than it did, and was not liable to plaintiffs; further grounds against plaintiffs' right to recover were: their failure to pursue the course provided by s. 41 of The Irrigation Act; their rejection of defendant's engineer's suggestion of drainage of their land, which would have mitigated the damage; and doubt, on the evidence, whether the water which damaged plaintiffs' land was from the canal.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (21 Alta. L.R. 449) aff., Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1] which set aside in part the judgment of Tweedie J.[2].\nThe action was for damages caused by the alleged flooding of plaintiffs' lands by water escaping from the defendants irrigation canal. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nAt the trial Tweedie J. awarded the plaintiffs $7,500 damages (2). The Appellate Division set aside this judgment in part, and held the plaintiffs entitled to recover for injury caused up to the time of the trial, with the right to seek further relief for injuries as they occur, and assessed the injury up to the time of the trial at $300, with the option to either party to have a reference at risk of costs of the reference.\nUnder special leave granted by the Appellate Division, the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from so much of the said judgment as declared that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover any sum against the defendant for injury sustained by them; and the plaintiffs cross-appealed, claiming that their damages should be assessed at the trial once and for all at $7,500 with costs, as fixed by the trial judge, and in the alternative that the damages be assessed up to the date of the judgment in this appeal and an injunction granted restraining defendant from committing further damages or injury to plaintiffs' lands.\nW. S. Gray and J. J. Frawley for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. and J. D. Matheson for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellant is a body corporate by virtue of a provincial statute, The Irrigation Districts Act, c. 114 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1922. It administers an irrigation district formed under that Act, and as therein provided (s. 35), it applied to the proper authorities under the Dominion Statute, The Irrigation Act, c. 61 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, and amendments, for the water required for the irrigation of the district and for authority to construct the necessary works for the utilization of the water. Having obtained this authority, it constructed and it now maintains a main irrigation canal, or ditch, as it is sometimes called, the head-gates of which are on the Old Man River. Thence the water is carried in the main canal, which is some thirty feet wide at the bottom, and it crosses the river at a distance of about three miles from the head-gates, through a flume. From the flume, the course of the main canal is in a northerly direction, passing at a distance of some 4,000 feet from the respondents' ranch, which is not contiguous to the canal. This ranch occupies some bench lands leading to what is called a cut-bank, where the ground descends by a steep slope to a lower level, on which the respondents' house and buildings are situated. This cut-bank is emphasized as affording shelter to the cattle, and at its foot was a spring that was convenient for furnishing water.\nThe appellant's canal in the vicinity of the respondents' ranch is constructed through gravel lands, the gravel increasing somewhat in coarseness the further down the excavation goes. When the canal is full, the water is seven feet deep, and it appears to have been anticipated by the builders that there might be some loss of water through seepage on account of the character of the soil.\nWater was first turned into the canal in May, 1923. Then a freshet came and caused damage to the works, and the water was withdrawn. It was again let into the canal in the following October. At some point of the canal which has not yet been discovered, a seepage took place, and by underground channels the water found its way to the re- spondents' ranch. This flow was first noticed at the spring, the discharge from which greatly increased, and I think it is unquestionable, and both courts have so found, that the respondents' land has been damaged thereby. The learned trial judge granted the respondents $7,500, as damages, assessed, I take it, for all time on the basis of a permanent depreciation of the property. The Appellate Divisional Court considered that no more than $300 should be allowed for damage caused up to the trial, but gave the parties, at their risk, the right to apply for a reference to show, if such be the case, whether the damages up to the trial were greater or less than that amount. Harvey C.J.A. and Hyndman J.A., dissented, and would have dismissed the action on the ground that the board of trustees had merely exercised without negligence its statutory rights, and was not responsible for damage caused thereby.\nThere is an appeal from the latter judgment by the appellant which relies on the grounds of dissent in the court below to ask for the dismissal of the respondents' action. The respondents also cross-appeal and seek to have the judgment at the trial restored.\nThe Irrigation Act (ss. 28 and following) confers expropriation powers on applicants for a license for water and for power to construct irrigation works such as this appellant, making The Railway Act applicable thereto, and subs. (2) of s. 29 states that all the provisions of The Railway Act which are applicable shall in like manner apply to fixing the amount of and the payment of compensation for damages to lands arising out of the construction or maintenance of the works of the applicant or out of the exercise of any of the powers granted to him under this Act.\nSection 164 of The Railway Act, 1919, is a familiar provision, which has often been considered by the Canadian courts and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It enacts that the company shall, in the exercise of the powers by this or the Special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers.\nIn the view I take of this case it will not be necessary to determine whether or not the appellant was guilty of any negligence in carrying out its statutory duty to supply water for irrigation purposes, as required by the provincial and federal statutes to which I have referred. Even assuming that there was no negligence, it does not follow, in my judgment, that the appellant can justify its flooding of the respondents' lands without compensation, by claiming to have merely exercised its statutory rights without negligence. The respondents' case, in my judgment, calls for the application of other principles. By flooding their lands, the appellant has interfered with the respondents' rights over their lands, and has exercised in respect of these lands what is a veritable easement, and this easement, as well as this right of interference, it could acquire only by following the course prescribed under The Railway Act, viz., a notice to treat and expropriation proceedings with the payment of proper compensation.\nNo notice to treat was ever given to the respondents, and the appellant, in flooding their lands, is in the position of a trespasser. To such a case I would apply the principle relied on by my brother Anglin in Hartley v. The Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Ry. Co.[3]. To the same effect as the Hanley Case3, and as showing the illegality of an entry on land without notice to treat, I might refer to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Cardwell v. The Midland Railway Co.[4], affirming the judgment of Byrne J. at the trial[5]. See also the decision of this court in Leahy v. Town of North Sydney[6], and the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Saunby v. Water Commissioners of London[7]. The general principle governing such cases is stated by Lord Macnaghten in Parkdale v. West[8].\nI am in accord, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Clarke, with the decision of the Appellate Divisional Court, restricting the damages which should be awarded to the respondents to the damages which had accrued at the date of the trial, reserving the right of the respondents to claim subsequent damages if the seepage continues, and it may in time cease. This is supported by the decision of this court in Gale v. Bureau[9]. I do not think, under the circumstances, that the respondents have no recourse by action at law for their damages but are restricted to having these damages determined by arbitration under The Railway Act. It was for the appellant to initiate proceedings under this Act, and then a case would have been established for an arbitration. The appellant should not now be allowed to make this objection.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The defendant is a body corporate formed under the provisions of The Irrigation Districts Act (R.S.A., 1922, c. 114), of which Act section 11 is as follows:\u2014\n11. The Board of every District formed hereunder shall be a body corporate, and shall have full power to acquire, hold and alienate water rights and all other powers and privileges under The Irrigation Act and to take, hold and alienate any property real or personal and shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have all the powers necessary for the construction, working, maintenance and renewal of irrigation or drainage works necessary for the use and purposes of the district and the inhabitants thereof.\n\"The Irrigation Act\" referred to in the above section is the Dominion Act, being R.S.C., 1906, c. 61.\nThe appellant filed a memorial with the Commissioner of Irrigation under the provisions of the Irrigation Act, asking permission to divert water from the Old Man river.\nAn authorization to construct the works was granted, but the memorial was amended and a new authorization to construct was issued on November 24, 1920.\nThe appellant acting upon such authority and the powers given it by the said Irrigation Districts Act, proceeded to construct a canal of about forty miles in length designed to distribute water on to the lands of water users within said district containing a hundred thousand acres or more.\nThe respondents own, outside of same, a ranch of about two thousand acres, the point of which nearest to said canal is some four thousand feet distant therefrom. Said ranch is chiefly on the flat land bordering the Old Man river and about seventy-five feet below the bottom level of said canal.\nThe said canal was constructed with such great care that the learned trial judge who heard the case out of which this appeal arises, and all others judicially concerned in the court of appeal below, have held that there was no negligence on the part of those concerned in said construction.\nIt was finished so far that appellant was given, after due inspection, by duly constituted authority, of said work, a permit by the Minister of the Interior, dated the 15th of May, 1923, to divert from the said Old Man river, a specified quantity of water for use in the works so constructed, and it was turned on accordingly.\nAn unprecedented flood in the Old Man river about same time did such damage to the head-gates of said canal that no further water was turned on until the following October, 1923.\nThe suggestion was made by Mr. Houston (an engineer who had much to do with inspecting this work and passing upon the same), in the course of his evidence, if I understand him aright, that said rising may have so disturbed things as to be the cause of the seepage now in question herein.\nI pass that meantime to continue the story of these proceedings.\nThe respondents' ranch suffered what may have arisen therefrom, but the turning on of the water in October into said canal, to serve its uses, and in the following spring again, for same purpose (it having been dry during the winter), were respectively, about three weeks thereafter, followed by a rising in a spring or well on the respondents' ranch, and the plaintiffs, now respondents herein, claim that that soaked into the adjacent ground making part of it boggy.\nThereafter, on the 30th October, 1924, respondents brought this action, claiming damages arising solely from said seepage, which was tried before Mr. Justice Tweedie, who held that the appellant had not been negligent in the construction of the said canal, or in turning on the water at first, but that when, as the evidence shewed, according to his finding, seepage from the canal had repeatedly shewn it was doing damage, the appellant had been negligent in not remedying the evil, and he entered a judgment for $7,500. This evidently was founded upon the pretension of the respondents that the selling value of the land was affected by reason of the existence of said seepage.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta there seems to have been a diversity of view.\nThe learned Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Hyndman concurred, held that under the principles laid down by Lord Watson in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in the case of the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Parke et al[10], from which he quotes from page 547 of the report, as follows:\u2014\nThe real question, therefore, in this case comes to be, whether these provisions ought to be construed as being in their substance, as well as in their form, permissive merely, and subject to the obligation, which in that case is implied at common law, that the irrigator must use his water supply so as not to do damage to adjacent lands; or, whether they are to be construed as imperative, and therefore as empowering the irrigator, so long as he is not convicted of negligence, to inflict any amount of injury upon his neighbour without incurring responsibility.\nand then he points out the legal results and infers as follows:\nHe considered that that case was within the first class: for he states in the following page:\u2014\n\"When the water has been conveyed to his land he is authorised to use it for purposes of irrigation; but it is left to his discretion to determine whether, as circumstances permit, he will use in irrigation the whole, or part, or none of it.\"\nIn other words Parke was treated as a water user merely, not as a water supplier which the defendant in this case is under provisions which, as stated, clearly make it imperative that it shall carry the water through its ditch.\nHe held that it was on the evidence impossible to remove the possibility of any seepage, by any reasonable effort, or in law to stop the work, and quotes Brett M.R., in the case of Heaven v. Pender[11], where he gives the definition of actionable negligence, as follows:\u2014\nThe neglect of the use of ordinary care or skill towards a person to whom the defendant owes the duty of observing ordinary care and skill, by which neglect the plaintiff, without contributory negligence on his part, has suffered injury to his person or property.\nMr. Justice Hyndman in his concurring judgment cites as appropriate law the following, to be found in the judg- ment of Lord Hatherly in Geddis v. Proprietors of the Bann Reservoir[12].\nIn referring to the case of Cracknell v. The Mayor and Corporation of Thetford[13], he says:\u2014\n\"In that case, which has been followed by several others, it seems to have been laid down that persons having powers to execute certain works, and executing those works in such a manner as to perform that duty in compliance with an Act of Parliament, and being utterly guiltless of any negligence, cannot be liable to an action. If the person injuriously affected cannot find any clause in the Act of Parliament, giving him compensation for the damage which he has received, he cannot obtain compensation for that damage by way of action against the parties who have done no wrong. That is the simple proposition which is laid down in that case, and when it is expressed in those terms it is impossible for anybody to find any fault with it.\"\nThe line of thought thus expressed and verified by said quotations is what (with many other authorities, I am about to refer to, and rely upon) convinces me I must agree therewith.\nMeantime I may point out that whilst so agreeing with the dissenting judges below, yet that the view the majority of said court took, if damages are to be assessed at all, they can only be damages up to the time of the bringing of the action, and that in such an action as this, if at all maintainable, it can be brought repeatedly and no means exist in the law whereby any such action can be made the ground of assessing damages as if upon the basis of an expropriation.\nMoreover the respondents were in duty bound, if any such action is maintainable at all, to have taken such steps as would have mitigated their damages; yet when drainage was suggested to them by a competent engineer acting for appellant, the respondents seemed to scorn it.\nIt is clear to me as noon-day that drainage of said land, to relieve it of any damage flowing from said water, was the course the respondents should have followed, and especially so when suggested by a competent engineer acting for the appellant.\nIt would only have cost, according to the evidence of said engineer, about nine hundred to a thousand dollars, or, according to that of another engineer, perhaps up to twelve hundred dollars; and, then, if done, I submit, probably would have added a large portion thereof to the previous value of the ranch, of which the land so treated formed a part. The evidence was not directed further to that consideration.\nPeople acting in such a way, in such remarkable circumstances as in evidence herein, are not entitled to much straining of the law to help them out.\nBefore considering further that aspect of this case I desire to revert to a further consideration of the law bearing on that aspect of the case presented by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Hyndman set forth above.\nThe case of Hammersmith and City Railway Company v. Brand[14], long ago decided by the highest authority in England, that any such nuisances as might have arisen from the operation of said railway, in the way of noise, smoke or vibration of the dwellings on the respondent Brand's land, and no matter how seriously the value of his property, adjacent to the said railway, had been impaired thereby, gave him no right to damages unless part of his land had been taken.\nThat was a decision under the English Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, but followed by this court in the case of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Company v. Holditch[15], in an appeal from an appellate division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. Again on an appeal by Holditch from that decision by this court, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[16], and that appeal was dismissed. The judgment of Lord Sumner, writing on behalf of said court, contains the following passage (cited by appellant's counsel herein) on page 544 of said report:\nThe claim for depreciation by the prospective annoyance from noise, smoke and vibration was put thus: Sect. 155 of the Railway Act of Canada requires the company to \"make full compensation * * * to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of\" the powers granted to them by this or by their special Act, and ss. 191 and 193 use language which draws a distinction between compensation for land taken and for damage suffered from the exercise of any of the powers granted for the railway. It was argued that the interference with convenient access to some of the lots by reason of the line being taken across the streets and the annoyance to be expected from the noise, smoke and vibration of passing trains alike constituted damage suffered from the exercise of the powers granted for the railway.\nTheir Lordships are unable to adopt this view. The substantive obligation upon the railway company to make compensation is derived from s. 155, and the other two sections are only concerned with the procedure by which this obligation is to be enforced. The language of s. 155 is taken, with modifications to which in this case no importance can be attached, from the proviso to s. 16 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and it is well settled by decisions of the highest authority that land so taken \"cannot by its mere use, as distinguished from the construction of works upon it, give rise to a claim for compensation.\" The decisions on this construction of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act have been applied to the Canadian legislation many years ago.\nThe important feature of this is that it removes from doubt the distinction attempted therein between that case and the Hammersmith Case [17] above cited arising from the facts and wording of the Canadian Railway Act when compared with the English Act on which that case turned.\nThere would seem to have arisen considerable diversity of judicial opinion in the course of that Holditch Case [18] through our Canadian courts.\nHolditch had subdivided a block of land he owned in Sudbury and filed in the registry office a plan thereof. The railway company expropriated certain of these lots as it was entitled to do, and on a reference to arbitration to determine the compensation he was entitled to, he contended, sometimes successfully, that he was entitled to damages for injury done other lots he owned in said subdivision by reason either of the railway crossing the street leading to such other lots rendering them less accessible\u2014hence less marketable; or of the smoke, noise and vibration incidental to the use of the railway when constructed.\nThe damage done to Holditch's lands, then in question, I suspect, was much more serious than anything suffered by the respondents herein.\nBut there, as herein, no part of the lands which Holditch had subdivided, except the lots therein so expropriated, had been expropriated. Hence the basis of the litigation.\nI submit that the Canadian railway statute in question therein was the same as that upon which the respondents herein rest their claim for compensation. And in face of said decisions I cannot see how it can be maintained that there is any foundation for the respondents to rest their claim herein upon.\nTheir main pretension seems to have been throughout, that the Railway Act impliedly gave such rights as they claim because the Irrigation Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 61, s. 29, subs.(2), reads as follows:\u2014\n2. All the provisions of the Railway Act which are applicable shall in like manner apply to fixing the amount of and the payment of compensation for damages to lands arising out of the construction or maintenance of the works of the applicant or out of the exercise of any of the powers granted to him under this Act.\nand, it is claimed, gives such a claim. I submit it clearly does not do so, if we have regard to the relevant facts and the law as declared in the cases cited above.\nSection 164 of The Railway Act, 1919, also put forward, is identically the same as section 155 of the Railway Act as it stood when Lord Sumner wrote the judgment in the Holditch Case[19], containing the above quotation therefrom, and the sections 191 and 193 to which he refers have been only so slightly modified in The Railway Act, 1919, as not to interfere with his said reasons above quoted.\nBut it is the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 37, which I submit must be referred to, as I cannot find that the Irrigation Act which appeared in the same revision and by sections 28 and 29 et seq., thereof, under the caption Expropriation, which tries to apply the Railway Act to solving such questions, has not been, since said revision, changed in this regard. And hence Lord Sumner's judgment, as quoted, proceeds on the express language in question herein.\nI desire to refer to the case of The London, Brighton, and South Coast Ry. Co. v. Truman et al[20], which turned upon the Railway Act which provided for railways carrying cattle and purchasing lands wherein to provide conveniences for loading them and keeping in store until loaded, but failed to provide any compensation for those suffering damages by reason of such a nuisance. It was held therein that the respondents therein who had complained, had no alternative but to submit thereto without any compensation therefor. Lord Selborne in giving judgment[21], says at p. 57:\u2014\nHere there can be no question that the legislature has authorized acts to be done for the necessary and ordinary purposes of the railway traffic (e.g., such as those complained of in Rex v. Pease[22]), which would be nuisances at common law, but which being so authorized are not actionable.\nLord Blackburn in his judgment, at page 60, says:\u2014\nI do not think there can be any doubt that if on the true construction of a statute it appears to be the intention of the legislature that powers should be exercised, the proper exercise of which may occasion a nuisance to the owners of neighbouring land, and that this should be free from liability to an action for damages, or an injunction to prevent the continued proper exercise of these powers, effect must be given to the intention of the legislature.\nAgain in the case of Mayor and Councillors of East Fremantle v. Annois[23], where\nThe appellant municipality, in the exercise of authority conferred by the Western Australian Municipal Institutions Act (59 Vict., No. 10), s. 109 and at the request of the ratepayers, in order to improve a street reduced the gradient opposite the respondent's house so that it was left on the edge of a cutting with a drop of about six or eight feet to the road:\u2014\nHeld, that the respondent was without remedy, since none had been given by statute, and the appellants had not exceeded the powers conferred.\nTherein Lord Macnaghten, at page 217, says as follows:\u2014\nThe law has been settled for the last hundred years. If persons in the position of the appellants, acting in the execution of a public trust and for the public benefit, do an act which they are authorized by law to do, and do it in a proper manner, though the act so done works a special injury to a particular individual, the individual injured cannot maintain an action. He is without remedy unless a remedy is provided by the statute.\nThe case of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Roy[24], in some respects presents a case more like unto this than any other for undoubtedly upon the facts presented, the fire originated from a locomotive of the railway company, passing the land in question, and destroyed more property than in question herein.\nIt ultimately turned upon the question of negligence and the question of negligence was negatived, and hence Roy had no remedy. The Lord Chancellor, at page 229 of the Report, spoke as follows:\u2014\nIf the immunity claimed for the appellants were simply claimed upon the ground that they were a corporation without reference to what they are authorized to do in that capacity, the argument would be well founded; but the fallacy of the suggestion lies in supposing that that immunity is claimed because they are a corporation. If it were so, there would be no difference between the law of England and the law as so expounded in the province of Quebec; but the ground upon which the immunity of a railway company for injury caused by the normal use of their line is based is that the legislature, which is supreme, has authorized the particular thing so done in the place and by the means contemplated by the legislature, and that cannot constitute an actionable wrong in England any more than it can constitute a fault by the Quebec Code.\nApply that to this case, where a canal duly authorized by those having an absolute right to do so, and upon the material which it required, and was duly presented in compliance therewith, and the canal was constructed accordingly without negligence, and the water turned on after due inspection thereof, and permission given, and no negligence to be found up to that time, how can negligence be imputed by reason of such a very remarkable discovery as that alleged to have been made herein? I fail to see any ground therefor. There is no ground for the appellant refusing to carry on by reason thereof. The cost of protecting the respondent now is quite prohibitive according to the evidence. It is a corporation created for municipal purposes only, in a country that needs the supply of water for irrigation.\nThe duty has become imperative by virtue of the legislation of its creator, and that must be observed. And thus what is complained of falls within the definition of Lord Watson in disposing of the Parke Case [25] above referred to. And all the authorities recognize that when that has transpired, there is no ground for relief in the case of unexpected developments which the legislature must have decided not to recognize.\nThere is another feature of the legislation, bearing upon the questions arising herein, I may advert to.\nIt was decided by this court in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Albin[26], that even where the property was in a sense damaged by improvements the railway needed, and the injury done to it as a place of business was such that it had to be abandoned, the arbitrator allowed $6,366 for injury to the property, and the injury being such as to destroy the business, he allowed $4,500 therefor, and this court, reversing that and the court below, held that the latter loss could not be compensated for. I dissented, but that binds me now. How can I hold respondents entitled in a much less meritorious case.\nEspecially so when there is nothing expressly provided by the legislature, for any compensation for any damages for anything arising after the continued operation of the work has become imperative.\nThe nature of the appellant's incorporation is, in a legal sense, the same as if it had been declared part of the municipal system of the province of Alberta, for the promotion of the interests of that province, and the duties cast upon appellant are purely of that nature and in no way for financial gain to appellant directly or indirectly.\nA distinction has been often made, between such a body and other corporate bodies created solely with a view to financial gain, when it comes to determining whether or not the legislature had definitely decided that under such like relevant circumstances, there could not be any claim for damages, although, in similar circumstances, a private corporation solely for gain, might be held liable.\nIn the one case the legislature can hardly have intended to declare that a tort, which was done under the direction of certain public officers, specified in the legislation, and in strict compliance therewith, without any negligence.\nIn the converse case of a private corporation which I thus point out, a different construction might be put.\nThe appellant's counsel properly drew our attention to the fact that it is subject to the control of the Irrigation Council constituted under The Irrigation Districts Act, section 34, of which the relevant parts are as follows:\u2014\n34. (1) There shall be an irrigation council of three members, or any less number, whose duty it shall be to advise every board upon the conduct of the affairs of its district and who may forbid any act or course of conduct proposed to be done or entered upon by a board.\n(2) The member or members constituting the council shall be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\n(3) No money received by any board upon debenture issue shall be expended at any time without the prior approval of the council. (4) The council shall be entitled at all times to require from any board all such information as it may be in its power to give, with respect to anything done or proposed to be done by it.\n****\n(8) No construction of any work shall be directed or begun and no contract for the construction of any work, entered into by any board, shall be of any effect whatsoever until the same shall have received the assent of the council.\nAnd he cites in that connection the Corporation of Raleigh v. Williams and Another[27], and quotes from the judgment of Lord Macnaghton at page 550 of said case as follows:\nIt was argued on behalf of the respondents that if a drainage work constructed under a by-law duly passed turns out in the result not to answer its purpose by reason of the insufficiency of the outlet, or by reason of some other defect which a competent engineer ought to have foreseen and guarded against, or if the result of a drainage work is to damage a person's land by throwing water upon it which would not otherwise have come there\u2014that is actionable negligence on the part of the municipality. This argument in their Lordships' opinion is wholly untenable. On the other hand their Lordships do not agree with the argument of the appellants that municipalities are helpless instruments in the hands of the engineers they employ. They cannot indeed modify the engineer's plan themselves. That is no part of their business. But they may return the plan for amendment if they think that it is not desirable in the shape submitted to them. If, however, acting in good faith, they accept the engineer's plan and carry it out, persons whose property may be injuriously affected by the construction of the drainage work must seek their remedy in the manner prescribed by the statute.\nI accept that from such an eminent judge and great lawyer as an absolutely accurate statement of the law and, I may add thereto that it is quite clear when there is no express and definite provision of such a remedy that none exists, and the legislature never intended there should be any.\nIn the case last mentioned there happened to be a definite remedy applicable in the municipal law governing the drainage there involved.\nThe parties, plaintiff therein concerned, had sought the same sort of relief as the respondents had tried on herein, but were told by the court above that they had erred in doing so and must begin de novo.\nThere is another aspect of the law relevant herein, and that is the provision of the Irrigation Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 61, s. 41, as follows: 41. Should any person residing on or owning land in the neighbourhood of any works, either completed or in course of construction, apply to the Minister in writing for an inspection of such works, the Minister may order an inspection thereof.\n2. The Minister may require the person so applying to make a deposit of such sum of money as the Minister thinks necessary to pay the expenses of an inspection, and in case the application appears to him not to have been justified, may cause the whole or part of the expenses to be paid out of such deposit.\n3. In case the application appears to the Minister to have been justified, he may order the applicant for a licence or the licensee to pay the whole or any part of the expenses of the inspection, and such payment may be enforced as a debt due to the Crown.\n4. Upon any inspection under the provisions of this section the Minister may order such applicant or licensee to make any addition or alteration which he considers necessary for their security to or in any works of the applicant or licensee, and if the applicant or licensee fails to obey to that effect, reciting all the facts and, in the province of Saskatchewan or Alberta, the judge of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories for the judicial district in which such works lie pending the abolition of that court by the legislature of the province, and thereafter any judge of such superior court as in respect of civil jurisdiction is established by the legislature of the province in lieu thereof, and, in the Northwest Territories, a stipendiary magistrate having jurisdiction in the district or place where such works lie, upon the production of such certificate, shall hear and determine the matter in a summary manner and shall order the applicant or licensee to proceed with all despatch to take such measures as the judge or magistrate considers necessary in the premises; and the refusal or neglect to obey any order made by a judge or magistrate under this section may be treated and punished as contempt of court, and such other proceedings may be had and taken thereon as in the case of non-compliance with any other mandatory order of the said court or a judge thereof.\n5. This section shall not apply to cases where the Minister waives the filing of plans.\nThe last subsection has no application for there was no such waiver, but the rest of the said section may well have.\nThe respondents never pursued that course and I submit that is another good reason in law why they ought not to succeed herein.\nI am, as result of reading the evidence relevant to the question of negligence on the part of the appellant, most decidedly of the opinion that there was no negligence on their part of which the respondents can complain.\nHad the ground underneath the said canal been composed, as respondents' declaration sets forth, entirely of gravel or loose stones, there would have been no trouble for the water would have sunk pretty straightly down through same for at least seventy-five feet, and never have travelled the four-fifths of a mile sideways to reach the respondents' ranch.\nIf the seepage in question came from the canal it clearly was by reason of its meeting an expansion of rock or other material impervious to water.\nI must repeat the doubts I above expressed as to the water from the canal being that which got into the well or spring on the respondents' ranch, but will not labour that question. No one can tell absolutely for the engineers testify that under any ordinary circumstances it would take much longer than three weeks to travel the four-fifths of a mile sideways.\nI fail to see any analogy, in fact or in the relevant law, between this case and either the case of the Corporation of Parkdale v. West[28], or North Shore Railway Company v. Pion et al[29].\nThe injury done to those respectively complaining in each of said cases seems to me to have been so flagrant that I cannot understand how those respectively responsible proceeded as they did by ignoring the law and failing to take the steps required of each respectively, by the several particular statutes in question in each of said cases.\nIn this case, now in hand, appellant was confronted with nothing it could have invoked to justify an appeal to any authority to expropriate or pass upon its property in any way save as in the way it did, by watching and so puddling with material parts possibly porous. And that is abundant reason for the dismissal of this action.\nI am, for the many reasons assigned by me in the entire foregoing, clearly of the opinion that the respondents never had any cause of action in law against the appellant, and that the appeal by it herein should be allowed and the action of the respondents dismissed with costs throughout, and that the respondents' cross-appeal herein should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 21 Alta.

(Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Dominion Bank (Defendant) Respondent.\n1926: February 9, 10; 1926: May 4.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nBankruptcy\u2014Alleged preferential payments by debtor\u2014\u201cIntention\u201dto give a preference\u2014Bankruptcy Act, D., 1919, c. 36, s. 31\u2014Banks and banking\u2014Bank\u2019s lien on, and right to appropriate, credit balance in current account.\nAppellant, trustee in bankruptcy, sued to recover from respondent bank the amount of certain payments to the bank made within three months of the assignment in bankruptcy, alleging that said payments were illegal, as made with a view to giving the bank a preference over other creditors and therefore obnoxious to s. 31 of the Bankruptcy Act. The debtor firm had with the bank a current account and a \u201cliability account.\u201d All moneys were paid into the current account and the firm\u2019s cheques were charged to that account. When that account became overdrawn the credit balance was restored by a loan secured by a demand note, the amount of which was credited in the current account, the note being recorded in the liability account. Interest was charged on these notes, and it was the practice when, from time to time, the current account was in funds, to transfer moneys available to the firm\u2019s credit in the liability account so as to reduce the interest bearing obligations. Of the six impeached payments, five were made by cheque, charged to the firm\u2019s current account, retiring notes previously given, in accordance with this practice, and one was effected by the bank charging the amount of an unpaid note to the current account without the formal authority of a cheque.\nHeld, on the evidence, the prima facie presumption under s. 31 (2) that the payments were made with a view to giving a preference to the bank had been displaced. There was not, within the meaning of said Act, an intent to create a preference on the part of the debtor firm or of the bank. The circumstances in evidence indicated that the firm gave the cheques without any expectation that the bank would obtain advantage over any other creditor. It is settled law that the intention to give a preference envisaged by s. 31 is an intention in fact, and it must be an intention entertained by the debtor. As to the payment effected by appropriating the credit balance in the current account for the payment of the note, the bank possessed a lien upon any such balance as security for any indebtedness and a right to set off such indebtedness against any such balance. The question would have been different if it could have been maintained that the credit balance was composed of moneys deposited in such circumstances as to mark the deposits themselves as preferential payments, but any such contention in this case was untenable.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (34 Man. R. 565) aff. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment of Galt J. in favour of the plaintiff[2] on the trial of issues directed to be tried pursuant to the provisions of The Bankruptcy Act and rules thereunder.\nThe plaintiff (appellant) was the authorized trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Daniel Coughlin and J. L. Coughlin, carrying on business as \u201cD. Coughlin & Company,\u201d and claimed to recover from the defendant (respondent) bank the amount of six payments made by the debtor firm to the bank within three months preceding the authorized assignment.\nThe trial judge, Galt J., found that the payments in question had the effect of giving the bank a preference over other creditors of D. Coughlin & Company, and that the bank had failed to rebut the presumption raised by the statute against it, and gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the amount of its claim. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba set aside this judgment and ordered that the issues directed to be tried be decided in favour of the defendant and that the action and claim of the plaintiff be dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada (on leave given by a judge of that court).\nHugh Phillips K.C. and C. K. Guild for the appellant.\nI. Pitblado K.C. and E. F. Haffner for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The questions involved in this appeal are, in substance, questions of fact only. The claim of the appellants, the trustees in bankruptcy of Daniel Coughlin and J. L. Coughlin, trading under the firm name of D. Coughlin & Company, is to recover from the respondent bank the amount of six several payments in the months of September and October, 1920, which are alleged to have been illegal, as made with a view to giving the bank a preference over the other creditors of D. Coughlin & Company, and therefore obnoxious to s. 31 of The Bankruptcy Act. The assignment in bankruptcy took place on November 30, 1920. Since 1906, the firm had been carrying on business as live stock brokers, buying and selling live stock on commission, and occasionally as principals, and financing cattle buyers. The firm banked with the respondent bank, and for some years, at all events, before the assignment, working capital was provided chiefly through advances by the bank. From the year 1918 onwards, the firm had two accounts with the bank\u2014a current account and an account known as the \u201cliability account.\u201d All moneys were paid into the current account, and the firm\u2019s cheques were charged to that account. When the current account became overdrawn, the credit balance was restored by a loan secured by a demand note, the amount of which was credited in the current account, the note being recorded in the liability account. Interest was charged on these notes at the rate of seven per cent, and, as no interest was allowed to the firm upon its credit balances in the current account, it was the practice when, from time to time, the current account was in funds, to transfer moneys available for that purpose to the firm\u2019s credit in the liability account, with the object of reducing the interest-bearing obligations. Of the impeached payments, five were made by cheque, charged to the firm\u2019s current account, retiring notes previously given, in accordance with this practice. One was effected by the bank charging the amount of an unpaid note to the current account, without the formal authority of a cheque.\nThese payments were made within three months of the assignment in bankruptcy, and consequently fall within subsection 2 of section 31. There is therefore what the statute describes as \u201ca prima facie\u201d presumption that they were made with a view to giving a preference to the bank, and the question of fact is whether or not that presumption has been displaced.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously held that there was not, within the meaning of the statute, an intent to create a preference on part either of the debtors or of the bank. This view is, I think, well founded.\nIn the summer of 1920, the position of the firm was considered by Mr. Patton, the assistant general manager at Winnipeg, who had before him a report of Mr. Sheffield, the local manager of the stock yards branch at St. Boniface, where the account was kept. Mr. Patton\u2019s view, after a careful survey of the assets of the firm, as well as of those belonging to Mr. Daniel C. Coughlin, personally, was that, taking into account these last mentioned assets, there was a surplus, and he informed Mr. Daniel Coughlin that, if certain named conditions were complied with, the bank would carry on the account as before. The evidence of Mr. Sheffield and Mr. Patton is explicit that, if these conditions were met, there was no question of the willingness of the bank to continue to do business with the firm on the existing footing. Mr. Patton was absent from Winnipeg in September and the early part of October. Unfortunately, disputes arose between Mr. Coughlin and Mr. Bearsto, who was left in charge. There was ultimately, on the 8th of October, a heated interview: Mr. Bearsto demanded instant compliance with the conditions; Mr. Coughlin demanded that action should be postponed until Mr. Patton\u2019s return; and, as he remained obstinate in this, he was informed that he must make banking arrangements elsewhere. In the meantime, large sums of money had been paid in to the credit of the current account, and, in the ordinary way, cheques had been given on that account, five of which are among the impeached payments. No hint of difficulty seems to have arisen until October. During the month of September (September 4), Mr. Bearsto authorized an advance of $25,000, and in explanation of that advance he states in his evidence that the firm was not insolvent when the personal assets of Daniel Coughlin were taken into account; and further, that in October, if the security demanded by the bank had been given, there would have been no rupture of the relations between the bank and the Coughlins. His evidence is entirely in accord with that of Mr. Patton, who says that, if the conditions were complied with, there was no thought of requiring the firm to liquidate its obligations: what the bank wanted was formal security upon Daniel Coughlin\u2019s assets. In considering the question of intent, the acts of the bank officials in August and September must be regarded as affording weighty evidence. There was an investigation by the bank officials directly concerned\u2014the assistant general manager at Winnipeg and the local manager charged with the supervision of the account\u2014of the value of the available assets; an investigation conducted with the specific object of ascertaining whether or not the resources of the firm and of the members of the firm were such as to justify the bank in continuing to extend credit to the firm as before. There was a decision that the assets were sufficient, and that the credits might be continued if certain conditions, quite within the power of D. Coughlin & Company, should be complied with. This decision was communicated to Daniel Coughlin, and upon the view thus arrived at, as to the value of the assets, the bank acted, in September, in making the advance mentioned.\nAs to Daniel Coughlin, there seems no room for dispute that he not only believed himself to be solvent, but that he had so much confidence in his financial solidity as to suppose that a refusal by the Dominion Bank to give him further credit would not gravely embarrass him.\nSuch being the circumstances, the conclusion of the Court of Appeal seems founded on sufficient grounds that D. Coughlin & Company gave the impeached cheques in the full expectation, an expectation not without reason, that the account would be carried on, as it always had been, and that the outstanding cheques would be fully paid, and, in a word, that the bank would obtain no advantage over any other creditor in consequence of these payments.\nAs regards the payments made by cheque, this seems sufficient to dispose of the appeal. It is settled law that the intention to give a preference envisaged by s. 31 is an intention in fact, and whatever else may be said about it, it must be an intention entertained by the debtor.\nAs to the payment effected by appropriating the credit balance in the current account for the payment of the note of $14,000, I see no reason to differ from the opinion of two of the learned judges in the court below, that the bank possessed a lien upon any such balance as security for any indebtedness to it from the firm, and a right to set such indebtedness off against any such balance. The question presented would of course have been a very different one if it could have been maintained that the credit balance was composed of moneys deposited in such circumstances as to mark the deposits themselves as preferential payments. Sufficient has already been said to shew that in this case any such contention would be untenable.\nIt is necessary to refer to the able and elaborate judgment of the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Galt. With great respect, I think the learned judges of the Court of Appeal are right in considering that the learned trial judge misdirected himself in relation to two rather important subjects: First, in considering the question of intent, an adequate survey of the facts would necessarily seem to embrace the fact that the bank was relying upon, and that D. Coughlin & Company knew that the bank was relying upon, the separate assets of Daniel Coughlin, as included in the resources justifying the credit extended to the firm; the full force of this was not appreciated by the learned judge. Second, the claim of the appellant was not based upon an allegation\u2014and, indeed, it is difficult to understand how such a claim could be successfully advanced\u2014 that the bank was in possession of moneys received by D. Coughlin & Company in a fiduciary capacity, and therefore not subject to their disposition, and that such moneys they wrongfully, and with the bank\u2019s knowledge of their fraud, transferred to the bank in liquidation of their indebtedness. The statement of claim as originally drafted comprised a claim on this basis, but the relevant allegations were struck out, and there was no issue properly before the learned trial judge as to the right of the customers of D. Coughlin & Company to recover from the bank moneys which the learned judge seemed to think were held by D. Coughlin & Company in trust for such customers. The case, as presented on the pleadings, rested upon the allegation that moneys, the property of D. Coughlin & Company, available for the satisfaction of the claims of their general creditors, were improperly and illegally paid by way of preference to the respondent bank. That allegation would not be established by making out that the payments alleged to constitute the preferences charged were effected by transfers of funds which in equity were the property of D. Coughlin & Company\u2019s principals, who, so far as appears, have never complained of these transfers, and who, again, for aught that appears to the contrary, may, by their conduct or otherwise, have sanctioned them. The appellants\u2019 claim rests upon the hypothesis that the payments were made out of moneys subject to the disposition of D. Coughlin & Company, and it is on that hypothesis that the litigation must be decided.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Phillips & Scarth.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Munson, Allan, Laird, Davis, Haffner & Hobkirk.\n[1] 34 Man.

The H. signalled her desire to pass the D. on the port side. The D. signalled her willingness. A collision took place, as to the cause of which, and the way in which it occurred, there was conflicting evidence. Martin L.J.A. held ([1925] Ex. C.R. 114) that both vessels were equally in fault and should bear the damages equally. This judgment was reversed by Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court (hearing the appeal with the assistance of two nautical assessors), who held ([1926] Ex. C.R. 59) the D. wholly to blame. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld (per Duff, New-combe and Rinfret JJ.): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Martin L.J.A. restored. The H. was the overtaking ship, and, having regard to the Navigation Laws and Pilot Regulations for the Inland Waters of the United States on the Pacific Coast, which were admittedly applicable, and especially to the requirement that \u201cevery vessel overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel,\u201d the H. had not, on the evidence, satisfied the burden resting upon her to excuse her collision with the overtaken ship. Moreover the evidence did not disclose that the D. materially altered her course or attempted to crowd upon the course of the H. or executed any movement material to the case which would affect the bearing as between her and the H. which was not, or should not have been, reasonably anticipated by the H. A vessel \u201ckeeps her course\u201d within the meaning of said rules if, in proceeding from one reach of a river channel to another, she keeps the course which would ordinarily be expected of a vessel making that passage. The court, however, was not prepared to reverse the findings of Martin L.J.A. as to the responsibility of the D., as, in the special circumstances of the case, good seamanship required that the D. should have given the H. more sea room. Both vessels were persistently navigating the channel on the side opposite to that to which they were equally directed by the regulations. Under the rules, the effect of the passing signal was to commit the H. to a passage on the port hand of the D.; and when the master of the D. realized that the H. was on a course to cross his bow he should not have been so late in porting his helm; and in obeying and construing the rules he did not observe due regard to the dangers of navigation and collision.\nAs to the character of the obligation of an overtaking vessel, The Saragossa, (1892) 7 Asp. M.C. 289, followed.\nAnglin C.J.C. and Idington J., dissenting, would affirm the judgment of Maclean J.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. (dissenting): The D. was alone to blame. The collision was caused by her failing, after assenting to the H. passing her to port, to maintain her course, and by her crowding upon the course of the H., in contravention of articles 21 and 18 of said rules. Correlative to the obligation of the H., as an overtaking ship, to keep out of the way of the D., was that of the D. to maintain her course and in no case to attempt to crowd upon the course of the passing vessel. The guide of the overtaking vessel is the presumption that the other will keep her course. To excuse herself the D. must show that her departure from her course was necessary to avoid immediate danger and was no more than was necessary. Where the leading ship alters her course in contravention of article 21, the otherwise absolute obligation imposed on the overtaking vessel by article 24 \u201cto keep out of the way\u201d is satisfied by her using all reasonable care and skill, and if, having done so, a collision nevertheless ensues, she will not be held in fault.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] reversing the judgment of Martin J., Local Judge in Admiralty of the Admiralty District of British Columbia[2]. The action was brought by the owner of the U.S. motor-ship Wm. Donovan against the Norwegian ss. Hellen for damages caused by a collision betwen the two vessels in the Chehalis river, state of Washington, U.S.A., on April 10, 1924, at about 5.15 p.m. The Hellen counterclaimed. Martin L.J.A. held (2) that both vessels were equally in fault for the collision and consequently should bear the damage thereby occasiond in like proportion. This judgment was reversed by Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court (who heard the appeal with the assistance of two nautical assessors) who held (1) that the Wm. Donovan was wholly to blame for the collision, and that the plaintiff's action and cross-appeal should be dismissed and the defendant ship, the Hellen, should succeed in its defence and counterclaim in its action below, and in its appeal. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC. W. Craig K.C. for the appellant.\nMartin Griffin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The collision occurred on the Pacific Coast of the United States, in the estuary of the Chehalis River, in the lower part of the defined channel. The Wm. Donovan is a twin screw motor ship of 2,204 tons register, length 243 feet, beam 47 feet, which, on 10th April, 1924, was outward bound from Aberdeen, in the state of Washington, to San Pedro, California, laden with lumber. The Hellen is a single screw steamship of 3,270 tons register, length 413 feet, beam 52 feet, which left Aberdeen on that day, partly laden, to complete her lading at Vancouver, where, upon arrival, she was arrested, at the suit of the appellant company, to answer the collision damages. These vessels left their moorings about three o'clock in the afternoon and proceeded down the channel, which is marked by red buoys on the south side and by black buoys on the north, the latter bearing the uneven numbers. The Donovan was drawing about 23 feet of water, the Hellen about 6 inches more. The Donovan's speed is estimated at 8 knots, and that of the Hellen, which proved to be the faster, at about 8 or 9 knots. The Hellen saw the Donovan ahead of her in the channel at a distance of about a mile and a half, and this she gradually reduced until, about an hour later, just below no. 6 inner red buoy, she had approached to within eight to twelve hundred feet of the Donovan, when, it being apparent that the Hellen was overtaking, she blew two blasts of her whistle to indicate that she desired to pass the Donovan on the port side of the latter. The Donovan answered by two blasts, signifying her willingness that the Hellen should so pass. At this time the two ships were in a reach of the river which was straight, in a southwesterly direction, as far as no. 2 inner red buoy, a distance of nearly two miles. Here the river turns to the southward, and, from the bell buoy, no. 8 red, a little less than three-quarters of a mile below no. 2, pursues a more westerly direction to no. 6 outer red buoy, a distance of about a mile and a quarter, where it turns still further to the westward and follows that course, about west southwest, to no. 4 outer red buoy. It was in this part of the river, and about opposite to no. 4 outer red buoy, that the collision occurred. The width of the channel from no. 2 inner to no. 4 outer varies; it is 1,500 feet at no. 2; 2,200 feet at the bell buoy; 1,200 feet at no. 5, which is about midway between the bell buoy and no. 6 outer; 2,200 feet at the latter, and 1,200 feet at no. 4 outer, after which it becomes broader again to the southward until, at no. 2 outer, at or immediately inside of the bar, the width is 2,000 feet. The formation is sandy, and there is a note on the chart that the bar is subject to frequent changes and that the buoys are shifted accordingly.\nThe case of the Donovan is that the two vessels coming down the river in its several reaches had pursued practically parallel courses, the Hellen being abeam or nearly abeam of the Donovan from the turn at no. 2 inner, but that, when passing no. 4 outer, and about 400 feet to the northward, the Hellen came across the bow of the Donovan, causing the collision.\nThe case of the Hellen is not materially different, except that, according to the evidence of her witnesses, the Donovan, at the place of collision, instead of pursuing her parallel course, sheered abruptly to the southward and thus caused the impact. The Donovan would have it that the Hellen struck with her starboard bow in the fore rigging of the Donovan and forged ahead on the Donovan's port bow and stem, which was split. The Hellen on the other hand contends that the Donovan struck her abaft of amidships, practically head on, or, as one witness says, at an angle of forty-five degrees. The result was serious damage to the Donovan, and some damage to the Hellen, which had several stanchions bent, and some port lights broken.\nThe case was tried before the local judge in Admiralty of the Exchequer Court at Vancouver.\nIt was assumed for the purposes of the case that the Navigation Laws and Pilot Regulations for the Inland Waters of the United States on the Pacific Coast apply, and these are admitted to be as stated in paragraph 9 of the defence, and in a certified official pamphlet, published by the Government printing office at Washington, which was put in as an exhibit. These rules appear to be in substantial conformity with the general regulations for preventing collisions at sea, but they contain some special provisions. The pertinent clauses, as pleaded and admitted, are the following:\u2014\nArt. 18, Rule VIII: When steam vessels are running in the same direction, and the vessel which is astern shall desire to pass on the right or starboard hand of the vessel ahead, she shall give one short blast of the steam whistle, as a signal of such desire, and if the vessel ahead answers with one blast, she shall put her helm to port; or if she shall desire to pass on the left or port side of the vessel ahead, she shall give two short blasts of the steam-whistle as a signal of such desire, and if the vessel ahead answers with two blasts shall put her helm to starboard; or if the vessel ahead does not think it safe for the vessel astern to attempt to pass at that point, she shall immediately signify the same by giving several short and rapid blasts of the steam-whistle, not less than four, and under no circumstances shall the vessel astern attempt to pass the vessel ahead until such time as they have reached a point where it can be safely done, when said vessel ahead shall signify her willingness by blowing the proper signals. The vessel ahead shall in no case attempt to cross the bow or crowd upon the course of the passing vessel.\nArt. 21: Where, by any of these rules, one of the two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.\nArt. 23: Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed, stop or reverse.\nArt. 24: Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel. Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than two points abaft her beam, that is, in such a position, with reference to the vessel which she is overtaking that at night she would be unable to see either of that vessel's side-lights, shall be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.\nAs by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel she should, if in doubt, assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep out of the way.\nArt. 25: In narrow channels every steam vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or midchannel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.\nThe learned local judge found that the Hellen had not passed the Donovan at any time before the collision, although she had, about forty-five minutes previously, given the signal of her desire or intention to pass on the port side of the Donovan; that both vessels were, having regard to Art. 25, on the wrong side of the channel, though neither had charged the other with this breach of the regulations; that, by reason of the contraction of the channel in the reach where the collision occurred greater caution was required, and that the Hellen, having assumed the obligation of a passing ship, was pursuing a course which, if both ships maintained their speed, would bring her into dangerous proximity at least to the Donovan, if they both continued to keep the wrong side of the channel; while the Donovan, keeping her speed, was embarrassed by reason of the strange conduct of the Hellen, by which I understand the learned trial judge to refer to the fact, which is implicit in his judgment, that the Hellen, although having given her passing signal, had not availed herself of her subsequent opportunities to pass, but had maintained her parallel course at speed practically no more than equal to that of the Donovan. The local judge found the case very unusual and perplexing, and, after careful study, it appeared to him impossible to reconcile the conflicting evidence, \u201cor to accept in entirety either of the irreconciliable accounts of what occurred.\u201d In the result the only conclusion he could arrive at, satisfactory to himself, was that the collision was caused by the unseamanlike conduct of both vessels in not appreciating the dangerous position in which they were and taking proper steps to avoid it. From this judgment the Hellen (defendant, now respondent) appealed to the Exchequer Court, and the Donovan (plaintiff, now appellant) gave notice by way of cross-appeal to vary the judgment by awarding to the plaintiff the full amount of the damages claimed, and dismissing the cross-appeal.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal were heard by the learned President of the Exchequer Court, who agreed with the local judge that the Hellen was an overtaking ship, but this he thought was a circumstance of minor importance, and he found the governing consideration in the fact that the Donovan, after receiving the Hellen's passing signal, did not take up and keep a course on her starboard side of the channel, as required by Art. 25 for the navigation of narrow channels. He considered that at no. 2 outer buoy, where the channel turns to the southwestward\nthe Donovan should have steered for no. 3 starboard buoy from no. 2 port buoy, and kept that starboard course, and not have gone close to port buoy no. 4.\nIn summing up he said:\u2014\nI agree with the trial judge that the Donovan was on the wrong side of the channel at the times here material, and those who advise me are also of the same opinion. I also think that the Donovan crowded upon the course of the Hellen, and steered a course which was likely to cross the course of the Hellen, in violation of Rule 8, and in this my assessors also agree. I cannot, however, concur in the view of the learned trial judge that the Hellen, in relation to the Donovan, was on the wrong side of the channel. In attempting to pass the Donovan, her proper place to attempt to do so in view of the signals exchanged, was on the port side of the channel, and at least on the port side of the Donovan. Having to pass on the port side of the Donovan, if at all, there was no other place in which she could make the attempt than where she did, and except for the conduct of the Donovan, it at no time involved a risk of collision. I cannot agree that the Hellen was on the wrong side of the channel, at least the Donovan cannot be heard to say so. She had undoubted right to be there, though perhaps at her own risk in respect of other ships navigating on that side of the channel. A situation might be imagined wherein another ship going up the channel might say so, but not the Donovan. I think the Hellen did everything that could reasonably be expected of her in passing the Donovan, that she was not guilty of negligence in any respect, and that it was the conduct and seamanship of the Donovan alone that brought about the collision. In all this, the persons who advise me, agree.\nHe accordingly found that the collision was caused entirely by the fault of the Donovan. Now in considering the facts of the case there is little difficulty in finding the course, relative position and procedure of each of these vessels from the time when they first came into relation with each other down to the time when, approaching outer red buoy no. 4, one or the other was put on the intersecting course which led to the collision. Down to this point the evidence of the witnesses is in substantial agreement upon the facts which are material. When the Hellen blew her two blasts she was, according to her pilot's testimony, very close to the line of no. 6 and no. 4 inner red buoys, and the Donovan was ahead two or three ship's lengths on the Hellen's starboard bow. At that place the channel is very broad, upwards of 2,000 feet. The learned President refers to a passage in the testimony of the Master of the Donovan, where he is asked why, upon acknowledging the signal, he did not starboard his helm, and he answers\nNo. I didn't alter it because she was over\u2014and I was pretty well on the right side of the channel and she had plenty of room to pass me.\nFrom this the President infers that the Donovan was at that time on her starboard side of the channel, or upon a course directed to that side. It seems to be clear upon the evidence however that the Donovan was not, either at the time of the passing signal, or at any time subsequently, on her starboard side of the channel, or on a course which, having regard to its sinuosities, would lead her to that side. The master of the Donovan says, immediately following the passage which I have quoted:\u2014\nQ. You didn't alter your course?\nA. No, because he had plenty of room over on my port side and had plenty of room to pass.\nQ. How much room was there from side to side?\nA. Oh, in the side, I guess he was\u2014well, 100 feet anyway on the side.\nQ. He was 100 feet to the side of you?\nA. That being a little astern of me, of course.\nFrom this I understand his meaning to be that the Hellen had plenty of room to pass, because there was at least 100 feet of clear water between the port side of the Donovan and the starboard side of the Hellen upon the course which the latter was following, close to the line of the red buoys; from which it follows that the Donovan was at that time several hundred feet at least to the south of mid-channel. There is no express explanation in the evidence as to why both of these vessels were pursuing their way along the southern bank; but, looking at the chart, and assuming that neither vessel was impressed with the necessity of following strictly the starboard hand rule, it is easy to see that naturally the convenient and shorter course would be that which they followed. The river trends generally in a southwesterly direction; there is a very pronounced bend to the southwest at inner red buoy no. 2, and more gradually to the westward at the bell buoy, and again at outer red buoy no. 6, and the inside course is obviously the shorter. Both vessels seem to have considered that they had plenty of space on the southern side, and, shortly after the time when the signal was given, they actually met an incoming steamer, which they passed alternately port to port. It is significant, moreover, that the Hellen, neither in her preliminary act nor pleading, makes any complaint based upon Art. 25, and her case is founded entirely upon the alleged sudden sheer in the course of the Donovan at no. 4 outer buoy. The two ships went down the channel in its various reaches upon parallel courses, the Hellen close to the red buoys, the Donovan about 300 feet to the northward of the Hellen, the latter making the greater speed until the rounding of the point at no. 2 inner red buoy, where, according to her allegations and testimony, she passed the Donovan, which, being outside, would make the longer turn. At no. 6 outer they were however still abeam and at the same distance between their parallel courses. The weather was hazy, but the vessels were at all times within easy sight of each other. On approaching no. 6 outer the haze or fog prevented the Donovan temporarily from seeing no. 4 outer. Hitherto she had been steering by the buoys, but then, as no. 4 was not visible, she continued by compass, southwest by west half west, passing no. 6 outer on this course. Then there is a slight, though inconsequential, conflict in the testimony of the witnesses, the Hellen maintains that, after passing no. 6 outer, she steered for no. 4, which was at all times visible; her master says that between no. 4 and no. 6 the two vessels maintained their relative positions \u201cabout the same,\u201d keeping parallel courses. Ivor Vaumond, the Hellen's pilot, gives the following testimony in his direct examination:\u2014\nQ. Now, tell us what happened when you got down there towards no. 6 red buoy, what manoeuvres did the two ships execute?\nA. Well, after I got down to no. 6 red buoy I changed the course to starboard, getting lined up for the Bar which is on the turn.\nQ. You changed the course to starboard?\nA. Towards starboard, yes, ported the helm; so did the Donovan.\nQ. Now, how far apart were the two vessels when that manoeuvre was executed?\nA. Well, as near as I could estimate it never changed very much at any time. Of course, I wasn't all the time watching the channel, looking ahead.\nQ. About 300 feet then?\nA. Practically, just an estimate.\nCapt. Malmgren of the Donovan, who appears to be a fair and honest witness, says that\nthe Hellen seemed to alter her course towards no. 4. She wasn't going parallel with us any more, she was going over to the south jetty.\nThe south jetty is projected westerly from Point Chehalis along a sand-bank, at the edge of the deep water, from 1,200 feet or more to the southward of the line of no. 6 and no. 4 outer red buoys. Capt. Malmgren had directed his mate and second mate to look out for no. 4 buoy, and he says\nI was going on my course and I asked the mate and third mate if they seen it and they said \u201cNo.\u201d A couple of seconds after I looked with the glasses. I sighted the buoy (no. 4 outer) which was right ahead, the Hellen then being fully four to five ship's lengths on the port side of me.\nHe says that then he altered his course one-half point to the northward so as to clear no. 4 by 400 feet, and that his ship had been on that course for five-eighths of a mile, or about one-half the distance between no. 6 and no 4. Now if we are to have regard to the preliminary act and pleadings of the Hellen, to the evidence, and to the course of the trial, there is nothing material to the cause of the collision in the fact, to which Capt. Malmgren deposes, that on passing buoy no. 6, when no. 4 was shut out of view by the fog, he proceeded for a short distance upon a compass course which was found to require a correction of half a point to the northward when, midway between the buoys, no. 4 became visible. There is nothing in the case to suggest that the Hellen was thereby misled or embarrassed or affected in her navigation. On the contrary she did not observe any change in the bearing of the Donovan between no. 6 and no. 4, and she makes no complaint of the Donovan's course or navigation until the ships came abeam of no. 4. Immediately after the collision, on the very day of its occurrence, the master of the Hellen wrote to the owners of the Donovan informing them of the accident, saying:\u2014\nSteamer Hellen outbound from Aberdeen to sea running abreast of the M\/S Wm. Donovan, at no. 4 red buoy, between Pt. Chehalis and the bar, the M\/S Wm. Donovan suddenly took a sheer and collided with' the Norwegian steamer Hellen and done considerable damage. For this damage I hold you responsible.\nBy the preliminary act of the Hellen, which was filed on 22nd April, the specific fault alleged against the Donovan is that she was allowed to take a sudden sheer into the Hellen, and the facts are thus stated in the defence, which was pleaded on 16th July:\u2014\n5. Between the bell buoy and outer red buoy no. 4 the Wm. Donovan gained a little on the Hellen and when the latter ship was in a position close to the said outer red buoy no. 4 she had the Wm. Donovan off her starboard quarter about 300 feet distant. Both vessels were then steering parallel courses along the channel out to sea.\n6. When the vessels were in the said position close to outer red buoy no. 4 those on board the Hellen saw the Wm. Donovan suddenly alter her course and head directly for the side of the Hellen, which said alteration of course made a collision between the two vessels inevitable. Immediately thereafter the bluff of the port bow of the Wm. Donovan struck the starboard side of the Hellen abaft amidships doing damage to the Hellen.\nThe undisputed fact therefore is that the Donovan reached the longitude of the point of collision, at no. 4 buoy, at a distance of about 400 feet to the northward of that buoy, and that she passed no. 6 at the same distance, without in anywise disturbing or interfering with the course of the Hellen, and upon a course which the master and pilot of the Hellen describe as parallel with hers. The suggestion that the accident was due to the Donovan having gradually approached the Hellen upon an intersecting course, while running down the distance between no. 6 and no. 4, is thus negatived, not only by the formal allegations of the Hellen, but also by the testimony of the witnesses on both sides of the case, and is without justification in fact.\nIt was as to the Hellen's course and the occurrences abreast or nearly abreast of no. 4 that the serious dispute occurs. This is what the master of the Donovan says, referring to the time when, five-eighths of a mile to the east- ward of the buoy, he altered his course half a point to the northward:\u2014\nQ. That is the time you saw the Hellen approaching you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And the Hellen was then two to three ship lengths away?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you want to increase that. Tell us how far?\nA. No, I could not tell you how far. It is impossible.\nQ. 500 to 750 feet, to the best of your belief?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And she started to approach you and draw in towards you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And then finally when she got near the no. 4 she shouted out \u201cget over\u201d or words to that effect?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How near were you to no. 4 then?\nA. We were close up to no. 4.\nOn the other hand, the master of the Hellen says:\u2014\nWe proceeded the usual way down the channel, keeping close to the red buoys all the way. The Donovan seemed to keep closer over towards the black buoys and made a little shorter cut there like, so by the time we got down between no. 4 and 6, the outer buoys, she had gained a little on us again, and about between 3 and 6 buoys I would say that her stem was a little abaft of our amidships.\nQ. That was between no. 4 and no. 6 outer buoy?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Being the red buoys?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Just state the position of the two ships, Captain, then, will you?\nA. At that time?\nQ. At that time, you mean when the ships were in a position between\u2014\nA. No. 4 and 6 buoys.\nQ. 4 and 6 red buoys?\nA. Yes, she was running pretty near a parallel course, I should say about 300 feet apart.\nQ. Which ship was leading?\nA. We was ahead of the Donovan.\nQ. How far astern of you was the Donovan?\nA. Her stem was a little abaft amidships.\nQ. Abaft amidships of the Hellen?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That was the position of the two ships just after passing no. 6 outer red buoy?\nA. Yes, I should say.\nQ. About what time was this roughly?\nA. Oh, that should be about five o'clock.\nQ. And what was the weather like at that time?\nA. It was nearly the same as when we started, a little misty, but quite visible. We could see all we wanted to see.\nQ. Could you see quite clearly all the buoys in the channel?\nA. Yes, sir, oh, yes. Q. Explain what happened after you passed no. 6 outer buoy?\nA. Just a little bit before we got to no. 4 buoy or practically abreast of no. 4 buoy I happened to look out and I saw that the Donovan was getting a little nearer and I drew the pilot's attention to it. I said: \u201cLook, she is getting closer.\u201d The pilot then went over to the side of the bridge and shouted over to the other ship, \u201cWhere are you going, why don't you keep over,\u201d or something of that kind. He said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d That was quite clear, and somebody that I took for the captain, came out from the wheelhouse and shouted back, \u201cI am broke down.\u201d\nQ. Yes, then what happened?\nA. The pilot then came right in amidships and ordered the wheel hard astarboard.\nQ. What was the Donovan doing at that time?\nA. Heading right down on us at a right angle of ninety degrees. He did this, as we could see that a collision would take place, and he thought it would lessen the impact of the blow by swinging parallel with her.\nQ. Could anything have been done at that time to avoid a collision?\nA. Nothing could have been done at the time she swung over, it was done in a second.\nQ. Where did the collision take place?\nA. At that time I looked at my watch, I took particular note and it was just 4.13.\nQ. Or 5.13?\nA. 5.13 at the time and I was abreast of no. 4 outer buoy.\nQ. Abreast of no. 4 outer buoy the collision took place?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And this you have been telling us about, your telling the pilot that the ship was coming near and so on, that was the work of a few seconds?\nA. The work of a few seconds, the shortest possible time.\nQ. Did the Donovan slow down?\nA. I could not say. It looked to me as if she was coming full speed ahead all the time. That is hard to say, but it looked to me that way, she was coming down at such a speed.\nQ. Where did the Donovan strike you?\nA. She struck us about thirty or forty feet abaft of amidships.\nQ. Then what did she do?\nA. She bumped us and bent some stanchions, she bumped us again and bumped again and slid along the Hellen after doing some damage until she got clear.\nQ. Did she do any damage to the Hellen?\nA. Yes, sir, she did.\nCaptain Malmgren was impressed with the view that, after he had acknowledged the passing signal, his duty required him to keep his course and speed, and he is not charged to have done otherwise, except, in the last few hundred feet, at no. 4 outer red buoy. He denies any sheer towards the Hellen, or any breakdown of his machinery, and he and his witnesses maintain that there was no change of the Donovan's course in this locality. It was not until the collision became imminent, by the approach of the Hellen, that the Donovan ported her helm, and later reversed her engines. Capt. Malmgren says that his ship did not answer her hard aport helm, and this he attributes to the proximity of the Hellen, which was then coming very close. But, however that may be, there was no defect in the working of his steering gear. The ship had steered perfectly on the various courses down river, and did so after the collision, on the reverse of these courses to Hoquiam for repairs. It is, I think, apparent that neither the port helm nor the reversing on the Donovan had any substantial effect with relation to the collision or its consequences. The Hellen was only 40 feet or 50 feet off when the Donovan reversed, and the porting and reversing were too late to be of any use.\nThere is no finding by either of the learned judges who have considered the case that the Donovan suddenly sheered to the southward. It is only if she did that the Hellen can be held free from blame. I find nothing in the circumstances to indicate a greater probability that the Donovan abruptly changed her course to the southward than that the Hellen more gradually approached her from that direction. On the contrary, the Donovan was on her course, and was passing no. 4 buoy about 400 feet outside of it, as she had passed the other port buoys coming down channel. If she deviated from this course and approached the Hellen head on, or at any lesser angle which would bring the ships into contact in so short a space and time, it must have been by reason of a hard astarboard helm, but in the execution of her voyage at that place the Donovan had no use for a starboard helm. If the Hellen had the obligation of an overtaking ship, as both the learned judges find she had, she was under absolute obligation to keep out of the way of the Donovan. In fact, however, her pilot and master did not realize their duty, they considered that they had already passed the Donovan, that the latter had become the following ship, and that the course and navigation of the Hellen were no longer burdened or affected by any requirement of the law to keep clear. This appears, not only by the evidence, but is set up by the pleadings, paragraphs 4 and 10 of the defence. The Hellen's stem was admittedly ahead of the Donovan's. The officers of the Hellen say that the Donovan's stem was abaft the beam of the Hellen. What actually happened is somewhat in the region of conjecture, but there is evidence that those responsible for the navigation of the Hellen were no longer keeping the Donovan in mind. There seems to have been no efficient lookout on the position or movements of the Donovan. The ships were coming up to the buoy, upon passing which they would naturally alter their course to the southward. The pilot of the Hellen was looking forward, he did not realize that the vessels were approaching each other until they were nearly in contact, when his attention was directed to the Donovan by Capt. Ommundsen, who said that he happened to look out and saw the Donovan coming down at an angle of 90 degrees, when nothing could have been done to avoid the collision. I have already quoted his evidence. The chief officer of the Hellen, who went on watch at four o'clock, says:\u2014\nQ. When you first saw that there was going to be a collision, could anything have been done by the Hellen to avoid an accident?\nA. No, it was too late. The only thing to do was to try and minimize the damage.\nand again:\u2014\nQ. It all happened in the course of one continuous act; the Wm. Donovan moved to port?\nA. Suddenly moved to port.\nQ. And struck you?\nA. Yes, shortly after.\nQ. How long after?\nA. The time it would take to go from 300 feet and right into the Hellen.\nBendiksen, the able bodied seaman, who was at the wheel of the Hellen, and taking his orders from the pilot, naturally did not see the Donovan. He says he could not see as he stood inside the wheelhouse but \u201che says when the Donovan went on him he got the order hard astarboard.\u201d\nThe witnesses agree that the collision occurred in the channel opposite, or nearly opposite, no. 4 outer buoy, and the evidence to which I have referred is, to my mind, suggestive of the fact that the pilot and officers of the Hellen, believing that they had passed the Donovan, and that she was already \u201cfinally past and clear,\u201d in order to avoid the buoy, and preparatory to the change of course which was necessary upon passing it, had come too far to the northward on a course to cross the bow of the Donovan, which their stem was leading by half a ship's length. I think it more likely that the accident occurred in this manner than by the extraordinary event of a breakdown in the machinery of the Donovan, or the starboarding of her helm; and moreover if, as admitted, immediately before the vessels assumed their conflicting courses, they were on parallel lines about 300 feet apart, and if, as said by the Hellen's witnesses, the Donovan's stem was then abaft her beam, it is impossible that, if the Hellen maintained her speed, and the course which she claims to have pursued, the Donovan could have come into contact with her where they say she did by any abrupt change of her course.\nIt must, I think, be conceded that the Hellen was the overtaking ship and that the passing rules applied. These rules, in their present application, were enacted specially for inland waters, and must therefore have been intended to operate in rivers, where it is necessary for a vessel frequently to change its course, following the windings of the channel, and I should think that a vessel keeps her course, within the meaning of the rules, if, in proceeding from one reach of a channel to another, she keeps the course which would ordinarily be expected of a vessel making that passage, and, as I have said, there is no complaint here that the Donovan, after acknowledging the passing signal, pursued any general course other than that which was anticipated.\nThe character of the obligation which the law casts upon an overtaking vessel is shown by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the well known case of The Saragossa[3], where Lord Esher, M.R., said, referring to the collision regulations then in force:\u2014\nIf the ships were an overtaking vessel and a vessel being overtaken, then the first rule is this: \u201cEvery ship, whether a sailing ship or a steamship, overtaking another, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken ship.\u201d That is an absolute rule, equivalent to an Act of Parliament. If that rule stood alone, whatever the overtaken ship did, however much she might deviate from her course, the other as bound absolutely to keep out of her way, and nothing can excuse it except inevitable accident. There was a case in the House of Lords in which the nautical advisers found that a man was put into such a position with regard to the other ship by the fault of that ship that any sailor of ordinary care and skill would have done just what the man did. The House of Lords held, nevertheless, that he was within the rule, and was bound to keep out of the way. It was a severe finding, I think\u2014it overruled the Court of Appeal\u2014but it shows that the rule is absolute. What is the effect of it? Why you say to a man, \u201cYou are to keep out of the way. We don't tell you how to keep out of the way. It may be by starboarding or by stopping and reversing, or going at full speed. It may be in any way you please. You are to have the choice; you have the obligation of doing it which way you will, but do it you must.\u201d It was thought right that if you put that tremendous obligation upon the overtaking ship you must give him all the means to carry it out, and therefore there is another rule: \u201cWhere by the above rule, one of two ships is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course.\u201d That is, that the ship on whom the heavy obligation lies may not be hampered by anything the other does. He must have his full liberty to go ahead of you, astern of you, within ten feet of you on one side or the other. If he is to have that obligation you must keep your course, so that he may not be hampered by you in any way as to his choice. Then it seems to me that that at once makes the rules correlative, and that the obligation on the one and the obligation on the other exists at the same time.\nThis exposition of the rule may, I think, be accepted for the present case, save as it is affected or qualified by the additional express provisions, which were not introduced into the general collision regulations until 1897, that\nthe vessel ahead shall in no way attempt to cross the bow or crowd upon the course of the passing vessel,\nand that, when a vessel becomes an overtaking vessel,\nno subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.\nI am unable, after attentive consideration of the evidence, to find that the Donovan materially altered her course, or that she attempted to crowd upon the course of the Hellen, or that the Donovan executed any movement material to the case, which would affect the bearing as between her and the Hellen, which was not, or should not have been, reasonably anticipated by the latter. Even were it otherwise, the enactment is specific that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every vessel, overtaking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel;\nand, having regard to the whole evidence in the case, I do not think that the Hellen has satisfied the burden which rests upon her to excuse her collision with the overtaken ship, or to set aside the original findings against her.\nI would experience some difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the Donovan should be held at fault in any respect, notwithstanding that both vessels were persistently navigating the channel on the side opposite to that to which they were equally directed by the regulations, were it not for the fact that the effect of the passing signal, Art. 18, Rule VIII, was to commit the Hellen to a passage on the port hand of the Donovan, and therefore that the Hellen could not be in any manner impeded or embarrassed, in the course which she had notified, by the Donovan going further to the northward; and I am disposed to think that when the master of the Donovan realized that the Hellen was on a course to cross his bow he should not have been so late in porting his helm. I do not think that in obeying and construing the rules he observed due regard to the dangers of navigation and collision; I think that, in the special circumstances of the case, good seamanship required that he should give the Hellen more sea-room, and for this reason, I am not prepared to reverse the finding of the learned local judge as to the responsibility of the Donovan.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, and restore the judgment at the trial.\nAnglin C.J.C. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion prepared by my brother Newcombe. I regret that I cannot agree in his conclusion.\nThe evidence, as I read it, supports the view of the learned President of the Exchequer Court that the collision was really caused by the Donovan's fault in failing, after having assented to the Hellen's passing her to port, to maintain her course, and in crowding upon the course of the Hellen, in contravention of Arts. 21 and 18 (Rule VIII).\nThe evidence of Malmgren, master of the Donovan (which I find unreliable except where he makes admissions adverse to the interest of his vessel), is that, up to a certain point, he had been steering by the red (or south) buoys and had maintained a course some 300-750 feet to the north of the Hellen; that after passing red buoy no. 6 his vision of outer red buoy no. 4 was obscured by fog or haze (which does not seem to have troubled anybody on the Hellen) and remained so for some appreciable time; that he again saw red buoy no. 4 when about five-eighths of a mile, or 3,375 feet, east of it and found his ship heading for it, or, according to his earlier and more probable story, with that buoy a quarter of a point on her starboard bow; that he altered his course half a point northerly when 4 or 5 ship lengths (about 1,100 feet) from buoy no. 4, enough, he says, \u201cto clear\u201d that buoy, to which he also says that both vessels \u201cpassed close,\u201d although he elsewhere maintains that his vessel was over 300 feet to the north of the buoy; that shortly before the collision, when the Donovan was only 50 or 60 feet away from the Hellen, he heard the pilot of the latter shout to him \u201cget over\u201d or words to that effect.\nI regard as most significant the fact that Malmgren did not reply to that demand by saying \u201ckeep over yourselves,\u201d or something of the kind, as one would have expected had he thought himself on his proper course and the Hellen encroaching upon it, which is now contended. Apparently conscious of his own default at that time, according to witnesses for the Hellen he answered \u201cI am broken down\u201d or \u201cI can't handle her,\u201d or something to that effect, and, according to his own story, \u201cI am trying to get her back.\u201d But, he says, the Donovan did not answer her helm, although it was then put hard over to port. She did not come \u201cback,\u201d i.e., to her proper course, until after she had run into the Hellen.\nOpposite buoy no. 4 the channel is 1,200 feet wide and there is no reason why the Donovan should not have passed that buoy at a distance of some 700 or 800 feet from it. Maintaining her course as it had been up to buoy no. 6 she would have passed it some 400 to 600 feet on her port side. The course of the Hellen lay to the north of buoy no. 4 and she was obliged to keep to the north of it in order to remain in the channel. She was steering as close to the red buoys on the south side as it was prudent for her to go. Thus, as found by the learned trial judge, she passed within 40 or 50 feet of the no. 6 outer red buoy, the south buoy immediately above and about 1\u00bc miles distant from outer red buoy no. 4. When passing buoy no. 6 the Donovan was about 300 feet further out in the channel and running on a course practically parallel to that of the Hellen. From this point the Hellen steered a course to carry her past buoy no. 4 close on her port side. That buoy was plainly visible to her pilot from the time she passed buoy no. 6.\nThe weight of the evidence points to the collision having occurred some 50 to 100 feet to the north of outer red buoy no. 4\u2014as put by the learned President, \u201cquite close to no. 4 buoy.\u201d It seems obvious to me that during the time her master says that his vision was obscured by fog or haze the course of the Donovan must have been materially altered to the southward so as to crowd upon that of the Hellen. His statement that when the fog lifted he had no. 4 red buoy slightly on his starboard bow five-eighths of a mile ahead makes this abundantly clear. In fact he eventually crowded in upon the course of the Hellen so much that he did not leave her sufficient room to pass buoy no. 4. This alteration of course and crowding in became apparent to the officers of the Hellen too late to permit of their doing anything to avoid the collision then apparently inevitable. The evidence does not show that they were at fault in not having sooner realized their danger. When they did perceive it, all they could do was to sheer off in order to minimize the results. The master of the Donovan, when 3,300 feet east of buoy no. 4, perceived that buoy one-quarter of a point on his starboard bow. Although he knew he was running on a course which would intersect that of the Hellen, he apparently maintained that course for 2,200 feet and changed it, at the most half a point, only when about 1,100 feet to the east of buoy no. 4. Assuming that he still had that buoy one-quarter of a point on his starboard bow when he made this change of course, it would bring his ship less than 60 feet to the north of that buoy when abreast of it. He did not put his helm hard-a-port until the pilot of the Hellen shouted to him to \u201cget over\u201d\u2014the two ships being then only 50 or 60 feet apart. That the Donovan failed to answer\u2014or to \u201cget back\u201d\u2014her master admits.\nIn my opinion the proximate cause of the collision was breach of articles 21 and 18 by the Donovan after her mas- ter had assented to the Hellen passing his vessel to port and his negligent failure to rectify that error, rather than to any blameworthy omission on the part of the Hellen to observe article 24.\nI agree in the view expressed by the learned President of the Exchequer Court, with the concurrence of his assessors, that after passing the no. 6 buoy \u201cthe Donovan steered a course which was likely to cross that of the Hellen\u201d\u2014that \u201cin view of the signals exchanged\u201d the Hellen was rightly \u201con the port side of the Donovan\u201d endeavouring to pass her, and that, \u201cexcept for the conduct of the Donovan the attempt (of the Hellen to pass) at no time involved a risk of collision\u201d\u2014that \u201cthe Hellen did everything that could reasonably be expected of her in passing the Donovan, that she was not guilty of negligence in any respect, and that it was the conduct and seamanship of the Donovan alone that brought about the collision.\u201d \u201cIn all this,\u201d adds the learned president, \u201cthe persons who advise me agree.\u201d\nWhether the deviation in the course of the Donovan was intentional in an endeavour to take a short cut in passing buoy no. 4, either regardless of the rights of the Hellen or in the mistaken belief that the Hellen's course would carry her out of the channel and to the south of buoy no. 4, or, as seems more likely, it was due to bad seamanship during the time when the master says his vision was obscured by haze or fog, and the failure of his belated attempt to rectify his error should be ascribed to some defect in the Donovan's steering apparatus, or to some other cause, it is a little difficult to determine; but that the Donovan did in fact change her course so that it would intersect that of the Hellen; that her master consciously persisted in that course for two-fifths of a mile and then altered it too little, and that the Donovan did in fact crowd upon the course of the Hellen and that her master made no attempt to correct his error until it was too late\u2014all this in my opinion, upon the evidence, admits of no doubt.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court was, I respectfully agree, entirely right in his interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201ccourse\u201d in article 21. The Roanoke[4]; The Velocity[5]; The Echo[6]. The view taken by that learned judge that correlative to the obligation of the Hellen, as an overtaking ship, \u201cto keep out of the way\u201d of the Donovan (art. 24) was that of the latter \u201cto maintain her course\u201d (Art. 21) and \u201cin no case to attempt * * * to crowd upon the course of the passing vessel\u201d (Art. 18) is also abundantly warranted by the authorities. \u201cThe rule requiring a ship to keep her course and speed must be strictly observed.\u201d The Olympic and H.M.S. Hawke[7]. The guide of the overtaking vessel is the presumption that the other will keep her course. The Roanoke4. To excuse herself the Donovan must show that her departure from her course was necessary to avoid immediate danger and was no more than was necessary. Marsden, Collisions at Sea, 8th Ed., p. 388. There is no suggestion of anything of the kind. Where the leading ship alters her course in contravention of article 21, the otherwise absolute obligation imposed on the overtaking vessel by article 24 \u201cto keep out of the way\u201d is satisfied by such overtaking ship using all reasonable care and skill, and if, having done so, a collision should nevertheless ensue she will not be held in fault. The Saragossa[8]; The Effie Gray v. Inkula[9]. The \u201ctremendous obligation\u201d imposed on the overtaking ship by article 24 implies that its discharge must not be hampered: by the leading ship; the two rules are correlative. If the ship which is bound to do so fails to keep her course and takes away part of the water to which the other is entitled she hampers her and the latter's \u201cabsolute obligation to keep out of the way\u201d is gone.\nFor these reasons I would affirm the judgment appealed from.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This action arises out of a collision between the steamship Wm. Donovan owned by appellant company, and the respondent when proceeding down the Chehalis river in the state of Washington and through Grays harbour out to sea. The course as a whole is somewhat tortuous and liable to confuse mariners, strangers to it, in giving evidence, and hence, I imagine, arises some of the conflicting evidence presented.\nThe appellant brought this action which was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Martin, the local judge in Admiralty; and the respondent counterclaimed.\nThe learned trial judge finding they were, at the point of collision, both on the wrong side of the channel, though sailing in the same direction down the river, found that both were to blame and hence divided the damages and costs.\nThe rule he invoked is, I take it, to meet the cases of vessels meeting each other head to head in a narrow channel and the contingencies possible in such a case, but, I respectfully submit, that rule does not apply to this case, and especially where no other vessels going the other way implicated or mentioned.\nHence the present respondent appealed, from so much of said judgment as awarded against the said respondent a moiety of the damages and costs, to the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nThat appeal came on for the hearing thereof at Vancouver before the President of said court, assisted by two nautical assessors.\nAfter hearing and duly considering said appeal the said President of said court allowed the said appeal with costs; dismissed the present appellant's action with costs, and allowed the present respondent's counterclaim with costs.\nAs I quite fully agree with the reasoning of the said learned President, assigned in support of his said judgment, I need not repeat same here.\nI may be permitted, however, to add that having read the entire evidence, I too have come to the conclusion that on the conflict of evidence between the two sides of the contending parties the weight of evidence on all material points in issue is entirely in favour of the present respondent.\nThe evidence adduced by some of the witnesses for the present appellant, in regard to the essential features in dispute, was for the most part very unsatisfactory, as I read it, and especially that of the appellant's captain in charge at the time. The learned trial judge was charitable enough to assign that feature to his want of knowledge of English to an extent that I cannot agree with, though I hope making all due allowance for the want of knowledge of English and for the advantage the learned trial judge had over me in seeing the witness.\nThe dense haze which he alleges prevented him from seeing as others did can hardly be attributed to want of English.\nNor can the contradictions of his own evidence taken before the court of investigation be so, I submit.\nAnd his theory of suction seems to have been only a guess and dispelled by evidence of an expert on that point.\nThe chief evidence of the respondent's witnesses was taken de bene esse as they could not foe detained in the country and hence the appellant had the advantage of knowing it all before the trial and what it had to meet.\nAnd that story is given, on the whole, very fairly I think, though of course in all such cases there are apt to be differences of recollection and of apprehension.\nI am not at all inclined to hold that the appellant's captain was a wilful liar. It was, in my humble estimation, unfortunate that his peculiar mode of thought was likely to be upset by the least excitement. And this probably caused him to take inconsistent steps at the time of the approaching collision, as well as being much puzzled on the cross-examination he had to meet.\nI refer to this phase of the case briefly lest anyone should be inclined to challenge the narrow ground on which the President of the Exchequer Court goes, though I agree with him.\nI merely desire to point out that there is much more to be said in support of his judgment in the line of thought I am adverting to than he has given expression to, or I either, except to indicate that independently of the first ground the evidence as a whole renders it impossible for me to consent to the appellant succeeding herein.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mayers, Lane & Thomson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Griffin, Montgomery & Smith.\n[1] [1926] Ex.

In such a case the question to be considered, with regard to jurisdiction, is the value of the subject matter as between the parties.\nMOTION by respondents by way of appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order affirming jurisdiction.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, reversing the order of Mowat J., had declared that the defendant Pong was trustee for the plaintiffs of a certain lease of premises used in the carrying on of a Chinese laundry, and ordered that the defendant Pong assign the lease to the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs should covenant in the assignment to indemnify the defendant against the lessee\u2019s covenants contained in the lease[1].\nThe defendant Pong appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and moved before the Registrar of that Court for an order affirming its jurisdiction to hear his appeal. The Registrar\u2019s decision, delivered 21st June, 1926, was as follows:\nThe sole question for determination on this motion to affirm jurisdiction, is with respect to the elements which can be taken into consideration when estimating the value of a leasehold property in view of its commercial possibilities.\nIn Toronto premises can not be used for the purpose of carrying on a Chinese laundry except with the approval of the ratepayers in the neighbourhood. The premises in question have received that approval. A laundry business has been established there for many years. The premises therefore have an exceptional value for this special purpose. I have no doubt on the evidence, that without this privilege, the property would not have a leasehold value sufficient to give the court jurisdiction, but with the privilege, I think the amount in controversy is more than $2,000. I therefore affirm the jurisdiction of the court; costs in the cause.\nIf I am wrong in the above expressed view, there is nothing to prevent the respondent, when the case comes to be heard on the merits, from moving to quash for want of jurisdiction. No order made by me can confer jurisdiction, if otherwise there is none.\nThe respondents moved by way of appeal from the Registrar\u2019s order affirming jurisdiction, on the ground that the sole question at issue was the right to possession of the premises under the lease in question, and that any rights conferred upon the occupant of the premises by virtue of a license from the city of Toronto to conduct a laundry business were not appurtenant to the said lease as between the parties to this appeal.\nAfter argument, judgment was rendered dismissing the motion with costs, the Chief Justice stating that the members of the court were all agreed that the proper question to be considered was the value of the property as between the parties, and it was impossible to say that the Registrar had erred in his appreciation of the evidence.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nFraser Raney for the motion.\nNorman Sommerville K.C. contra.\n[1] (1925) 56 Ont.

The facts are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nThe defendant's appeal was from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from an order of Morrison J., refusing, on the return to an order nisi for habeas corpus, to release the defendant from close custody under an order or warrant of deportation, dated 21st March, 1923, made by the Deputy Minister of Immigraton and Colonization.\nO. M. Biggar, K.C. for the motion.\nW. Schroeder contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The respondent moves to quash this appeal on the ground that it is an appeal \"in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a criminal charge\" within the exception to the jurisdiction of this court made by s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act (as amended 1920, c. 32).\nThe appellant is an alien and was convicted after his entry into Canada of an offence under para. (d) of s. 4 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923. Section 25 of that statute enacts that any alien so convicted\nshall, upon the expiry or sooner determination of the imprisonment imposed on such conviotion, be kept in custody and deported in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to enquiry, detention and deportation. The warrant on which the appellant is held in custody awating deportation shews on its face that he is so held, no doubt under the authority of s. 25 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, as a consequence of his conviction of an offence against para. (d) of s. 4 of that statute. The scope of any enquiry under The Immigration Act in such a case must be limited to ascertaining officially that the person in question was an alien, that he had been convicted after his entry into Canada of an offence within the ambit of s. 25 and that the period of imprisonment imposed upon him on such conviction had expired or been determined. It follows, in our opinion that any \" proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus \" directed to bring the convicted alien before the court in order that the legality of his detention under such warrant may be enquired into are necessarily proceedings \" arising out of a criminal charge \" within the meaning of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nIt is nihil ad rem that the alien has served the sentence imposed on him, except that the expiry or determination of his term of imprisonment is by s. 25 made a pre-requisite to the custody for, and the deportation which it ordains. The statute, in addition to such imprisonment as may be imposed, subjects him as a result of his conviction and, therefore, as something directly flowing from the judicial finding of his guilt of the criminal charge laid against him, to the further consequences prescribed by s. 25. It is impossible to say that the custody and deportation imperatively ordered by that enactment do not \" arise out of the criminal charge\" of which the alien was convicted; it is equally impossible to maintain that curial proceedings to enquire into the legality of the detention pending deportation do not likewise so arise.\nThe motion to quash is granted.\nMotion granted.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. J. B. Mellish.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. Meredith.\n[1] [1926] 2 W.W.R. 734.\n"

In an action under The Fatal Accidents Act, 1922, c. 196, by the widow of a person who had been in attendance at a banquet given by an association in the defendant's hotel and, after the conclusion thereof, met his death by falling into a private service elevator shaft, a general verdict was rendered by a jury in favour of the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered for $40,000 damages. Upon appeal to the Appellate Division, judgment was reversed and the action was dismissed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (22 Alta. L.R. 237), that, upon the undisputed facts disclosed at the trial, the deceased was not at the time and place of the accident, entitled to be treated as an invitee, and, as the defendant's liability must be determined in view of its duty to a mere licensee, there was no failure of duty to the deceased on the part of the defendant company. Beyond the material facts in proof and their fair implication, everything was left to conjecture; and, although the courts must be careful to distinguish between the separate functions of judge and jury and to avoid the disposition of a case upon inferences inconsistent with findings which there is evidence to sustain, there was no evidence in this case to support the finding implied in the general verdict that the deceased was invited, or was justified to believe that he was invited, by the defendant company to enter or to use the private passage, or to meddle with the door of the service elevator.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Walsh J., with a jury and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellant is the widow and administratrix of the estate of one A. M, Knight, in his lifetime a barrister in the office of the Attorney General of Alberta, who was accidentally killed in the MacDonald Hotel in Edmonton, which is owned and operated by the respondent company. On the night of December 20, 1924, the Alberta Bar Asso- ciation, of which the deceased was a member, held a banquet in the hotel at which the deceased was present. While in the hotel he fell down an elevator shaft and was killed. The action was brought under the Fatal Accidents Act for damages. It was tried with a jury and a verdict for $40,000 damages was rendered. That judgment was reversed by the Appellate Court. The trial judge instructed the jury that the deceased, in attending the banquet, was an invitee of the company and that the duty owed the deceased was something more than was owed a mere licensee. The Appellate Court held that although it was true that the deceased was the invitee when attending the banquet he was, at the time and place of the accident, a mere licensee, as at that time the banquet was over; and the Appellate Court held further that whatever duty might be owed a mere licensee along the main corridors or immediately adjacent thereto', there was no duty owed him to keep an elevator door free from danger, situated as it was at the end of a service passage which the public had no right or reason to use.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and H. A. Friedman for the appellant.\nN. D. Maclean K.C. for the respondent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The appellant's husband met his death on the evening of 20th December, 1924, at or about 11.30 o'clock, by falling down the shaft of the private service elevator in the MacDonald Hotel at the city of Edmonton, a distance of about 30 feet. He was a barrister, residing and practising at Edmonton, and, that evening, had attended a banquet held on the mezzanine floor of the hotel by the Alberta Bar Association, of which he was a member. The respondent company, the proprietor, carrying on the business of the hotel, had provided and served the banquet for the Bar Association. The service of the dinner had concluded before 10 o'clock, and some speeches followed, but after these were finished, and sometime previously to the accident, the banquet had broken up, and the guests had left the mezzanine floor. Shortly before 11.30 o'clock, the deceased had visited a room on the 2nd floor, which was occupied by a guest of the hotel, and where some friends of the guest were, but he remained there only a few minutes; he enquired of a witness whether there were a lavatory in the room, and, being informed that there was none, said that\nhe had looked all down the corridor and couldn't find one.\nThere were in fact two marked lavatories, one at each end of this corridor. He was next seen, after a short interval, in the corridor contiguous to the banquet-room which leads from the main stairway and passenger elevators. This corridor runs east and west. The deceased was seen at the east end of the corridor, the main stairway and passenger lifts being situated to the westward. Adjoining the banquet-room, the entrances to which from the main corridor are on the north side of the latter, there is a narrow corridor or passage leading from the main corridor to the service elevator, a distance of about 15 feet, and from the east side of this passage a stairway leads down to a cloak room in connection with the main dining room on the floor below. The stairway extends only between the main or ground floor and the mezzanine floor, and is used for service purposes exclusively. The passage from the main corridor to the private service elevator is of a width at the entrance of about 3 feet. There is no door, but, within the entrance, the passage has a uniform width of about 4\u00bd feet. This space was in part occupied by a buffet or sideboard, used for service purposes, which stood in the middle of the passage against the wall on its western side, and was of the dimensions of about 7 feet by 2\u00bd feet, so that there would be, opposite to the sideboard, a space of not more than 2\u00bd feet between the sideboard and the rail which guards the well of the private stairway. It is said by the coroner, who visited the place immediately after the accident, that\nit was very narrow between the sideboard and the railing to get in there.\nThe passage was used by the waiters for service on the mezzanine floor, and, during the dinner, had been occupied by the attendants who served the wine. It provided no accommodation for the use of guests.\nAt the time when the deceased was last seen in the mezzanine corridor he crossed that corridor and went into this private service passage, and to the door of the elevator, which is at the end of it, where he stood rattling the door. A few minutes later he was found in an unconscious and dying condition on the concrete at the bottom of the shaft. The door of the elevator was closed when the deceased went to it, but there is evidence that the lock was defective, and apt to be released because of insufficient tension. When the deceased fell the lift itself was at one of the floors above, and in its descent the attendant found the mezzanine door open, and closed it, and, when he reached the basement, he discovered the deceased lying in the pit.\nThe trial judge describes the lift in his charge to the jury. He says:\nThe elevator itself was, in appearance a typical elevator. I don't mean to say that it was anything like the two large passenger elevators which we saw in the hotel when we were over there on Tuesday, but it was a structure built of frame with glass in the upper part and some kind of wire netting, if I am not mistaken, behind the glass. There was no handle on the door, there were push buttons beside it\u2014up and down, the regulation buttons that are observable at the side of every other elevator, a dial above the door to indicate the location of the elevator cage.\nIt should be added however that, as the lift was not used by passengers, and was operated only by the private service waiter, the push buttons and dial had not been connected with the mechanism, and did not serve their purposes.\nImmediately to the eastward of the passage leading to this private elevator, and beyond the stairway, was the pantry or serving room for the mezzanine floor, which opened off the main mezzanine corridor, so that there was, adjoining the private dining rooms, which on this occasion had been thrown into one large banquet-room a considerable space or block, comprising the private passage, stairway, elevators and pantry, devoted exclusively to service purposes.\nThe action was brought by the widow and administratrix of the deceased on behalf of herself and her children, of whom there were four, to recover compensation under the statute, and it resulted in a general verdict for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered for $40,000 damages. The defendant company appealed and the Appellate Division allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. The Chief Justice, who pronounced the judgment on behalf of the court, after reviewing the evidence, referred to the cases of Walker v. Midland Railway Co.[2]; Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Proctor[3], and Connor v. Cornell[4], and particularly to the speech of Lord Selborne in the first named case, where it is said, at p. 490:\nI think it impossible to hold that the general duty of an innkeeper to take proper care for the safety of his guests extends to every room in the house, at all hours of night and day, irrespective of the question whether any such guests may have a right or some reasonable cause to be there. The duty must, I think, be limited to those places into which guests may reasonably be supposed to be likely to go, in the belief reasonably entertained that they are invited or entitled to do so.\nAnd the learned Chief Justice concluded, having regard to these authorities, that it was established by the undisputed facts, that at the time and place of the accident the deceased was not entitled to be treated as an invitee, and that therefore there was no failure of duty to him on the part of the defendant company.\nI have considered the evidence very carefully and I do not think that the judgment of the Appellate Division should be disturbed. The material facts in proof have been stated. Beyond these and their fair implications, everything is left to conjecture. The court must of course be careful to distinguish between the separate functions of judge and jury and to avoid the disposition of a case upon inferences inconsistent with findings which there is evidence to sustain. But here the case does not depend upon contradicted evidence, and I find no support for the finding, which, in view of the charge of the learned trial judge, must necessarily be implied in the general verdict, that the deceased was invited, or was justified to believe that he was invited, by the respondent to enter or to use the private passage, or to meddle with the door of the service elevator. There can be no doubt that the hotel management did not intend or expect that he should or would go into the private service quarters. It is suggested that he was still looking for a lavatory, but there was no lavatory in the passage, and no reason is disclosed why he should expect to find one there, and of course he had no permission to search the recesses of the hotel. The lavatories were in the basement, as he knew, or would have learned by inquiry. If the deceased were looking for an exit, why did he leave the passenger lift, or main stairway, by which he had come up, and by which he had descended from the second floor to the mezzanine, and which would have taken or led him direct to the ground floor? Evidently he was not looking for an elevator. It is said however that, having found this one, he shook the door in order to summon an attendant. That is a surmise which has, perhaps, some suggestion of probability, but certainly there was no holding out of the place to be used by visitors in that manner or for that purpose. I see no evidence to indicate that, by anything for which the hotel is responsible, the deceased was misled into a belief that he was invited to use the private passage; and, having gone there, where he had no right to be, he was not entitled to rely, if he did rely, upon the adequacy of the lock of the elevator door to withstand the shock which he gave it.\nIf, on the other hand, the view were taken that the defendant company was negligent in the execution of its duty to the deceased, the question would remain as to whether there be in proof a state of facts from which the jury might infer that the defendant's negligence was the cause of the accident, and the considerations suggested by Wakelin v. The London and South Western Ry. Co.[5], would arise; but, having regard to the conclusions which I have expressed, it is unnecessary to consider this question.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 22 Alta.

The owner of the ship, at the time of the contract, was domiciled and resident in the United States and the ship, then called the Lincolnland, was registered there, but it was alleged in the defence that later, before action, she was sold, her name changed and that she became of British registry.\u2014The Exchequer Court of Canada has been declared, in pursuance of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act (1890) 53-54 Vict., c 27, to be a Court of Admiralty and has, on its Admiralty side, under s. 2, subs. 2, of that Act, jurisdiction \u201cover the like places, persons, matters and things, as the Admiralty Jurisdiction of the High Court in England * * *,\u201d which jurisdiction, relating to claims for ship\u2019s necessaries, is defined by two statutes of the United Kingdom, (1840) 3-4 Vict., c. 65, s. 6 and (1861) 24 Vict., c. 10, s. 5.\nHeld that, although by the laws of this country the respondent might not have a maritime lien for necessaries supplied to the appellant ship, the Exchequer Court of Canada, in Admiralty, could entertain an action in rem for the recovery of the price where a maritime lien therefor is created under foreign law. A right acquired under the law of a foreign state will be recognized, and may be enforced, under the law of England, unless opposed to some rule of domestic policy or procedure which prevents the recognition of the right; and, as the contract in this case is not void on the ground of immorality nor contrary to any positive law which would prohibit the making of it, the right which has accrued under or incident to it may be recognized and enforced by a court having the requisite jurisdiction; and held that, in view of the above stated statutory enactments, the Exchequer Court of Canada has the requisite jurisdiction in this case: Inasmuch however as the case was submitted upon points of law arising upon the statement of claim, the court expressed no opinion upon a question of priorities suggested by the defence.\nPittsburgh Coal Co. v. SS. Belchers ([1926] Ex. C.R. 24) dist.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1926] Ex. C.R. 226) aff. APPEAL from an order of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Nova Scotia Admiralty District[1], affirming jurisdiction in an action in rem for the recovery of the price of certain necessaries furnished to the appellant ship in the port of Boston. Upon motion of the appellant it had been ordered that the question of law arising from the pleadings, to wit: that the court was without jurisdiction, be set down for argument before the trial on the merits.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellant.\nAlfred Whitman K.C. for the respondent.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellant. The Exchequer Court of Canada in Admiralty has no jurisdiction to entertain an action in rem for necessaries supplied to the Strandhill (then the Lincolnland) in the United States of America.\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada in Admiralty has no jurisdiction to enforce by action in rem a lien created by the law of the United States under facts and circumstances that would not give rise to a maritime lien under British Admiralty law.\nA maritime lien cannot be created by foreign law otherwise than by a judgment in rem, and when so created cannot be enforced in the Exchequer Court.\nBy virtue of the American law the respondent did not acquire a right in the ship which attached to and followed the ship even through change of ownership.\nThe statement of claim disclosed no cause of action which could be enforced by an action in rem in the Exchequer Court.\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada was wholly without jurisdiction to entertain this action as an action in rem.\nThe arrest of the Strandhill in this action was wrongful ab initio.\nAlfred Whitman K.C. for the respondent. The respondent can recover in this action in rem for necessaries supplied to the Strandhill, a foreign ship in a foreign port. The respondent can invoque the statutory lien.\nThe Admiralty Court has jurisdiction over claims for necessaries.\nThe appellant has a maritime lien, by the laws of the United States of America and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for the necessaries supplied to the Strandhill. Where a maritime lien attaches it is not dependent on the personal liability of the owners at the time the lien is sought to be enforced. A maritime lien travels with the thing into whosesoever possession it may come and may be enforced into whosesoever possession the thing may come.\nThe Court of Admiralty has also inherent jurisdiction in matters of maritime liens. The ship was under the control of and in the hands of that court.\nThe Admiralty Court can enforce the law of the United States.\nThe courts do not enforce a foreign law or judgment but the rights of a party acquired under the law of a foreign country.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The claim which the plaintiff, respondent, seeks to recover is for the price of necessaries supplied to the defendant ship, appellant, under an American contract, and which, by the law of the United States, was secured by maritime lien upon the ship. I say American contract, because the vendor was carrying on its business in the United States; the contract was made in the United States for the sale and delivery of the goods; the defendant, Strandhill, then called the Lincolnland, was an American ship; the goods were delivered to her as ship\u2019s necessaries, in an American port, at the request of the owner, who was domiciled and resident in the United States, and there was thus no point of contact with any other country, save that the ship, in the course of her navigation, might visit or sometime be found in a foreign port.\nThe question arises upon the submission by the defence that the statement of claim discloses no cause of action within the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada in Admiralty, wherein the action was brought; this is substantially the effect of the objections set out as points of law in the defence.\nThe hearing took place upon an order of the local judge setting down the questions of law to be heard before the trial. The case therefore depends upon the allegations of the statement of claim, which is concisely drafted, and may conveniently be set out in full:\nStatement of Claim\n1. The plaintiff at the time of the occurrence hereinafter mentioned carried on business at Boston in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, as dealers in ship supplies, provisions and chandlery.\n2. The said ship Strandhill at the time the necessaries hereinafter mentioned were supplied to her was an American ship called the Lincoln-land and was lying in the said port of Boston under the command of one Rupert Wry as master.\nThe owner of the said ship at such time was Joseph F. Fertitta, of the city of New York, in the state of New York, and he was at all material times domiciled and resident in the said city of New York.\n3. The said ship did not belong to the port of Boston at the time such necessaries were supplied, and at the time of the institution of this cause no owner or part owner of such ship was domiciled in Canada.\n4. The plaintiff at the request and upon the order of the said owner, or alternatively at the request and upon the order of a person authorized by such owner to order necessaries for the use of said ship, namely, the said master Rupert Wry, supplied on the 24th and 26th days of October, 1922, necessaries (within the meaning of the fifth section of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, and within the meaning of the United States Acts of 1910, chapter 373), for the necessary use of the said ship then called the Lincolnland to the value of $1,091.84; and a promissory note dated October 27, 1922, for $1,000 signed by said owner Joseph F. Fertitta and endorsed by said master Rupert Wry was given by the said owner and master to the plaintiff but said note was dishonoured by non-payment on due presentation and there is now due and unpaid to the plaintiff in respect to such necessaries the sum of $1,091.84 with interest thereon. Particulars of such necessaries are delivered herewith.\n5. Said necessaries were supplied by the plaintiff on the credit of said ship and not merely on the personal credit of the master or the owner.\n6. By the laws of the United States of America and the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the time the said necessaries were supplied, any person furnishing repairs, supplies or other necessaries to a vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order of the owner or owners of such vessels, or of any person by him or them authorized had a maritime lien on such vessel which might be enforced by a proceeding in rem.\n7. The plaintiff repeats the foregoing paragraphs of this statement of claim and says that at the time such necessaries were supplied to said ship a maritime lien in its favour on such ship was created which might be enforced by a proceeding in rem, and that such lien has at all times up to the present continued in force, and the plaintiff now asks for its enforcement in this court.\n8. The plaintiff claims:\u2014\n(1) Judgment for the said sum of $1,091.84 together with interest thereon. (2) That the defendant and his bail be condemned therein with costs.\n(3) A sale of the said ship and payment of the said sum and interest out of the proceeds of said sale, together with costs.\n(4) Such further and other relief as the case may require.\nThere is a bail bond, by which the National Security Company submits itself to the jurisdiction of the court, and becomes responsible for what may be adjudged in the action.\nWhile, upon the record of the submission, the evidence of the law of the United States is to be found in the 6th paragraph of the statement of claim, we were at the hearing, by tacit consent, referred also to the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, as enacted by congress and published in the statutes at large of the United States, vol. 41, part I, p. 1005. By subs. P. of that Act, introduced under the caption of \u201cMaritime Liens for necessaries,\u201d it is enacted that:\nAny person furnishing repairs, supplies, towage, use of dry dock or marine railway, or other necessaries, to any vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order of the owner of such vessel, or of a person authorized by the owner, shall have a maritime lien on the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem, and it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.\nIt must therefore be considered that, according to the intention and law of the contract, the plaintiff company had a maritime lien on the vessel for the price of the necessaries supplied.\nThe nature of a maritime lien is expounded in The Bold Buccleugh[2]. It is said by Mellish L.J., delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in The Two Ellens[3]:\nA maritime lien must be something which adheres to the ship from the time that the facts happened which gave the maritime lien, and then continues binding on the ship until it is discharged, either by being satisfied or from the laches of the owner, or in any other way by which, by law, it may be discharged. It commences and there it continues binding on the ship until it comes to an end.\nIn The Ripon City[4], Gorrell Barnes J., in the course of an instructive judgment, adopts Lord Tenterden\u2019s definition, and he says:\nThe definition of a maritime lien as recognized by the law maritime given by Lord Tenterden has thus been adopted. It is a privileged claim upon a thing in respect of service done to it or injury caused by it, to be carried into effect by legal process.\n* * *\nThe result of my examination of these principles and authorities is as follows: The law now recognizes maritime liens in certain classes of claims, the principal being bottomry, salvage, wages, masters\u2019 wages, disbursements and liabilities, and damage. According to the definition above given, such a lien is a privileged claim upon a vessel in respect of service done to it, or injury caused by it, to be carried into effect by legal process. It is a right acquired by one over a thing belonging to another\u2014a jus in re aliena. It is, so to speak a subtraction from the absolute property of the owner in the thing.\nThis right must, therefore, in some way have been derived from the owner either directly or through the acts of persons deriving their authority from the owner. The person who has acquired the right cannot be deprived of it by alienation of the thing by the owner. It does not follow that a right to a personal claim against the owner of the res always co-exists with a right against the res. The right against the res may be conferred on such terms or in such circumstances that a person acquiring that right obtains the security of the res alone, and no rights against the owner thereof personally. A simple illustration of this is the case of bottomry.\n* * *\nLastly, as pointed out above, a maritime lien travels with the vessel into whosesoever possession it comes, so that an innocent purchaser of a ship may find his property subjected to claims which existed prior to the date of his purchase, unless the lien is lost by laches or the claim is one which may be barred by the Statutes of Limitation. This rule is stated in The Bold Buccleugh[5], to be deduced from the civil law, and, although it may be hard on an innocent purchaser, if it did not exist a person who was owner at the time a lien attached could defeat the lien by transfer if he pleased.\nThis exposition must I think be taken as descriptive of a maritime lien for the purposes of the case in hand, there being no averment or proof of judicial interpretation of the foreign law, Lloyd v. Gilbert[6],\nThen it is clear, upon abundant authority, that a right acquired under the law of a foreign state will be recognized, and may be enforced, under the law of England, unless opposed to some rule of domestic policy or procedure which prevents the recognition of the right, Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. v. Shand[7]; Hooper v. Gumm[8]; Jacobs v. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais[9]; In re Missouri Steamship Co.[10]; and I think it may be said of the law of the United States regarding ship\u2019s necessaries, as was affirmed by the Exchequer Chamber in Cammell v. Sewell[11], when upholding the passing of property in a ship under the law of Norway, that\nit does not appear to us that there is anything so barbarous or monstrous in this state of the law as that we can say that it should not be recognized by us.\nInglis y. Usherwood[12], exemplifies the application of this principle in a case in which the Court of King\u2019s Bench recognized and gave effect to a Russian modification or extension of the right of stoppage in transitu as sanctioned by the lex fori. In Storey\u2019s Conflict of Laws, 4th ed. s. 322 b, p. 527, he says, after referring to the right of stoppage in transitu; the lien of a bottomry bond on a thing pledged; the lien of mariners on a ship for their wages and the priority of payment in rem, which the law sometimes attaches to peculiar debts, or to particular persons,\nIn these, and like cases, where the lien or privilege is created by the lex loci contractus, it will generally, although not universally, be respected and enforced in all places where the property is found, or where the right can be beneficially enforced by the lex fori.\nAnd in s. 327, p. 551:\nThe law of a foreign country, is admitted, in order that the contract may receive the effect, which the parties to it intended. No state, however, is bound to admit a foreign law even for this purpose, when that law would contravene its own positive laws, institutions, or policy, which prohibit such a contract, or when it would prejudice the rights of its own subjects.\nIn Lord Watson\u2019s speech in The Henrich Bj\u00f6rn[13], he says:\nMany foreign states, whose systems of jurisprudence are based on the civil law, admit a maritime lien for necessaries, but the ground upon which the courts of England have declined to recognize such a lien is not, in my opinion, that it is opposed to some rule or principle peculiar to English law, but that it is contrary to the general principles of the law merchant.\nIt cannot of course be said that the contract is void on the ground of immorality, nor is it contrary to such positive law as would prohibit the making of it, and therefore I think that the right which has accrued under or incident to it, may be recognized and enforced, if the tribunal to which the plaintiff has resorted have the requisite jurisdiction.\nI observe that Lord Tenterden in his great work on Shipping, 5th edition, the last for which he was responsible, in a passage which is preserved by the learned authors of the 14th edition, at p. 177, says:\u2014\nLord Mansfield is reported to have said generally in a case depending for judgment in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that a person, who supplies a ship with necessaries, has not only the personal security of the master and owners, but also (Rich v. Coe[14]. An expression of the same import was also used by his lordship in the case of Farmer v. Davies[15]), the security of the specific ship. But in a recent case, to which I have had more than once occasion to refer, Lord Kenyon, alluding to two cases that will be presently mentioned, expressed a doubt whether the doctrine of Lord Mansfield on this subject was not too generally laid down (Westerdell v. Dale[16]); and upon the view of the decisions which I am about to quote, one of which was pronounced by Lord Mansfield himself, it appears that the law of England has not adopted this rule of the civil law with regard to repairs and necessaries furnished here in England.\nThe words which I have emphasized suggest, if they do not invite, the inference that necessaries, furnished in a country where the rule of the civil law prevails, may nevertheless be regarded in England as entitled to the lien conferred by the law of the contract, and, if so, it follows that the liability of the ship would be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIndeed it is difficult to perceive any reason why an American citizen, the owner of a ship which is by American law subject to a maritime lien for the price of necessaries purchased by him in an American port, could avoid the enforcement of the lien by sending his ship to Canada, if there be a Canadian tribunal having jurisdiction to enforce it.\nThe case, as now presented, does not involve a question of priorities as between competing creditors to be determined by the lex fori, as in cases like The Tagus[17]; Clark v. Bowring[18]; The Colorado[19]. Nor is it a claim by way of real privilege or lien on a chose in action, depending on the law for the recovery of the latter, as in the much debated decision of Dr. Lushington in The Milford[20]. The case is concerned only with the vindication of the right claimed against the ship. It must, however, be remembered that it is the right, and not the remedy, which is regulated by the lex loci; and, as said by Story, in his commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, 4th ed., s. 327, p. 550:\nMr. Chancellor Kent has laid down the same rule in his Commentaries, as stated by Huberus and Lord Ellenborough in Potter v. Brown[21], and has said: \u201cBut on this subject of conflicting laws, it may be generally observed, that there is a stubborn principle of jurisprudence, that will often intervene and act with controlling efficacy. This principle is, that when the lex loci contractus and the lex fori as to conflicting rights acquired in each, come in direct collision, the comity of nations must yield to the positive law of the land. In tali conflictu magis est, ut jus nostrum, quam jus alienum, servemus.\u201d\nThe defence is pleaded by Wm. P. Cant, alleged to be the owner of the ship at the date of the writ, and it is said that he is a subsequent purchaser for value. The present issue as to the sufficiency in law of the statement of claim is not affected by these allegations; but, if it should appear at the trial that subsequent interests have intervened and that conflicting priorities are to be adjudged, other considerations may arise, which have not been debated, and as to which I am careful to say that I do not express any opinion.\nAs to the remaining question, the jurisdiction of the High Court of Admiralty in England, relating to claims for ship\u2019s necessaries, is defined by two statutes of the United Kingdom, 3 and 4 Vict. (1840), c. 65, s. 6:\nAnd be it enacted, that the High Court of Admiralty have jurisdiction to decide all claims and demands whatsoever in the nature of salvage for services rendered to or damage received by any ship or seagoing vessel, or in the nature of towage, or for necessaries supplied to any foreign ship or seagoing vessel, and to enforce the payment thereof, whether such ship or vessel may have been within the body of a county, or upon the high seas, at the time when the services were rendered or damage received, or necessaries furnished, in respect of which such claim is made.\nAs to the application and effect of this section, see the observations of Mellish L.J., in The Two Ellens[22]; also The Anna[23]. The other statutory enactment is 24 Vict. (1861), c 10, s. 5, the material part of which provides that:\nThe High Court of Admiralty shall have jurisdiction over any claim for necessaries supplied to any ship elsewhere than in the port to which the ship belongs, unless it is shewn to the satisfaction of the court that at the time of the institution of the cause, any owner or part owner of the ship is domiciled in England or Wales.\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada, having been declared, in pursuance of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, 53-54 Vict., c. 27, to be a court of Admiralty, has, on its Admiralty side, under s. 2, subs. 2 of that Act, jurisdiction\nover the like places, persons, matters and things, as the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court in England, whether existing by virtue of any statute or otherwise, and the Colonial Court of Admiralty may exercise such jurisdiction in like manner and to as full an extent as the High Court of England, and shall have the same regard as that court to international law and the comity of nations.\nAnd, by s. 3, in interpreting the Admiralty jurisdiction, so conferred, in its application to this Dominion, \u201cCanada\u201d is to be read in substitution for \u201cEngland and Wales.\u201d\nNow in view of these enactments I apprehend that if a provision, corresponding to that of the United States statute which I have quoted, had been enacted in England, the High Court of Admiralty would have found itself adequately equipped to enforce it, in the cases provided for in the Acts of 1840 and 1861. And, seeing that equivalent local jurisdiction exists, the Exchequer Court of Canada is empowered, when, in those cases, the claim for necessaries is secured by a maritime lien, to enforce that lien, notwithstanding that the right may have been acquired under the law of a foreign country.\nThe conclusion which I have reached, while in accord with that of the learned trial judge, and with the view expressed by Routhier L.J.A. in Coorty v. S.S. Coldwell[24], is not in conflict with the recent judgment of the learned local judge at Toronto in Pittsbrugh Coal Co. v. S.S. Belchers[25], to which our attention was directed, because, to mention one reason only, in that case, the ship against which the lien was asserted was registered in Canada, where the owner was domiciled.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014This appeal is from the Exchequer Court of Canada, Nova Scotia Admiralty District, in a case wherein Mr. Justice Mellish heard an argument on the law applicable to the state of facts set forth in the statement of claim. Apparently it was a substitute for a demurrer to same.\nThe first six paragraphs of the statement of claim, containing all that is material for our consideration, are as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff at the time of the occurrences hereinafter mentioned carried on business at Boston in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, as dealers in ship supplies, provisions and chandlery.\n2. The said ship Strandhill at the time the necessaries hereinafter mentioned were supplied to her was an American ship called the Lincoln-land and was lying in the said port of Boston under the command of one Ruper Wry as master. The owner of the said ship at such time was Joseph F. Fertitta of the city of New York, in the state of New York, and he was at all material times domiciled and resident in the said city of New York.\n3. The said ship did not belong to the port of Boston at the time such necessaries were supplied, and at the time of the institution of this cause no owner or part owner of such ship was domiciled in Canada.\n4. The plaintiff at the request and upon the order of the said owner or alternatively at the request and upon the order of a person authorized by such owner to order necessaries for the use of such ship, namely, the said master Rupert Wry supplied on the 24th and 25th days of October, 1922, necessaries (within the meaning of the fifth section of the Admiralty Court Act 1861 and within the meaning of the United States Acts of 1910, chapter 373) for the necessary use of the said ship then called the Lincolnland to the value of $1,091.84; and a promissory note dated October 27, 1922, for $1,000 signed by said owner Joseph F. Fertitta and endorsed by said master Ruper Wry was given by the said owner and master to the plaintiff but said note was dishonoured by non-payment on due presentation and there is now due and unpaid to the plaintiff in respect to such necessaries the sum of $1,091.84 with interest thereon. Particulars of such necessaries are delivered herewith.\n5. Said necessaries were supplied by the plaintiff on the credit of said ship and not merely on its personal credit of the master or the owner.\n6. By the laws of the United States of America and the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the time the said necessaries were supplied, any person furnishing repairs, supplies or other necessaries to a Vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order of the owner or owners of such vessels, or of any person by him or them authorized had a maritime lien on such vessel which might be enforced by a proceeding in rem.\nOn the assumption that the foregoing statements are each and all, including, of course, that in paragraph six, stating the laws of the United States of America and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, correctly stated, I am of the opinion that Mr. Justice Mellish has, for the reasons he assigns, reached an absolutely correct conclusion.\nHaving read, amongst others, the cases he cites, I may say that they are not by any means founded upon exactly the same sort of facts as set forth in the foregoing statement of claim, but the principles therein proceeded upon are concisely as enunciated by Lord Justice Baggallay in The City of Mecca[26], where, at page 119, after expressing his entire adoption of the proceedings in rem and in personam, as quoted by the Master of the Rolls in the case of The Bold Buccleugh[27], he quotes this additional passage which he says he thinks should be read:\u2014\nThis claim or privilege travels with the thing, into whosesoever possession it may come. It is inchoate from the moment the claim or privilege attaches, and when carried into effect by legal process by a proceeding in rem, relates back to the period when it first attached.\nThe third edition of Dicey, cited by Mr. Justice Mellish, is the last edition of that work (and properly read supports his conclusion), but the second edition is persistently referred to by counsel for appellant, why so puzzles me. I have the third edition at hand, but not the second.\nThe appellant\u2019s factum claims this case and the case of Pittsburg Coal Co. et al and SS. Belchers[28], are the same; and that Mr. Justice Hodgins\u2019 decision is directly contrary to that of Mr. Justice Mellish herein. With due respect, I cannot assent, to that, for, so far as the latter case is concerned, the vessel there in question is simply set down as registered and owned in Canada, and no record of its ever having been registered elsewhere appears.\nThis probably is the basis of the different results.\nThe American law seems to have made the advance for necessities a maritime lien on American vessels.\nAnd certainly to maintain the appellant\u2019s contention herein would open wide the door to fraud. It would be, I submit, intolerable to enable owners of American vessels to get advances on faith of such a maritime lien and move up to Canada and sell out.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Co. under four lien agreements, duly registered. C. Co. made an assignment in bankruptcy. Defendant filed a claim for $771.44 as the balance then due on the machinery covered by said agreements. It subsequently notified the trustee in bankruptcy of its intention to remove said machinery. Subsequently the plaintiffs, who had taken a temporary lease, from the trustee and inspectors, of C. Co.\u2019s premises and plant, etc. (from which lease was excepted such plant, machinery, etc., as was subject to liens) and were in possession, desired to purchase the property, but their proposals to the inspectors were rejected, and it was decided to advertise for tenders. On Oct. 13, 1921, plaintiffs wrote defendant: \u201cWe have taken over the plant of [C. Co.] We understand that you hold a lien on part of the machinery of this plant. This amount. we understand which is due, is in the vicinity of $800. In order that you realize this amount it might be necessary for you to remove considerable machinery at a cost which would not mean anything to you and which would naturally depreciate this plant. We feel sure that we can come to some terms with you. Will you kindly let us have a reply at once so that we may know what machinery is held by you and what your demands are.\u201d Defendant replied on Oct. 17, referring plaintiffs to its\u2019 solicitors and stating its requirement of immediate payment to avoid its repossessing the machinery under its lien. On Oct. 26 plaintiffs telegraphed defendant \u201cYour letter October 17th, make sight draft against Bill of Sale receipted. Wire amount so that we can arrange finances.\u201d Further correspondence ensued and defendant\u2019s solicitors made a sight draft on plaintiffs for $1,003.09, to which were attached the four lien agreements receipted. Plaintiffs paid the draft and obtained the documents. Plaintiffs removed the machinery covered by the lien agreements to another site. This machinery was however recovered from the plaintiffs by the trustee in bankruptcy in a replevin action in which it was held that, on a proper appropriation of the payments made by C. Co. to defendant, the lien agreements had been paid by C. Co., and that the present plaintiffs could not claim as under an assignment of the lien agreements, as there had been no notice or filing of the assignment. Plaintiffs then sued defendant for, among other things, return of the $1,003.09 which they had paid to it, claiming that there had been a total failure of consideration for such payment.\nHeld: There had been no failure of consideration and plaintiffs could not recover. The correspondence must be interpreted in the light of the facts and circumstances as known to and affecting the parties at the time. The \u201cbill of sale\u201d mentioned in plaintiffs\u2019 telegram of Oct. 26 must be taken to mean the lien agreements. Plaintiffs had got what they stipulated for, namely, the four lien agreements receipted. There had been no representation, concealment or warranty as to defendant\u2019s claim or security or right to payment. Defendant had its claim which it was endeavouring to recover and which it considered exigible and adequately secured. No question had then been raised as to the validity of the claim or the security for it. The principles laid down in Smith v. Hughes (L.R. 6 Q.B. 597 at 606-607), Haigh v. Brooks (10 A. & E. 309 at 320), and other cases, were applicable.\nWhile deciding the case on the above ground, the Court considered the interpretation and effect of the \u201cdrag-net\u201d clause in the lien agreements, providing that \u201cthe title in the said machinery and goods, and all other machinery and goods, included in former orders, and orders which may hereafter be given * * * shall not pass * * * till all moneys payable and notes given under this order and such other orders, and all judgments obtained therefor, have been paid and satisfied,\u201d and expressed the view that the word \u201corders\u201d must have been intended to apply only to conditional orders, and that machinery unconditionally sold and delivered after the time of the agreements in question was not within the application of the clause. Re Canadian Optical Co., A. R. Williams Company\u2019s claim (2 Ont L.R. 677), dist.\nQuaere as to the question whether defendant, after bankruptcy of C. Co., could appropriate payments not previously appropriated. Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco ([1925] 2 D.L.R. 1009) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant, by special leave granted by this court, from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1] which, reversing judgment of Rogers J., held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $1,003.09 with interest. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by Newcombe J., now reported. The appeal was allowed.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. for the appellant.\nFinlay MacDonald K.C. and J. A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiffs, who are the respondents in the case, brought their action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the defendant company, appellant, for the recovery of damages for breach of an alleged contract of sale and delivery of machinery purchased by the respondents from the appellant, averring that it was an implied condition or warranty of the sale that the appellant was the owner of the machinery and had the right to sell, and, moreover, that the appellant falsely and fraudulently represented to the respondents that it was the owner and had the right to sell; that in fact the machinery was not the property, of the appellant, but of one Geo. E. Faulkner, trustee in bankruptcy of the Cape Breton Engineering Works Ltd., who subsequently recovered the possession from the respondents. These allegations were denied, and the parties went to trial, but, at the trial, the plaintiffs were permitted to amend by adding to their statement of claim a paragraph to the effect that what the defendant company agreed to sell was its right and title under certain conditional agreements of sale, whereby the defendant had sold the machinery to the Cape Breton Engineering Works; that the plaintiffs paid the defendant the purchase price of $1,003.05, but that the defendant had no right or title, as the Cape Breton Engineering Works had fully paid for the machinery; that there was therefore a total failure of consideration for the payment made by the plaintiffs to the defendant, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to have their payment of $1,003.05 returned to them. The defendant company pleaded, with other matters of defence, that the payment sought to be recovered by the plaintiffs was made pursuant to an arrangement, whereby the latter, representing themselves to be equitable owners of the goods, agreed to pay to the defendant the stipulated sum upon delivery by the defendant to the plaintiffs of the agreements of sale receipted, and that the defendant complied with this condition, and received the payment in question in consideration of the delivery of the sale agreements, and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of the payment of the sum claimed to be due thereon.\nThe facts are very fully stated in the judgment of Rogers J., who tried the case, but for present purposes may be usefully recapitulated.\nIn March, April, May and June, 1920, the defendant company, which is a dealer in machinery, at St. John, N.B., sold to the Cape Breton Engineering Works, Ltd., a company then carrying on the business of machinists at Sydney, N.S., various articles of machinery for the aggregate purchase price of about $13,000. The sales were evidenced by four agreements in writing, identical in form, and signed by the purchaser, by which it was stipulated that the purchase price should be paid, one-half in cash on delivery, and the balance in two equal notes, at three and six months, with interest at 7%; that, if default were made in any payment, the whole amount should then become due; that the goods should be at the purchaser\u2019s risk; that the purchaser would at all times keep the goods insured for an amount sufficient to cover the vendor\u2019s interest, and that\nthe title in the said machinery and goods, and all other machinery and goods, included in former orders, and orders which may hereafter be given by me, us, to you, shall not pass from you until all the terms and conditions of this order and such other orders shall have been fully complied with by me, us, and till all moneys payable and notes given under this order and such other orders, and all judgments obtained therefor, have been paid and satisfied; it was also provided by the agreements that the purchaser should not sell or remove the goods without the vendor\u2019s consent, and that, in case of default or breach of any of the provisions of agreement, or if the goods were seized for rent or taxes or other execution, or if the purchaser should make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or become insolvent, the vendor might enter upon the purchaser\u2019s premises and take down and remove the goods and sell them, crediting the proceeds, less expenses and commission of sale, the purchaser agreeing to pay the deficiency, and there was a further stipulation on the part of the purchaser that\nany note or notes or other security given by me, us, to you for any indebtedness under this or any of said orders or any part thereof, shall be collateral thereto, and that you may apply all payments made by me, us, to you as you may at any time desire.\nThese agreements are known in the case as lien agreements, and the learned trial judge tells us that they were in due course filed with the Registrar of Deeds in compliance with the provisions of the Bills of Sale Act relating to hiring and purchase agreements, but they were not treated as bills of sale under the earlier sections of the Act, and were not therefore accompanied by the affidavits of bona fides appropriate to a bill of sale as such.\nThe Bills of Sale Act, as in force at the time, was c. 11 of 1918, and, by the definitions of the Act, the expression \u201cBill of Sale\u201d includes among other meanings \u201cauthorities or licenses to take possession of personal chattels as security for any debt.\u201d\nAfter the transactions represented by these lien agreements, the defendant\u201d sold and delivered to the Cape Breton Engineering Works on credit, during the succeeding months, from July to November inclusive, tools or machines, the price of which amounted to $838.08, It is claimed on behalf of the appellant that, although these goods were sold unconditionally, they were nevertheless subject to the terms and conditions of the preceding agreements, because of the clause therein, known as the dragnet clause, which is quoted above. The Cape Breton Engineering Works made large payments on account, but other payments fell into arrears, and the appellant, on 8th February, 1921, placed its claim in the hands of solicitors for collection. At that time the amount due was $3,209.05, including all items, whether specifically secured by the agreements or not; of this amount $2,295.74 represented balances due upon the lien agreements, and $913.31, including interest, was for the tools and machinery subsequently purchased.\nOn 25th July, 1921, the Cape Breton Engineering Works made an assignment in bankruptcy to Geo. E. Faulkner, an authorized trustee. Previously, in March, the company had paid the sum of $750, on account, to the appellant\u2019s solicitors, and had given a promissory note for the balance, which, at the time of the assignment in bankruptcy, had been reduced by payments to the sum of $617.66, and it is admitted that this balance, with interest, insurance premium and costs, constituted the total of the appellant company\u2019s claim against the bankrupt estate of the Cape Breton Engineering Company. As to the amounts collected by the solicitors, Mr. Mather, the vice-president and manager of the appellant company, testifies:\u2014\nQ. The account was sent to McLean, Burchell and Ralston for collection in February, 1921?\nA. Yes.\nQ. They collected a certain amount. What was done with the money remitted to you from time to time?\nA. We credited it to the Cape Breton Engineering Co., Ltd. Later, when we had notice of their assignment, we treated the moneys as applying to goods not covered by specific liens, and made up our balance under the liens and forwarded it with the orders to the trustee.\nQ. As proof of the debt?\nA. Yes.\nThus, after the assignment, the appellant company appropriated the payments, and filed its claim against the trustee in bankruptcy for the sum of $771.44, as the balance then due on the property covered by the lien agreements, valuing the security furnished by these agreements at $3,895, and the trustee recognized the appellant as a secured creditor.\nThe plaintiffs had been largely interested as stockholders and employees of the Cape Breton Engineering Works, and, immediately after the suspension of that company, entered into partnership and began the business of machinists on their own account. By lease of September, 1921, the trustee and inspectors of the bankrupt estate, by authority of a resolution of the creditors, leased to the plaintiffs All and singular the plant, machinery, tools, equipment, office furniture and premises of the said Cape Breton Engineering Works Limited situate and being at Sydney aforesaid; excepting and reserving therefrom all and any plant, machinery and equipment upon which any persons, firms or corporations have chattel mortgages, bills of sale or other liens.\nfor and during the term of three months, for the monthly rent of $470, and it was provided by the lease that the tenancy might be determined at any time, during the term, by the lessors giving the lessees at least fifteen days\u2019 notice to that effect. It will have been observed that, according to the description of the demised premises, plant, machinery and equipment under chattel mortgage, bill of sale or other lien are excepted.\nOn 1st September, 1921, the appellant gave to the trustee in bankruptcy notice that, at the expiration of fifteen days, the company would remove from the premises of the Cape Breton Engineering Works all its property covered by the four lien agreements. On 5th October, the trustee gave to the respondents the requisite fifteen days\u2019 notice, stipulated by the lease, requiring them to vacate the leased premises on 20th October. The plaintiffs desired to purchase the property, and had submitted proposals to the inspectors, but these were rejected by the creditors at their meeting on 12th October, when it was decided to advertise for tenders. The plaintiff, Moore, admits that his proposition had been unfavourably received and that he knew that he was not likely to get the property. In this posture of affairs, on the day following, 13th October, the plaintiffs wrote the defendant company as follows:\u2014\nWe have taken over the plant of the Cape Breton Eng. Works, Ltd., Sydney, N.S.\nWe understand that you hold a lien on part of the machinery of this plant. This amount, we understand which is due, is in the vicinity of eight hundred dollars $800.\nIn order that you realize this amount it might be necessary for you to remove considerable machinery at a cost which would not mean anything to you and which would naturally depreciate this plant.\nWe feel sure that we can come to some terms with you.\nWill you kindly let us have a reply at once so that we may know what machinery is held by you and what your demands are.\nTo this the defendant replied, on 17th October, that its claim was in the hands of its Nova Scotia solicitors, to whom it was forwarding the plaintiffs\u2019 letter for attention, adding however that the company would not consider any further extension of credit, and that, if its claim were not paid within two weeks, it would proceed to repossess all the machinery under its lien, concluding with an expression of hope that the plaintiffs would be able to raise the funds necessary, as the amount of the claim was not very large. On 26th October, the plaintiffs, having received no other communication from the defendant or its solicitors, telegraphed direct to the defendant, saying:\u2014\nYour letter October 17th, make sight draft against Bill of Sale receipted. Wire amount so that we can arrange finances.\nThat by \u201cbill of sale\u201d in this message the plaintiffs meant the lien agreements is, I think, clear beyond question; that was the sense in which at the time both parties understood and acted upon the message.\nAt an adjourned meeting of the creditors, held on 26th October, it was decided to accept the offer of Capt. H. C. Verner, who had been the managing director of the bankrupt company, and his associates, for the purchase of the plant. On 27th October, the defendant replied to the plaintiffs\u2019 telegram of the preceding day, reminding them that the matter was entirely in the hands of the company\u2019s solicitors, to whom it was posting instructions to get in touch with the plaintiffs, but intimating that the solicitors could proceed upon a cash basis only, and that no delay or partial payment could be considered. On 28th October, the defendant\u2019s solicitors at Halifax telegraphed the plaintiffs as follows:\u2014\nAs instructed by A. R. Williams, we are forwarding to-morrow Bills of Sale receipted with sight draft attached for one thousand and three dollars nine cents covering claim interest, insurance, solicitors\u2019 charges.\nThe solicitors then made a sight draft for $1,003.09 upon the plaintiffs, to which were attached the four original lien agreements, with the following receipt endorsed upon each of them:\u2014\nPaid. A. R. Williams Machinery Co. (Maritime) Ltd., October 29th, 1921, A. P. Coleman, Halifax.\nMr. Coleman was the defendant\u2019s Halifax manager. On or before 2nd November, the plaintiffs paid and took up the draft, with the documents attached, and, on the last mentioned date, they telegraphed to the defendant company, saying:\u2014\nHave paid draft and obtained papers attached. Solicitor advises that your agent here formally repossess articles and transfer same to us. The defendant telegraphed the plaintiffs, on the same day:\u2014\nTelegram received. Will instruct our solicitors to act accordingly.\nAnd they wrote the plaintiffs, at the same time, as follows:\u2014\nWe have your wire as follows:\n\u201cHave paid draft and obtained papers attached. Solicitors advise that your agents here formally repossess articles and transfer claim to us.\u201d\nIn reply we have wired you as per copy attached, that we are instructing our solicitors to act accordingly, and we are urging them to see that there is no further delay.\nWe are glad to know that you have taken over the plant of the C. B. Engineering Works, and also that, you are able to pay our claim and thus prevent the dislocation of the plant.\nYou can rest assured, that if you are prepared to operate this plant we will be only too glad to assist you as far as our means will permit. We understand our Halifax Office has quoted you on a certain drill you asked about, and we trust to have your order in due course. We have a large stock of machinery and supplies, and our prices are right, and we only ask the opportunity to show you what we ,can do.\nOn 2nd or 3rd November, the plaintiffs, being still in possession of the leased property, disconnected the machinery covered by the lien agreements, and removed it to a site which they had acquired for themselves. On 11th November, the solicitors wrote the plaintiffs, saying:\u2014\nRe C. B. Engineering Works.\nMr. Coleman has asked us to write you in connection with this matter.\nYour telegram to the A. R. Williams Machinery Company of St. John instructed the A. R. Williams Machinery Company to make a sight draft with lien agreements attached and receipted. In accordance with this telegram we attached the original lien agreements duly receipted to sight draft made by ourselves on you. The draft was paid and receipted lien agreements delivered to you. This is the end of the matter so far as the A. R. Williams Machinery Company is concerned and they have nothing further to do with the matter and we have advised them accordingly.\nShortly after this, Mr. Faulkner, the trustee in bankruptcy, caused the machinery to be replevied. The plaintiffs defended the replevin action, which was tried before Mellish J., who upheld the proceedings and the right of the trustee. Thus the plaintiffs lost the property, which it was no doubt the object of their negotiations with the defendant company to acquire, and it was in consequence of this that they instituted the present action. The defendant company was not a party to the replevin suit, but the judgment of Mellish J., and a transcript of the evidence upon which he proceeded, were put in as exhibits in this case. That learned judge reviewed the state of the account between the Williams Machinery Co., the present appellant, and the Cape Breton Engineering Works. He considered that the question depended upon the appropriation of the partial payments, and he found that the payments which had been made to the solicitors ought to be appropriated to the earlier items of the account, and therefore that the secured claim of the Williams Company had been paid, and that, although Moore and Murphy, defendants in replevin, claimed the machinery under an assignment to them of the lien agreements, they had given no notice of the assignment, and moreover that the assignment was not filed as required by the Bills of Sale Act, and therefore he upheld the claim of the replevisor.\nRogers J. reviewed the evidence very carefully. He considered that the case was to be determined upon the interpretation of the correspondence which had taken place by letter and telegram previously to the payment of the $1,003.09 on 2nd November. He referred to the opening sentence of the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of 13th October, \u201cwe have taken over the plant of the Cape Breton Engineering Works,\u201d as \u201ca statement which, to say the least, was entirely lacking in frankness\u201d; he found that the plaintiffs could not recover upon the allegations of the statement of claim upon which they went to trial; that there was no sale, and that it was not intended that there should be a sale, of specific articles. He said that\nthe original inquiry was made by the plaintiffs as ostensible owners of the whole estate, and of the equity in the machinery, and concerned itself only with request for information for the details, so that they may know what machinery is held and what the demands are. The plaintiffs, as owner of the plant, could then, as fully known by both parties, have acquired ownership only from the trustee, and the plaintiffs (sic) had filed their claim and an account along with copies of their agreement for lien with the trustee. The plaintiffs knew of the amount (about S800) and there was available to them all the information asked for. Doubtless the purpose of the letter of the 13th October was to begin a negotiation which they hoped would place them in an advantageous position thereafter and perhaps enable the plaintiffs ultimately to discharge defendant\u2019s claim at a reduced amount, but the defendants were in no mood to lessen their demand. They stood on what they, I have no doubt, honestly believed were their legal rights. He found that\nthere was no misrepresentation on the part of the defendant company, nor is there any express warranty or undertaking, either as to the title to the goods, or as to the amount of the indebtedness. There is a simple release to the supposed owners of the plant of the liens which the defendants held and believed enforceable, and which they wished to be released without delay. Their reasons for this anxious haste became apparent on the trial. They anticipated on October 12th that they would soon become proprietors of the going concern (so much so that they represented themselves as already proprietors), but, on October 27th their hopes were shattered by the creditors. What they had failed to obtain by negotiation they sought, at any rate as to part of the machinery, to obtain by acquiring defendant company\u2019s rights and thus dislocating and \u201cdepreciating the plant now acquired by their rivals in business, a proceeding which they themselves deprecated in the initial communication of the 13th. They paid their money for precisely what they got: from defendant company\u2019s standpoint, the payment of its claim by the ostensible owner of the equity; from the plaintiffs\u2019, an opportunity to hamper their rivals, and the possibility of procuring a lot of valuable machinery at a very inconsiderable cost.\nHe considered that the defendant company was not bound by the judgment in replevin, and that it was unnecessary to express an opinion as to the appropriation of the payments made by the Cape Breton Engineering Works, or as to whether the indebtedness secured by the four agreements had actually been paid. He said that the consideration was completely executed on both sides by the plaintiffs\u2019 payment, and the delivery by the defendant of the documents evidencing its claim; that it was immaterial that the documents proved to be of less value to the plaintiffs than they anticipated, and that they must be regarded as worth to the plaintiffs what they were willing to pay for them, seeing that they could not acquire them for less.\nThe learned Chief Justice, who pronounced the judgment of the court en banc, interpreted the transaction differently. He thought the bill of sale referred to in the plaintiffs\u2019 telegram of 26th October was \u201ca bill of sale or transfer of four lien agreements and the amount due thereon.\u201d He thought that the defendant had represented the amount due and secured by the four lien agreements to be $777.44, which was the amount of its claim against the bankrupt estate; that the plaintiffs had seen this account, and, adding interest, had understood it to be in the vicinity of $800. He referred to the letters and telegrams and he said that in the face of this correspondence the defendants must be treated as if they had volunteered the information as to the amount due and secured by the lien agreements, and if the representation was untrue they must be responsible.\nHe reviewed the question as to appropriation of payments, and considered that the defendant would have been bound, by the judgment of Mellish J., if there had been an express contract of indemnity, but not otherwise. If I understand his judgment, his conclusion was that the defendant was not estopped by that judgment. Referring to the drag-net clause of the agreements he said,\nI think it obvious that these orders referred to are orders similar to the four lien agreements, and that the object of the clause was to tie together all these liens and give the vendors the right to claim under the other three any amount still due under any one of them after the specific security had been exhausted.\nand he expressed a view, in accordance with that of Mellish J. in the replevin suit, that\nthe defendants had, long before that suit was begun, wrongfully wiped out the unsecured claim on their books by crediting thereon payments specificially made on the secured debt.\nHe held moreover that the right of appropriation did not survive the bankruptcy of the debtor. Accordingly, by the judgment of the court en banc, the appeal was allowed, and the plaintiffs recovered $1,003.09 with interest.\nThis amount being below the ordinary appealable jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada, application was made to this court for special leave to appeal, and leave was granted upon the submission that the case involved the interpretation of the lien agreements, which were in common form and in general use, and that the view expressed by the court en banc was in conflict with the judgment of the Divisional Court of Ontario in Re Canadian Camera and Optical Co., A. R. Williams Co\u2019s. claim[2]. In that case the claimant had delivered to a company which was or became insolvent a turret lathe upon an order signed by the latter, by which it was to pay the price, one-quarter in cash, and the balance in three equal payments, on specified credit, and it was stipulated that the title should not pass to the insolvent until payment of the moneys payable by it under the order in question, as well as under any other orders which might be given by the insolvent to the claimant before the lathe was actually paid for. After the purchase of the lathe, the insolvent ordered and received from the claimant other goods, which were not paid for, and the price of which, together with one of the instalments upon the lathe, remained unpaid at the beginning of the winding up proceedings. The claimant contended that the lathe was subject to a lien, not only for the instalment of the purchase price unpaid thereon, but also for the price of the goods subsequently purchased. The liquidator, while admitting the lien for the instalment due upon the lathe, contended that the claimant must rank upon the estate as an ordinary creditor for the balance of its claim. Street J., who pronounced the judgment of the Divisional Court, in disposing of the question, said:\nThe good faith of the parties to the contract is not impeached or attacked, and the agreement must be taken to express the true contract between them, viz., that, until the bailees should pay, not only the purchase money of the lathe itself, but also the purchase money of any other goods they should purchase after the sale of the lathe and before it was fully paid for, the property in it should remain in the claimants. I can find nothing in any statute affecting the validity of a contract of this kind, and I think it, therefore, entitled to prevail.\nA copy of the contract itself is not set out in the report, but, according to the effect of it as therein stated, there are noticeable differences between the clause which was there intended to provide security for the payment of the price of goods purchased in the future and the clause which is described in this case as the drag-net. In the latter it is stipulated that the title in the machinery and goods purchased, and all other machinery and goods included in former orders and orders which might thereafter be given\nshall not pass * * * till all moneys payable and notes given under this order and such other orders, and all judgments obtained therefor, have been paid and satisfied.\nNow although, for the reasons which I am going to state, it becomes unnecessary for the purposes of this case to determine the interpretation of the agreements in this particular, yet, inasmuch as the question has been argued, and as leave to appeal was granted for review of the opinion expressed by the court en banc upon this branch of the case, I think it right to say that I have come to the conclusion that since the clause is expressed to apply, not only to the machinery and goods specified, but also to other machinery and goods, whether previously purchased or subsequently to be purchased, it can be intended to apply only to conditional orders; obviously it does not affect property which had already passed, and therefore it does not apply to previous unconditional sales, but the word \u201corders\u201d as used in the clause must naturally have the same meaning when used as descriptive of orders to be given as it has with relation to orders previously given, and therefore, if this be so, the machinery unconditionally sold and delivered after the time of the agreements here in question is not within the application of the clause.\nThis however does not determine the defendant\u2019s liability. In the order granting leave to appeal, there is, fortunately for the appellant, but unfortunately for the uniformity of practice in the court, no limitation of the questions which are to be discussed. The appellant is permitted to appeal from the judgment of the court en banc, and any question of law or fact which is raised, affecting the propriety of that judgment, must be considered.\nIn my view the findings of the learned trial judge ought not to have been reversed. Upon the first question propounded by the learned Chief Justice\u2014what were the plaintiffs to get for the $1,003.09 which they paid to the defendant?\u2014I think, with the utmost respect, that there can be only one answer: they got what they stipulated for, namely the four lien agreements, or bill of sale, as the agreements were called in the plaintiffs\u2019 telegram, and the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment upon each of them that the debt secured thereby had been paid. In order to interpret the correspondence we must look to the state of the facts and circumstances as known to and affecting the parties at the time. As said by Blackburn J., in Fowkes v. Manchester and London Life Assurance and Loan Association[3],\nthe language used by one party is to be construed in the sense in which it would be reasonably understood by the other.\nAnd Lord Watson said in Birrell v. Dryer[4],\nI apprehend that it is perfectly legitimate to take into account such extrinsic facts as the parties themselves either had, or must be held to have had, in view, when they entered into the contract. It was known to the parties that the Cape Breton Engineering Works was indebted to the defendant; that it had made an assignment in bankruptcy; that the defendant had filed its claim as a secured creditor with the trustee for $777.44, for which it claimed the security of the four lien agreements, which were registered under the Bills of Sale Act; that the security had been valued under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, by the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s local manager, at $3,895, and that the machinery ordered by the Cape Breton Engineering Works, and of which it had received possession under these agreements, was still in place in the factory, or on the premises of the Engineering Works. Also it was known that the defendant company had given notice to the trustee of its intention to remove the machinery covered by the agreements. In this state of the case the plaintiffs introduced themselves to the defendant, by their letter of 13th October, with the statement that they had taken over the plant of the Cape Breton Engineering Works. They intimated their understanding that the defendant had a lien on part of the machinery of this plant, the amount of which was in the vicinity of $800; they referred to the fact that it might be necessary for the defendant to remove the machinery in order to realize; they expressed a desire to come to terms, and asked for a reply stating what machinery was held by the defendant, and what the defendant\u2019s demands were. The answer, on 17th October, refers the plaintiffs to the company\u2019s solicitors, stating however that the claim was long overdue, and that no further extension would be considered. The appellant company had its claim, which it was endeavouring to recover, and which it considered exigible and adequately secured. Nobody had suggested a question as to the validity of the claim, or the security for it. The respondents cannot complain if the appellant proceeded upon the assumption that they were telling the truth when they said that they had taken over the plant. If, as is the necessary inference from the respondents\u2019 letter, the plant which they said they had taken over included the machinery subject to the lien agreements, the desirability from their standpoint of obtaining a discharge of these agreements was sufficiently obvious. The appellant\u2019s papers and business with respect to its claim against the Engineering Works were in the hands of its solicitors, to whom it naturally referred the respondents. Then came the respondents\u2019 urgent message of 26th October requesting sight draft against bill of sale receipted, and the draft, with the agreements receipted, was forwarded to the respondents by the appellant\u2019s solicitors on 29th October, and paid in due course by the respondents, who then took up the receipted documents. It is surprising in these circumstances to hear of charges of fraud or misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, on the part of the appellant company, or that it concealed information which it was bound to communicate. There are two very apt passages in the judgment of Blackburn J. in the well\n3 known case of Smith v. Hughes[5]:\nIn this case I agree that on the sale of a specific article, unless there be a warranty making it part of the bargain that it possesses some particular quality, the purchaser must take the article he has bought though it does not possess that quality. And I agree that even if the vendor was aware that the purchaser thought that the article possessed that quality, and would not have entered into the contract unless he had so thought, still the purchaser is bound, unless the vendor was guilty of some fraud or deceit upon him, and that a mere abstinence from disabusing the purchaser of that impression is not fraud or deceit; for, whatever may be the case in a court of morals, there is no legal obligation on the vendor to inform the purchaser that he is under a mistake, not induced by the act of the vendor.\n* * * *\nIf, whatever a man\u2019s real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party\u2019s terms.\nSee also Monforts v. Marsden[6]. I find nothing in the case to indicate that the parties did not agree in the same sense, or that there was any representation, concealment or warranty as to the appellant\u2019s claim or security or right to payment, and it appears to have been a very reasonable and convenient transaction in the course of business that the respondents should pay off a comparatively small charge upon their property, and that the appellant should hand over its documents constituting the security to the respondents, who, upon the case as represented by them, had acquired the property subject to the charge.\nIn Haigh v. Brooks[7], Lord Denman said:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs were induced by the defendant\u2019s promise to part with something which they might have kept, and the defendant obtained what he desired by means of that promise. Both being free and able to judge for themselves, how can the defendant be justified in breaking this promise, by discovering afterwards that the thing in consideration of which he gave it did not possess that value which he supposed to belong to it? It cannot be ascertained that that value was what he most regarded. He may have had other objects and motives; and of their weight he was the only judge.\nSee also Lawes v. Purser[8]. These authorities, and there are many others, seem fully to justify the finding that there was no failure of consideration.\nIt is not necessary to enter upon the question of appropriation of payments as between the appellant and the Cape Breton Engineering Works. It is beyond the reach of controversy that the appellant honestly believed in its claim in the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy as filed and attested, and, if the trustee had questioned the validity of the claim, or its right to rank upon the machinery covered by the agreements, I am not satisfied that the claim could have been displaced by the evidence of appropriation of payments to be found in the case. It is contended that the appellant after the bankruptcy could not impute payments which had not been appropriated previously. I find no provision to this effect in the Bankruptcy Act, and none was cited at the argument; but that is however a question which I would be disposed to consider further, if it were material.\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, and that the judgment at the trial should be restored; but, seeing that leave to appeal was granted upon the condition that the appellant should pay, in any event, to the respondents their costs of and incident to the appeal to this court, these costs will be disposed of accordingly. The appellant should however have the costs of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc. Idington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Rogers in his comprehensive judgment as trial judge, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the said learned trial judge be restored with costs of the appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

G\u00e9rin-Lajoie contra.\nRinfret J.\u2014This application is for an order staying the execution of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada pending the hearing of the appeal herein to His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council.\nThis judgment was rendered on the 18th day of June, 1925.\nOn the 25th day of the same month, it was ordered by a judge of this court in chambers that, upon the appellant giving, on or before the 6th day of July, 1925, security to the amount of $1,000 to indemnify the respondent from the costs incurred as well in this court as in the lower courts, to the satisfaction of the registrar of this court, all proceedings herein, except a settlement of the minutes of judgment, be stayed until the 31st day of July, 1925, to afford appellant an opportunity of applying to the Judicial Committee of His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council for leave to appeal from the judgment rendered.\nThe above order is now spent, both for the reason that the period of time during which it was to remain in force has expired, and because the purpose of the order has been served, since the appellant has obtained leave to appeal as appears from His Majesty\u2019s order dated the 12th day of October, 1925, and duly filed in this court.\nWhen the present application was made, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada rendered on the 18th of June, 1925, had not yet been certified by the registrar of this court to the proper officer of the court of original jurisdiction, so that this court, or a judge thereof was still competent to entertain the application and make the order (In re Strathcona Fire Company, Lemire v. Nicol[1]).\nAn application for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and even the granting of such leave, do not, as a matter of law or by the rules of this court, ipso facto operate as a suspension of proceedings in execution.\nUnder s. 58 of the Supreme Court Act, so soon as the judgment of this court in appeal has been certified by the registrar of this court to the officer of the court of original jurisdiction and all proper and necessary entries have thereupon been made, all such proceedings may be taken thereon as if the judgment had been entered or pronounced in the said last mentioned court.\nPursuant to rule 136, it has been the practice of this court to make orders for stay of execution of its judgments pending the time necessary for applying to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for leave to appeal from the judgment rendered. Except however for very special reasons, such as no doubt existed in Schofield v. Emmerson Brantingham Implement Company[2], this court will be slow to exercise the wider discretion which the rule undoubtedly authorizes. As a general rule, it is desirable, where special leave to appeal to His Majesty\u2019s Privy Council is granted, that the conditions attached to such special leave and the terms upon which it is allowed should be left to the Judicial Committee. In this case, the petition for special leave contained a prayer\nthat execution of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada be stayed pending the hearing of the appeal.\nIn the report of the Board, dated the 28th day of July, 1925, their Lordships, while recommending that leave ought to be granted to the petitioner and defining the terms as the circumstances of the case in their view required, made no order with regard to the stay of execution of the judgment of this court. It is not to be doubted therefore that their Lordships thought that a stay of execution ought not to be ordered in the premises. Any temporary relief against the judgment of this court until judgment shall be given in this case by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should properly be left to the Judicial Committee itself.\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1924] S.C.R. 510.\n[2] Cameron\u2019s Fract., 3rd Ed., 469.\n"

The appellants, with two others, set forth in a boat called Denman II and left for Sidney Island with the intention of taking from the Beryl G. her cargo of liquor. According to the story of one of the appellants and an accomplice the Beryl G. was towed from Sidney Island by the Denman II, and the bow anchor, having been detached was sunk with the bodies of the captain and of his son, which had been fastened together by a pair of handcuffs. It had been proven that Baker had bought a yachtman's cap with a white top and ornamented profusely with gold braid in order to give himself the appearance of a revenue officer, and that this cap, together with two revolvers and handcuffs and a flashlight had been brought by Baker on board the Denman II. The case against Baker, as exhibited in the evidence on behalf of the Crown, was that in concert with the others he attacked the crew of the Beryl G., under the pretence that he and his associates were officers of the law, one of them being disguised in such a way as to present the appearance of a revenue officer, and the party being equipped. with and displaying such arms and implements as such officers might be expected to use in dealing with the possessors of a contraband cargo of liquor. Evidence was offered by the Crown in rebuttal, of the fact that Baker on one occasion recently, and on another at a considerably earlier date, had employed similar equipment and precisely this ruse for the purpose of deceiving and disarming the opposition of bootleggers while he took over their illegal possessions.\nHeld that, as bearing upon the issue thus raised (as to design) it was relevant to shew a similar use of such implements by Baker on a recent occasion\u2014within a month ; and, such evidence being given, evidence of the use of similar implements in a similar way on an earlier occasion, several years before, would be admissible as tending to establish a practice.\nQuaere whether the admission of such evidence could be supported on the ground that it tended to corroborate the evidence of the accomplices.\nHeld, also, that the criticism against the trial judge's charge to the jury\u2014that he insufficiently warned the jury as to the risk of finding a verdict against the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice\u2014possessed little or no importance when considered in light of the undisputed and indisputable facts proven or admitted by the accused.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming the convictions of the appellants of the crime of murder.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant Baker.\nAustin O'Connor for the appellant Sowash.\nJ.A. Ritchie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014When the undisputed and indisputable facts are understood and the course of the trial is appreciated, it becomes evident that only two questions of any importance are raised by these appeals. The first concerns a criticism directed against the charge of the learned trial judge, and the second concerns the admissibility of certain evidence offered by the Crown in rebuttal. Both these questions must be considered in light of the evidence and the issues to which it was directed. Though the evidence is volum- inous, the case is not a complicated one, and the essential facts and the critical points in controversy at the trial can be easily grasped.\nIn the summer and autumn of 1924, one Marinoff, who lived in Tacoma, was engaged in running liquor from British Columbia into the state of Washington. One Willis kept a stock of liquor in a boat-house near Barclay, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and Marinoff was a purchaser from him. In the early days of September, Marinoff purchased from Willis 350 \" cases,\" so called, of Scotch whisky and gin, and it was arranged that, according to a practice followed in the execution of previous sales, the liquor should be sent in the Beryl G., manned by William Gillis and his son, to an anchorage in a cove at Sidney Island, which is an island situated a little west of the boundary line between Canada and the United States running through Haro Strait, there to be delivered to Marinoff's agents. The Beryl G., with her cargo, duly arrived at the appointed place, and about five or six o'clock in the evening on the 15th of September, 110 cases out of this cargo were delivered to Marinoff's agents, and reached his hands in due course in the United States. Marinoff's agents left the Beryl G. anchored (with one bow anchor weighing from 100 to 150 pounds, and a much lighter one at the stern), with the intention of returning for the remainder of the cargo. Two days later the Beryl G. was discovered a few miles from Sidney Island, adrift. The bow anchor had disappeared, her cargo was gone, and the craft presented unmistakable indications of a sanguinary struggle. Neither of the Gillises has been seen or heard of since, and the appellants have been convicted of the murder of the father.\nIn the first week of September, the appellants, Baker and Sowash, together with Stromkins, who was the principal witness for the Crown at the trial, and one Charlie Morris, were in Victoria (whither they had come from Seattle) ; and it is admitted by Baker and Sowash that, as Stromkins testifies, they then had in view jointly an expedition to the west coast of Vancouver Island, with the object of taking possession of liquor they hoped to find cached in places said to have been disclosed to them as likely places by the customs officials and the provincial police of British Columbia. The police had, Baker insists in his evidence, assured them through one Majowski, a detective from Seattle, that, such liquor having been illegally in the possession of persons who had hidden it, and having been hidden for illegal purposes, anybody who should find it might take it without violating the law of British Columbia, and get it into the United States if he could. This comparatively harmless design was one, at least, of the objects of the expedition. They set forth in a boat owned by Stromkins, called Denman II, and coasted as far north as Port Renfrew, but returned on the 12th or 13th to Esquimalt empty handed. They remained in Victoria until the night of the 15th, when they, that is to say, Baker, Sowash, Charlie Morris and Stromkins, started from Cadboro Bay in the Denman II. Baker says that from Cadboro Bay they went direct to Anacortes, in the state of Washington, and there parted company. Stromkins and Sowash say that, on Baker's proposal, or the proposal of Baker and Morris, they left for Sidney Island with the intention of taking from the Beryl G., whose anchorage was well known, her cargo of liquor; that this purpose was carried out; that William Gillis and his son were killed in the course of its execution ; that the liquor was cached in various places, some on the beach at Sidney Island, some on Gooch Island, some on South Pender Island and some on Moresby Island (though as to this there is some discrepancy between the evidence of Stromkins and that of Sowash).\nAs regards this whole chapter of events, to which Stromkins and Sowash testified\u2014from the departure, at ten o'clock on the evening of the 15th, until the disposal of the liquor was completed\u2014Baker advanced a blank denial. Not only did he say that he was not there himself, but that Denman II. and Stromkins and his passengers were all elsewhere\u2014en voyage from Cadboro Bay to Anacortes; that this part of the story of Stromkins and Sowash is pure fabrication. Two or three days after the 16th of September, when, according to the story of Baker, as well as that of Sowash and Stromkins, all had arrived at Anacortes, and Baker, Sowash and Morris had separated from Stromkins, leaving him with his boat, Baker admits that he, with Sowash and Morris, made arrangements with one Clausen, of Seattle, to go to the British Columbia islands and bring whisky and gin cached there to the American side, on the terms that Clausen was to receive for his services one-third of the liquor recovered ; and that with Clausen, he and Sowash set out on this expedition from Seattle, on the 18th or 19th. They first went to Moresby Island and, under the direction of Baker, discovered and took away with them some twenty cases of whisky and gin, containing 12 quart bottles each, which, however, they were obliged to throw overboard under pressure of pursuit by an American revenue cutter. After this misadventure, they entered Lake Union, where Clausen's boat, the Dolphin, was allowed to lie for about a week, when they, Clausen, Baker and Sowash, set forth again, and this time they went to Sidney Cove, on the northeast side of Sidney Island, and, under the direction of Baker, discovered on the beach above high water mark, a lot of eighteen cases of Scotch whisky and gin (the exact quantity of such liquor which Stromkins states was left above high water mark in this locality on the night of the 15th out of the looted cargo of the Beryl G.) ; two lots of the same kind of liquor on Gooch Island, and another on South Pender Island. All these various lots were together brought to a place on South Pender Island, and deposited there. The liquor so collected was later\u2014in part with the assistance of Clausen, in part with the assistance of one Smith\u2014introduced into Washington state and apparently was sold, under the direction of Baker, who controlled the distribution of the proceeds and still held, at the time of the trial, he declared, $3,200 for Stromkins as his share. It should be mentioned that the liquor which constituted the cargo of the Beryl G. was done up in sacks, described by the witnesses as \" cases,\" of 12 quart bottles each, of Scotch whisky or gin; and it is undisputed that all the whisky and gin recovered from the various places of deposit visited under the direction of Baker by Clausen, Baker and Sowash was in such sacks, except where the sacks had been ruptured by the action of the water.\nBefore proceeding to notice the grounds of appeal, some additional facts, as well as some passages in the evidence which are not undisputed, should be mentioned. According to the story of Stromkins and Sowash, the Beryl G. was towed from Sidney Island to Halibut Island on the night of the 15th by Denman II, and the bow anchor, having been detached, was sunk with the bodies of the Gillises, father and son, which had been fastened together by a pair of handcuffs. These handcuffs, as well as a flashlight, which he used in boarding the Beryl G., had been in possession of Baker, who also had with him on board the Denman II at least two revolvers, with one of which he shot the elder Gillis. It was shewn that there was, on the 16th, a wind prevailing in the vicinity of Halibut Island of about 36 miles an hour, and expert evidence was given to the effect that the Beryl G., when sighted on the 17th, was approximately in a position where, having regard to the weather and the tides, she might be expected to be found if left on the night of the 15th, as in the testimony was averred, in the vicinity of Halibut Island with only her stern anchor holding her. Before leaving Seattle for Victoria, Baker bought a yachtsman's cap with a white top and ornamented profusely with gold braid, on the advice, as he said, of Clausen, who suggested that he might use it in a critical juncture to disarm suspicion by giving himself the appearance of a revenue officer. Stromkins and Sowash say that this cap, together with the revolvers, the handcuffs and the flashlight mentioned above, were brought by Baker on board the Denman II on the night of the 15th. Baker denies that he ever had in his possession handcuffs or a flashlight, and he asserts that for many years before the trial he had not carried a revolver.\nThe criticism directed against the learned trial judge's charge to the jury\u2014that he insufficiently warned the jury as to the risk of finding a verdict against the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice,\u2014is seen to possess little or no importance when considered in light of the facts. The learned trial judge did explain in a most unexceptionable way that the evidence of an accomplice must be weighed and examined with care and suspicion, and that although the jury might convict on such evidence, it would be dangerous to do so. He did explicitly warn the jury that Sowash must be treated as an accomplice, although he did fail to give in express terms the same warning as to Stromkins. A passage in his charge, in which he says in so many words that Sowash corroborates Stromkins, obviously relates exclusively to the Crown's case against Sowash himself, and directs attention to Sowash's own admissions. The learned trial judge did not, it is true, explain to the jury that corroboration in the relevant sense means corroboration not only in respect of some fact tending to shew that the crime was committed, but also in respect of some evidence implicating or tending to implicate the accused.\nIndeed, there is perhaps reason to impute to the charge some tendency to mislead in a sense unfavourable to the accused in this respect, as well as in the explicit labelling of Sowash as an accomplice as contrasted with the absence of any such description of Stromkins in so many words ; and had the corroboration which the jury actually had before them been either scanty or of questionable weight, it might have been necessary to consider the probable effect of these features of the learned judge's observations with some care.\nBut the learned trial judge would have done much less than justice to the force of the uncontroverted facts\u2014facts established by the admissions of the appellants or by independent and unchallenged evidence\u2014if he had led the jury to believe that they were at liberty to regard the evidence of Stromkins in its essential elements or of Sowash in so far as it implicated Baker as destitute of corroboration. Considering the gravity of the crime, corroboration of real substance and weight was no doubt demanded, but it was produced in superfluity. Sowash's case requires no comment; indeed, as to this point, is hardly susceptible of useful comment. As concerns Baker's case, there was one capital issue and one only, for the jury to pass upon. As already intimated, that issue was simply this: Was the narrative of Stromkins and Sowash dealing with the trip of the Denman II to Sidney Island on the night of the 15th and the attack on the Beryl G., and the subsequent disposal of the cargo, a fabrication from beginning to end, or was it not? That is to say, was Baker's story of the uneventful crossing to Anacortes the true story? If this issue were found against Baker, that would be the end of the controversy.\nFirst must be noticed the evidence of Clausen, who deposes to a conversation with Baker, in which Baker told him the liquor they were collecting was the cargo of the Beryl G., which he and his associates had taken by force. The killing was not admitted, Baker's story being that the Gillises had been marooned on one of the islands. But this evidence of Clausen, if believed, was of course, as touching the real issue raised by Baker's defence\u2014as to the attack on the Beryl G., from the Denman II\u2014conclusive against Baker. Clausen, of course, was deeply involved with Baker by his association with him in the collection and sale of the cargo after he became aware, according to his own account, that he was dealing with goods procured by acts of robbery and violence. But however justly suspicious one may be that we are not in possession of the whole story of Clausen's relations with Baker, there is no evidence in the juridical sense that Clausen was from the beginning a party to Baker's design (Clausen's loan to Baker proves nothing) ; and, whatever might have been the position if Baker had been charged with another offence, there is no ground for treating Clausen for our present purpose as an accomplice in the murder.\nClausen's statement is denied by Baker. But Baker, confronted with the necessity of producing an alternative explanation of his expeditions with Clausen and Sowash in the Dolphin, gives an explanation of which it is only necessary to say that in itself it is a highly improbable one and destitute of a shred of support from independent sources.\nIt is in the light of this improbable explanation of Baker's that the corroborative cogency of the admissions of Baker and Sowash must be weighed; and in light of it, the facts already mentioned, the venture as originally conceived, the departure of all the conspirators together on the night of the 15th, the concerted action of all but Stromkins in the recovery of the liquor, the situation of the caches, indicating that they had been selected under stress of emergency, Baker's knowledge of their situation, all tend strongly to confirm the conclusion that the collection of the liquor from these places was only one of the latest steps in execution of a design with which the party set out.\nHad Baker not been called as a witness, and had the facts admitted in his own evidence been put in evidence through the testimony of an independent witness, could it have been suggested either that Stromkins or Sowash was an uncorroborated witness as against Baker, or even that upon that subject any question could possibly arise? His own admissions were conclusive in a higher degree than the testimony of any other witness could be; and his explanation, given by himself, cannot be said to weaken the case against him. There seems little room for doubt that the accused suffered no substantial wrong because the trial judge did not more elaborately discuss the subject of corroboration with the jury. So also, in face of the admissions of Baker and Sowash, it seems idle to suggest prejudice resulting either from the refusal to postpone the trial or the admission of the memorandum of proposed evidence which got into the hands of the jury.\nA question remains, however, which requires careful examination, and that is the question affecting the admissibility of the evidence, adduced in rebuttal, of the witnesses Johnston and Marinoff. It seems impossible to support the admission of this evidence as going to credit alone; the rule is rudimentary that, except in certain well-known classes of cases within which the present case does not fall, a cross-examiner is bound to accept the answers of the witness unless the testimony so given is in itself relevant to one of the issues between the parties. Subject, at all events, to a qualification which seems to be open to question (Thompson v. The King[1], namely, that the admission of the testimony in question could be supported on the ground that it tended to corroborate the evidence of Stromkins and Sowash, the point to be considered is whether this evidence was in the legal sense relevant to any issue between the Crown and Baker. The view taken by some of the judges in the court below may, perhaps, be put in this way: The case against Baker, as exhibited in the evidence on behalf of the Crown, was that in concert with the others he attacked the crew of the Beryl G., under the pretence that he and his associates were officers of the law, one of them being disguised in such a way as to present the appearance of a revenue officer, and the party being equipped with and displaying such arms and implements as such officers might be expected to use in dealing with the possessors of a contraband cargo of liquor. Evi- dence, therefore, of the fact that Baker on one occasion recently, and on another at a considerably earlier date, had employed similar equipment and precisely this ruse for the purpose of deceiving and disarming the opposition of bootleggers while he took over their illegal possessions, was admissible on the same principle as the possession of the ordinary implements of burglary would be admissible to prove a charge implicating the accused in a burglary in which such implements had been used.\nThis seems at first sight to be open to some criticism. It may be said that the issue was not whether Baker was personally implicated in an act of piracy involving murder, in which such implements and methods were employed, or, in other words, whether Baker was present and took part in an attack on the Beryl G. from the Denman II ; the issue of substance was: Did any such attack take place at all? The evidence establishing that such methods were employed establishes, if accepted, that the crime was committed, as Stromkins and Sowash say it was\u2014and that being established, there could be, as between the Crown and Baker, no substantial issue left. This criticism appears, however, when analyzed, to go to the form in which the view is expressed, rather than to the substance of it. It can be stated in another form, when, as will appear, the criticism seems to miss the mark.\nThe principle of law to be applied is hardly in doubt, but the most apt statement of it for the present purpose is, I think, to be found in the judgment of Lord Sumner (in which Lord Parker concurred), in Thompson's Case[2], in these passages:\u2014\nNo one doubts that it does not tend to prove a man guilty of a particular crime to show that he is the kind of man who would commit a crime, or that he is generally disposed to crime and even to a particular crime; but, sometimes for one reason sometimes for another, evidence is admissible, notwithstanding that its general character is to show that the accused had in him the makings of a criminal, for example, in proving guilty knowledge, or intent, or system, or in rebutting an appearance of innocence which, unexplained, the facts might wear. In cases of coining, uttering, procuring abortion, demanding by menaces, false pretences and sundry species of frauds, such evidence is constantly and properly admitted. Before an issue can be said to be raised, which would permit the introduction of such evidence so obviously prejudicial to the accused, it must have been raised in substance if not in so many words, and the issue so raised must be one to which the prejudicial evidence is relevant. The mere theory that a plea of not guilty puts everything material in issue is not enough for this purpose. The prosecution cannot credit the accused with fancy defences in order to rebut them at the outset with some damning piece of prejudice. No doubt it is paradoxical that a man, whose act is so nakedly wicked as to admit of no doubt about its character, may be better off in regard to admissibility of evidence than a man whose acts are at any rate capable of having a decent face put upon them, and that the accused can exclude evidence that would be admissible and fatal if he ran two defences by prudently confining himself to one. Still, so it is ***\nI certainly do not think it could be held that, as a matter of course, even in the case of crimes of this class, the articles found in a man's possession, not as parts of the transaction which is being enquired into, but at a separate time and place, could, as such, be put in evidence against him merely because they were such as criminals possess or use, and in the absence of any circumstance in the crime tending to show specific connection between it and the articles in question. If a man could be convicted of a particular burglary, in which it was clear that no tools had been used at all, merely because at another place and time burglar's impleplements were found on his premises, it is difficult to see what limit could be put to the admissibility of general evidence of bad character, and the fact that evidence of articles found on the premises of accused persons is constantly given without much question, though I doubt not in the vast majority of cases quite rightly, is really only misleading, unless at the same time we ask the question what exactly does this purport to prove and by what probative nexus does it seek to prove it. *** All lawyers recognize, as part of their professional premises, that there is all the difference in the world between evidence proving that the accused is a bad man and evidence proving that he is the man. Laymen are apt to think that the difference, if any, is in favour of admitting the former. There must be something to connect the circumstance tendered in evidence, not only with the accused, but with his participation in the crime.\nWas there, then, an issue before the jury in respect of which the impeached testimony was relevant in the sense indicated in these passages in Lord Sumner's judgment? I think there was. At a very early stage the Crown pointedly raised the issue by eliciting from Stromkins evidence indicating that the design with which Baker and his companions became associated was not limited to the comparatively harmless one of picking up unguarded deposits of liquor without resorting to violent measures; but to take such liquor whenever a convenient opportunity arose, and if necessary to employ force and to facilitate success by the stratagem said to have been actually put into effect. Evidence was adduced of Baker's purchase of a cap and, as already mentioned, of his possession of revolvers and a flashlight and handcuffs, and of a significant remark by him on sighting the Beryl G. at the mouth of Sooke Har- bour. It would have been competent to the Crown to call evidence of a practice among criminals of Baker's class to use such implements in the way suggested, as tending to shew that the possession of them was not accidental or innocent. The possession of the implements, especially if so supplemented, would be evidence that the design of the expeditions and of the whole venture on which they were engaged was as the Crown contended. It is within the principle of the observations quoted, and of the decision of this Court in Brunet v. The King[3], and of that of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Armstrong[4], to hold that, as bearing upon the issue thus raised (as to design) it was relevant to shew a similar use of such implements by Baker on a recent occasion\u2014within a month; and such evidence being given, it would appear that evidence of the use of similar implements in a similar way on an earlier occasion, several years before, would be admissible as tending to establish a practice. The existence of such a design would in itself be relevant on the cardinal issue whether, when the party left Cadboro Bay, Baker having these implements with him, they left with the intention of attacking the Beryl G. or crossing to Anacortes direct.\nAn objection was raised concerning the admissibility of a passage in Stromkins' evidence professing to report a remark made by Morris to Stromkins on the Denman II immediately after the killing of the Gillises which, perhaps, deserves a word of notice. Morris' remark consisted in the exclamation, \"The cold-blooded murderers!\" The admissibility of this evidence does not, in view of the circumstances, appear to be open to serious doubt. The learned trial judge was entitled to find, for the purpose of determining the question of admissibility, that the criminal acts of Baker and Sowash, to which Stromkins had testified, were within the scope of the objects of a conspiracy with which Morris was identified, and identified so narrowly as to constitute him the alter ego of Baker and Sowash in relation to the incidents of the crime and contemporaneous comments upon them. In point of law, such a comment, uttered in such circumstances by Morris, was, as the learned trial judge was entitled, for that purpose, to find, the comment of the appellants. (Rex v. Brandreth [5], per Richards L.C.B.)\nThe appeals should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant Baker: Moresby, O'Reilly & Lowe.\nSolicitor for the appellant Sowash: R. D.

Union Trust Co., [1927] S.C.R. 1\nDate: 1926-12-01\nHorace B. Forman (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Union Trust Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1926: November 4, 5; 1926: December 1.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nEvidence\u2014Letter signed intended to embody terms of deposit of money\u2014Inadmissibility of parol evidence to contradict, vary or explain\u2014Evidence received without objection at trial put aside by appellate court.\nPlaintiff deposited with defendant $20,000 to be held and paid out on certain terms. At an interview between plaintiff and defendant\u2019s manager there was drafted in the latter\u2019s handwriting and signed by plaintiff the following letter from plaintiff to defendant, which was intended to embody plaintiff\u2019s full instructions to defendant: \u201cThere will be paid to you * * * $20,000 * * * This payment is in connection with the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate. You will please hold these funds until such time as you are instructed by [G.] that it is proper for you to pay same out and you will pay same to such persons, firms or corporations as [G.] may direct and this shall be your sufficient authority.\u201d The moneys were (as found by the court) paid out by defendant according to G.\u2019s directions.\nHeld, that parol evidence was not admissible to show a stipulation, alleged by plaintiff but denied by defendant, that, as a term of the deposit, the moneys were not to be paid out by defendant unless the sum of $50,000 should be received by the defendant under the provisions of an earlier document known as the \u201cHayes-Lorrain Syndicate agreement.\u201d The reference in the letter to the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate, on its face, merely identified the matter for which the money was to be held and used, and did not cover such a stipulation as alleged by plaintiff; and extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties in making it was not admissible. The rule of law that extrinsic evidence is not, in general, admissible to contradict, vary or explain written instruments must be enforced in cases that fairly come within it.\nAlthough the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of the antecedent conversation, at said interview, as to the terms of his deposit was received without objection and acted upon by the trial judge, the appellate court, upon being satisfied that a writing had been agreed to which was meant to embody those terms, rightly put that evidence aside and decided the case upon the evidence properly admissible. (Jacker v. International Cable Co., 5 T.L.R., 13).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] allowing an appeal from the judgment of Kelly J. in favour of the plaintiff[2].\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim was to recover the sum of $20,000 and interest for moneys alleged to have been paid to the defendant upon certain trusts, and alleged to have been paid out by the defendant otherwise than in accordance with the said trusts. The defendant denied any indebtedness to the plaintiff, stating that the moneys were paid out in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s instructions. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nThe appeal was dismissed with costs.\nJ.A. Worrell K.C. and R.H. Sankey for the appellant.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover a sum of $20,000 deposited by him with the defendant. The deposit of the money and that it was held on some terms is common ground. The plaintiff complains that the moneys were wrongfully paid out by the defendants in contravention of the terms of deposit.\nOne of the two terms alleged by the plaintiff is denied by the defendant. The existence of the other is common ground and the question is as to its fulfilment, the defendant maintaining and the plaintiff denying that it was in fact observed. The learned trial judge, Kelly J., upheld the plaintiff\u2019s contention on both grounds2. The Appellate Division unanimously accepted the view put forward by the defendant on both points1.\nThe terms of deposit alleged by the plaintiff were\n(a) that the moneys were not to be paid out by the defendant \u201cunless the full $50,000 (referred to in the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate agreement) was actually paid into the Trust Company; and\n(b) then not to pay it out except on instructions by Mr. Gallagher and to whom Mr. Gallagher might direct, all for the purposes of the Hayes-Lorrain agreement.\u201d\nWhether the existence of term (a), which was not observed, is established by evidence legally admissible is one question; and, if not, whether term (b) was complied with is the other. A decision of either in the plaintiff\u2019s favour would mean the allowance of his appeal.\nIt may be as well to say at once that consideration of the evidence has fully satisfied us that on the second question the conclusion reached by the Appellate Division, that payment was made by the defendant with Gallagher\u2019s approval, is right and cannot be disturbed. It is true that Forman did not advise Gallagher of the fact that he had made his (Gallagher\u2019s) approval a condition of the Trust Company\u2019s payment out of the $20,000 and also that he did not authorize Gallagher to give such approval; but Lang (the defendant company\u2019s trust manager) communicated these instructions to Gallagher on the 23rd of May\u2014both he and Gallagher say so\u2014and Gallagher with knowledge of them undoubtedly authorized the payment over to the vendors by the Trust Company of all the moneys held by it in connection with the purchase of the properties in question. The Trust Company was fully justified in concluding that such payments were sanctioned by Gallagher and had no reason to suspect that such sanction had not been authorized by the plaintiff.\nThe question whether the Trust Company held the plaintiff\u2019s money subject to the condition that before payment of it out $50,000 should be actually in its hands in pay- ment of subscriptions under the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate agreement must now be considered.\nThe arrangement for the deposit with the defendant company of the $20,000 was made at an interview on the 22nd of May, 1923, between Mr. Lang and the plaintiff, no other person being present. There is direct conflict between them as to the $50,000 stipulation, the plaintiff deposing that it was distinctly made by him and assented to by Lang and the latter that nothing of the kind took place. Both are, however, agreed that Lang during the interview expressed the desire that the plaintiff\u2019s instructions as to the deposit should be put in writing, and that the plaintiff acceded to this request. On this point the plaintiff says:\u2014\nMr. Lang stated that he understood me perfectly in the matter but would prefer to have it in writing over my signature so he called in a typist and dictated what is known as my letter of instruction to the Trust Company of May 22.\nQ. Is that the letter signed by you?\u2014A. No, I do not think this is it; it looks like my signature, but I thought it was typed; he called in somebody who typed it, I am almost sure.\nQ. That is your signature?\u2014A. It appears to be my signature, yes.\nAnd on cross-examination he said:\u2014\nQ. I also understood you to say that as soon as you started to mention conditions upon which your money might be paid out, Mr. Lang at once said: \u201cWe must have written authority from you, Mr. Forman\u201d?\u2014A. Yes; written authority over my signature.\nQ. And this letter (Exhibit 14) was then signed by you?\u2014A. Yes.\nLang explicitly denied that there was any allusion by the plaintiff at the interview of the 22nd of May to the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate agreement or to the retention of his money by the Trust Company until it should have received $50,000 under that agreement. His account of the interview, so far as material, is as follows:\u2014\nQ. I want you to come to this interview which the plaintiff had with you on the 22nd of May,1923, and I would like your account of that interview in as much detail as you can give it to me?\u2014A. Well, Mr. Forman came into the office without any introduction at all, and told me who he was, and that he wanted to give us some money.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. I am pretty sure that I told him that we had title deeds there in connection with these mining claims he talked about which were being held by us against payment.\nQ. Of the purchase price?\u2014A. I do not recollect that I told him the purchase price; I cannot be sure of that.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. The next thing, as I recollect it, was his mention of Mr. Gallagher\u2019s name, and the greater part of that interview consisted of him telling me about Mr. Gallagher, and asking me what I knew about him, and his statement that he was going to leave it entirely to Mr. Gallagher, and whatever Mr. Gallagher did was going to be all right. Following that I told him if he wanted to give us any money he should give us instructions in writing as to what we were to do with it. He agreed to that, and I pulled a sheet of paper out of my drawer and proceeded to take down his instructions.\nQ. Had he or had he not before this time outlined his instructions\u2014before the paper was produced?\u2014A. The first part of the conversation was very general as far as I know. We did not get down to business until I pulled this paper out of my desk and started to write down what he wanted me to do. So far as that letter was concerned, I wrote it, it is in my handwriting.\nQ. That is the letter of May 22nd, 1923, which has been put in as Exhibit 14?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. That letter, I would say, was really at Mr. Forman\u2019s dictation; he did not dictate the words I should use\u2014I did that myself because I was writing it\u2014but he undoubtedly told me what he wanted put in that letter, and that is the way it was written.\nQ. Was there some discussion during the drafting of that letter as to the various points which it mentions?\u2014A. I do not think so; the letter was written without any difficulty at all as to instructions.\nQ. Was the letter signed, the first draft of it, or were several drafts required?\u2014A. It was signed immediately without any change.\nQ. Did the interview continue after the signing of the letter for some time, or did it end shortly afterwards?\u2014A. I would not be sure, but the interview was short, in any case; it did not last very long.\nQ. About how long?\u2014A. Not more than ten to fifteen minutes at the outside.\nQ. Have you given me your account of the interview as fully as you can?\u2014A. Except this, that most of our talk was about Mr. Gallagher, in my office, and his reliance upon Mr. Gallagher; I cannot emphasize that too much.\nQ. Was that mentioned once or more than once?\u2014A. Mentioned repeatedly.\nQ. Mr. Forman has said that the interview was opened by his producing a copy of the syndicate agreement, as he calls it, and that you glanced at that agreement and told him it was unnecessary for you to read it, because the Trust Company had a copy. What do you say to that?\u2014A. I cannot recollect that at all.\nQ. You have no recollection as to that conversation taking place?\u2014A. Absolutely not, none at all.\n* * *\nMr. Thomson: As I understood Mr. Forman\u2019s evidence he said that he told you clearly and in a way not capable of being misunderstood by you that he was paying this sum of $20,000, or the additional sum of $15,000\u2014I have forgotten which\u2014under the syndicate agreement?\u2014A. No, that is not my recollection of it at all.\n* * *\nHis Lordship: Give us his instructions as you say he gave them to you?\u2014A. His instructions were that he was to give us this money and we were to pay it out when Mr. Gallagher said it was all right to do it.\nMr. Thomson: Q. And Mr. Forman said very definitely that in addition to the stipulations which are covered by the document, Exhibit 14, he made a further stipulation not covered by the document, to this effect: \u201cMy money is not to be paid out until $50,000 has been subscribed to the syndicate agreement.\u201d What do you say as to that?\u2014A. I say that he is absolutely mistaken about that, that it is not correct.\nQ. At any rate I suppose you endeavoured to cover in the writing (Exhibit 14) and to cover accurately Mr. Forman\u2019s instructions to you?\u2014A. Undoubtedly so.\nQ. Do you think you did?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe letter written by Lang in his own hand, and not by a typist as Forman thought, reads as follows:\u2014\nUNION TRUST COMPANY,\nTORONTO.\nThe Union Trust Company, Limited,\nToronto, Ont.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014There will be paid to you in the course of a few days a total of $20,000 sent for my account from Bioren & Co., of Philadelphia. This payment is in connection with the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate. You will please hold these funds until such time as you are instructed by Mr. Ziba Gallagher that it is proper for you to pay same out and you will pay same to such persons, firms or corporations as Mr. Ziba Gallagher may direct and this will be your sufficient authority.\nDated May 22,1923.\nHORACE B. FORMAN, Jr.,\nHaverford, Pa., U.S.A.\nWitness: D.W. Lang.\nKindly send draft for the premium on these funds for my credit at Bank of Montreal, Gananoque, Ont.\nHORACE B. FORMAN, Jr.\nBoth Forman and Lang agree that this letter was intended to embody the plaintiff\u2019s full instructions to the Trust Company as to the terms on which the latter should accept and hold the $20,000. As to the disputed term the plaintiff says he understood it to be covered by the sentence: \u201cThis payment is in connection with the Hayes-Lorrain Syndicate.\u201d Lang says this reference was merely to identify the matter for which the money was to be held and used. The reference does not ex facie import what the plaintiff says he understood it to cover; its apparent significance is what Lang attributes to it. Extrinsic evidence of the intention of the parties in making it is not admissible.\nMoreover, if, as the plaintiff suggests, it was meant thereby to recognize the existence of the so-called syndicate agreement and to subject the holding of the plaintiff\u2019s money by the defendant to its terms, it must be borne in mind that the 30 days during which, under that agreement, the Trust Company was to hold the plaintiff\u2019s money had already expired and there is no hint of any other period having been substituted, so that, if the $50,000 were not paid to the Trust Company it might have been obliged to hold the plaintiff\u2019s money indefinitely. This syndicate agreement had not been executed by anybody except the plaintiff and by him only as to his original $5,000 subscription. When he agreed to put up the extra $15,000 he entered into an arrangement with Kemmerer, one of the vendors to the syndicate, that he should become interested with him (Kemmerer) in the transaction and bargained for a share of Kemmerer\u2019s promotion stock. Gallagher, who had been apprised of these facts on the morning of the 22nd of May, then understood that the syndicate agreement had been abandoned and was no longer to be taken account of. These considerations, however, rather bear upon the question whether the story told of the interview of the 22nd of May by the plaintiff or that told by Lang is the more probable and would scarcely suffice to outweigh the explicit finding of the learned trial judge that Forman\u2019s testimony rather than Lang\u2019s was entitled to credence.\nBut it seems clear that any parol evidence of the conversation during which the letter of the 22nd of May, 1923, was written is not admissible to add to or vary the instructions which it contains. That letter, according to the plaintiff\u2019s own story, having been written to formulate the terms and conditions of the Trust Company\u2019s authority in regard to the $20,000 deposit, it was, to quote the language of Judge Taylor (Taylor on Evidence,11th ed., p.776): \u201cintended finally to embody the entire agreement between the parties.\u201d The admission of parol evidence in such a case would be fraught with all the dangers to obviate which it has been established as a rule of law that extrinsic evidence is not, in general, admissible to contradict, vary or explain written instruments. (Best on Evidence, 10th ed., p. 208). This salutary rule affords the best, often the only, protection against mistakes arising from treacherous memory, and courts must enforce it in cases that fairly come within it. The consequences of allowing it to be frittered away would be deplorable.\nAlthough Mr. Forman\u2019s evidence of the antecedant conversation as to the terms of his deposit was received with- out objection and acted upon by the trial judge, the Court of Appeal, upon being satisfied that a writing had been agreed to which was meant to embody those terms, rightly put that evidence aside and decided the case upon the evidence properly admissible. Jacker v. International Cable Co.\nFor these reasons the appeal fails and will be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Worrell, Gwynne & Beatty.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\n[1] 29 Ont.

On the 16th of November, 1859, a son was born of the marriage, was baptised and given the name of his father, Raphael. On the 19th of February, 1863, another son was born, was baptised and received the name of Pierre Etienne. Pierre Etienne died on the 28th of September, 1864. His brother, Raphael, died on the 31st of December, 1878. Their father had died on the 30th of May, 1863. It would therefore appear that, after 1878, of the immediate family, there survived only the widow, the donee under the marriage contract. She died on the 17th of October, 1918, without having contracted a second marriage. On the 9th of July, 1912, she made her last will and testament, modified by a first and second codicil, dated respectively the 25th of January, 1914, and the 18th of December, 1914. The only relevant part of her testamentary disposition is the admitted fact that by the will she left to the female respondent, her niece, all the property of which she died possessed. The female respondent accepted the succession of her aunt and entered upon the possession of the property to her bequeathed. It is common ground that among the property taken possession of by respondent was the property owned by her deceased uncle, the husband of the testatrix, on the date of his death, and covered by the clause of the marriage contract. There were living at the date of the death of the testatrix some fifty-one nephews and nieces, among whom was the respondent. The appellant, a nephew of the deceased Raphael Dufort, brought the present action, in which he alleges the marriage contract, the marriage, the birth and death of the two sons, the death of the widow, the will made by the widow and the taking possession of the estate by respondent; and further alleges that Dame Elmire Deslauriers, by the terms of her marriage contract, was bound to preserve all the property, the usufruct of which only was given to her by her deceased husband, for that at the extinction or termination of the usufruct, the same should be handed over to the heirs at law \u201cdu c\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc et ligne\u201d of her late husband. The appellant further alleges that the usufruct of the properties found in the estate of Raphael Dufort. having terminated by the death of Madame Dufort, on the 11th of October, 1918, and inasmuch as the children born of the marriage were then dead, without issue, the property existing at the date of the death of Raphael Dufort, and still existing at the date of the death of Madame Dufort, returned to and became the property of the heirs at law of the \u201cc\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc et ligne\u201d of the husband, the whole in accordance with the terms of the marriage contract. And the prayer of the action is that the appellant be declared to be the owner of an undivided 1\/51 part of the estate of the late Raphael Dufort, and a partition of the said property be made and the respondent be ordered to render an account of the fruits and revenues of the said property during the period which she illegally held possession of it. The respondent pleads, practically admitting all the facts alleged, that the clause in the marriage contract relied upon by the appellant did not create a substitution; that the clause is null and of no effect; that Madame Dufort inherited from her children the property in question, that she became and was at the date of the making of her last will and testament, and at the date of her death, the absolute owner of the property, and that she possessed the power of disposing of the same by her will; and that the respondent in virtue of the will became vested with the absolute ownership of all the property.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014L\u2019appelant, neveu de feu Rapha\u00ebl Bourget dit Dufort (que je vais appeler Rapha\u00ebl Dufort), se pourvoit contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e par voie d\u2019action en p\u00e9tition d\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 et met en cause les autres neveux et ni\u00e8ces de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort, lesquels, dit-il, sont, avec lui-m\u00eame et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ses plus proches h\u00e9ritiers. Sa part dans cette succession serait d\u2019un cinquante-uni\u00e8me, et il demande le partage des biens qui en d\u00e9pendent. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (DeLormier J.) a accord\u00e9 ses conclusions, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi. De l\u00e0 l\u2019appel.\nCommen\u00e7ons par un rapide expos\u00e9 des faits saillants de la cause.\nLe 23 f\u00e9vrier 1859, Rapha\u00ebl Dufort et Elmire Legault dit Deslauriers contract\u00e8rent mariage \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, apr\u00e8s avoir fait, le 20 f\u00e9vrier, un contrat de mariage devant L. S. Martin, notaire. Ce contrat stipulait s\u00e9paration de biens, douaire pr\u00e9fix en la somme de $2,000, affectant un immeuble de l\u2019\u00e9poux situ\u00e9 au faubourg Saint-Antoine, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et il contenait, en outre, la convention suivante qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au proc\u00e8s:\nEn consid\u00e9ration du dit futur mariage les futurs \u00e9poux se sont fait et se font par ces pr\u00e9sentes, Fun \u00e0 l\u2019autre et au survivant d\u2019eux, ce acceptant, donation viag\u00e8re, mutuelle, \u00e9gale et r\u00e9ciproque de tous les dits biens meubles et immeubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques qui se trouveront appartenir au premier mourant d\u2019eux au jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s de quelque nature et en quelques lieux et endroits qu\u2019ils soient et en quoi qu\u2019ils puissent monter et consister, pour en jouir par le dit survivant en usufruit seulement pendant sa vie \u00e0 sa caution juratoire en faisant bon et loyal inventaire, tant que le dit survivant ne convolera pas en secondes noces; auquel cas de secondes noces, le dit usufruit sera \u00e9teint; pour apr\u00e8s son extinction, retourner les dits biens aux h\u00e9ritiers des dits futurs \u00e9poux du c\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc et ligne d\u2019o\u00f9 ils proc\u00e8deront;\nCette donation vaudra qu\u2019il y ait enfant ou enfants n\u00e9s alors ou \u00e0 na\u00eetre du fit futur mariage, car ainsi, &c.\nRapha\u00ebl Dufort d\u00e9c\u00e9da \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 20 mai 1863, laissant son \u00e9pouse et deux enfants issus de son mariage avec cette derni\u00e8re, savoir Denis-Rapha\u00ebl, n\u00e9 le 15 novembre 1859, et Pierre-Etienne, n\u00e9 le 19 f\u00e9vrier 1863. Ces deux enfants sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s en minorit\u00e9, le second le 28 septembre 1864, et l\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 le 28 d\u00e9cembre 1878. Madame Dufort ne convola pas en secondes noces, et mourut \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 11 octobre 1918, instituant l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme sa l\u00e9gataire universelle. Outre ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, l\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue que la veuve de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort vendit sans droit pour $15,000 deux terres dont elle n\u2019avait que l\u2019usufruit. Il ne conclut cependant pas \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la vente, probablement parce qu\u2019on lui aurait oppos\u00e9 la prescription, mais il veut partager dans le prix. Quant aux autres biens laiss\u00e9s par Rapha\u00ebl Dufort, l\u2019appelant en demande le partage entre lui, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les mis-en-cause suivant leurs droits respectifs.\nLe code civil est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 1er ao\u00fbt 1866 et rappelant base ses pr\u00e9tentions sur le droit ant\u00e9rieur au code. Il faut cependant observer que le code ne contient pas v\u00e9ritablement un droit nouveau. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ses dispositions sont d\u00e9claratoires du droit existant lors de la codification, sauf lorsqu\u2019il innove express\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce droit. La mati\u00e8re des successions ab intestat est l\u2019une de celles o\u00f9 il y a eu telle innovation, et c\u2019est sous l\u2019empire de l\u2019ancien droit (je vais ainsi d\u00e9sginer le droit ant\u00e9rieur au code) que se sont ouvertes les successions de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort et de son second fils, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1864. La succession ab intestat de son fils a\u00een\u00e9, au contraire, s\u2019est ouverte apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur du code civil, ce qui entra\u00eenera \u00e0 son \u00e9gard l\u2019application des nouvelles r\u00e8gles adopt\u00e9es par le code. Je reviendrai sur ce point.\nEnvisageant maintenant la clause que j\u2019ai rapport\u00e9e plus haut, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019elle renferme une donation \u00e0 cause de mort ou institution contractuelle, car elle ne porte que sur les biens qui se trouveront appartenir au premier mourant des \u00e9poux au jour de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Avant comme depuis le code les donations \u00e0 cause de mort ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 permises dans les contrats de mariage. Les parties envisagent cette clause, soit comme stipulant un droit de retour, soit comme cr\u00e9ant une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire, soit enfin comme ne conf\u00e9rant au survivant des \u00e9poux qu\u2019un simple droit d\u2019usufruit, sans disposition quant \u00e0 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, l\u2019appelant en parle comme d\u2019une substitution, le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure y voit un droit de retour, et la troisi\u00e8me solution est celle que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9conise et que la Cour du Banc du Roi a accept\u00e9e. Il reste toutefois une quatri\u00e8me alternative, dont il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans les jugements, de savoir si la partie finale de la clause n\u2019a pas plut\u00f4t pour objet de cr\u00e9er des propres de succession. Je me propose d\u2019examiner ces alternatives, ce qui entra\u00eenera la discussion de r\u00e8gles de droit abrog\u00e9es par le code. Il est clair, en effet, qu\u2019il faut entendre la clause dans le sens que lui donnait le droit coutumier fran\u00e7ais, car de m\u00eame que les actes s\u2019interpr\u00e8tent suivant la loi du lieu o\u00f9 ils sont pass\u00e9s (art. 8, C.C.), de m\u00eame faut-il consulter la loi en vigueur lors de la passation d\u2019un acte pour en d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e juridique.\nLes parties nous ont cit\u00e9 quatre causes o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019une clause plus ou moins analogue: Barras v. Lagueux[2], Andrews J.; Th\u00e9oret v. Chaurette, Cour de Revision[3]; H oude v. Marchand, Cour du Banc du Roi[4]; Tass\u00e9 v. Goyer, Cour de Revision[5].\nDans la premi\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce, le contrat de mariage ant\u00e9rieur au code ne stipulait pas le retour en faveur des h\u00e9ritiers de l\u2019\u00e9poux donateur, mais disait simplement que les biens retourneraient du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de celui dont ils proc\u00e9daient, et le juge Andrews a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas et ne pouvait y avoir de substitution. Dans les trois autres causes, les contrats de mariage \u00e9taient subs\u00e9quents au code, et on avait stipul\u00e9 que les biens retourneraient aux h\u00e9ritiers de l\u2019\u00e9poux donateur; la Cour du Banc du Roi, dans la cause de Houde v. Marchand[6], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait substitution, mais la Cour de Revision s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e en sens contraire dans les deux causes jug\u00e9es par elle. J\u2019ai lu ces jugements bien attentivement, mais il me semble qu\u2019il faut remonter plus loin pour trouver la solution du probl\u00e8me qui nous occupe.\nComme je l\u2019ai dit, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il y avait ici un droit de retour en faveur de ceux qui, \u00e0 l\u2019extinction de l\u2019usufruit de Mme Dufort, se trouvaient les plus proches h\u00e9ritiers de feu Rapha\u00ebl Dufort. La Cour du Banc du Roi, au contraire, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Mme Dufort n\u2019avait qu\u2019une droit d\u2019usufruit que le contrat de mariage n\u2019avait pas dispos\u00e9 de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens grev\u00e9s de l\u2019usufruit, que cette nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9volue aux deux enfants de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, et que Mme Dufort l\u2019avait recueillie comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de ses enfants. Aucun des juges n\u2019a vu dans la clause du contrat de mariage une substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire. Il est clair, en effet, qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre question de substitution si Mme Dufort n\u2019avait qu\u2019un droit d\u2019usufruit, car en supposant m\u00eame qu\u2019il y aurait eu disposition de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur des h\u00e9ritiers de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort par voie de retour conventionnel, nous n\u2019aurions pas ici les deux donations portant sur la m\u00eame chose qui sont de l\u2019essence de la substitution.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que la donation faite au survivant des \u00e9poux ne porte que sur l\u2019usufruit des biens et que partant il n\u2019y a pas de substitution. Cette donation est dite \u00eatre une \u201cdonation viag\u00e8re\u201d, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une donation pour la vie du donataire, et m\u00eame celui-ci perd ses droits s\u2019il convole en secondes noces. Du reste, il en jouit \u201cen usufruit seulement\u201d, ce qui exclut l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une donation en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi il ne peut y avoir de substitution avec la charge de rendre qu\u2019elle comporte.\nNous en venons maintenant \u00e0 la partie finale de la clause,\npour apr\u00e8s son extinction (de l\u2019usufruit) retourner les dits biens aux h\u00e9ritiers des futurs \u00e9poux du c\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc et ligne d\u2019o\u00f9 ils.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait stipulation d\u2019un droit de retour conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 779 du code civil.\nL\u2019\u00e9tude de cette question de droit de retour doit \u00eatre combin\u00e9e avec celle de la quatri\u00e8me alternative que j\u2019ai signal\u00e9e plus haut, savoir si la partie finale de la clause du contrat de mariage ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme stipulant que les biens provenant de chacun des \u00e9poux\u2014car il y est question des biens des deux \u00e9poux\u2014seront propres dans la succession de l\u2019\u00e9poux dont ils proviennent, et, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans la succession de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort, le premier mourant. Dans l\u2019ancien droit, la convention cr\u00e9ant des propres de succession, appel\u00e9s \u201cpropres conventionnels\u201d, et qui ne pouvait se faire que par contrat de mariage, avait un effet consid\u00e9rable dans les successions ab intestat.\nParlons d\u2019abord du droit de retour. L\u2019article 779 du code civil\u2014qui n\u2019est pas indiqu\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant de droit nouveau\u2014 para\u00eet admettre que ce droit soit stipul\u00e9 en faveur du donateur ou des tiers. Cet article s\u2019exprime comme suit:\n779. Le donateur peut stipuler le droit de retour des choses donn\u00e9es, soit pour le cas de pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s du donataire seul, soit pour le cas du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s du donataire et de ses descendants.\nLa condition r\u00e9solutoire peut dans tous les cas \u00eatre stipul\u00e9e soit au profit du donateur lui-m\u00eame soit au profit des tiers.\nL\u2019exercice du droit de retour ou autre droit r\u00e9solutoire a lieu en mati\u00e8re de donation de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re et avec les m\u00eames effets que l\u2019exercice du droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le cas de vente.\nLe droit de retour est plus \u00e9tendu dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec qu\u2019en France o\u00f9, par crainte des substitutions, les auteurs du Code Napol\u00e9on Font restreint au seul donateur (art. 951, C.N.). Le deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de notre article permet de stipuler le droit de retour au profit du donateur ou des tiers, mais la formule qu\u2019il emploie semble envisager l\u00e0 condition r\u00e9solutoire en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dont le droit de retour, qui est certainement une condition r\u00e9solutoire, n\u2019est qu\u2019une esp\u00e8ce. Cette g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 des termes de l\u2019article 779 C.C. a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention des Lords du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Herse v. Dufaux[7]. Je ne me propose pas de la discuter ici, car il est certain que le droit de retour peut \u00eatre stipul\u00e9 soit en faveur du donateur, soit au profit des tiers, y compris les h\u00e9ritiers du donateur envisag\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de celui-ci, et alors, puisqu\u2019il est subordonn\u00e9 au pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e8s du donataire, ou du donataire et de ses descendants, il op\u00e8re comme condition r\u00e9solutoire et an\u00e9antit, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019accomplit, la donation elle-m\u00eame. Mais ce qu\u2019il convient de noter, c\u2019est que lorsque le droit de retour est stipul\u00e9 au profit d\u2019autres personnes que le donateur, il rentre plut\u00f4t dans la cat\u00e9gorie des substitutions (Demolombe, t. 18, nos 110 et 111; Aubry & Rau, 5e \u00e9d., t. 11, p. 296) car, ainsi que le dit Troplong (Donations, t 3, n\u00b0 1267), le droit de retour fait remonter la chose vers sa source, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au donateur, tandis que la substitution l\u2019en \u00e9loigne. Or, ici, il n\u2019y a certainement pas substitution, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a une condition r\u00e9solutoire dont l\u2019effet serait d\u2019an\u00e9antir la donation. Il n\u2019y a pas m\u00eame une donation en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au survivant, mais seulement un droit de jouissance, et il n\u2019y a rien qui puisse faire retour du donataire aux h\u00e9ritiers du donateur. De quelque mani\u00e8re que j\u2019envisage la clause, je ne puis y voir un droit de retour.\nReste l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que la partie finale de la clause du contrat de mariage ne serait que la stipulation que les biens en question seront des propres de succession. La stipulation de propre, que Guyot, dans son R\u00e9pertoire de Jurisprudence (vo. R\u00e9alisation, tome 14, pp. 456 et suiv.), appelait la clause de r\u00e9alisation, \u00e9tait bien connue dans l\u2019ancien droit o\u00f9 elle a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 de nombreuses controverses. Elle pouvait avoir pour but de modifier la communaut\u00e9 de biens entre \u00e9poux, et sous cette modalit\u00e9 elle existe encore dans le droit actuel, ou bien de rendre des biens propres de succession, et dans ce cas elle ne se faisait que par contrat de mariage. On l\u2019exprimait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en disant que certains biens, par exemple des meubles, seraient propres \u00e0 l\u2019un des \u00e9poux, o\u00f9 lui sortiraient nature d\u2019h\u00e9ritage, et son extension variait suivant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019\u00e9poux et des siens, par quoi on entendait les enfants, ou des siens et de ceux de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne, et alors elle comprenait les enfants ou descendants et les collat\u00e9raux. (Voy., pour l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ces expressions, Guyot, vo. Biens, tome 2, p. 348, 2e colonne; Pothier, Trait\u00e9 des Propres, n\u00b0 130, tome 8 de l\u2019\u00e9dition Bugnet.) Quand la clause de propre \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e au profit des siens et de ceux de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne, le R\u00e9pertoire de Guyot, l\u2019article est de Merlin, l\u2019appelait \u201cla r\u00e9alisation ou stipulation de propre au traisi\u00e8me degr\u00e9: vo. R\u00e9alisation, parag. III, tome 14, p. 462.\nDire que les biens donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux ou par lui retourneraient \u00e0 ceux de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne, c\u2019\u00e9tait, dans l\u2019ancien droit, stipuler que ces biens seraient propres de succession. On les appelait des propres fictifs pour les distinguer des propres r\u00e9els. Guyot, vo. R\u00e9alisation, tome 14, p. 467, 1\u00e8re colonne, au bas de la page, cite un arr\u00eat o\u00f9 il s\u2019agissait de la clause suivante d\u2019un contrat de mariage:\nque le survivant (des \u00e9poux) aurait l\u2019usufruit des biens-fonds du pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, et qu\u2019en cas de non enfants, les biens retourneraient au c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne dont ils seraient proc\u00e9d\u00e9s.\nPersonne ne s\u2019est avis\u00e9 de croire que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 une clause de propre.\nDu reste, l\u2019article 94 de la Coutume de Paris se servait de la m\u00eame expression \u201cretourner\u201d pour indiquer des propres de succession. Parlant des rentes constitu\u00e9es appartenant \u00e0 des mineurs, et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rachet\u00e9es pendant leur minorit\u00e9, cet article s\u2019exprimait ainsi:\nles deniers de rachat ou le remploi d\u2019iceux en autres rentes ou h\u00e9ritages sont cens\u00e9s de m\u00eame nature et qualit\u00e9 d\u2019immeubles qu\u2019\u00e9taient les rentes ainsi rachet\u00e9es pour retourner aux parents du c\u00f4te et ligne dont les rentes \u00e9taient proc\u00e9d\u00e9es.\nEt Pothier, ouvrage cit\u00e9, n\u00b0 119, commentant ces mots \u201cpour retourner, etc.\u201d, disait:\nElle (la coutume) fait assez connaitre par ces termes que ce qu\u2019elle s\u2019est propos\u00e9 par cette disposition, est que le bien d\u2019une ligne du mineur ne passe point \u00e0 une autre ligne, et que le bien de chaque famille lui soit conserv\u00e9.\nC\u2019\u00e9tait bien l\u00e0, dans l\u2019ancien droit, l\u2019effet de la d\u00e9volution, par voie de succession ab intestat, de biens qui \u00e9taient propres de succession. Ils retournaient aux successibles du c\u00f4t\u00e9 dont ils \u00e9taient proc\u00e9d\u00e9s par application de la r\u00e8gle paterna paternis, materna maternis. Dans le contrat de mariage qui nous occupe, les parties n\u2019ont pu envisager que la cr\u00e9ation de propres de succession, car elles excluaient la communaut\u00e9 de biens entre elles.\nJe suis donc d\u2019opinion que la clause dont il s\u2019agit ici est une stipulation de propre. Une telle stipulation au profit des h\u00e9ritiers du c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne de l\u2019un des \u00e9poux ne constituait pas une substitution en faveur de ceux-ci (Thevenot d\u2019Essaule, \u00e9d. Mathieu, n\u00b0 239, p. 89). Et nous avons vu que ce n\u2019est pas un droit de retour dans le sens envisag\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 779, C.C.\nJ\u2019ai \u00e0 peine besoin de dire que ces stipulations de propre avaient une port\u00e9e consid\u00e9rable dans l\u2019ancien droit, mais seulement, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, dans les sue-cessions ab intestat. On pouvait ali\u00e9ner les biens stipul\u00e9s propres, ou en disposer par testament, m\u00eame en faveur d\u2019un parent d\u2019une autre ligne, car la clause \u00e9tait de droit tr\u00e8s \u00e9troit (Pothier, ouvrage cit\u00e9, n\u00b0 133; voyez sp\u00e9cialement ce qu\u2019il dit au bas de la page 575).\nL\u2019importance de la clause de propre quant aux successions ab intestat provenait du fait que l\u2019ancien droit, dans ces successions, consid\u00e9rait la nature d\u2019un bien pour en r\u00e9gler la succession, par application de la r\u00e8gle paterna paternis, materna maternis. Ainsi, comme deux des successions ab intestat dont il s\u2019agit en cette cause se sont ouvertes avant le code civil, celle de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort lui-m\u00eame et celle du plus jeune de ses fils, Pierre-Etienne, on peut dire qu\u2019on aurait tenu compte de cette clause de propre pour r\u00e9gler la d\u00e9volution des biens qui en d\u00e9pendaient. Mais il faut observer qu\u2019au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Rapha\u00ebl Dufort, ses deux fils, qui \u00e9taient ses plus proches h\u00e9ritiers, et qui \u00e9taient de sa ligne, ont exclu l\u2019appelant et tous les collat\u00e9raux de la ligne paternelle (Guyot, verbis Paterna Paternis, parag. III, premi\u00e8re classe, questions 3 et 4, pp. 633 et suiv. du tome 12). La d\u00e9volution s\u2019est op\u00e9r\u00e9e instantan\u00e9ment suivant la r\u00e8gle: \u201cle mort saisit le vif son hoir plus proche et habile \u00e0 succ\u00e9der\u201d (art. 318 de la Coutume de Paris.)\nDe m\u00eame, quand Pierre-Etienne Dufort est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1864, sa succession ab intestat s\u2019est ouverte sous l\u2019ancien droit, et on peut conclure que les propres dont il s\u2019agit sont d\u00e9volus \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, Denis-Rapha\u00ebl, qui \u00e9tait un successible de la ligne paternelle, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de rappelant et de tous les collat\u00e9raux de cette ligne. (Voy. les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent).\nVient ensuite le code civil qui a radicalement modifi\u00e9 l\u2019ancienne loi des successions. La vieille distinction des propres et des acquets est abolie en mati\u00e8re de succession ab intestat, et nous trouvons, au Titre des Successions, l\u2019importante disposition suivante qui est de droit nouveau, et je pourrais probablement dire d\u2019ordre public:\n599. La loi ne consid\u00e8re ni l\u2019origine, ni la nature des biens pour en r\u00e9gler la succession. Tous ensemble ils ne forment qu\u2019une seule et unique h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 qui se transmet et se partage d\u2019apr\u00e8s les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles, ou suivant qu\u2019en a ordonn\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire.\nLes mots \u201cou suivant qu\u2019en a ordonn\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire\u201d se r\u00e9f\u00e8rent \u00e9videmment \u00e0 une disposition testamentaire. On ne peut consid\u00e9rer comme une telle disposition, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une institution contractuelle, la partie finale de la clause du contrat de mariage, car jamais, dans l\u2019ancien droit, on n\u2019a regard\u00e9 les mots\npour retourner les dits biens aux h\u00e9ritiers des futurs \u00e9poux du c\u00f4t\u00e9 estoc et ligne d\u2019o\u00f9 ils.\ncomme \u00e9tant une disposition ou une substitution en faveur de ces h\u00e9ritiers (Voy. les autorit\u00e9es cit\u00e9es plus haut, et sp\u00e9cialement Thevenot d\u2019Essaule).\nJe puis ajouter que si, dans l\u2019ancien droit, le conjoint survivant ne succ\u00e9dait pas \u00e0 ses enfants morts en minorit\u00e9 quant aux biens stipul\u00e9s propres fictifs pour le conjoint pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et ceux de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 et ligne, c\u2019est qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de la ligne oppos\u00e9e. La fiction, \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, produisait tout son effet.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de se demander pourquoi depuis le code civil on trouve dans les contrats de mariage des clauses comme celle qui nous occupe. Cela s\u2019explique par l\u2019habitude des notaires de se servir de vieilles formules, bien que leur utilit\u00e9 pratique ait pris fin. Du reste, nous interpr\u00e9tons ici un contrat ant\u00e9rieur au code.\nDonc, lorsque Denis Rapha\u00ebl Dufort est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en minorit\u00e9 le 28 d\u00e9cembre 1878, sa succession ab intestat s\u2019est transmise conform\u00e9ment aux nouvelles r\u00e8gles contenues dans le code. Partant, comme il ne laissait ni fr\u00e8res, ni s\u0153urs, ni neveux, ni ni\u00e8ces, sa succession, comprenant la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens en question, est d\u00e9volue pour le tout \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re, Mme Dufort (art. 626 et 631, C.C., \u00e9galement de droit nouveau, tels qu\u2019ils se lisaient avant l\u2019amendement de 1915, 5 Geo. V, c. 74).\nIl s\u2019ensuit que, devenue propri\u00e9taire de ces biens comme h\u00e9riti\u00e8re de son fils Denis-Rapha\u00ebl, Mme Dufort pouvait en disposer par son testament en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais eu la qualit\u00e9 d\u2019h\u00e9ritier dans aucune de ces successions.\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

(1906), c. 145, s. 4, subs. 5.\nThe appellant was charged with the murder of his mother. The trial judge, in instructing the jury, made the following remarks: \u201cThe doctor who made the autopsy has declared that the death must have occurred at seven o\u2019clock in the morning or even before. The accused was at that time in the house according to his own declaration to police officers. The accused was then alone with his mother when she was killed; and if so, the defence should have been able to explain by whom the murder has been committed, because such a brutal murder could not have been committed without the knowledge of the accused.\u201d\nHeld that, although (the language of the charge might be understood1 as relating to a failure of the accused to give an explanation to police officers or others, it is also easily and naturally capable of being under stood as relating to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the trial; and therefore such language is obnoxious to the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act which requires the trial judge to abstain from any comment upon the failure of an accused to take advantage of the privilege which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own behalf. The accused is entitled to a new trial.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, upholding the conviction of the appellant for murder.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. and J. E. B\u00e9dard K.C. for the appellant.\nArthur Fitzpatrick K.C. and V. Bienvenu K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014As a new trial is necessary, and since the crime with which the accused is charged is one of the greatest gravity, it is important to adhere rigorously to the practice of refraining from any comment on the circumstances of the case, beyond that which is strictly necessary in order to elucidate the point upon which the decision of the appeal turns.\nIt should be said at the outset that the jurisdiction of this court rests upon the dissent of Mr. Justice Allard, and in particular upon his view, in which he was not in agreement with his colleagues, that the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had failed to observe the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act, which, in effect, requires the trial judge to abstain from any comment upon the failure of the accused to take advantage of the privilege which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own behalf.\nThe learned trial judge said:\nLe docteur Marois a fait l\u2019autopsie \u00e0 trois heures et quart, et si vous croyez son t\u00e9moignage (c\u2019est un homme dont le t\u00e9moignage a du poids), il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la mort avait d\u00fb arriver \u00e0 sept heures, ou \u00e0 six heures et m\u00eame avant, du matin.\nVoil\u00e0 les circonstances qui enveloppent la mort de la d\u00e9funte.\nSi la mort, mes amis, remonte \u00e0 six heures ou \u00e0 sept heures du matin, o\u00f9 \u00e9tait l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, vers sept heures ou six heures du matin, m\u00eame plus \u00e0 bonne heure? A la maison. A la maison. Car, d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa propre d\u00e9claration, il n\u2019est sorti qu\u2019\u00e0 huit heures du matin.\nIl \u00e9tait donc seul avec sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 la maison quand la mort est arriv\u00e9e et si l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait seul avec sa m\u00e8re quand elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9e et \u00e9gorg\u00e9e, la d\u00e9fense aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre capable d\u2019expliquer par qui ce meurtre a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Car une pareille boucherie n\u2019a pas d\u00fb se faire, sans que l\u2019accus\u00e9 en eut connaissance.\nIt seems to be reasonably clear that, according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure of la d\u00e9fense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely, that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145. The law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher[1], in these words:\n* * * it is not what the judge intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.\nThere must be a new trial.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] (1922) 37 Can. Cr. C. 83.\n"

F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nM. H. Ludwig K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The several rights and liabilities arising out of two transactions which took place in Vancouver (of the 17th of August, 1923), are in question.\nBy that on which the counter-claim is founded, Harris purchased from Sullivan Dominion bearer bonds of the par value of $17,000, for which Harris gave his cheque on the Vancouver branch of the Home Bank. Of these bonds, Harris deposited in that branch bonds of the par value of $6,000, which sum was placed to his credit. Against this credit, he drew a cheque for a sum slightly in excess of it, had it certified by the bank, and negotiated it. Shortly after Harris received the bank's certification, the Vancouver branch suspended payment, and, Sullivan's bank refusing for this reason to accept cheques on the Home Bank, Sullivan demanded from the Home Bank the return of the bonds he had sold to Harris, and, by his counter-claim, seeks to enforce the demand so advanced.\nBy the other transaction, Sullivan purchased from Harris Dominion bonds of the par value of $10,000, for which he gave to Harris his cheque on the Standard Bank of Canada for $10,657.70, which cheque Harris deposited to the credit of the account of Harris & Co. in the Home Bank, and, through this deposit and others made on the same day, Harris & Co's. account was put in credit to the amount of $31,496.57; and on the same morning, before the suspension, Harris' cheques were, on the strength of this credit, accepted by the Home Bank and paid, to the amount of $32,000 odd. Sullivan, on learning of the suspension, stopped payment of his cheque, and the bank, by this action, seeks to enforce payment of it.\nThe head office of the bank in Toronto had suspended payment some hours before the suspension in Vancouver; and it was contended, in support of the appeal, that by reason of this fact the bank became incapacitated from acquiring a title to the Victory bonds in question or to the cheque sued upon.\nAs to the first mentioned transaction, the bearer Victory bonds were negotiable instruments which the bank acquired for value, and without notice of any defect in Harris' title. It is plain that the bank is entitled to keep the bonds unless there was such a total incapacity to acquire title to them as to make the delivery of them an absolute nullity. As to the last mentioned transaction, Sullivan retains the consideration for which the cheque was given. There again, unless the bank was totally disabled from acquiring a title, the appellant obviously fails.\nAccordingly, the appellant rested his appeal upon the proposition that, by force of the suspension, which went into effect in Toronto before these transactions took place, but without the knowledge of the Vancouver officials (who learned of it after they had taken place), the bank was by law struck with such incapacity.\nIt seems sufficient to say that there is no warrant for such a proposition in the statutory provisions upon which the appellant relies. The Bank Act (s. 117), provides for the appointment of a curator \"forthwith\" when the bank suspends payment. The curator is then to have supervision over the affairs of the bank, until the bank resumes business or a liquidator is appointed. There is no suggestion in this section that the corporate capacity of the bank to acquire property or to carry on business ceases to exist. It still exists, but is, subject to the provisions of the Act, to be exercised under the supervision of the curator, whose immediate appointment the section contemplates. As to the situation during the period intervening between the suspension and his appointment, the only pertinent provision appears to be that contained in s. 146, which makes it an offence for any officer of the bank to pay any debt of the bank with knowledge of suspension without assent by the curator or liquidator; a provision which implies no declaration of the bank's incapacity to acquire property when that takes place in the ordinary course of business and through the agency of officers having no knowledge of a suspension.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Having perused and considered the judgment of my brother Duff J. herein in regard to the appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, I agree with the reasoning therein and the conclusion reached that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacInnes & Arnold.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Reid, Wallbridge, Gibson & Co.\n[1] [1926] 3 W.W.R. 305.\n"

Anglin C.J.C.\u2014This is an application for special leave to appeal under s. 74 (3) of The Bankruptcy Act from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick delivered by Grimmer J., reversing the judgment of Barry C.J.K.B., sitting as a judge in bankruptcy. Barry C.J.K.B. had held the insolvent to be a \u201ctrader\u201d within the meaning of s. 47, added to the C.S.N.B., 1903, c. 153, Respecting Landlords and Tenants, by c. 30 of the New Brunswick Statutes of 1924. He accordingly restricted the landlord\u2019s priority over general creditors to three months\u2019 rent. The appellate court, being of the opinion that the insolvent was not a \u201ctrader\u201d within the meaning of the New Brunswick statute, held that the landlord was entitled to priority for his entire claim for rent amounting to upwards of $3,000, but, inasmuch as the estate of the bankrupt was inadequate to meet that claim, directed that the trustee should pay over to the landlord all the moneys in his hands received from the sale of the estate less the sheriff\u2019s costs of a seizure under execution, amounting to $243.31, the balance payable to the landlord being $2,256.69, \u201cwithout deducting therefrom any costs or charges of the sale or otherwise\u201d; and no costs of the appeal were allowed.\nThe questions as to whether an hotel-keeper is a \u201ctrader\u201d and as to the extent of the landlord\u2019s rights in New Brunswick under an assignment in bankruptcy seem to me to be of sufficient general importance and open to sufficient doubt in view of the conflicting judgments below, to warrant the granting of special leave to appeal.\nSuch leave will accordingly be granted; and the costs of this application will be costs in the appeal.\nApplication granted.\nSolicitors for the applicant: Porter & Ritchie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Edward P.

(R.S.M. 1913, cc. 178, 133, 134).\nPlaintiff sued to set aside a tax sale of its land by defendant municipality (in Manitoba), claiming that it was illegal because made for default in payment of notes given to the municipality by the plaintiff\u2019s tenant for moneys advanced to the tenant for seed grain, and for the cost of a well bored for the tenant, on the land. The advances for seed grain and the cost of the well amounted to $530. The land was worth over $2,000. Plaintiff\u2019s action was begun after one year from the day of the sale. The action was dismissed by Mathers C.J.K.B. (35 Man. R. 331) whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (35 Man. R. 551). Plaintiff (whose application for leave to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal) appealed de plano to the Supreme Court of Canada, and defendants moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nHeld, that the motion to quash the appeal should be refused; whether plaintiff still retained its right to redeem, and whether, through the effect of the \u201ccurative\u201d section of the Assessment Act (Man.) it was precluded from obtaining the relief sought, were questions to be considered and were properly matters in controversy; the application to the case of the relevant sections of the Municipal Act and the Assessment Act was a point in dispute; it was therefore apparent that, as a result of the litigation, when all questions raised on both sides had been considered and according as the respective contentions were held well or ill founded, plaintiff\u2019s title might be affirmed or denied to lands the value of which exceeded the amount required to found jurisdiction for appeal.\nIdington J. held that the right of appeal depended on whether or not the right of redemption still existed, and as this was not settled on the facts before the court the motion should be enlarged to be disposed of on the argument of the appeal.\nMOTION by the respondents to quash, for want of jurisdiction, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] affirming the judgment of Mathers C.J.K.B.[2] dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action to set aside a tax sale by defendant municipality of certain lands. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The motion was dismissed with costs.\nD. H. Laird K.C. for the motion.\nE. F. Newcombe contra.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim alleges that, in May, 1919, it was the legal owner of certain lands and entered into an agreement of sale of these lands to certain parties named Edward McGee and Fred McGee, who took possession; that Fred McGee subsequently executed a quit-claim to the plaintiff of his interest, and that Edward McGee continued to occupy as tenant of the plaintiff; that the defendant municipality, without the consent of the plaintiff, advanced seed grain to the said Edward McGee and, at his request, bored a well upon the lands in question, for all of which it took from him promissory notes in settlement; that the defendant municipality never gave notice to the plaintiff of the advances but, on default of payment of the notes, made a claim upon the plaintiff for the amount thereof, for which the lands were sold at a tax sale to the defendant Joyal.\nThe plaintiff claimed that this sale was illegal and asked that it be declared null and void and set aside. The action was dismissed2. This was affirmed in appeal[3]. The plaintiff applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The application was refused. The plaintiff thereupon proceeded to appeal de plano, and security was allowed by a judge of the Court of Appeal, who however said that his order \u201cshall not be construed as giving leave to appeal\u201d or \u201caffecting in any way the question of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201d\nThe respondents now move to quash on the ground that the case is not appealable.\nThey argue that the only question involved in the case is whether\nthe amount required to redeem is some $530 less than the amount certified as arrears of taxes to the District Registrar who is now dealing with the application of Joyal for a certificate of title.\nThis sum of $530 represents the advances for the seed grain and the well repudiated by the plaintiff.\nWe do not think the litigation is so limited.\nThe tax sale took place on the 27th October, 1922. The action was begun on the 3rd January, 1924, or after the expiration of one year from the day of the sale.\nThe lands in question are proven to be worth well over $2,000.\nPlaintiff asserts its ownership of these lands and claims to have been illegally divested of its title by the alleged illegal proceedings of the municipality.\nJoyal, the tax purchaser, resists the plaintiff\u2019s claim and submits his rights to the court.\nAs a consequence, it may be that the plaintiff still retains the right to redeem; or it may be that, through the effect of the so-called curative section of the Assessment Act, plaintiff is now precluded from obtaining the relief sought by it; but these are questions which will have to be considered and they are properly matters in controversy. The application to the case at bar of the relevant sections of the Municipal Act and the Assessment Act is one of the points in dispute.\nFor the present, therefore, it is apparent that, as a result of this litigation, when all questions raised on both sides have been considered and according as the respective contentions are held well or ill founded, plaintiff\u2019s title may be affirmed or denied to lands the value of which clearly exceeds the amount required to found jurisdiction for appeal to this court.\nWe think, for these reasons, that the motion fails and should be dismissed with costs. Idington J.\u2014Assuming the lands have been sold and the possibility of redemption thereof by payment of the tax has passed, I agree with my brother Rinfret J. in the conclusion he has reached that the title of the land is in question and, therefore, as that seems to be worth over two thousand dollars, that there would be no doubt of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal. If, however, the time for redemption has not elapsed and it is still possible for the appellant to redeem the land for $800 or $900, or any sum less than $2,000, I can see no right to appeal here. In such a case the title to land is not necessarily involved, it is the damage done by casting a cloud upon the title and this does not, in itself, I think, give jurisdiction to come here.\nAs the evidence, in my view, does not conclusively establish either of the alternatives I have put, I would prefer the motion to be enlarged to be disposed of on the argument of the appeal.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Eric Browne-Wilkinson.\nSolicitors for the respondent The Rural Municipality of Richot: Munson, Allan, Laird, Davis, Haffner & Hobkirk.\nSolicitor for the respondent Joseph Joyal: C. M. Boswell.\n[1] 35 Man. R. 551; [1926] 2 W.W.R. 51.\n[2] 35 Man. R. 331; [1925] 3 W.W.R. 695.\n2 35 Man. R. 331; [1925] 3 W.W.R. 695.\n[3] 35 Man. R. 551; [1926] 2 W.W.R. 51.\n"

A. Barnard K.C. and W. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nA. R. McMaster K.C. and L. J. B\u00e9\u00efque K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, province of Quebec, modifying, by reducing the amount awarded, a judgment of the Superior Court which had granted the present appellant $35,000, under the contract to which I will presently refer. At the same time, the Superior Court rejected a claim of the appellant for $25,000, as damages for loss of profit, and as to this claim its judgment was upheld. The appellant now appeals to this court on both points.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows.\nIn 1920, the respondent had a ship under construction at Three Rivers by the Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited. This company went into liquidation before the work was finished, and the respondent then entered into an agreement with the appellant to complete the construction of the ship. This agreement, signed by the respondent in December, 1920, and by the appellant in March, 1921, contained the following covenants:\u2014\nWhereas the company (the respondent) are the owners of a ship commonly known as an oil tanker of approximately 6,500 tons deadweight now partially constructed in the yard of the Three Rivers Shipyards Company, Three Rivers, Quebec, and through their representative have mutually agreed with the shipbuilders (the appellant) to complete this vessel ers, engines and machinery. The trial of both actions, which had been consolidated, took place at Three Rivers. We were informed by the parties that at the argument on the first action, the one asking for cancellation, the appellant admitted that under art. 1691 of the civil code the respondent was entitled to cancel the agreement, and this point of view was accepted by the learned trial judge who pronounced the agreement duly cancelled. The appellant states that it acquiesced in the judgment in this action and paid the costs. In the second action, the learned trial judge awarded the appellant the $35,000, but rejected the claim for $25,000 for want of proper proof. Both parties appealed from this judgment to the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The latter court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court in so far as the claim for $25,000 was concerned, but modified it in regard to the item of $35,000, Which it reduced to $12,000, the respondent in its factum having expressed its willingness to pay the latter sum. The appellant now comes before this court asking that the judgment of the Superior Court be restored as to the award of $35,000, but reversed in respect of the other item of its demand.\nThe only judgment before us is that rendered in the appellant\u2019s action claiming $35,000, under clause 8 of the agreement and $25,000 damages for loss of profit under clause 7.\nThe appellant in its factum as well as in its argument before us, endeavoured to take the position that art. 1691 C.C. did not apply to the agreement in question, or, if it . did, it was only with respect to the installing of the boilers, engines and machinery. Had the appellant taken that position before the trial court, it is likely that the learned trial judge would have made a finding on the question whether the appellant had fulfilled its contractual obligations, and whether the respondent had valid cause for cancelling the contract. The admission of the appellant that the case came within the scope of art. 1691 C.C., while to some extent an admission of law rather than of fact, no doubt influenced the course of the trial and the judgment. I am not disposed therefore to deal with the litigation on any other basis. Much of the evidence adduced at the trial is irrelevant on an issue governed by art. 1691 C.C. The respondent, on the other hand, led considerable evidence to show that the contract had become impossible of performance for the reasons alleged in its protest, i.e., that the ship, for lack of sufficient depth in the channel of the St. Maurice, could not be brought to the appellant\u2019s shipyards for installation of the boilers, engines and machinery, or removed therefrom after the work was done. The testimony on this point is contradictory, and I am not satisfied that the respondent, which had the onus of establishing it, has shewn beyond doubt that performance of the contract had become impossible within the meaning of art. 1202 C.C. Moreover, the most that could be said is that, if the performance of the contract became impossible, it was through no fault of the appellant, Which clearly could not be expected to dredge the bed of a navigable stream, and therefore the respondent would be bound to the extent of the benefit received by it. I prefer therefore to rest nothing on the alleged impossibility of performance, but I will view the case as being one calling for the application of art. 1691 CC\nThis article gives the owner the right to cancel at his own will a contract for the construction of a building or other works at a fixed price, although the work has been begun,\non indemnifying the workman for all his actual expenses and labour, and paying damages according to the circumstances of the case.\nThe obligation to indemnify the workman for all his actual expenses and labour, to wit, to pay him for the work done, is absolute. Liability for damages depends on the circumstances of each particular case. The workman is certainly entitled to payment for the work actually done and money expended by him, and the circumstances of the case may also, as a matter of justice, give him the right to claim damages.\nIt would be quite impossible, in my opinion, to say that the workman can demand, as damages, payment in full as if the work had been entirely performed, for the owner may have cancelled the contract because such payment would be beyond his means. Article 1794 of the Code Napol\u00e9on allows the owner to cancel the contract\nen d\u00e9dommageant l\u2019entrepreneur de toutes ses d\u00e9penses, de tous ses travaux et de tout ce qu\u2019il aurait pu gagner dans cette entreprise; it does not mention other damages. The codifiers in their report make no special mention of art. 1691 C.C., being content to say that\nthe articles numbered from 78 to 84 (art. 1691 to 1697 C.C., while they express the existing law, coincide substantially with the articles of the Code Napol\u00e9on cited under them.\nThe coincidence, in so far as art. 1691 C.C. is concerned, is certainly not very marked, and, in my opinion, while the French code has laid down a definite rule as to the basis of assessment of damages, our code has done so only in regard to \u201cactual expenses and labour.\u201d\nPothier, Louage, no. 440, Bugnet ed., vol. 4, pp. 147, 148,\nto whom the codifiers refer under art. 1691 CC, says:\nPar exemple, si j\u2019ai fait march\u00e9 avec un entrepreneur pour la construction d\u2019un b\u00e2timent, et que, depuis le march\u00e9 conclu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre nous, je lui d\u00e9clare que je ne veux plus b\u00e2tir, et que je demande en cons\u00e9quence la r\u00e9solution du march\u00e9, l\u2019entrepreneur ne peut pas s\u2019opposer absolument \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du march\u00e9, et pr\u00e9tendre que je doive lui payer le prix entier du march\u00e9, aux offres qu\u2019il fait de remplir son obligation, et de construire le b\u00e2timent port\u00e9 au devis; car il a pu me survenir, depuis la conclusion de notre march\u00e9, de bonnes raisons pour ne pas b\u00e2tir, dont je ne suis pas oblig\u00e9 de rendre compte; il a pu me survenir des pertes dans mes biens, qui me mettent hors d\u2019\u00e9tat de faire la d\u00e9pense que je m\u2019\u00e9tais propos\u00e9e. Mais si je dois \u00eatre re\u00e7u \u00e0 demander la r\u00e9solution du march\u00e9, ce ne peut \u00eatre qu\u2019\u00e0 la charge de d\u00e9dommager l\u2019entrepreneur, s\u2019il souffre quelque dommage de son inex\u00e9cution; puta, si avant que je lui eusse d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mon changement de volont\u00e9, il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait emplette de quelques mat\u00e9riaux qu\u2019il sera oblig\u00e9 de revendre \u00e0 perte; s\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 lou\u00e9 des ouvriers qui lui deviennent inutiles. On doit aussi comprendre, dans les dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats de l\u2019entrepreneur, le profit qu\u2019il aurait pu faire sur d\u2019autres march\u00e9s que celui dont on demande la r\u00e9solution lui a fait refuser.\nPothier\u2019s reference to claims which may be considered under the head of damages, is clearly only by way of examples. Our code, as I have said, is definite merely with regard to \u201cactual expenses and labour,\u201d but I think it may be stated that Pothier\u2019s refusal to allow the contractor to claim\nle prix entier du march\u00e9 aux offres qu\u2019il fait de remplir de sa part son obligation\nholds good under the true construction of art. 1691 C.C.\nComing now to the appellant\u2019s claim of $35,000 under clause 8 of the agreement, it is therein expressly stated that this sum is to be paid to it\nas their recompense for superintending the construction and completion of the vessel. This supposes that the appellant has exercised this superintendence until full completion of the vessel, which of course would include the installation of the engines, boilers and machinery \u201cwhich are to be furnished by the company (the respondent),\u201d and that it supplied and installed\nthe necessary piping and valves to connect to the hull piping, sea-suctions and discharges.\nIn other words, this \u201crecompense,\u201d with the special price I stipulated for installation of engines, boilers and machinery and the supplying and installation of the necessary piping and valves, may be assimilated to what Pothier calls \u201cle prix entier du march\u00e9.\u201d In my opinion, only the part of this \u201crecompense\u201d which corresponds to the actual \u201csuperintendence\u201d can be allowed either as damages or as \u201cactual expenses or labour,\u201d and I think it comes better under the heading of \u201cdamages,\u201d for, under reserve of the question of the \u201csea chest\u201d to which I will presently refer, it is not contended that all actual expenses and sums spent for labour or materials were not paid by the respondent.\nI do not think the judgment of the Superior Court can be restored, for it awarded to the appellant the whole of the sum payable for superintending the construction until full completion of the vessel. There is however room for a difference of opinion whether an allowance of approximately one-third of the $35,000 is sufficient compensation for damages suffered by the appellant by reason of the cancellation of the contract under art. 1691 C.C. The question, however, whether any damages at all should be granted, and, if so, what should be their amount, are questions to be determined by the court under this article. The Court of King\u2019s Bench came to the conclusion that the appellant was entitled to damages, and granted it the sum of $12,000, and this court does not interfere with the quantum of such damages unless a wrong principle has been followed by the court in assessing them. This has not been shewn. I therefore do not feel justified in increasing the award with respect to these damages.\nI may add that I do not find the proof satisfactory as to the portion of the \u201crecompense\u201d which can be said to correspond to the superintendence actually exercised. The appellant\u2019s witnesses say that the expenditure up to the launching amounted to $350,000, and that ten per cent of this would be a fair compensation. This is not the proper test when dealing with an express contract stating for what superintendence the $35,000 is to be paid.\nBoth courts, including Mr. Justice Tellier who dissented, were of the opinion that the appellant had not sufficiently proved its claim for $25,000 for loss of the profit it would have made in installing the boilers, engines and machinery under clause 7 of the contract. In that I agree, but as to such a claim, it would suffice to say that the profit which the workman would have made, had the contract gone on to completion, is not, under art. 1691 C.C., the proper basis for the assessment of his damages. That, I have already stated, is clearly the effect of the article.\nThe appellant also claims that it is entitled to $2,896.70, which it expended in building a \u201csea chest\u201d in connection with the carrying out of clause 7 of the contract. The \u201csea chest\u201d was delivered to the respondent but was never paid for.\nThis the respondent does not deny, but its objection is that this amount was not specifically claimed in the action. The appellant admitted that in the argument before the Superior Court these expenses were overlooked. It seems to me that as this \u201csea chest\u201d was really made and delivered to the respondent, it would be only fair to add the amount of the expenditure to the $12,000 granted by the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nWith this variation, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. A. Barnard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: B\u00e9\u00efque & Bissonnette.\n"

Plaintiffs claimed at the rate of $16 per h.p. Defendant paid at the rate of $12. Plaintiffs sued for $8,190.78, as the balance due, at the $16 rate, having obtained, on 30th January,1922, the Attorney General\u2019s consent, pursuant to s.16 of The Power Commission Act (R.S.O.,1914, c. 39), to bring an action \u201cto recover the sum of $8,190.78, being the balance alleged to be due * * * for electric power supplied * * *.\u201d Before trial counsel agreed to refer the matters in question to an arbitrator, the plaintiffs not to be prejudiced \u201cby any claim made by them in the writ of summons or pleadings in this action.\u201d The arbitrator awarded plaintiffs $51,861.75, taking into consideration an alleged element of compulsion, and basing his award on his estimate of cost to plaintiffs plus reasonable profit. Defendant moved to set aside the award, and plaintiffs sued on the award, having obtained the Attorney General\u2019s consent, dated 20th April, 1923, to bring an action \u201cto recover the sum alleged to be due * * * for electric power supplied. * * * This consent is to be deemed to have been given as of the 30th day of January, 1922.\u201d\nHeld, having regard to s.16 of The Power Commission Act and the terms of the Attorney General\u2019s consent to the first action, defendant\u2019s counsel had not authority to compromise by imposing on defendant, directly or indirectly, any liability greater than $8,190.78, or any liability to be determined otherwise than by ascertaining what a fair price would be on the basis (as contemplated by the consent and presented in the pleadings) of a legal right arising from the supply and acceptance of power under a voluntary agreement; and the award could not be supported as authorized by a reference to which counsel was empowered to consent; the Attorney General\u2019s consent to the second action did not enlarge retrospectively the scope of the first action and counsel\u2019s authority therein.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (57 Ont. L.R. 603) and of Wright J. (56 Ont. L.R. 35) affirmed in the result.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming in the result the judgment of Wright J.[2] allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside an arbitrator\u2019s award, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action upon the award.\nThe proceedings taken by the defendant by way of motion to set aside the award and by the plaintiffs by way of action to enforce the award were, by order of the Appellate Division, consolidated.\nIn 1915 Mahlon Ford Beach, deceased, the owner of a power plant, had a contract with the Rapids Power Co., Ltd., for the supply by Beach of electric power for one year, which expired on 31st March, 1916. The Rapids Power Co., Ltd., transferred its rights under this contract to the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario, the defendant. At the expiration of the contract, negotiations were entered into for continuing the supply of power, but these negotiations failed to result in an agreement. It would appear that Beach desired a ten year contract at $16 per h.p., but the defendant was unwilling to pay more than $12. Without any definite agreement Beach, and after his death his executors, the plaintiffs, continued to supply power to 1st May, 1919. The defendant was from time to time billed at $16 per h.p., but paid only at the rate of $12 without admitting further liability, nor, on the other hand, was there any admission of the sufficiency of the payments. Negotiations to settle the price failed, and the plaintiffs determined to enforce the claim by action. Faced with the provisions of The Power Commission Act, R.S.O., 1914, c. 39, s. 16, which reads\nWithout the consent of the Attorney General no action shall be brought against the Commission or against any member thereof for anything done or omitted in the exercise of his office.\nthey applied to the Attorney General for his consent, and a written consent, dated 30th January, 1922, was given, headed \u201cIn the Supreme Court of Ontario\u2014In the matter of a proposed action\u201d between the plaintiffs and the defendant, and reading as follows:\nPursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, chapter 39, section 16, I hereby consent to Mahlon Wickway Beach, Benson Clothier Beach and Charles Asa Beach, executors of the estate of M.F. Beach of * * * bringing an action against the Hydro Electric Power Commission to recover the sum of $8,190.78, being the balance alleged to be due said estate for electric power supplied by said estate to The Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario.\nThereupon the plaintiffs issued a writ against the Commission claiming a balance due of $8,190.78, calculated at the rate of $16 per h.p. (It would appear that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel intended to move to amend by claiming a larger sum).\nBefore the trial of the action, an agreement was made between counsel for plaintiffs and defendant as follows:\nThe parties hereto agree to settle and compromise this action upon the following terms and conditions.\n1. The parties have agreed that the matters in question in this action shall be referred to J.M. Robertson of the city of Montreal, engineer, to determine what reasonable and just price shall be paid to the plaintiffs for the power furnished by them to the defendants from April 1, 1916, to May 1, 1919, and to fix the amount due the plaintiffs by the defendants after deducting the sum already paid the plaintiffs by the defendants.\n2. It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that in determination of these matters the plaintiffs shall not be prejudiced by any claim made by them in the writ of summons or pleadings in this action.\n* * *\n4. It is understood between the parties that the provisions of the Ontario Arbitration Act, R.S.O., 1914, chapter 65, do not apply herein and the said arbitrator herein may proceed informally and if he so desires is not required to take evidence under oath. 5. The decision of the said arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties.\nAn arbitration was accordingly had, and an award was made, dated February 15, 1923, for the payment by defendant to plaintiffs of $42,249.70 and interest, making in all $51,861.75. The arbitrator took into consideration an alleged element of compulsion in the supply of power, and held that the basis of Beach\u2019s remuneration should be the cost to him plus a reasonable profit, and based his award accordingly, taking into account what he considered to be the various elements, and the amounts in regard thereto, that should be included in estimating the cost of the supply of power.\nThe defendant disputed the validity of the award and moved to set it aside, and the plaintiffs, having procured a consent of the Attorney General, brought this action to recover the amount of the award. The Attorney General\u2019s consent just mentioned was dated 20th April, 1923, it was headed \u201cIn the Supreme Court of Ontario\u2014In the matter of a proposed action\u201d between the plaintiffs and the defendant, and read as follows:\nPursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1914, chapter 39, section 16, I hereby consent to Mahlon Wickway Beach, Benson Clothier Beach and Charles Asa Beach, executors of the estate of M.F. Beach, of * * * bringing an action against the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario to recover the sum alleged to foe due said estate for electric power supplied by said estate to the Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario.\nThis consent is to be deemed to have been given as of the 30th day of January, 1922.\nBoth the motion to set aside the award and the action upon it came on before Wright J., who allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action, on the ground that the arbitrator erred both in fact and in law, and that such error appeared upon the face of the award[3]. An appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division[4] on the grounds that the consent given by the Attorney General dated 30th January, 1922, would not justify an action for a larger sum than that therein mentioned; that there was no power to settle the action by agreeing to a proceeding which might in the result compel the payment of a much larger sum; that the reference to arbitration was ultra vires and the award a nullity ab initio; that this nullity was not given life by the terms of the Attorney General\u2019s consent of 20th April, 1923; that, even were the submission to arbitration valid and the arbitrator allowed by law to make a valid award, the award could not stand, for, without deciding whether or not the arbitrator based his award upon a mistake of fact, it was obvious that he \u201capproached the consideration of the questions to be decided from a wrong angle * * *.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nG.F. Henderson K.C., J.M. Godfrey K.C. and L.W. Mulloy for the appellants.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and Sir W.H. Hearst K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal seems to fail upon a ground which can be stated at no great length.\nThe authority of counsel for the Commission to compromise the first action cannot be ascertained without reference to s. 16 of The Power Commission Act and the terms of the consent given under that enactment. By the enactment, the consent of the Attorney General was a necessary condition of the right to bring the action. The consent given was strictly limited, first, as to amount; and secondly, as to the character of the claim. The claim contemplated was a claim of a sum \u201calleged to be due said estate for electric power supplied by said estate\u201d to the Commission, and it was a claim for the sum of $8,190.78.\nObviously, the claim authorized to be put in suit was one based upon a legal right arising from the supply and acceptance of power. As presented in the pleadings, the actual claim was for the sum mentioned, and it was based upon an alleged agreement to pay $16 per h.p. for power supplied; the defendants denying that there was any express agreement as to the price, and alleging that a fair price was $12 per h.p. Admittedly, the issue on the plead- ings was what price (limited by the maximum of $16) was a fair price to pay for power supplied under an agreement between the parties, the price for which was not fixed. It seems too clear for argument that in these circumstances counsel for the Commission (regard being had to s.16 of The Power Commission Act and to the terms of the Attorney General\u2019s consent) was not endowed with authority to compromise by imposing oh the Commission, directly or indirectly, any liability greater than the sum named, or any liability to be determined otherwise than by ascertaining what a fair price would be on the footing mentioned. He could have no authority, for example, to consent to the determination of that liability on the footing that the purchase was a compulsory purchase, or to the enhancement of the liability by reference to some circumstance of coercion or intimidation supposed to have the effect of bringing into play rules and principles inapplicable in the case of a sale by voluntary agreement.\nYet this is precisely what is done by the award, which proceeds professedly upon the reference to arbitration to which counsel agreed by way of compromise of the action. The award, therefore, cannot be supported as authorized by a reference to which counsel was empowered to consent.\nNor does there appear to be any basis for a finding of ratification. The subsequent consent of the Attorney General (of April 20, 1923) has been invoked as a consent to the present action, and necessarily so; otherwise the action must have failed for want of compliance with s. 16. It cannot at the same time serve to enlarge retrospectively the scope of the earlier action and the authority of counsel engaged in that action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Godfrey, Lawson & Corcoran.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hearst & Hearst.\n[1] (1925) 57 Ont.

In determining the amount to be (paid for such license the Exchequer Court properly took into consideration the cost of manufacture and repair of the machine, as well as the unexpired term of the life of the patent.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada had jurisdiction to hear the appeal; s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act does not apply to a proceeding brought under s. 40 of The Patent Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Audette J.)[1] allowing an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents.\nThe respondents, by a petition to the Commissioner of Patents, asked for the issue of a compulsory license, under s. 40 of The Patent Act, 13-14 Geo. V, c. 23, in respect of the patent owned by appellant for alleged new and useful improvements in \u201cautomatic pastry making machines\u201d, and that the Commissioner definitely determine the amount of the license fee. The Commissioner dismissed the petition, holding that it did not appear that the terms on which the license was offered to the petitioner were unreasonable, and that it had not been proven to his satisfaction that the reasonable requirements of the public with respect to the patented invention in question had not been satisfied. An appeal from this decision was allowed by the Exchequer Court of Canada1, which ordered the appellant to grant to the respondent a license allowing it to make and use the machine covered by the patent during the unexpired residue of the term of the patent, upon the respondent paying to the appellant a license fee at a yearly rate of $275 royalty upon each machine made or used under the license.\nThe respondent, besides resisting the appeal on the merits, contended that the judgment of the Exchequer Court was rendered in the exercise of judicial discretion, from which no appeal lies, in view of s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act, and that, even apart from that section, the Exchequer Court was, in the present instance, persona designata, empowered by statute with executive discretion, and this court should not interfere with the exercise of such discretion. Geo. H. Kilmer K.C. and J. A. Macintosh K.C. for the appellant.\nR. S. Smart K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nMignault J\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court allowing an appeal taken by the present respondent from a decision of the Commissioner of Patents. The respondent, by a petition presented to the Commissioner, asked for the issue of a compulsory license under s. 40 of The Patent Act (13-14 Geo. V, ch. 23) in respect of the appellant\u2019s patent, no. 145,379, for alleged new and useful improvements in \u201cautomatic pastry making machines.\u201d The petition was dismissed by the Commissioner, but, on appeal, was granted by the Exchequer Court.\nThe appellant, among other grounds of appeal, contended before this court that the respondent had not made out a case for relief under the proper construction of s. 40.\nI do not propose however to pass on this contention, for the reason that the appellant did not take that position before the learned Commissioner. On the contrary, at the very opening of the case, counsel for the appellant said:\u2014\nThere is only one question, we are willing to give them a license and the question is what the terms are.\nThe learned counsel also stated to the Commissioner:\u2014\nMr. Commissioner, you have a record to which we are confined and on that record the sole question is what royalty should be paid, there is nothing else * * *.\nUnder these circumstances, any question as to the proper construction of s. 40 is eliminated, and we do not have to determine the meaning of the words \u201cthe reasonable requirements of the public\u201d, or whether the requirements of a particular individual or of a particular trade come within the purview of the section. The respondent, in view of the narrowing down of the issue to a mere question of what under the circumstances was \u201ca reasonable price\u201d or \u201creasonable terms\u201d for the sale of the patented article or for a license for the use of the invention, was not called upon to adduce evidence to show that \u201cthe reasonable requirements of the public with respect to a patented invention \u201chad not been satisfied.\nOn the issue thus narrowed down, I would not disturb the decision of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court. The patented article is the Bruckman machine for the manufacture of what are known as ice cream cones. The patent is on the machine itself and not on its product. In determining the amount to be paid by the respondent for the issue of a license, the learned judge considered the cost of manufacture and repair of the appellant\u2019s machine as well as the unexpired term of the life of the patent. I do not think that in so doing the learned judge proceeded upon an improper basis.\nAn objection was taken to our jurisdiction on the ground that the judgment of the Exchequer Court was a judgment rendered in the exercise of judicial discretion within the meaning of s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act. I do not think that s. 38 applies to a proceeding brought under s. 40 of The Patent Act. The objection is not well taken.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald & Macintosh.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Russel S. Smart.\n[1] [1926] Ex. C.R. 143.\n1 [1926] Ex. C.R. 143.\n"

She was then past 14 years and 8 months of age, and a perusal of her testimony indicates that she was not without adequate intelligence to make a reasonable choice. See Stevenson v. Florant[2], affirmed on appeal by the Judicial Committee.\nThat the learned judge had a judicial discretion, to be exercised having due regard to the facts of the case, is admitted. The appellant\u2019s case is that he used this discretion improvidently, but that has not been established; and, considering the girl\u2019s age, now within a few months of 16 years; her desire to remain with the respondent, with whom she has been living happily for seven years, and the other circumstances of the case, we are not satisfied that we would consult the true welfare of the girl by compelling her return to her mother.

A sale and transfer of land for unpaid taxes under the Alberta Tax Recovery Act of 1919, even though made prior to January 1st, 1924, can be successfully attacked on the ground that the notice required by s. 42, (amended by 1921, c. 25, s. 13) had not been sent to a \"person interested\" in the land (in this case a mortgagee), as the curative provision in that Act, s. 44a as enacted by 1923, c. 5, s. 26c, does not then apply.\u2014The failure to give this notice is a defect so fundamental that it rendered the transfer ineffectual. The statute makes the giving of such notice a condition precedent to the exercise of the power to execute and deliver a transfer, and section 44a contains no provision to cover the absence of the notice.\nA \"person interested\" in land sold for taxes has an absolute right to the formal notice prescribed by the Act, even if that person had knowledge, before the expiration of the delay for sending the notice, that the land had been so sold. Toronto v. Russell, [1908] A.C. 493 dist.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (22 Alta. L.R. 148) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Boyle J. at the trial and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe judgment of the trial judge declared a sale of a quarter section of land for taxes to be illegal and void and directed the cancellation of the certificate of title issued to the respondent Lamrock, who was the purchaser at the tax sale. The sale was made for arrears of taxes for the year 1920 and took place on 29th October, 1921. The transfer is dated 30th November, 1923, and registered 21st January, 1924, and the certificate of title was issued some time afterwards. The consideration of the transfer was $75.35[2]. The respondents rely for the support of the sale and transfer upon The Tax Recovery Act of 1919, c. 20, and The Tax Sale Relief Act, 1922, c. 53. The appellant's interest in the land sold is as mortgagee.\nG. H. Steer for the appellant.\u2014The giving of the notice required by s. 42 of the Act of 1919 as amended by c. 25, s. 13, 1921, was a condition precedent to the giving of any transfer and the transfer given to the respondent Lamrock was not given pursuant to the Act and therefore did not cure the defects proved in the sale proceedings.\nThe transfer given to the respondent Lamrock did not come within the terms of the curative section of The Tax Recovery Act enacted as s. 26 (c) of c. 5 of the statutes of Alberta, 1923.\nThe transfer not being the transfer referred to in the Act did not have the curative effect set out in the section.\nThe cases relied on, Toronto v. Russell [3] and McCutcheon v. Minitonas[4], should be distinguished from this case.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the respondents.\u2014The appellant's claim is barred by the provisions of the section 14a of the Tax Sales Relief Act, 1922, as enacted by chapter 5, 1923, s. 25, and also by section 44a of The Tax Recovery Act (1919) as enacted by chapter 5, s. 26, 1923.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the validity of a sale for arrears of taxes for the year 1920, held under the provisions of The Tax Recovery Act (c. 20 of the statutes of Alberta, 1919), by the respondent municipality of Hiram. The other respondent, William A. Lamrock, was the purchaser at the tax sale.\nThe sale took place on the 29th October, 1921. The transfer of the land sold was delivered to Lamrock on the 30th November, 1923, and was registered on the 21st January, 1924. A certificate of title was afterwards issued to Lamrock by the Registrar of the Land Titles District.\nThe appellant held in 'the land an interest as mortgagee under a memorandum dated March 17, 1919, and duly registered March 27, 1919. It commenced on the 4th February, 1925, this action alleging failure to comply with The Tax Recovery Act, claiming a declaration that the sale was illegal and void and asking for an order restoring the title to the name of the former registered owner with an endorsement thereon of the appellant's mortgage.\nThis relief was granted by Boyle J., but his decision was reversed by the Appellate Division (Beck J. dissenting).\nUnder The Tax Recovery Act (as amended by statute of Alberta, c. 25 of 1921), the treasurer, assessor or collector of the municipality, to whichever of whom the taxes are payable, submits to the reeve or mayor, on or before the fourteenth of August, in each year, a list in duplicate of all lands liable to be sold for arrears of taxes, with the amount set opposite each parcel of land.\nThe reeve or mayor forthwith authenticates each of such lists by his signature and by the seal of the municipality, if any. One of these lists is then deposited with the clerk and the other is given to the treasurer with a warrant thereto annexed under the hand of the mayor or reeve and the seal of the municipality, if any, commanding him to levy upon the lands mentioned in the lists for the arrears due. And it is only after having received the list and warrant so authenticated by the signature of the reeve or mayor and the seal of the municipality that the treasurer may proceed to advertise and sell the lands.\nIn this case, the list was not signed by the reeve, and, although it must be assumed from the record that the municipality had a seal, the latter appeared neither on the list, nor on the warrant.\nThe Act then provides that the list shall be published for a certain period of time in local newspapers and in The Alberta Gazette, together with a notice that the lands will be offered for sale for arrears of taxes at the day, time and place therein stated; and it is claimed that the advertisements published failed in important particulars to comply with certain sections of the Act or to follow the forms by it required.\nFinally, by ss. 35 and following, it is enacted that the owner of any land which has been sold for non-payment of arrears of taxes (or his heirs, executors and assigns) may at any time, within one year from the date of the sale, redeem such land by paying the amount of the arrears, with costs and certain other sums for penalty; and the Act (as amended by s. 13 of c. 25 of 1921) says\u2014and this is important, because it is the only notice to which a mortgagee is entitled\u2014that if the land has not been redeemed at the expiration of nine months from the date of the sale,\nthe treasurer shall immediately send by registered mail to each person shown by the records of the land titles office to have any interest in such land a notice in form A in the schedule of this Act, or to the like effect, and any such person shall be entitled to redeem the land as agent of the owner of such land, as hereinbefore provided.\nBy the notice thus required to be sent, the recipient is informed of the fact of the sale on account of non-payment of taxes and he is advised that the year allowed for redemption will expire on a certain date. The notice contains a complete description of the land and adds:\u2014\nIf you wish to contest the legality of the sale of such lands, you should immediately make application to the judge of the District Court of the judicial district within which the land is situated, for an order staying the issue of a certificate of title to the purchaser of such lands.\nIt is not proven that this notice was ever sent to the appellant and it is admitted that the appellant never received it.\nUnder The Tax Recovery Act, the notice in this case should have been mailed by the treasurer on or about the 30th July, 1922.\nHowever, on 28th March, 1922, and, therefore, long before the expiration of the period of redemption and more than four months before this notice should have been sent, the legislature passed an Act to provide for the \"Relief of Owners of Lands sold at Tax Sales.\" Under that Act, the owner of any land, which in the year 1920 was sold for non-payment of arrears of taxes, or any person in his name, could redeem it at any time prior to the first day of November, 1922. The procedure to be followed in the exercise of the right of redemption was there given.\nBy the 15th section of that Act, in the case of any parcel of land which was not subdivided land and was sold at a tax sale in the year 1921, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was given authority to name a date in the year 1923 (with a proviso not material here)\non which the right of redemption of such parcel shall expire, notwithstanding anything in The Tax Recovery Act contained.\nIt is common ground that this section applied to the tax sale here in question. Then follows section 16 whereby the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, when naming such a date, may, among certain other things, give such directions as may seem proper to him, with regard to notices and to the procedure to be followed.\nUnder the authority of those sections, an Order in Council was passed on the 18th September, 1922, and, for lands sold in the year 1921, it extended the redemption period until the twenty-first day of October, 1923. The Order in Council was to take effect on and from the 6th September, 1922. This was later than the date (30th July of the same year) when the treasurer ought to have mailed his notice to the appellant. His failure to send it on or about that date cannot therefore be excused on any ground derived from the provisions of The Tax Sale Relief Act which, in respect of tax sales having taken place in the year 1921, by force of the Order in Council, came into operation only on the 6th September, 1922.\nThere was in the Order in Council a further direction\nthat the procedure to be followed in the exercise of the right of redemption hereby given shall follow, as nearly as circumstances may permit, the procedure set forth in the said The Tax Sale Relief Act, with the change of the year 1921 for the year 1920, and of the year 1923 for the year 1922.\nAmong the sections of The Tax Sale Relief Act applicable to the redemption of lands sold for non-payment of taxes in 1920 was the following:\u2014\n9. In case notice as provided for in sec. 42 of The Tax Recovery Act has not been sent out as provided for therein, the treasurer shall before the first day of July, 1922, send out a notice in form A set out in the schedule of this Act, with respect to every parcel of land which is not subdivided land, which was sold for taxes in the year 1920, and has not been redeemed at the date of sending out such notice.\n2. The said notice shall be sent by registered mail to each person shown by the records of the land titles office to have had any interest in such land at the time when notice in form A should have been sent out under the provisions of section 42 of The Tax Recovery Act.\nThe form of the notice, as set out in the schedule, as similar to that already outlined and provided for under section 42 of The Tax Recovery Act. The Order in Council of the 30th September, 1922, does not in terms give directions with regard to notices; but it seems a plausible contention that s. 9 is thereby made applicable to the exercise of the right of redemption of lands sold for taxes in the year 1921. The treasurer, however, made no attempt under s. 9 to remedy the failure to give the notice which, under s. 42 of The Tax Recovery Act, should have been mailed on or about the 30th July, 1922.\nThis is not without importance, for the respondent argued with some force that the appellant became aware of the sale for taxes several months before the expiration of the time for redemption. In fact, the appellant knew as early as May 5th, 1923 that the lands had been sold at the 1921 tax sale and, on the 22nd of the same month, it was informed by the treasurer of the amount necessary to redeem. This, however, was in May, 1923. A month or so still had to run before the expiration of the time for sending the notice, under s. 9. The purpose of this notice was not to warn the appellant of facts which he knew already (as would appear from what transpired on the dates of May 5th and May 22nd already alluded to). The object of this notice was mainly to advise, on or before the 1st July, 1923, any person entitled to redeem that the time allowed for redemption would expire on the 31st October, 1923, and also to inform him that, if he wished to contest the legality of the sale, he should apply to a judge of the District Court for an order staying the issue of a certificate of title to the purchaser of the lands. The knowledge acquired by the appellant, through the correspondence exchanged on the 5th and 22nd May, 1923, did not include these important particulars. The appellant had an absolute right to the formal notice prescribed by the Act. Under no legitimate inference can it be held to have consented to dispense with such notice or to have waived it. The facts are widely different from those in Toronto v. Russell[5]. In that case, moreover, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee were dealing with the debtor of the taxes and not, as here, with the mortgagee of the land sold.\nThe courts are, as a general rule, anxious to uphold the validity of municipal proceedings, if the circumstances admit of such a result. But, in statutes for the enforcement of taxes and which lead to the forfeiture of rights in property, the steps prescribed are usually considered essential and more particularly must provisions requiring notices be held imperative. Their omission, as in this case, is fatal, in the absence of statutory declaration to the contrary.\nApart from the effect of the curative section, we fully concur, therefore, with the view of both the trial judge and the appellate division that the defects proved were sufficient to invalidate the sale.\nBut the judgment in appeal found these defects to have been cured by s. 44a of The Tax Recovery Act as enacted by s. 26c of c. 5 of 1923 and that is the point which remains presently to be examined. (For the purposes of this case at least, s. 14a of The Tax Sale Relief Act, introduced by s. 25 of c. 5 of 1923, does not add anything to s. 44a and need not be considered separately.)\nSec. 44a is as follows:\u2014\n44a. From and after the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, every sale of lands for arrears of taxes held under the provisions of this Act and every transfer issued pursuant to the provisions hereof shall, notwithstanding any informality or defect in or preceding such sale, be valid and binding to all intents and purposes except as against the Crown; and every such transfer shall from and after the said first day of January one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, be conclusive evidence of the assessment and valid charge of the taxes on the land therein described and that all the steps and formalities necessary for a valid sale had been taken and observed as provided by this Act in that behalf; and thereafter any such sale and transfer and any certificate of title issued pursuant to any such transfer shall only be questioned on the following grounds or any of them and no other;\n(a) that the sale was not conducted in a fair, open, and proper manner; or\n(b) that there were no taxes whatever in arrears for which the said land could be sold; or\n(c) that the said land was not liable to be assessed for taxes.\nThe jurisprudence of this court is not lacking in precedents to the effect that enactments, such as this, will be given a construction which will cover defects so substantial and fundamental as to render the proceedings absolutely null and void, only if their language requires it. McKay v. Crysler[6]; O'Brien v. Cogswell[7]; Whelan v. Ryan[8]; Heron v. Lalonde[9]; Temple v. North Vancouver [10] might be referred to. Nevertheless these statutes, like all others, must receive their effect and, as was said by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee (Toronto v. Russell[11]). since the main and obvious purpose and object of the legislature * * * was to validate sales made for arrears of taxes in the carrying out of which the requirements of the different statutes as to the mode in which they should be conducted had not been observed, and to quiet the titles of those who had purchased at such sales, the statute should, where its words permit, be construed so as to effect that purpose and attain that object.\nBut a careful examination of s. 44a discloses that it does not comprise in the word \"sale\" the whole of the proceedings taken under the statute up to and including the delivery of the transfer. On the contrary, a clear distinction is there made between the \"sale\" and the subsequent \"transfer,\" which words are used to mean two separate and successive operations.\nIt follows that \"sale\" here is used in the restricted sense of the knocking down to the purchaser at the auction, and not in its wider meaning comprising the whole transaction up to its completion when the treasurer has executed and delivered to the purchaser a \"transfer\" of the land sold. As a result, by force of s. 44a, any informality or defect in or preceding the auction and knocking down to the purchaser is cured and validated. This covers the failure of the reeve to sign the list, the lack of a seal on the list and on the warrant, the insufficiencies in the forms of advertisement required by the Act, and, generally speaking, any of the proceedings connected with the sale anterior to and in the course of the auction and knocking down.\nThe section further enacts that, if the transfer is \"issued pursuant to the provisions\" of the Act, it becomes conclusive evidence that the assessment and charge of taxes were valid and that all steps and formalities necessary for a valid sale have been taken and observed; and the sale (i.e., auction and knocking down), the transfer itself and the certificate of title can thereafter be questioned only on any or all of the three grounds enumerated at the end of the section, none of which\u2014it may be mentioned\u2014has any connection whatever with the transfer proper.\nThis is equivalent to saying that once the actual transfer has been properly and legally issued, the validity of the assessment and charge of taxes and the regularity of all the steps and formalities attending the tax sale may no longer be challenged, unless either the auction was not \"conducted in a fair, open and proper manner,\" or no arrears of taxes were due or the land was not liable to be assessed. But this provision is predicated upon the existence of an effectual transfer. It assumes the transfer to have been executed otherwise pursuant to the power conferred in the Act and obviously such requirement is essential to the applicability of the section.\nThe failure, in the present case, to give notice to the mortgagee is a defect so fundamental that it rendered the transfer ineffectual. The statute made that notice a condition precedent to the exercise of the power to execute and deliver a transfer and there is nothing in s. 44a to cover the absence of such notice. This precludes the application of the curative section.\nThe result is that the tax sale cannot stand, for it is impossible to conceive that the statute contemplated a sale which could not be completed by a valid transfer. It is obvious that absence of this notice to the mortgagee would be an absolute answer by the municipality to an action for specific performance by the purchaser at the tax sale. In this respect, the auction and the transfer may not be disconnected and together they form the successive and indispensable steps of a single conveyance or sale. There are no provisions whereby the notice could now be given to the mortgagee, even if it were found possible to cancel the transfer alone and put the parties back where they stood before it was executed.\nThe illegality of the transfer coupled with the impossibility of its being remedied therefore entails the setting aside of the whole tax sale.\nFinally, section 21 of The Tax Sale Relief Act ought to be mentioned, because it appeared to some extent to be relied on by the respondent.\nHere, the certificate of title was issued and s. 21 is to the effect that all proceedings taken under the provisions of The Tax Sale Relief Act with regard to the\nobtaining of a certificate of title to lands, shall be good and valid, notwithstanding any want of compliance with the procedure prescribed at any period under the provisions of The Tax Recovery Act.\nIn this case, we think the failure to give notice to the mortgagee was not merely a defect of procedure, but went to the very root of the power to execute and deliver the transfer. The appeal therefore ought to be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald, Weaver & Steer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Auxier & Brennan.\n[1] (1926) 22 Alta.

The appellant, among other allegations of its defence, pleaded in paragraph 4 that the dam had existed since 1835 and at its present elevation since 1882; and that in 1915 the dam was carried away and replaced by a temporary structure erected in that year, which in turn was succeeded by the present dam in 1920 and 1921; and the appellant pleaded further in paragraph 5 that the appellant\u2019s auteurs, far from having caused the waters to rise, had removed obstructions from the outlet of the lake and enlarged the discharge, thereby preventing the water from reaching its normal height during freshets. The respondent inscribed in law against these two paragraphs of the defence, objecting that the facts therein alleged were irrelevant and did not support the conclusions of the defence. Held that the facts pleaded in these two paragraphs were not irrelevant to the issues between the parties and their proof should not have been excluded as immaterial, upon an inscription in law.\nHeld also that, under the Quebec \u201crules of pleading\u201d (Arts. 105, 108, 110, 191, 192 C.C.P.), a paragraph of a defence is sufficient in law if it allege a material fact, even although the proof of other facts, which may be alleged in other paragraphs, be essential to justify the defendant\u2019s conclusion. Moreover a fact pleaded is not immaterial, although it have relation only to the damages claimed, or a part of the damages, as distinguished from the right which the plaintiff alleges to maintain the action. Mignault J. expressing no opinion.\nHeld, further, that, although by the terms of article 1066 C.C. a court may order demolition of a thing to be effected by its officer, or authorize the injured party to do it at the expense of the other, it seems only consistent with justice, and no doubt is intended, that that power shall be exercised by the court at its discretion. Mignault J. expressing no opinion.\nAPPEAL[1] from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of Coderre J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s inscription in law against two paragraphs of the appellant\u2019s plea.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. for the appellant.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent), by her declaration, filed 5th February, 1925, alleged that she had been, since 14th July, 1914, owner of a parcel of land therein described, situate in the township of Magog, and bounded on the west by lake Memphremagog; she made the following allegations against the defendant (appellant) in pars. 2 and 3 of her declaration:\n2. The defendant is, and has been for several years, the owner of certain dams or constructions at the outlet of lake Memphremagog, and by reason of its illegal use and maintenance of said dams and construc- tions the defendant has for several years been interfering with and changing the natural course and level of the waters in lake Memphremagog, causing the same to rise beyond their normal and usual height to the detriment and loss of the plaintiff as hereinafter alleged.\n3. By reason of such illegal interference with the level of the waters in lake Memphremagog, the defendant has not only caused the said waters to rise beyond their normal and usual height, but has caused \u201csaid waters to remain at a higher level for considerable periods beyond the normal, usual and natural level of the said waters and were it not for the said acts of the defendant the average level of the said waters would be much lower.\nThe plaintiff proceeds to allege that, in consequence, a considerable part of the margin of her property upon the lake has been undermined and carried away by flooding, or had been rendered useless by the overflow; that the vegetation and a number of trees had been destroyed, and, by par. 5, that these damages had been caused gradually from day to day. The plaintiff moreover alleges by pars. 11 and 12 that:\n11. As the dam constructed by the defendant at the discharge of of the said lake Memphremagog, which causes the above mentioned change in the level of the waters of the said lake, has been constructed by the defendant and has been kept and maintained by the defendant for the said discharge illegally and without right and constitutes a public nuisance which causes damage and will continue to cause damage to the plaintiff and to the plaintiff\u2019s said property hereinabove mentioned because the raising of the level of the said waters will continue to act as it has been acting for these last years, the plaintiff is entitled to ask that the defendant be enjoined from using the same dam and maintaining the same and be ordered to demolish the same, or at least any part thereof which causes or may be apt to cause a change in the level of the waters of the said lake Memphremagog opposite the plaintiff\u2019s said property.\n12. Even if the defendant had the right to maintain and operate the said dam and raise the level of the said lake, as aforesaid, which the plaintiff denies, its exercise of such right would nevertheless in law be subject to the condition of paying all damages caused to third parties by the exercise thereof and the defendant would all the same be responsible towards the plaintiff for the said damages.\nThe conclusions are for damages; demolition of the dam, or such part thereof as may cause the flooding of which the plaintiff complains, and, \u201csubsidiarily,\u201d that the defendant be enjoined from using the dam in such a way as to cause flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s land.\nThe defendant company, by its statement of defence, denied these allegations and pleaded two paragraphs, 4 and 5, the sufficiency of which is now in controversy. These paragraphs read as follows: 4. That dams or constructions at the point in question have existed since the year 1835, and have moreover existed at the same elevation since the year 1882, the dam erected in that year having been carried away in 1915. The said dam or construction was replaced by a temporary dam erected in the same year which was replaced by the present dam in the year 1920 and 1921, all of which dams or constructions had approximately the same elevation.\n5. So far from having caused the waters in the said lake to rise beyond their normal and usual height, defendant\u2019s auteurs, by means of removing certain obstructions from the outlet of the said lake, and enlarging its sluice openings, prevented the waters in the said lake from rising to their normal height at times of freshets.\nBy par. 9 of the defence, the defendant also pleaded prescription of the damages alleged. The defendant, upon these and other allegations, concluded for the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe plaintiff, by her reply, under reserve of her partial inscription in law, to which I shall immediately refer, prayed acte of the admission that the defendant had been owner of the dam since April, 1923, alleging that, if\nthe defendant was not itself the owner of such dam prior to that date, it is in the rights and obligations of its auteurs in connection therewith and everything caused thereby,\nand joined issue upon the other paragraphs of the defence, submitting however that the facts alleged therein were irrelevant. At the same time the plaintiff inscribed in law against pars. 4 and 5 of the defence, objecting that the facts therein alleged were irrelevant and did not support the conclusion of the defence, and in particular that, even if the facts were as pleaded in par. 4 of the defence, they would not justify the maintenance of the dam, as no such right could be acquired by prescription, or by user for any number of years, and that the facts alleged in par. 5 of the defence did not constitute a reason why the defendant should be entitled to keep the waters of the lake at a higher level than they would naturally reach at other times than in freshets, nor to change the natural conditions of the lake.\nAt the hearing of the inscription in law before Coderre J. of the Superior Court, the learned judge maintained the inscription, and ordered pars. 4 and 5 of the defence to be stricken out upon the considerant that the facts alleged did not constitute in law\nvalid reasons in support of the defendant\u2019s conclusions asking for dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action; and, upon appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, this judgment was, for the same reason, affirmed.\nThe pleadings are regulated by chapter XI of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, under the caption \u201cGeneral rules of pleading,\u201d by which it is provided (Arts. 105, 108 and 110) that\nin any proceeding it is sufficient that the facts and conclusions be concisely, distinctly, and fairly stated, without any particular form being necessary, and without entering into particulars of evidence or of argument; (that) the allegations are divided into paragraphs numbered consecutively; and each paragraph must contain, as nearly as may be, only one allegation, (and that) every fact which, if not alleged, is of a nature to take the opposite party by surprise, or to raise an issue not arising from the pleadings, must be expressly pleaded.\nBy arts. 191 and 192 C.C.P. it is provided, with regard to inscription of law, that an issue of law may be raised, as to the whole or part of the demand, whenever the facts alleged, or some of them, do not give rise to the right claimed; that the inscription must contain all the grounds relied upon, and that no other ground can be alleged at the hearing.\nI do not interpret the rules of pleading to mean that every paragraph of a defence, separately numbered, must in itself contain an allegation which, if proved, would negative the cause of action as to which the paragraph is pleaded; and, in the narrative form which is contemplated, a paragraph is, I think, sufficient in law if it allege a material fact, even although the proof of other facts, which may be alleged in other paragraphs, be essential to justify the defendant\u2019s conclusion; moreover a fact pleaded is, I should think, not immaterial, although it have relation only to the damages claimed, or a part of the damages, as distinguished from the right which the plaintiff alleges to maintain the action. These rules are less exacting than the corresponding rules of pleading in England and in the other provinces, and they are remarkable for the absence of the exception which the latter rules contain that no denial or defence shall be necessary as to the damages claimed or their amount.\nComing then to the two paragraphs of the defence which are subject to objection upon the inscription in law, it must be observed that they are not very artistically pleaded and admit perhaps of some question as to their intent and purpose, but that is not one of the grounds of the inscription; they are subject to attack here for legal insufficiency, and each of them must be held good or bad depending upon the enquiry as to whether it contain a material allegation.\nIt will have been perceived that, according to the declaration the plaintiffs sue as riparian owners on lake Mamphremagog to recover damages for the flooding of their land for several years by the use and maintenance of a dam at the outlet of the lake. They allege that their land along the margin of the lake has been undermined and flooded; that it has in consequence become unfit for use, and that the vegetation and trees thereon have been destroyed; the relief claimed is not only damages, but the demolition of the dam. Now while it is true, as pointed out by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that title to a servitude cannot be acquired by possession, art. 549 of the Civil Code, nevertheless I should think that long possession of the dam by the defendant company and its auteurs, and delay on the part of the plaintiff in the assertion of the right claimed, are facts material for the consideration of the court at the trial, as affecting the remedy if not the right. The question of demolition is an important one. It is claimed under art. 1066 of the Civil Code, but, although by the terms of that article the court may order demolition to be effected by its officer, or authorize the injured party to do it at the expense of the other, it seems only consistent with justice, and I have no doubt is intended, that the power shall be exercised at discretion. There can be no doubt as to the materiality of delay or laches upon applications for injunctions; cases of acquiescence are numerous, and mandatory injunctions are not infrequently refused because it would be oppressive to grant them. In Claude v. Weir[2], the plaintiff claimed as a lower riparian to have the defendant enjoined. The court considering the circumstances of the case, refused to grant an injunction, seeing that the effect of it would be to destroy a principal industry of the locality. In Lidstone v. Simpson[3], it was held by the Court of King\u2019s Bench that a slight encroachment on neighbouring land by a party who builds a house, made in good faith and with the knowledge of the owner of the land, and without objection on his part, would not give the latter a right to; sue for demolition, his recourse being for indemnity, the measure of which would be the value of the land so occupied. There are other cases in the province to the like effect, but it seems unnecessary to cite them, the principle of the decisions having recently been considered and applied by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in a Quebec case, Michaud v. Cit\u00e9 de Maisonneuve and Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[4]. In that case the plaintiff asserted a claim to land in the city of Maisonneuve. There had been some negotiations for a gift of the land to the city for highway purposes, and the city had taken possession and paved the land as part of the public way, with the plaintiff\u2019s full knowledge, and without any objection or warning by him. The Court of King\u2019s Bench of Quebec, on its appeal side[5], affirming a judgment of the Superior Court of the district of Montreal, had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action. The judgment of the Board was delivered by the Lord Chancellor, who, disposing of the case, said that the principle to be followed was that which had been applied in some well known English cases, and he mentioned Laird v. Birkenhead Railway Company[6]; Rams-den v. Dyson[7]; he said that, under circumstances such as were disclosed in that case a man would not be permitted to assert his title to the land in question.\nIn Crawford v. The Protestant Hospital[8], Jette J., having observed that the English and French law upon the subject were alike, said that one of the questions he had to answer was:\u2014\nQuel recours la loi reconnait-elle au voisin qui souffre pr\u00e9judice de l\u2019entreprise ou de la construction faite par le propri\u00e9taire sur son fonds?\nand, in the course of his judgment,\nEntrons maintenant dans l\u2019\u00e9tude des principes qui doivent nous guider, afin d\u2019en faire ensuite l\u2019application aux faits de la cause. Puis\u00e9s \u00e0 une source commune\u2014le droit romain\u2014ces principes sont les m\u00eames d\u2019ailleurs, en droit anglais qu\u2019en droit fran\u00e7ais, et nous les trouvons aussi facilement reconnaissables dans l\u2019ensemble de la jurisprudence anglaise que dans les textes pr\u00e9cis de notre droit fran\u00e7ais.\nThis passage received the approbation of Sir Henry Strong in Drysdale v. Dugas[9], which was an action to recover damages for nuisance under the Quebec law. And, in that connection, it may be useful, by way of illustration or examples, to mention Attorney General v. Sheffield Gas Consumers Co.[10]; Attorney General v. Grand Junction Canal Co.[11]; Gaunt v. Fynney[12]; Rogers v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[13], all cases where mandatory injunctions were refused on the ground of laches and acquiescence.\nNow what is the case as alleged by the pleadings? It is that the plaintiff became owner in July, 1914: that the defendant company has, for several years, been the owner of the dam, and that, for the same time, it has been interfering with the water and raising the level, creating a public nuisance, and thus gradually has damaged the plaintiff\u2019s land, and the plaintiff claimed therefore not only to recover the loss so caused, but also that the dam be demolished. The defendant, among other allegations of its defence, says in par. 4, in effect, that the dam has existed since 1835, and at its present elevation since 1882; that in 1915 the dam was carried away, and replaced by a temporary structure, erected in that year, which in turn was succeeded by the present dam in 1920 and 1921. There is no allegation or suggestion as to any protest or complaint by the plaintiff\u2019s auteurs, or by the plaintiff herself, previously to this action, the declaration in which was filed on 5th February, 1925. I have intended and endeavoured to say nothing more than is necessary which might affect the course of the trial, or the disposition of the case when it comes to be heard. It will be for the trial judge to consider all the facts as they may then appear, and to give such effect to them as the justice of the case may require, but for the reasons which I have stated, I do not consider that proof of the facts alleged in the 4th paragraph of the defence should be excluded as immaterial; and, if not, they are facts which may be pleaded.\nAs to par. 5, the substantial fact pleaded is that the defendant\u2019s auteurs removed obstructions from the outlet of the lake, and enlarged the discharge, thereby preventing the water from reaching its normal height during freshets. This is, in my view, an answer to the declaration in so far as it applies to the raising of the level of the water in times of freshet. The complaint is that the defendant, by the works which it maintained, raised \u201cthe normal, usual and natural level.\u201d The defence, as stated in par. 5, is, in effect, that the defendant did not raise the level of the water during freshets, but, on the contrary, that the level was reduced. There is thus, although perhaps in an argumentative form, a denial of the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the damage complained of for at least a part of the period during which the damage is alleged to have been gradually taking place, and therefore I think that this paragraph must be maintained as against the reasons of insufficiency alleged.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout.\nMignault J.\u2014In this case I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of the two courts below which struck from the appellant\u2019s plea to the respondent\u2019s action paragraphs 4 and 5 which are quoted in the judgment of my brother New-combe. In my opinion, the fundamental question underlying the issue between the parties is: What is the normal and natural level of the waters of lake Memphremagog which the respondent says the appellant has raised to her detriment? Evidence adduced under these two paragraphs may be useful for the proper decision of this question, and I cannot therefore say that they are irrelevant to the issues.\nI express no opinion as to the construction of art. 1066 of the civil code, nor with respect to the principles which should govern the decision of this case. I would merely leave these paragraphs in the plea, believing that the judge at the trial will be in a better position to determine the materiality of any fact which it may be desired to put in evidence.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Casgrain, McDougall, Stairs & Casgrain.\n[1] Reporter\u2019s Note\u2014 Jurisdiction of this court was affirmed by a judgment of 2nd February, 1926, reported in [1926] S.C.R. 310; the court holding that the judgment appealed from was a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of par. e of s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act.\n[2] [1888] M.L.R. 4 Q.B. 197.\n[3] (1907) Q.R. 16 K.B. 557.\n[4] [1923] 3 D.L.R. 487.\n[5] (1919) Q.R. 30 K.B. 46.\n[6] (1859) 1 John. 500; 70 E.R. 519.\n[7] (1865) L.R. 1 H.L. 129.\n[8] (1889) M.L.R. 5 S.C. 70, at p. 73.\n[9] (1895) 26 Can.

Richelieu owing to the collapse of the landing slip on a government wharf at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac on the 7th July, 1923. The wharf, built in 1910-12, had been but little used. Early in 1923 the Canada Steamship Lines applied to the Minister of Public Works to have it put in condition. The minister assented and estimates for the cost were sanctioned late in June or early in July, 1923. To the knowledge of the navigation company, no substantial repairs to, and no thorough inspection of, the wharf had been made. Without further notice to the government, the steamboat Richelieu began to use the wharf in the latter part of June. On the fourth trip, 4th July, amongst the passengers disembarked at the wharf was one Brunet, a government engineer, then on a trip of inspection for his department. Brunet, seeing the crowd disembarking, had some apprehension as to the safety of the slip and made, the next day, a casual and perfunctory examination of it. Before leaving Tadoussac that evening, Brunet, instead of clearing up his suspicions by an immediate personal inspection, or at least promptly reporting his fears to the Department of Public Works at Quebec, or warning the officers of the steamship company of the probable danger of using the slip in its then condition, merely asked one Imbeau, not a permanent or regular employee of the government, to examine the slip and to report to the department at Quebec the result of his inspection. Imbeau\u2019s report as to the bad condition of the slip, dated 7th July, was not received at Quebec until the 9th of July.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1926] Ex. C.R. 13), that the Crown was not under contractual obligation to the Canada Steamship Lines to provide at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac a reasonably safe landing place for passengers, the $2,000 per annum accepted by the Crown \u201cin payment of commutation of wharfage\u201d not being the equivalent of a rental for the use of the government wharves between Quebec and Chicoutimi.\nHeld, also, that Brunet, in allowing continued use of the wharf and slip pending Imbeau\u2019s report and in failing to give warning to the steamship company, was guilty of negligence as an \u201cofficer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work\u201d (The King v. Schrobounst ([1925] S.C.R. 458); and his neglect entailed liability of the Crown for consequent injuries in person and property sustained by passengers in attempting to land on the slip.\nHeld, also, that the Canada Steamship Lines was also guilty of negligence, in using the wharf and slip, without making an inspection of their condition and without intimating its intention to use them to the government from which it had demanded repairs that its officers knew had not been made.\nHeld, therefore, that there was a \u201ccommon offence or quasi-offence\u201d of the steamship company and of the appellant resulting in a joint and several obligation on their part to persons who sustained consequential injury (art. 1106 C.C.), with the result that there must be an apportionment of responsibility between these co-debtors (art. 1117 C.C.) and that one of them, the steamship company, having paid the debt in full, can recover from the other only the share and portion (in this case one-third) for which, inter se, such other was liable (art. 1118 C.C.). With this right of recovery, subrogation has nothing to do.\nCosts of preparing and printing the appeal case disallowed the appellant on account of flagrant disregard of rule 12 of this court requiring exhibits to be printed in chronological order.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] maintaining a petition of right against the Crown with costs and referring the case to the registrar of the Exchequer Court to enquire and report upon the amount of damages sustained by the suppliants.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. L\u00e9on Garneau K.C. for the appellant. The injuries to the persons mentioned in the petition of right did not result from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe Steamship company took possession of the wharf and operated the slip in question without previously notifying and warning the Crown of its intention so to do.\nThe Steamship company had applied to the Crown to have certain improvements made to such wharf and was aware that the Parliament of Canada had been asked to vote certain money appropriations for the purpose of carrying out such improvements, and before such appropriations were voted and available, the Steamship company proceeded, without warning to the Crown, to make use of such wharf and slip.\nThe Steamship company, its officers, employees and servants, before beginning to use such wharf, failed to examine the slip thereof and failed to notify the Grown of its possible dangerous condition.\nThe Steamship company caused such slip to be overloaded.\nIf the accident complained of was due to the wharf and slip in question not being in a proper state of repair, there was no duty on the Crown or on any Minister of the Crown to keep same in repair for the failure of which a petition of right lies against the Crown.\nThe facts complained of do not constitute a ground of relief by way of petition of right against the Crown in virtue of the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe suppliants have no recourse against the Crown ex contractu.\nThe passengers injured in the accident complained of had no recourse in damages against the Crown.\nThe suppliants could not be subrogated in the alleged claims of the injured passengers and such subrogations are null and void.\nThe petition of right was founded on such subrogations and no amendment should have been granted allo\nwing suppliants to change the nature of their petition and to sue on a new basis of action which was outlawed and prescribed. J. A. Mann K.C. and W. J. Chipman K.C. for the respondents. Even had there been no duty on the part of the government engineers and their assistants and foremen to carefully examine the structure prior to the spring of 1923, an onerous duty was thrown upon them immediately that it became known that heavy traffic was about to use the wharf, but they all failed in the performance of a duty palpably necessary to be performed.\nThe Crown was under contract to supply the Steamship company with a safe landing for its passengers. The necessary, immediate and foreseeable consequence of the failure to fulfil this obligation would be injury to those who used the defective slip and consequent liability of the Steamship company to its passengers.\nUnder section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act, liability for breach of contract is not the only liability. The subject may seek relief \u201cin respect of any matter which might in England be the subject of a suit or action against the Crown.\u201d It is submitted that in England there may be an action against the Crown for tort in the circumstances of this case and that the prerogative of the Crown does not apply where the Crown has undertaken duties of a managing nature which are not political but which are normally left to private enterprise. If there is an action for tort, the responsibility will be determined according to the law of the province in which the cause of action arises.\nThe Crown is liable under section 20c of the Exchequer Court Act. This is an express statutory liability accepted by the Crown for the particular case of quasi-delict by an employee in the course of his employment. The liability once accepted, the provincial law becomes applicable. It is submitted that the facts in this case show a series of negligences by public servants engaged in public work which were directly responsible for the accident upon which this case is founded. That the expression \u201con any public work\u201d has not a geographical but a functional significance is settled by the case of The King v. Schrobounst[2]. L\u00e9on Garneau K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. and W. J. Chipman K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014This action arises out of claims for personal injury and loss of property sustained by passengers landing from the ss. Richelieu, owned and operated by the respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., owing to the collapse of the landing slip on the government wharf at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac on the 7th of July, 1923. These claims were settled by the respondent Canada Steamship Lines and its insurers (and co-respondents), the Travellers\u2019 Insurance Co., and the amounts paid out by them, respectively, they seek to recover from the Crown by petition of right.\nThe learned trial judge held the Crown liable to indemnify the respondents on the ground that it had undertaken a contractual obligation to Canada Steamship Lines to make reasonably safe and sufficient provision for the landing of passengers from its steamboats, inter alia, at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac wharf.\nTwo main questions arise on this appeal: (a) whether there was breach of a contractual obligation owed by the Crown (appellant) to the respondent Canada Steamship Lines in regard to the wharf at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac entailing liability for consequential damages to that company; and, alternately, (b) whether the injuries suffered by the passengers from the Richelieu\nresulted from the neglect of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work\nso as to entail liability of the Crown under s. 20 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended in 1917 (c. 23, s. 2).\nIn the event of liability under s. 20 (c) being affirmed, a further question emerges, namely, (c) whether there was also negligence of the respondent Canada Steamship Lines in connection with its use of the L\u2019Anse Tadoussac wharf sufficient to bring this case within the purview of arts. 1106 and 1118 C.C. Another phase of the appeal has to do with the efficacy of subrogations taken by the respondent, The Travellers\u2019 Insurance Co., when making payments under its insurance contract with its co-respondent.\n(a) In determining that the Crown was under a contractual obligation to the Canada Steamship Lines to provide at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac a reasonably safe landing place for passengers from that company\u2019s steamboats, the learned trial judge treated acceptance by the Crown from the company of a sum of $2,000 per annum for the use of the Government wharves between Quebec and Chicoutimi as implying such an obligation. But, with respect, the learned judge\u2019s attention does not seem to have been directed to the significance of the fact that by the Order in Council of the 27th of February, 1917, which provided for the annual payment of this amount of $2,000, it is stated to have been agreed upon with Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd. \u201cas commutation of wharfage,\u201d i.e., of wharfage tolls, and in the departmental letter of the 22nd of May, 1923, acknowledging the company\u2019s cheque for $2,000 for the season of 1923, it is also said to be \u201cin payment of commutation of wharfage.\u201d This payment was, therefore, in no sense accepted as the equivalent of a rental for the wharves or for their use by the company, but was, as appears by the earlier Order in Council of the 12th of December, 1906, merely a convenient method of collecting the wharfage tolls imposed by statute for the use of the government wharves indicated, which are undoubtedly \u201cpublic works.\u201d No contract, express or implied, is created with the Crown because an individual pays statutory tolls for the use of a public work and the commutation of such tolls for a lump sum does not imply any relations other than those which would ensue upon payment of the appropriate tolls on each occasion when the public work was used. The Queen v. McFarlan[3]; The Queen v. McLeod[4]. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court cannot be maintained on the ground on which it was put by the learned trial judge.\n(b) The government wharf at L\u2019Anse Tadoussac was built during the years 1910-1912. It appears to have been but little used, except by small schooners and local craft, until 1923, only an occasional call having been made at it by the steamboats of Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., prior to that year. That company\u2019s steamboats usually moored at the other government wharf at L\u2019Anse \u00e0 l\u2019eau. There had never been a wharfinger in charge of the L\u2019Anse Tadoussac wharf. So far as appears no substantial repairs to, and no thorough inspection of, the L\u2019Anse Tadoussac wharf had been made from the time of its completion in 1912 until the 6th of July, 1923, the day preceding the collapse of the slip, and there is room for doubt whether the inspection then made was at all complete or thorough.\nThe wharf was equipped with a slip, or cale-mobile, which was intended to provide for convenience of landing at different tides. It was raised or lowered, when required, by men of the crews of the vessels using the wharf arid was often left, we are told, for long periods with its lower end submerged in the sea, or so submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide to the air\u2014conditions said to be most favourable to rapid deterioration of the spruce timbers or beams which formed its lateral supports. By means of chains, attached to iron bands, or eyes, through which the outer or lower ends of these lateral timbers (11\u00bd inches by 5\u215b inches), were inserted, and passed over pulleys, the slip was raised or lowered by the use of winches placed upon the wharf.\nEarly in 1923 Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., applied to the Minister of Public Works to have this wharf put in condition for use by its steamboat Richelieu which it was then about to place on the Saguenay route. The draft of this steamer was too great to permit of its berthing at L\u2019Anse \u00e0 l\u2019eau wharf and rock conditions precluded further dredging there. The work required to make the L\u2019Anse Tadoussac wharf suitable included dredging, the extension of the face of the wharf and some general repairs. The Minister assented to the company\u2019s request, subject to estimates for the cost of the work being sanctioned by parliament. These estimates appear to have been passed late in June or early in July, 1923\u2014the precise date is not given. Meantime, however, sufficient dredging had been done to enable the Richelieu to effect a landing and, without further notice to the government, that steamer began to use the wharf in the latter part of June. She had made landings at it on four trips prior to the date on which the slip collapsed.\nOn the fourth trip, i.e., on the evening of the 4th of July, when a large number of passengers disembarked at Tadoussac, there was amongst them one Brunet, a government engineer, who was then on a trip of inspection for his department. Brunet remarked the crowd disenibarking and says that this aroused apprehension in his mind (\u201cpeur\u201d) as to the safety of the slip, although he subsequently suggests that his doubts were rather as to the sufficiency of the chains and hoisting apparatus to sustain the weight. He made a casual and perfunctory examination of the wharf on the 5th of July and left Tadoussac on that evening. His inspection apparently did not include any examination of the slip except as to the winches and pulleys used in raising and lowering it, which he had been told were defective. Before leaving Tadoussac he called on one Imbeau, who, it is said, was engaged as a foreman by the Department of Public Works whenever government work was done at Tadoussac, but was not a permanent or regular employee of the department. Brunet requested Imbeau to examine the slip because, he says, he had reasons for apprehension. Imbeau was told to report to the department at Quebec the result of his inspection. Imbeau was not in the government\u2019s pay when requested to make this inspection, nor does it appear that he was remunerated by the government for making it.\nOn the 4th of July Imbeau had noticed a plank broken in the slip and repaired it, he says, gratuitously. He seems to have then seen enough of the condition of the slip to realize that it needed repair and should be carefully inspected. He confirms what Brunet says as to the instructions given him on the 5th of July, adding that he had advised Brunet \u201cau commencement\u201d that the slip should be inspected \u201ccomme il faut pour voir s\u2019il avait du mal lui aussi\u201d He made an inspection of the slip on the 6th and wrote out a report on the wharf and slip in the evening which he dated the 7th, because it could not be mailed until the following morning. That report reads as follows:\u2014\nTadoussac, 7 juillet, 1923.\nMonsieur A. G. Sabourin,\nIng\u00e9nieur de district.\nMonsieur,\u2014Vous trouverez ci-inclus un croquis des ch\u00e2ssis de la shed du quai de L\u2019anse Tadoussac. M. Brunet est venu ici cette semaine et il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de bien vouloir lui envoyer ces mesures-l\u00e0 pour faire faire des passes en fer pour port\u00e9ger les vitres et il m\u2019a demand\u00e9 aussi de regarder dans le quai si les lambourdes \u00e9taient pourries et je n\u2019ai pas pu y aller; il aurait enlev\u00e9 les pav\u00e9s. J\u2019ai visit\u00e9 le slip et j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bien dangereux, le bois parait bien magan\u00e9. Je vous envois les mesures et si vous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rez en faire faire un autre avant qu\u2019il arrive quelque accident, pour moi je le trouve bien dangereux.\nLongueur 36 pds, largeur 8 pds et 10 pouces.\nBien \u00e0 vous,\n(Sign\u00e9) ARMAND IMBEAU.\nThis report was not received at Quebec until the 9th of July. Notwithstanding the terms in which he reported, Imbeau insists that he did not regard the slip as in a dangerous condition even after his inspection of the 6th, adding\nSi j\u2019avais eu vu le slip bien dangereux, j\u2019aurais pas attendu les ordres de barrer le slip, je l\u2019aurais barr\u00e9 de moi-m\u00eame; mais je n\u2019ai pas fait demander \u00e0 monsieur Sabourin qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bien dangereux, le slip et l\u2019appareil. Mais si je l\u2019avais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 bien dangereux, je l\u2019aurais barr\u00e9 de suite.\nHe says that when he stated in his report \u201cje le trouve bien dangereux,\u201d he had reference to the hoisting apparatus and the winches:\u2014\nq * * * Vous lui avez dit: je le trouve bien dangereux. Vous lui avez dit \u00e7a dans votre lettre?\nR. Oui, que je le trouve bien dangereux, en voulant parler de l\u2019appareil de montage et des winches, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bien dangereux.\nIt would seem that Imbeau was either incompetent or careless or that his testimony is not dependable. He either made an inadequate examination, or could not appreciate the conditions disclosed. Any sufficient examination must have revealed the imminent danger of collapse of the slip due to the rottenness of the lateral supporting timbers. Brunet vouches for Imbeau\u2019s capacity; and I incline to accept his opinion on that point. Was he merely careless, or did he perceive the danger, although now unwilling to admit having done so?\nThe cause of the collapse was undoubtedly the breaking off of the lateral timbers or beams where they entered the iron eyes and on subsequent examination they were found by numerous witnesses to be very badly decayed, only the outside shell having the appearance of firm wood\u2014\"le dedans (qui) \u00e9tait tout pourri.\u201d Towards the close of his examination, however, in answer to a question by the trial judge, Imbeau stated that he had examined the lateral timbers at the places where they broke and that while, on looking at the outside, decay was not apparent, on picking into the wood with a knife it was found rotten inside \u2014that in his opinion at the time it was \u201cmagan\u00e9,\u201d but not so much decayed as it appeared to be after it was broken. He adds:\u2014\nmais je voyais qu\u2019il fallait qu\u2019il fut renouvell\u00e9, le slip, en cas d\u2019accidents, parce que je trouvais qu\u2019il pouvait venir \u00e0 manquer, d\u2019une fois \u00e0 l\u2019autre.\nHad Imbeau been in the employment of the government, when he inspected the slip on the 6th of July, his failure either to bar access to the slip or, if he had not authority to do that, to advise the department by telegram of the imminent danger, or at least to warn the responsible officers of Canada Steamship Lines against making further use of the slip until it had been put in a safe condition would have amounted to neglect\nof an officer or servant of the Crown while acting in the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work.\nThe evidence, however, does not sufficiently establish that Imbeau was an officer or servant of the Crown within the meaning of s. 20 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe case of Brunet is quite different. He was undoubtedly an officer or servant of the Crown. He came to Tadoussac in the discharge of his duties or employment. He saw the use that was being made of the slip which afterwards collapsed and immediately realized that its condition was dubious and had reason, as he says, to \u201cfear\u201d for its safety. He was told by Imbeau that there should be an inspection \u201ccomme il faut\u201d of the slip because it might be \u201cendommag\u00e9\u201d\u2014to see if it were not also in bad condition. Instead of clearing up his suspicions by an immediate personal inspection, or at least promptly reporting his fears to Quebec, or warning the officers of the steamship company of the probable danger of using the slip in its then condition, he contented himself with asking Imbeau to make an inspection and to report the result in writing to Quebec. In taking the risk of allowing the continued use of the wharf pending such report and in failing to give any warning to the officers of the steamship company Brunet was in my opinion guilty of a dereliction of duty amounting to negligence on his part as an\nofficer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon a public work (The King v. Schrobounst[5]), and his neglect entailed liability of the Crown for the consequent injuries in person and property sustained by the passengers in attempting to land on the slip on the 7th of July.\n(c) But if there was neglect on the part of the government engineer Brunet in failing to take immediate action for the protection of passengers who he knew would make use of the slip for landing in the immediate future, how should the conduct of the steamship company in imperilling the lives and limbs of its passengers by sending them ashore in crowds over such a slip be regarded? The steamship company\u2019s officers knew better than the servants of the Crown for what number of passengers landing facilities would be required at Tadoussac. In landing the passengers the steamboat officers might have restricted the number allowed simultaneously on the slip or they might have landed them by gangway directly on the wharf. Those officers were familiar with the history of the wharf and knew of its practical disuse for over ten years. They knew, or had abundant means of knowing, that the alternate submersion and exposure of the supporting timbers of the slip would leave them in a doubtful state of preservation. The sight of the disembarking crowd on the evening of the 4th of July should have awakened in the minds of those in charge of that operation, had they given any thought to the safety of the landing, the same fear with which the spectacle inspired Brunet\u2014fear for the safety of the slip\u2014suspicion of its capacity to withstand the strain to which it was being subjected. With knowledge that nothing had been done in the way of repairs, without making any inspection of the condition of this almost derelict wharf, without any inquiry as to whether inspection of it had been made by government officers, without even intimating its intention to do so to the government from which it had demanded repairs, that its officers knew had not been made, and would not be made until parliament should provide money therefor, the steamship company proceeded to use the wharf and slip as if assured that they were in good repair and arranged for the landing of passengers, not one by one, or two by two, but in droves\u2014as many as 35 being on the gangway together when the slip collapsed. If Brunet was negligent, this conduct of the steamship company\u2019s officers savours of recklessness.\nIt seems to follow that we have here a case of \u201ccommon offence or quasi-offence\u201d of the respondent company and of the appellant resulting in a joint and several obligation on their part to persons who have sustained consequential injury (art. 1106 C.C.), with the result that there must be an apportionment of responsibility between these co-debtors (art. 1117 C.C.) and that one of them, the steamship company, having paid the debt in full (for this purpose the two respondents are identified, the insurance company claiming through and having no other or greater rights than its insured) can recover from the other only the share and portion for which, inter se, the other was liable (art. 1118 C.C.). With this right of recovery\u2014 and it is the respondents\u2019 only right in this action\u2014subrogation has nothing to do. Indeed the limitation of art. 1118 C.C. is imposed\neven though he (the claiming co-debtor) be specially subrogated in the rights of the creditor.\nThe apportionment of responsibility presents some difficulty; it can at best be approximate. Giving to all the circumstances such effect as careful consideration suggests they are entitled to receive, justice will probably be done as nearly as possible if the resultant damages be borne in the proportion of two-thirds and one-third\u2014two-thirds by Canada Steamship Lines, Ltd., and one-third by the Crown.\nIf the Crown is now prepared to admit that the total recoverable claims of injured persons paid by the suppliants amounted to the sum of $65,744.61, as finally asserted by them at the trial, the reference directed in the judgment of the Exchequer Court will be unnecessary, and judgment may be entered at once in favour of the suppliants for one-third of that amount. Otherwise the judgment will merely declare the rights of the parties and direct the registrar of the Exchequer Court to proceed to enquire and report as to the total amount which should be made the subject of apportionment.\nAs to the right of the Insurance Company to share in the suppliants\u2019 recovery and, if that right exist, to what extent, we are not in a position to pronounce judgment. The two companies are joint suppliants. There is no issue between them on the record and they were not separately represented. Unless they can agree upon their respective rights inter se as to the monies to be paid by the Crown, upon the total amount due by it being finally ascertained the appellant may pay the same into court to the joint credit of the suppliants; and the Crown will thereupon be fully discharged from liability to each of them. Either suppliant may thereupon proceed, as it may be advised, to obtain payment out to it of its proper share of the money so to be deposited in court.\nThe appellant will have its costs of the appeal from the respondents, except those of preparing and printing the appeal case, which are disallowed on account of the flagrant disregard of rule 12 requiring exhibits to be printed in chronological order.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L\u00e9on Garneau.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.

Corp. Ltd. ([1920] 2 Ch. 28) referred to.\nA change material to the risk was held to have occurred in the description of premises with regard to their occupancy. The Court referred to evidence going to establish materiality, but also indicated, referring to Western Assurance Co. v. Harrison (33 Can. S.C.R. 473), that a representation may be held material although no evidence of materiality be given at the trial except the proof of the representation.\nWhere the property insured is described as occupied in a particular manner, and occupation in that manner is material to the risk, the insurance does not attach to the risk if the premises, at the date of the contract, be not, and have not subsequently been, so occupied. Farr v. Motor Traders Mutual Ins. Soc. Ltd. ([1920] 3 K.B. 669) referred to.\nA change in the property, from occupation as a residential store to vacancy, not being notified to the insurer, and being material, as found, was held to avoid a policy in question within the intent and meaning of no. 2 of the statutory conditions in R.S.O., 1914, c. 183.\nA policy of fire insurance, dated 5th January, 1923, was on a building described as \u201coccupied as general store and dwelling.\u201d The tenant had been notified by the insured to quit on 1st January, and began to move out on 2nd January and completed moving on 5th or 6th January, and the building ceased to be occupied as described. It was held that, either the property at the time of the policy did not answer to the description, or it must have been known to the insured that the building was in process of being vacated, and would immediately cease to be occupied as described, and this, having regard to the evidence and findings, constituted, if not a misdescription, a misrepresentation of, or omission to communicate, a material circumstance, or a change material to the risk, by reason of which, under nos. 1 and 2 of the statutory conditions in R.S.O., 1914, c. 183, the policy was avoided.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (58 Ont. L.R. 351) which, reversing judgment of Riddell J. (58 Ont. L.R. 351), held plaintiff entitled to recover on certain fire insurance policies, reversed.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, reversing judgment of Riddell J.[2], held the plaintiff entitled to recover against the defendants under certain policies of fire insurance. The material facts of the cases are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeals were allowed. D.L. McCarthy K.C. and W.R. West for the appellants.\nPeter White K.C. and W.F. MacPhie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014These two cases were tried together. The plaintiff (respondent) brought separate actions against the two Insurance Companies, defendants (appellants), to recover upon two policies of fire insurance which these companies had issued to him upon buildings, of which he was the proprietor, situate at the settlement of Earlton in Northern Ontario. There was a storehouse 25 by 36 feet with three rooms in the top fitted for living purposes, attached to which, in the rear, was a small dwelling 25 feet square. These had been occupied as a store and dwelling, but, in 1916, when the plaintiff acquired the property, he constructed a building, 78 by 33 feet, known in the case as the new store, which was attached to and communicated with the storehouse on the north side of the latter, and these buildings, as a group, are, as will presently be seen, described in the policies as the new building \u201cand additions.\u201d The policies were thus intended to cover the same property, but the descriptions do not precisely correspond, and it will be convenient to consider each case separately. Both policies were, however, subject to the Ontario statutory conditions, which are printed on the back. These are identical, and the first and second of them are expressed in the following terms:\u2014\n1. If any person insures property, and causes the same to be described otherwise than as it really is to the prejudice of the company, or misrepresents or omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the company, in order to enable it to judge of the risk it undertakes, such insurance shall be of no force in respect to the property in regard to which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\n2. Any change material to the risk, and within the control or knowledge of the assured, shall avoid the policy as to the part affected thereby unless the change is promptly notified in writing to the company or its local agent; and the company when so notified may return the unearned portion, if any, of the premium which has been paid for the unexpired period and cancel the policy, or may demand in writing an additional premium, which the assured shall, if he desires the continuance of the policy forthwith pay to the company; and if he neglects to make such payment forthwith after receiving such demand, the policy shall be no longer in force. THE SUN CASE\nThe original policy was dated 14th January, 1919, and it was renewed each year down to and inclusive of 14th January, 1923, the date of the last renewal. It stipulates that the insured, the plaintiff, is insured against direct loss or damage by fire during the year for the actual cash value of the property at the time of the loss, not exceeding $4,000,\nOn the two story frame building 33 x 78 and additions thereto attached, with metal roofing, occupied as Residential Store, situate on the North West corner of lot No. 6 in the 3rd concession of the Township of Armstrong in the District of Temiskaming, Province of Ontario.\nThe buildings were totally destroyed by fire on 27th February, 1923. These buildings were wooden structures and the two older ones, the storehouse and dwelling, had wooden roofs, but the new store had a zinc roof. It was a building of two stories, with living quarters in the upper story, where the plaintiff lived while he carried on business there, and in which his tenant, Poirier, who succeeded him in the business, subsequently lived. The plaintiff occupied the premises until 1921, carrying on business as a general merchant, when he leased to Poirier for three years from 1st April, 1921. Poirier leased the dwelling at the rear of the storehouse to Boileau, who occupied it as his dwelling. Subsequently, Poirier having failed in business, his lease became void, and the plaintiff, in the autumn of 1922, notified him to quit, and arranged with Boileau that the latter was to remain in possession of the dwelling and pay rent to the plaintiff. Boileau did remain, and although temporarily absent, was in occupation of the dwelling as the plaintiff\u2019s tenant at the time of the fire. Poirier moved out and quitted the premises on 5th or 6th January, 1923, and from that time until the fire, the buildings were unoccupied, except for Boileau\u2019s occupation of the small dwelling in the rear, subject however to the facts now to be stated. Sometime after Poirier gave up the premises, the plaintiff, as he says, decided to re-open his business in the new store. He lived at North Bay, and, on 28th January, he visited the premises, going there and returning to North Bay on that day. Subsequently, on 26th February, he returned to Earlton with two carpenters whom he left there with instructions to clear up, wash the floors, and build a wood shed. They took in a stove, stove pipe, spring mattress and blankets from another building belonging to the plaintiff at Earlton. The plaintiff remained with them, helping them with their work, for the day. The two men slept upstairs in the new store that night, and, on the night of the 27th, they slept downstairs, in the same building, to be near the stove, as the weather was cold. It was during that night that the fire occurred. The plaintiff testifies that it was his intention to return on 1st March, as it is suggested, then to re-open the shop.\nIt was, as I have stated, on 14th January that the policy was renewed. The effect of the renewal, as I interpret it, is that the new store, with metal roofing, occupied as a residential store, and the other two buildings, being the \u201cadditions thereto attached,\u201d were insured subject to the terms and conditions of the policy; this description must be held to operate with relation to the date of renewal; but it is certain that the building was not then occupied as a store, whatever may be the meaning of the qualification introduced by the word \u201cresidential,\u201d and this fact must be considered having regard to the first statutory condition quoted above.\nIn In re Wilson and Scottish Insurance Corporation, Limited[3], it was held by Astbury J., as appears to be accurately stated in the head note, that\nThe renewal of a fire policy is impliedly made on the basis that the statements in the original proposal are still accurate.\nThis was a case where, in 1915, a motor car had been insured for its full value on a proposal stating the present value at \u00a3250. The policy was renewed from year to year and the car was burned in June, 1919, when it was found worth \u00a3400, and the question was whether the insured was entitled to indemnity upon the latter estimate of value. Counsel for the corporation argued that each renewal was a fresh insurance, re-incorporating the original statements in the proposal, and made on the basis of their continued accuracy at the date of renewal. He cited MacGillivray on Insurance, p. 298, and Pim v. Reid[4]. The learned judge said in his judgment:\nThere is no decision directly applicable, but I cannot help thinking that on renewing the policy on November 8, 1918, the insured must be deemed to have continued or repeated his \u201cestimate of present value\u201d at \u00a3250. The actual decision in Pim v. Reid4, is not in point, but Cresswell J. said: \u201cNo fresh proposal appears, therefore, to be expressly required on either side at the end of the first year; but it may then be very material for the company to know of any change in the extent of the risk, to enable them to determine whether or not they will continue the insurance.\nMr. MacGillivray, in the passage referred to in his valuable work, says:\nIn fire policies and similar risks, where the insurers may decline to renew the policy at the expiration of the original period, each renewal is made on the faith of the continued truth of the original representations, and if there has been any change, that must be disclosed when the renewal premium is tendered.\nThe view thus expressed appears, in my judgment, to be sound and reasonable, and I have no hesitation in accepting it. It is true that the effect of the misdescription may be limited by the first condition to which I have referred, but, if the findings of the learned trial judge be accepted, the misdescription is material, and to the prejudice of the company. He finds that:\nThe plaintiff knew January 6 at the latest that the property was no longer a \u201cresidential store\u201d: he may have contemplated reoccupying it as a \u201cresidential store,\u201d but he did nothing in that direction for some 8 weeks, and he had not in fact reoccupied it as such at the time of the fire. This was a change material to the risk, increasing the risk, on principle and authority, evidence and common sense.\nThese findings, it must be remembered, relate to buildings in a frontier settlement; they seem, according to the evidence in the case, to rest upon reason and experience, and I should be reluctant to disturb them. Witnesses were called who were skilled in the business of insurance, an agent, an adjuster and appraiser, an inspector of agencies and the manager of two insurance companies. These gentlemen testified, having regard to their knowledge and experience, that vacancy was a condition material to a fire risk; that the risk was thereby increased. It was shown that three of the insurance companies, including the Sun (defendant), would not take unoccupied risks in the north country. Another witness, who is an adjuster, extends that statement generally to the insurance companies in the north country. None of this evidence was contradicted, although the plaintiff was offered an adjournment to make inquiries. The testimony of these witnesses is, it may be remarked, not confined to mere matter of opinion. Moreover I would direct attention to the fact that it was held by this court in Western Assurance Co. v. Harrison[5], that a representation was material, although no evidence of materiality was given at the trial, except the proof of the representation.\nThere are many cases referred to in the factums, and more in the books, with regard to the effect of words forming part of the description in a fire policy and intended to describe, sometimes in the present and sometimes in the future tense, the user of the premises, but there is none inconsistent with the view, the reasonableness of which commends itself, that, where the property is described as occupied in a particular manner, and occupation in that manner is material to the risk, the insurance is not attached to the risk if the premises, at the date of the contract, be not, and have not subsequently been, so occupied. See Farr v. Motor Traders Mutual Insurance Society, Ltd.[6]\nMoreover, by the second statutory condition, to which the learned trial judge gave effect, it is declared that any change material to the risk, and within the control or knowledge of the assured, shall void the policy as to the part affected thereby, unless the change be promptly notified in writing to the company or its local agent. The change, from occupation as a residential store to vacancy, not being notified, and being material as found, therefore voids the policy within the intent and meaning of this condition. In this particular there appears to be an error of fact in the judgment of the Appellate Division, in that the change is described as occurring after the renewal, whereas, from the time of the renewal until the fire, there had been no occupation of any sort, except by the two carpenters on 26th and 27th February.\nThis appeal must therefore be allowed. THE GUARDIAN CASE\nIn this case the policy is dated 5th January, 1923, and by it the property, as described in the body of the policy, is insured in the sum of $2,000:\nOn the two story 33 x 78 frame building and additions attached thereto with metal roofing, occupied as General Store and dwelling, situate on the North West corner of lot No. 6, in the 3rd concession of the Township of Armstrong, Dist. of Temiskaming, Ont. Marked risk on diagram.\nWarranted that no paints, oils or varnishes or other inflammable liquids (coal oil excepted), kept therein except in hermetically closed packages, bulk not broken.\nIt is a condition of this insurance and for which the premium has been reduced, that the property hereby insured is detached or is contained in a building detached not less than 40 feet, from any other building or shed and further that the building is and will be continually occupied during the currency of this policy for dwelling purposes above the ground floor.\nConditions nos. 1 and 2 and the evidence and findings are the same as in the Sun case already considered. The building which is prominent in the description, and the only one described by that name, is \u201cthe two-story 38 by 78 frame building,\u201d or new store, which, up to the date of the policy, had been occupied as a general store and dwelling by Poirier, or his trustee in bankruptcy, or his wife, who had bought the bankrupt stock from the trustee. It was the smaller of the two buildings described as additions, and which was situated at the rear of the addition known as the storehouse, that Boileau occupied as a dwelling. There were in this small building five rooms in all, two or three on the ground floor and the others on the upper floor. I do not think that the description admits of any interpretation other than that the building required by the condition to be continually occupied for dwelling purposes above the ground floor is the new store; a different meaning is not only incompatible with the text, but, in my view, too improbable to be seriously considered. Now it is not proved whether Poirier completed his moving on 5th or 6th of January, but it is certain that, from one or the other of these dates, there was, during the currency of the policy, no occupation of the new store for dwelling purposes above the ground floor, except in so far as the fact that the two carpenters slept there on the night before the fire constituted such an occupation for that night. The following day they moved down with their effects, because they found the place too cold, and so left the upper story unoccupied. Neither, it may be added, was there any occupation of any part of the new store for any purpose, except that of the carpenters, such as it was. There was thus a breach of the stipulation, but if this be a condition within the meaning of the Ontario Insurance Act, as distinguished from a limitation of the risk, a question which was not discussed, it is ineffective by the provisions of the statute, and therefore I shall put my decision upon the short ground which I am going to state.\nPoirier\u2019s lease, according to the terms of it, became void by his bankruptcy. The plaintiff had notified him to quit on 1st January. He had made his arrangements for quitting; the moving began on 2nd January, and was completed on the 5th or 6th. In these circumstances, either the property at the time of the policy did not answer to the description, or it must have been known to the insured that the building described as \u201coccupied as general store and dwelling\u201d was in process of being vacated, and would immediately cease to be so occupied. This, having regard to the evidence and findings to which I have already referred, constituted, if not a misdescription, a misrepresentation of, or omission to communicate, a material circumstance, or a change material to the risk, by reason of which, under statutory conditions 1 and 2, the policy was avoided.\nThis appeal should therefore likewise be allowed.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy & McCarthy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.F.

McBride, [1927] S.C.R. 84\nDate: 1926-12-15\nThe Ontario Jockey Club Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nSamuel McBride (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1926: May 19; 1926: December 15.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Idington, Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nCompany\u2014Transfer of shares\u2014By-law restricting right of transfer\u2014Alleged agreement of shareholder to observe provisions of by-law\u2014The Ontario Companies Act, 1907, ch. 34.\nA company\u2019s by-law purporting to disable any shareholder from transferring his shares to anyone not already a shareholder until the company had had an opportunity of finding a purchaser as in the by-law provided, was held not to be within the company\u2019s powers under The Ontario Companies Act, as it stood in November, 1910, when the by-law was passed. Canada National Fire Insur. Co. v. Hutchings, [1918] A.C. 451, applied. It was further held that the transfer of the share in question was not shown to be affected by an undertaking to observe the terms of the by-law; and the transferee was entitled to have the share registered in his name. Idington J. dissented.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario (58 Ont. L.R. 97) affirmed in the result, Idington J. dissenting.\nSemble, had the company established such an undertaking as aforesaid on the part of the registered shareholder in respect of the share in question, the plaintiff, who claimed as transferee from a transferee of such registered shareholder, might not (even apart from the principle of Lord Strathcona S.S. Co. v. Dominion Coal Co., [1926] A.C. 108) have been able to force the company to register him as the holder of the share.\nAPPEAL by the defendant company from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] which, reversing judgment of Lennox J[2], upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim to be registered as a shareholder of the defendant company. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nW. Nesbitt K.C. and F.W. Fisher for the appellant.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Duff, Mignault, Newcombe and Rinfret JJ.) was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014On the 23rd of June, 1922, one Orpen professed to sell to the plaintiff, who is the respondent in this appeal, a share in the capital stock of the appellant club, The Ontario Jockey Club Limited, which Orpen had previously purchased from Mr. Charles Millar. The respondent having applied to have the share registered in his name, and the right to registration having been denied, this action was brought to establish that right. Registration was refused on the ground that by by-law of the club no. 37, passed on the 24th of November, 1910, Millar, who was the registered owner of eight shares, was disabled from transferring any one of his shares to Orpen or to the respondent, neither of whom was a shareholder, until an opportunity had first been given to the club to find a purchaser for it. Other grounds of justification are now advanced for the action of the club, which will have to be discussed, but it is convenient first to take up the question raised touching this by-law, which, if it was passed in a valid exercise of the club\u2019s powers, has unquestionably the effect contended for.\nThe point seems to be concluded by the judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Phillimore in Canada National Fire Insurance Co. v. Hutchings[3]. The provisions of the Canadian Companies Act which were there examined and applied (R.S.C. 1906, c. 79, ss. 132 and 138), are not distinguishable from the pertinent provisions of The Ontario Companies Act as they stood at the time the by-law was passed; and it seems to follow from their Lordships\u2019 observations, at pp. 456 and 457, that s. 48 of The Ontario Companies Act of 1907, which was in force in November, 1910, by which the shares of companies governed by it are made\ntransferable on the books of the company in such manner and subject to such conditions and restrictions as by this Act, the special Act, the Letters Patent or by-laws of the company may be prescribed,\nmust be read with s. 87, from which the power to make bylaws in relation to the transfer of shares is derived, and which is there defined as a \u201cpower to regulate the transfer of shares\u201d; a power which, in their Lordships\u2019 view as expressed on the pages mentioned, does not embrace authority to pass \u201crestrictive by-laws.\u201d \u201cRegulation does not mean restriction,\u201d it is laid down; and a sentence is cited from the judgment of MacMahon J. in In re Imperial Starch Co.[4], and adopted by their Lordships, which is in these words:\u2014\nThe statute gives the company power to pass by-laws regulating the transfer of stock, that is, how and in what manner and with what formalities it is to be transferred.\nThis interpretation of language, almost identical with and differing from that of the Ontario Act only in respects quite immaterial, is, of course, binding on this court.\nThe appellant, however, advances the defence that Millar had entered into an agreement by which he undertook to observe the provisions of the by-law and by which, it is said, the terms of the by-law became in effect enforceable against him as the terms of a contract with the club. The examination of this point necessitates a word or two upon the history of the shares held by Millar at the time of his agreement with Orpen.\nThe Jockey Club was originally incorporated on the 20th of April, 1881, with a capital of $20,000, divided into 200 shares at $100 each. In 1910, supplementary Letters Patent were issued, increasing the capital from $20,000 to $200,000, divided into 200 shares at $1,000 each. In December, 1910, Mr. Millar received a stock certificate, no. 37, for 2 shares in the Ontario Jockey Club, and on the receipt of this certificate he signed an acknowledgment in these words:\u2014\nI hereby acknowledge the receipt of Certificate No. 37, for two shares of the Capital Stock of The Ontario Jockey Club, and I hereby agree to accept the said shares, subject to the conditions contained in By-law Number 37 of the Club, passed on the twenty\u2011fourth day of November, 1910; which require that before any Shareholder can transfer a share to any person not already a shareholder of the Club, notice shall first be given to the Club of the desire of such shareholder to sell his share and the Club shall have the right to sell the same to a purchaser at a price to be ascertained according to the provisions of said by-law, or at any less price that may be fixed by the seller. Subsequently, in 1916, supplementary Letters Patent were again issued, by which 400 shares of \u201cnew stock,\u201d of $1,000 each, were created, increasing the capital stock from $200,000 to $600,000. Of these 400 shares, each shareholder received two, for every share of the old stock held by him. Millar, as the holder of two shares, was entitled to, and received, four of the new issue. As affecting these additional four shares, Millar gave no express undertaking to observe the terms of the by-law. The stock certificates were never delivered to him, but the shares were allotted to him, and he became thereby the registered holder of them. At a later period, Millar acquired two additional shares by purchase, but the evidence tells us nothing as to the history of them.\nIn sum, Millar, when he agreed with Orpen to sell him one share, was the owner of two shares affected by his undertaking above set out, and of four shares affected by no undertaking, and also of two shares in relation to which we are not clearly informed whether any undertaking had or had not been given.\nIt follows that Millar, when he entered into his agreement with Orpen, had four shares with which he was free to deal, if the view above expressed is correct that the bylaw was invalid as such, unless, apart from the express undertaking exacted by the club upon delivery of stock certificates, there was some agreement by conduct of the same or similar character affecting these four shares and binding upon Millar. It is sufficient to say that there is no evidence of facts from which such an agreement can properly be inferred. The shares of the \u201cnew stock\u201d created by the supplementary Letters Patent in 1916 allotted to Millar were not created by a sub-division of the existing shares, and there appears to be no satisfactory ground for holding that Millar undertook by implication in accepting, in exercise of his plain rights, the additional shares, to observe, in relation to these shares, the terms of his undertaking as to the existing shares.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. The Appellate Division proceeded on rather different grounds, which it is unnecessary to discuss; but it ought, perhaps, to be observed that, apart altogether from the principle of the judgment in Lord Strathcona S.S. Co. v. Dominion Coal Co.[5], had the appellant succeeded in establishing the existence of an agreement on the part of Millar, as alleged, the respondent (whose title, acquired from Millar through Orpen, could, before registration, be only an equitable one), would have found himself in difficulties in attempting to force the club to register a share transferred by Millar in violation of his undertaking to the club.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by the Ontario Jockey Club Limited from a judgment of the Second Divisional Court of the Supreme Court of Ontario, dated 20th November, 1925[6], and reversing the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Lennox at the trial[7].\nBy the judgment after the trial the plaintiff\u2019s claim for a declaration that he is a shareholder of the defendant, the Ontario Jockey Club, and for other relief, was dismissed.\nThe appellant, the Ontario Jockey Club, was incorporated by Letters Patent under The Ontario Companies Act, bearing date 29th April, 1881, with an authorized capital of $20,000 divided into two hundred shares of $100 each.\nOn the 10th November, 1910, whilst the original charter was still in force, and before any supplementary patent, above referred to, had issued, by-law no. 37 was passed at a meeting of the appellant\u2019s committee, and ratified at the annual general meeting, held 30th November, 1910.\nThe first two clauses of said by-law are as follows:\u2014\n(1) Save as hereinafter provided, no shares or interest in the Club shall at any time be transferred to any person not already a shareholder, until the Club has had an opportunity to find a purchaser for such share or interest as hereinafter provided.\n(2) Any shareholder desiring to sell his share or shares (or any portion thereof) shall give notice in writing to the Club that he desires to sell and transfer the same, and such notice shall constitute the Club such shareholder\u2019s agent for the sale of such share or shares to any purchaser at a price to be ascertained as hereinafter provided or at any lower price that may be fixed by the shareholder desiring to sell.\nThe remaining four clauses are directed to specifying how the price is to be determined and the consequential results. This by-law is claimed to have been within the powers conferred by section 33 of The Ontario Companies Act as it stood at the time of its incorporation and substantially in all succeeding amendments of the said Act down to the time of the passing of said by-law.\nAnd I submit that it is also so substantially so as it appears in the first subsection of section 56 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario in 1914, that any slight changes made do not affect its force so far as the questions raised herein are concerned.\nAnd in pursuance thereof Mr. Charles Millar received stock certificate no. 37, dated 13th December, 1910, for two shares of the Ontario Jockey Club stock, and, at that date, attached his signature to the following declaration in the stock certificate book of said club:\u2014\nI hereby acknowledge the receipt of Certificate Number 37, for two shares of the Capital Stock of The Ontario Jockey Club, and I hereby agree to accept the said shares, subject to the conditions contained in By-law Number 37 of the Club, passed on the twenty\u2011fourth day of November, 1910; which require that before any shareholder can transfer a share to any person not already a shareholder of the Club, notice shall first be given to the Club of the desire of such shareholder to sell his share and the Club shall have the right to sell the same to a purchaser at a price to be ascertained according to the provisions of said By-law, or at any less price that may be fixed by the seller.\n(Signed) C. MILLAR.\nIt is in respect of said stock, referred to in said certificate as no. 37, that this suit was instituted by respondent to have an assignment thereof to him registered by the appellant in entire disregard of the said by-law.\nI infer that the by-law had been observed ever since its passage, until the respondent had apparently bought or agreed to buy said shares in appellant\u2019s club.\nThe appellant is naturally anxious to know where it stands in light of such pretension unexpectedly set up by the respondent.\nThe respondent\u2019s action was, on the trial, dismissed by Mr. Justice Lennox by reason of failure to prove some step in the case whereby he was not called upon to pass upon the points of law now in question herein.\nThe Second Appellate Division for Ontario, having heard the case, after an amendment of the pleadings and relying on the authorities cited to them, allowed the appeal. The recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in appeal in the case of Lord Strathcona Steamship Company Limited v. Dominion Coal Company Limited[8], having reversed the decision therein, given a year before in the court appealed from, rather decisively I imagine, disposes of the cases relied upon in the latter part of Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s judgment herein, written on behalf of a unanimous court, from which this appeal is brought.\nThere is only one feature about which I am now in doubt herein, and that is the different attitude maintained by the respective counsel for appellant and respondent herein, in relation to the question of notice to the respondent of the agreement to which Mr. Millar has subscribed as set out in the copy thereof, above quoted by me, and of the said by-law upon which same is founded.\nIn the appellant\u2019s factum, at page 5 thereof, it is distinctly put forward as an admitted fact\u2014subject to conditions\u2014whatever that may mean.\nIn respondent\u2019s factum counsel stands out for the denial of notice.\nI suspect there has been some understanding between counsel, followed by another misunderstanding, as it is of some importance, to the appellant at least, to have this appeal disposed of on the basis of knowledge or notice to respondent of the sort of agreement Mr. Millar signed.\nI, therefore, proceed to dispose of this case, so far as I am concerned, upon the assumption of respondent having had notice.\nIt has been, until I observed this discrepancy, as it were, a matter of some concern to me, for I cannot understand how a purchaser from one who had not only subscribed to the agreement, I quote above, in the records of the appellant, but whose certificate of title to the shares in question has printed across it such absolute notice of assent thereto, and acceptance thereof, can manage to escape notice, unless going it blind.\nAn investigation of the law relative to constructive notice, might, in that event (but for the assumption I am proceeding upon), have been, in all its bearings on such a case, an unwelcome duty, for the case was not argued on all its manifold bearings in this respect. As to the effect of subsection 2 of section 3 of the Ontario Act having any bearing on this case I am decidedly of the opinion that it had none.\nThat subsection, which was a distinct amendment, could not, or, at least in my opinion, should not, be interpreted so as to act retrospectively on transactions which had transpired before the amendment and therefore valid, unless, of course, the by-law was wholly void save so far as made the basis of an agreement as it was in Millar\u2019s case.\nAs I can dispose of this appeal on the grounds taken above without passing on the original validity of said bylaw, quite independently of any contract, I do not definitely and finally express a decided opinion.\nI may be permitted to say, however, that having, before reaching said conclusion, read and considered the cases cited as bearing on the question of the said validity, I found a wide distinction possible between all of said cases and this.\nThey all seemed to be by-laws or material which imposed an absolute veto independent of any other consideration given to the protection of the shareholder or his assignee.\nThis by-law is far from being quite so unreasonable. It seems to have been a well considered scheme for protecting appellant from being invaded with undesirable members, and, at the same time, protecting the shareholder from any loss he would be likely to suffer.\nOf course I see two classes of cases impossible to provide for. For example, if a shareholder had a chance to sell at a price giving him more profit than there had been earned, and some gullible fellow was willing to run chances, there would be a loss of that chance.\nAnother case is that of a shareholder having a desire to give one of his family, or other friend, a gift; he may not do it unless he convinces the appellant that his friend is a good fellow and not to be shut out.\nI am only making the various suggestions as to the absolute validity of the by-law without assent thereto on the part of the shareholder at his acquisition of a share, and have come to no definite opinion thereon. I have, however, for the reasons above assigned, come to the con- clusion that this appeal should be allowed, but as to the question of costs, perhaps no need to pass thereupon.\nThere may be cases such as I suggest above in which the by-law might be held restrictive and hence ultra vires, but so far as the provision for an option at the price the shareholder wants, I do not think it more than a regulation of which notice must be imputed to the buyer.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ludwig & Ballantyne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Millar, Ferguson & Hunter.\n[1] (1925) 58 Ont.

The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the plaintiff moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that the amount in controversy did not exceed $2,000.\nSections 39 and 40 of the Supreme Court Act (now R.S.C. 1927, c. 35), read as follows:\n39. Except as otherwise provided by sections thirty-seven and forty-three, notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from a judgment rendered in any provincial court in any proceeding unless,\u2014\n(a) the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds the sum of two thousand dollars; or, (b) special leave to appeal is obtained as hereinafter provided.\n40. Where the right to appeal or to apply for special leave to appeal is dependent on the amount or value of the matter in controversy such amount or value may be proved by affidavit, and it shall not include interest subsequent to the date on which the judgment to be appealed from was pronounced or any costs.\nThe trial judge\u2019s reasons for judgment stated that \u201cthere will be judgment * * * against the defendant Bridge for the amount claimed with costs * * *.\u201d The formal judgment adjudged \u201cthat the plaintiff do recover from the defendant John Bridge the sum of $2,009.31\u201d and costs. The action was tried on February 2, 1926, and judgment was given on February 20, 1926. The plaintiff\u2019s (respondent\u2019s) solicitor, in an affidavit, claimed that the $9.31, which was apparently intended to cover subsequent interest, must have been included in the formal judgment through error, and that he did not notice it until the applications before the Appellate Division (in this action and in another action brought by another plaintiff on a similar claim in which the amount involved was $1,100) for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (which applications were made immediately after the hearing and judgment in appeal, and were refused by the Appellate Division). On the present motion there was conflicting affidavit evidence as to certain facts in connection with the inclusion of the sum of $9.31 in the formal judgment at trial.\nThe motion to quash the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, the Court, without passing upon the question as to the inclusion of the $9.31 in the formal judgment of the trial court, expressing the view that, since interest on that judgment up to the date of the judgment of the Appellate Divisional Court must be included in computing the amount in controversy in the appeal, this Court had jurisdiction[1].\nMotion refused with costs.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for motion.\nGeo. F. Macdonnell contra.\n[1] Hamilton v. Evans, [1923] S.C.R. 1, was not alluded to in the argument.\nSee also Dominion Cartage Co. v. Cloutier reported later in this volume.\nThe appeal to this Court in Bridge v. Eggett was dismissed, by judgment delivered orally after argument on the merits, on November 2, 1926.\n"
